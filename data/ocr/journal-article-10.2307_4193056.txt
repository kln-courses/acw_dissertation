On occasion, later rabbinic literature facilitates the interpretation of poorly preserved or laconic earlier sectarian halakhot; in other cases, Qumranic writings reveal alternative interpretive options for rabbinic sources. This applies particularly where intuitive associa- tions sparked by sectarian law contribute to a new reading of early rabbinic sources that differs from their interpretation by later rabbinic authorities. Furthermore, the Qumranic material enhances our ability to isolate the different strata of rabbinic literature, thereby elucidating the * This article was written while I was a Starr fellow at the Harvard Center for Jew- ish Studies (1995-96).

This paper represents an attempt both to illustrate aspects of the development of rabbinic halakhah on the one hand, and to clarify features of Qumranic literature on the other. Scattered lists of human deformities have been preserved in both rabbinic and Qumranic literature in a variety of contexts. In Qumranic texts, exclusion of persons bearing deformities reflects the belief that "the holy angels are in their council" ('I rSP: rnpi 'Dip n) accord- ingly, only unblemished persons may enter into sacred assemblies and places. Rabbinic texts, by contrast, appear to lack any all-encompass- ing rationale and explain each case of exclusion on independent exege- tical grounds. However, closer analysis of early rabbinic strata reveals that the rabbis were heir to a tradition closely related to that of the sect. As we shall argue below, early rabbinic texts display the tendency to derive all exclusions on the basis of one common principle. As a result, some details of the Qumran lists are better understood as well. Although this paper essentially opens a dialogue between these two corpora, for the sake of clarity, I have chosen to begin with the rab- binic sources. I I will mention only a few examples: Y.D. Gilat's (Studies in the Development of the Halakhah [Bar-Ilan University Press, 19921 249-61) early dating of some of the rab- binic prohibitions of Shabbat derives from a renewed reading of rabbinic sources based upon a comparison with the Shabbat laws in the Damascus Document; J. Baumgarten ("The Disqualification of Priests in 4Q Fragments of the 'Damascus Document"' The Madrid Qumran Congress, Proceedings of the International Congress on the Dead Sea Scrolls [ed. J. Trebolle Barrera and L. Vegas Montaner; Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1992] 503- 13) has suggested that the law disqualifying a priest held in captivity from temple serv- ice in 4Q266 5 2 facilitates our understanding of the version of m. KeL 2:7 preserved among some medieval scholars which reads: "So too two men held captive, one claims I am a priest and the other claims I am a priest"; in a recent article ("Testimony, Rebuke and Warning in Qumran Law and Rabbinic Literature," Tarbiz [forthcoming]) I argue that the rabbinic midrash concerning the law of rebuke should be reread in light of the Qumranic law. As is well known, according to the sect, rebuke was an integral part of the juridical procedure. On the other hand, the general impression of rabbinic midrash is that the Rabbis understood the biblical law of rebuke on purely moral grounds. However, a close examination of the midrash reveals that the Qumranic type of rebuke was also practiced within rabbinic circles. This is the right way to explain the story (see: Sifra, Kedoshim 4:9; Sifre Deut. 1) about Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri's complaints to Rabban Gamliel concerning Rabbi Akiva.</page><page sequence="3">THE EXCLUSION OF DEFORMED PERSONS FROM HOLY PLACES 181 [1] Individuals Exempt from Pilgrimage and Priests Disqualified from Their Duties Due to Physical Defects Introduction The pentateuchal injunction "to appear before the Lord" (rTI'tn nfnlr),2 repeated three times in nearly identical language (Exod. 23:17, 34:23; Deut. 16:16), is most detailed in its final occurrence: Three times a year-on the Feast of Unleavened Bread, on the Feast of Weeks, and on the Feast of Booths-all your males shall appear before the Lord your God in the place that he will choose. They shall not appear before the Lord empty-handed, but each with his own gift, according to the blessing that the Lord your God has bestowed upon you. In m. Hag. 1:1, we find a list of persons not obligated by the com- mandment to "appear before the Lord": All are bound to appear [at the Temple] except a deaf man, an imbecile and a minor,3 a person of unknown sex, a hermaphrodite, women, unfreed slaves, the lame, the blind, the sick, the aged, and one who is unable to go up on foot. This list of exemptions can be further broken down into three sub- divisions: (1) a deaf man, an imbecile, and a minor-the standard group exempted from the observance of commandments due to "lack of understanding"; (2) a person of unknown sex, a hermaphrodite, women, slaves who have not been freed-evidently excused because they do not belong to the category of "all your males"; (3) a group comprised of individuals with limited locomotion, to which the blind man con- stitutes an exception. Y.N. Epstein maintains that the blind man was not mentioned in the version of the Mishnah known to the Palestinian Amoraim.4 If this was the case, then all the exemptions for this cate- gory inhere from its members' physical inability to reach the Temple 2 rM-K has a dual meaning and denotes both the pilgrimage and the festal offering which accompanies it.

See also S. Lieberman, ;wVs kbn (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1962) 5.1267, and below, for objections to the foregoing. Lieberman adduces that the KtO in our mishnah is certainly one who is blind in both eyes; due to his inability to see his way, he cannot reach the Temple on foot. Consequently, he is excused from nMW1 r=. If O1O is understood in this fashion, then all the members of this group are excused for a single reason.</page><page sequence="4">182 AHARON SHEMESH on foot, as specified in the concluding section of the Mishnah. Un- doubtedly, this exemption reflects the midrashic tradition, to be dis- cussed below, that equates the use of DOODD with the word D'z (the root of which denotes "foot" as well as "times"). This tradition is based on the verse: ;1 "5 flnnrT D"t:n C (Exod. 23:14), found in close proximity to the injunction to "appear before the Lord" (Exod. 23:17). Further examination of tannaitic sources and both the Palestinian and the Babylonian Talmud elicits the existence of additional tradi- tions that reflect a more expanded list of individuals excused from the injunction to "appear before the Lord." Indeed, a brief glance at these lists reveals that they do not lend themselves to classification accord- ing to the standard rabbinic criteria outlined above. In t. Hag. 1:1 we find the addition of the "unclean person" to the list and the explicit mention of a blind person, while the Mekhilta (Kaspa, 20)1 surpris- ingly exempts the proselyte from pilgrimage. The baraita cited in b. Hag. 4a states: "The scraper, the copper-smith and the tanner are exempt from appearing [at the Temple]," while the parallel tradition in y. Hag. 1:5, 76d exempts men afflicted with blisters or with a poly- pus as well.6 According to yet another baraita: "The uncircumcised and the unclean are exempt from [bringing] the pilgrimage-offering" (b. Hag. 4b). Moreover, both Talmuds attest to the further amplification of the range of exemptions to include individuals suffering from less severe impairment. The deaf man of the Mishnah's tripartite category of a deaf man, an imbecile, and a minor, excused by virtue of his "lack of understanding," is customarily understood to be a deaf-mute, as we learn from m. Ter. 1:2: "The or of whom the Sages have spoken in all cases is one who can neither hear nor speak." However, both Talmuds are cognizant of the tradition that the irn who is excused from pil- grimage includes the category of individuals with the ability to hear but unable to speak, or with the ability to speak but unable to hear7; therefore, his exemption must accrue not from his "lack of understand- See nn. 30, 66. 6 These two baraitot both belong to a single list of deformities, concerning which m. Ket. 7:10 states: "they are compelled to divorce their wives." I B. Hag. 2b: "But surely it is taught: One that can speak but not hear, hear but not speak is exempt!" Y. Hag. 1:1, 5d: "A deaf-mute: Associates in the name of R. Eleazar: 'So that they may hear and learn to fear the Lord' (Deut. 31:12). Up to this point ref- erence has been made to one who speaks but does not hear. A deaf-mute who hears but cannot speak-R. Ila in the namne of R. Eleazar, [He is included under,] 'In order that they may learn' [which may be read], 'In order that they may teach."' The Baby-</page><page sequence="5">THE EXCLUSION OF DEFORMED PERSONS FROM HOLY PLACES 183 ing" but from some other reason. Further exemptions are reflected in R. Tanhum's opinion that "one who is deaf in one ear is exempt from appearing [at the Temple]" and that the MrT in the Mishnah also in- cludes "one that is lame in one foot" (b. Hag. 3a). Regarding the tCD1O, we find the following opinion of R. Johanan b. Dahabai cited in the name of R. Judah, that even a man who is blind in one eye is exempt (ibid., 2a). Although the exemptions found in the above-mentioned sources are all derived from biblical verses, the clear impression remains that in this instance tradition preceded the homily. Some homilies seem far- fetched, while with respect to others we find differences of opinion among the sources. We will first undertake to identify the factors underlying the amplificatory traditions. Exemption or Prohibition? As mentioned above, in t. Hag. 1:1 we find the addition of the tkD (unclean person) to the list of exemptions cited in the Mishnah: "An unclean person is exempt from the requirement of making an appear- ance, since it is said, And you will come there and you will bring there (Deut. 12:5-6). [The requirement applies] to one who is suitable to come into the [Temple] courtyard, excluding the unclean person, who is not suitable to come into the [Temple] courtyard." The baraita uses the term "exempt" (-I=) even though the unclean person is actually unfit to enter the Temple courtyard. The homily based on Deut. 12:5-6 discloses that the exemption in question is clearly from the festal offering; there is no need to explicitly exempt him from the obligation to "appear before the Lord" since his entry into the Temple court is prohibited. Based upon this halakhah, the Palestinian Talmud extra- polates two additional points: (1) the commandment to "appear before the Lord" is restricted to the Temple court and does not apply to the entire Temple Mount, as an impure person is permitted to enter the Temple Mount; (2) an impure person is exempt from sending his sacrifices via an agent.8 lonian Talmud eliminates the contradiction by establishing that cases in the Mishnah are not all-inclusive, further claiming that the OM who speaks but cannot hear, or hears but cannot speak is exempt only from rrtrii n= but not from the injunction to rejoice (rioM= n), whereas the deaf-mute is exempt from both. The Palestinian Talmud finds this unnecessary and simply argues: "R. Jonah has said, 'That indicates that the general rules of Rabbi are not all-encompassing."' T The language of the Palestinian Talmud is as follows: -TZ Wr31 "ft' me</page><page sequence="6">184 AHARON SHEMESH This explanation for the unclean person's exemption is congruent with the tradition represented in b. Hag. 4b that links him with the un- circumcised: Kn- 'DMT i-'ntin }D 19Cl ("The uncircumcised and the unclean are exempt from [bringing] the pilgrimage offering"). This same pair is found in Isa. 52:1: "Awake, awake, 0 Zion! Clothe your- self in splendor; Put on your robes of majesty, Jerusalem, holy city! For the uncircumcised and the unclean shall never enter you again." Similarly the lame and the blind are linked in an ancient tradition pro- scribing their entry into the Temple. I am referring to the difficult verse in 2 Sam. 5:8: "On that occasion David said, 'Those who attack the Jebusites shall reach the water channel and [strike down] the lame and the blind, who are hateful to David.' That is why they say: 'No one who is blind or lame may enter the House."' The stringent view of the prophets that excludes the unclean and the uncircumcised from Jerusalem entirely and those with deformities from the Temple was not accepted in rabbinic law.9 The well-known mishnah in m. Kel. 1:8-9 delineates the areas of holiness in the Temple and specifies who is permitted or forbidden to enter those precincts: Within the wall [of Jerusalem the locality] is still more holy than they are [namely, the foregoing] in that they may eat of the lesser holy sacrifices and the second tithe. The Temple Mount is more holy than it, for no men with a flux or women with a flux or menstruants or women after childbirth may enter therein ... but none [entering it unwittingly] would thereby become liable to a sin-offering. The Court of the Israelites is more holy than it [the Court of Women], because no one whose atonement is incomplete might enter therein, and [if he did enter...] he becomes liable therefore to a sin-offering. The Court of Priests is holier than it [the Court of the Israelites], for non-priests may not enter therein except when they must lay on the hands, at the slaughtering, [and] at the waving. [The space] between the Hall and the Altar is more holy than it [namely, the Court of the Priests), since none with a blemish or bare-headed may enter there. The Sanctuary is still holier than it [the space], for no one may enter therein with unwashed hands and feeL The Holy of Holies is still more holy than them, since none may enter therein save only the High Priest on the Day of Atonement at the time of the [Temple] Service. ("And may he send his festal-offering with a third party?" [y. Hag. 76a]). It appears that the reference here is not to the pilgrimage offering but to the festal offering ('D'0 m"lrM). However, MMr can be used to refer to the pilgrimage offering as well, as we lear from the Tosefta (Hag. 1:4): rin31: l"Tnp [rvnn nt tnrr DI] -In rt ("This one and that one [both the pilgrimage-offering and the festal-offering] fall under the title of festal-offering."). See also Lieberman, TOVW N-wun 5.1279. 9 It forms, however, the basis for the Qumran community's halakhah, which forbids the entry of the uncircumcised and the unclean to the entire O!pDi1 r1D (city of the sanctuary) and Jerusalem. See Y. Yadin (ed.), The Temple Scroll (Jerusalem: Israel Exploration Society, 1983) 1.277 and n. 59 below.</page><page sequence="7">THE EXCLUSION OF DEFORMED PERSONS FROM HOLY PLACES 185 The Mishnah applies the prohibition against the entry of deformed persons'0 to the area between the hall (portico) and the altar and in- ward. In actuality, this prohibition pertains only to priests, as even un- blemished Israelites are forbidden access to the Court of the Priests. However, scholarly research has shown that during the pilgrimage fes- tivals these restrictions were breached, and that the distinction between priest and Israelite was blufred."1 On these occasions, pilgrims entered areas to which they were normally denied access, including the area between the hall and the altar. Testimony of this practice has prob- ably been preserved in m. Suk. 4:5. The mishnah relates that "every day they went round the alter once [ ...] but on that (i.e., the seventh) day they went round the altar seven times." The plain meaning of the Mishnah is that the entire community of pilgrims participated in this ceremony. But the discussions in both the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds imply that only priests participated. However, this talmudic implication is only a result of the need to resolve a contradiction with Mishnah Kelim which bans the entry of Israelites to the area between the alter and the hall. Indeed, the plain reading of m. Sukkah has been preserved in a later midrash'2 which states explicitly that lay Israelites too participated in the ceremony. It appears then that the underlying basis for the exemption from the obligation to appear before the Lord is to be found in the compre- hensive prohibition against the entry of deformed persons and others 10 The sources are divided on the question of whether the disqualification of de- formed priests applies to entry into the area or to the performance of the Temple service itself. M. Kel. 1:8 and its parallel in Sifre Zuta (5) indicate that the physical presence of priests with deformities in the area between the portico and the altar is prohibited, whereas the homily in Sifra (Emor, 3:10-11) implies that It is participation in the Temple service which is forbidden and sums up the issue as follows: "Might one suppose that he also may not enter to prepare beaten gold plate (for covering the walls of the Holy of Holies]? Scripture says, 'but.' This is how the religious duty is carried out: Priests are supposed to go in to do that work. If no priests are available, then Levites go in. If there are no clean ones, then unclean ones go in. If there are no unblemished ones, then blemished ones go in." In the following discussion I will not distinguish between the two but simply use "enter" or "serve" in the appropriate context " See Y.

During the year, such a prohibition was unnecessary as Israelites did not enter the Temple court at all; only in the context of the pilgrim festivals, when Israelites behaved like priests and entered the area between the hall and the altar, was there a specific need to exclude the participation of individuals with deformities from fulfilling this aspect of pilgrimage. This explanation elucidates the amplificatory traditions described above. In light of the foregoing, what we have is not an "exemption" from pilgrimage for those whose physical impairment makes it diffi- cult for them to reach the Temple, but rather a "prohibition" emerg- ing from the comprehensive prohibition against the entry of deformed persons to the sacred area. I intend to further substantiate this hypo- thesis by examining the list of deformities that disqualify priests from priestly service and establishing its relationship to the list of exemp- tions from pilgrimage. I also hope to ascertain the underlying reason for this prohibition based upon the biblical sources and their tannaitic interpretations. Individuals Exempt from Pilgrimage and Priests with Physical Defects Lev. 21:18-20 contains a detailed list of the deformities that dis- qualify priests: No one at all who has a defect shall be qualified: no man who is blind, or lame, or has a limb too short or too long; no man who has a broken leg or a broken arm; or who is a hunchback, or a dwarf, or who has a growth in his eye, or who has a boil-scar, or scurvy or crushed testes. The homiletical treatment of this passage in Sifra reflects an ampli- ficatory trend similar to the one for pilgrims with deformities attested to above in Rabbinic sources. We find there a homily identical to the one for pilgrims: "...'A man blind':-whether blind in both eyes or blind in only one eye" (Emor 3:6); ". .. lame-whether lame in both legs or lame in only one" (ibid., 3:7). Nonetheless, it is the expansion of the list of deformities beyond the biblical ones that is of special interest. I know only these [blemishes that invalidate a priest]. How do I know that the law encompasses other blemishes? Scripture repeatedly refers to "blemish," thus encompasses the rest of them. How do we know that the law covers a priest who is swarthy, red-skinned, albino, giant, dwarf, deaf-mute, imbecile, drunkard, who has clean negaim [skin diseases that do not cause impurity-a.s.]? Scripture says, "Any man...," encompassing all of these cases. (Ibid., 3:1-2)</page><page sequence="9">THE EXCLUSION OF DEFORMED PERSONS FROM HOLY PLACES 187 M. Bek. 7 lists additional deformities: the baldheaded (7:2); someone whose limbs or appendages are disproportionate to the rest of his body (7:4); and someone whose eyelashes or teeth have fallen out (7:3; 7:5). The rationale for the disqualification of the latter is Inn rwin 'nm ("for appearance's sake" ).'3 In light of the above, physical ability to perform the priestly duties clearly has no bearing on the disqualification of priests with deformi- ties. No limitations on movement or sight are involved; priests who are swarthy, red-skinned, albino, giants, or dwarfs are considered deformed purely for esthetic reasons.'4 Nor is the disqualification of priests with deformities related to ritual impurity; Scripture explicitly states that his deformity notwithstanding, "he may eat of the food of his God, of the most holy as well as of the holy" (Lev. 21:22). In rabbinic homily this idea receives explicit expression in the addition of ritually pure priests with "clean negaim" to the list of those disqualified from service.' We have already seen that the exemption of individuals with defor- mities from pilgrimage is not grounded in functional reasons: deafness in one ear or blindness in one eye do not hamper performance of the commandment. But both groups, those exempt from pilgrimage and disqualified priests, share the essential characteristic of including indi- viduals who suffer from esthetic deformities. The skin disease (clean negaim) mentioned in the list of blemishes that invalidate priests un- doubtedly detract from the sufferer's appearance. This corresponds pre- cisely to the case of the man who suffers from blisters exempted from 13 See Rashi, b. Bek. 43b. 14 The Talmud (b. Bek. 43a) distinguishes between three classes of disqualified priests: (1) those with an actual blemish (like those in the pentateuchal list) are dis- qualified, and if they perform the Temple service it is profaned; (2) those disqualified by the interpretation of the repetition of er"-"K: "who is not like the seed of Aaron" (like the swarthy, red-skinned and albino) who transgress a positive commandment but do not profane the Temple service; (3) those disqualified because of their appear- ance do not profane their Temple service or the Temple. This distinction illustrates that the Amoraim had difficulty ascribing the concept "deformity" to variations in shape or color. Nonetheless, this distinction is absent from tannaitic sources. I believe that the language of the mishnah, IDiT rrlK 13D, is meant to convey the sense that these dis- qualifications are not deformities; rather it implies that their sufferers are deformed by dint of their appearance (see Rashi's explanation above). '5 Maimonides as well understands the amplification of the list of blemishes in this fashion. See The Book of Temple Service, "Entrance into the Sanctuary" 6:4: "Not only did the blemishes mentioned in Scripture render priests unfit, but all visible blemishes of the body rendered them unfit. For it is said: whatsoever he be that hath a blemish (Lev. 21:18), implying any blemish at all. Those mentioned in Scripture are cited only as examples."</page><page sequence="10">188 AHARON SHEMESH pilgrimage in the baraita (y. Hag. 76d). Similarly, the man afflicted with a polypus, paired with the one with blisters, and the scraper, the copper-smith and the tanner listed in the baraita in the Babylonian Talmud are all exempted from "appearing before the Lord" due to their esthetic anomalies.'6 Why are Individuals with Deformities Barred from the Area between the Sanctuary and the Altar? The colligation of the ban on the performance of sacred duties by physically deformed priests and the prohibition against the presence of physically deformed pilgrims in the Temple sheds light on the essence of the prohibition itself. Scripture characterizes the performance of sacred duties by priests with deformities as profanation of the Temple: "But he shall not enter behind the curtain or come near the altar, for he has a defect. He shall not profane these places sacred to Me, for I the Lord have sanctified them" (Lev. 21:23). 17 This profanation evi- dently arises from the polarity between holiness, perceived as perfec- tion, and defornity, its opposite. But this by no means exhausts the matter. Scripture emphatically states that the priest with a deformity "shall not. . . come near the altar," and "no man of your offspring ... who has a defect shall be qualified to offer the food of his God" (Lev. 21:16). These expressions constitute a strongly "&amp;personified" descrip- tion of the priestly service, one which attests to the intimacy inherent 16 In t. Ket. 7:11, we find the following: "R. Yose b. R. Judah [says], "One who has a polypus-this is one who has bad breath." According to this interpretation, the man with a polypus is exempt from TimR because of the bad odor he emits, similar to the scraper and the copper-smith whose exemptions are derived from the verse "When all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God.. ." (Deut. 31:11); that is, "He who is worthy to make an appearance with all Israel brings an appearance-offering, and he who is not worthy to make an appearance with all Israel does not bring an appearance-offering" (y. Hag. 76d). It appears that R. Shimi emends the baraita thus in the discussion in y. Hag. 76d. Nonetheless, in the baraita itself (ibid.) the exemp- tion is derived from the verse "And you will come there and you will bring there. . ." [Deut. 12:5-6]; consequently, these individuals are unfit to come to the Temple not because their offensive smell disturbs the other pilgrims, but by dint of possessing physical defects. Essentially, the two reasons are inter-related; while the aversion evoked by their unesthetic appearance does not comprise the basis for their exemption, it does serve to indicate that they possess blemishes. Henceforth, it is immaterial whether the defect is based on their appearance or on the emission of a bad odor. See also Lieberman, MMVM r7II 7.304-5. 17 For a consideration of the biblical terminology for disqualified priests, see J. Milgrom, Studies in Levitical Terminology I (University of Califomia Publications, Near Eastem Studies, vol. 14; Berkeley: University of California Press, 1970) 38-42.</page><page sequence="11">THE EXCLUSION OF DEFORMED PERSONS FROM HOLY PLACES 189 in the human-divine encounter of man standing before God."8 Similarly, in the case of the pilgrim; the verse "Three times a year all your males shall appear before the Lord your God" is interpreted in Sifre as fol- lows: "As one comes to see, so does he come to be seen" (Sifre Deut. 143). The plain meaning of this homily, as we shall see below, is that the pilgrim does not only come to see God but also comes to be seen by God. In light of the anthropomorphic conception of the divine fig- ure, as reflected in a plethora of rabbinic sources,'9 and the notion that man was created in the divine image, appearing before the Lord is an occasion possessing particular significance. Consequenfly, the notion of individuals with deformities appearing before God is intolerable. It proclaims lack of perfection and is perceived as hurling defiance at God. There can be no greater profanation of the sacred. The close affinity between the prohibition against the presence of deformed indi- viduals in the Temple and the injunction to see God and be seen by him in its ostensibly real, physical sense explains the specific focus on visible esthetic deformities in the expanded lists.20 Evidently, the ratio- nale underlying both the disqualification of defonned priests and the baning of additional categories of pilgrims from the Temple even when they do not suffer from deformity in the accepted sense emanates from fear of desecrating the holy. Among the disqualified priests we find the inclusion of the tW (uncircumcised).2' In the talmudic discussion (b. San. 83b), R. Hisda Is See I. Knohl, The Sanctuary of Silence (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1995) 169-70. 19 See A. Goshen-Gottstein, 'The Body as Image of God in Rabbinic Literature," HTR 87 (1994) 171-96 and the prior bibliography cited there, nn. 1, 7; D. Boyarin, "The Eye in the Torah: Ocular Desire in Midrashic Hermeneutic," Critical Inquiry 16 (1990) 532-50. The favorite example cited by scholars as representing the conception that the body was created in the image of God is Hillel's declaration to his students, "I am going to fulfill a commandment," when he was on his way to the toilet or to the baths (Avot de-Rabbi Nathan B, chap. 30; Lev. Rab. 34:3). Nonetheless, Knohl correctly points out ("'Ct rnM'D 'bUp m ;V MM," Tarbiz 53 [19831 23-24) that we cannot ignore Shammai's position: "Shammai did not speak in this vein, but said that man must fulfill his obligation to this body."

The plain meaning of the prophetic text for- bids the entry of non-Jews into the Temple, a prohibition known to have been in force during the Second Temple period as the baraita in Sifre Zuta testifies: "The Temple Mount is holier than Jerusalem, for men and women with a flux enter Jerusalem, but may not enter the Temple Mount. The rampart is holier than the Temple Mount for Ara- means and those defiled by a corpse enter the Temple Mount but not the rampart."22 The verse in Ezekiel23 serves as the basis for R. Hisda's derivation of the halakhah disqualifying an uncircumcised priest from service.24 Clearly, as far as lack of circumcision is concerned, no dis- tinction is made between a priest and an ordinary Israelite; all uncir- cumcised males are unfit to enter the Temple. Indeed, the baraita in b. Hag. 4b exempts both the uncircumcised male and the unclean per- son from pilgrimage.25 The entry of the uncircumcised male into the realm of the shekhi- nah (divine presence) debases the holy on two counts. First, the un- circumcised male is considered deformed, since in the scriptural and rabbinic view physical perfection is attainable only through circumci- sion. The baraita in Avot de-Rabbi Nathan A, 2 places Adam at the head of a list of individuals born circumcised, using the verse "And God created man in His image" (Gen. 1:27) as its prooftext. As God himself is circumcised, it follows that an uncircumcised male, like others with physical defects, cannot be seen in the Temple. The second (divine capital punishment), see A. Shemesh, 'Iv, nlVTpDf nlpmp r OM" (Bar-Ilan University Dissertation, 1994) 194. ' On the prohibition against the entry of non-Jews from the rampart inward, see also G. Alon, 'The Levitical Uncleanness of Gentiles," Jews, Judaism and the Classi- cal World (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1977) 165-66. 23 In R. Ashi's opinion, Ezekiel did not institute this halakhah: "rather you must say that it was traditionally handed down and when Ezekiel came he strengthened It by attaching it to Scripture" (b. Yoma 71b). See E.E. Urbach, `,t=n rOn Tarbiz 18 (1946) 18 (= D'3rr 'O MD'W [Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1988] 38). 24 Even though his lack of circumcision was not voluntary, but was determined by the death of his brothers following this ceremony. 25 Clearly, just as the KtD is prohibited from observing nT'It1, and not simply "exempt," so too the 'rD. The Talmud (b. Hag. 4b) ascribes this baraita to R. Akiba, who "includes the uncircumcised like the unclean. For it is taught: R. Akiba said: [the expression], what man soever [Lev. 22:4], comes to include uncircumcised." (See Sifra, Emor, 4:18.)</page><page sequence="13">THE EXCLUSION OF DEFORMED PERSONS FROM HOLY PLACES 191 count is linked to a different aspect of the essence of holiness. In Lev. 20:25-26, Scripture provides the following rationale for the pro- hibition against eating unclean animals: So you shall set apart the clean beast from the unclean, the unclean bird from the clean. You shall not draw abomination upon yourselves through beast or bird or anything with which the ground is alive, which I have set apart for you to treat as unclean. You shall be holy to Me, for I the Lord am holy, and I have set you apart from other peoples to be Mine. This and related verses26 enable us to identify apartness as the quintes- sential aspect of holiness. God set the Israelites apart from the nations and, for that reason, enjoins them to disassociate themselves from gen- tile laws and mores.27 Circumcision symbolizes this dissociation from the nations; therefore, the appearance of an uncircumcised male in the Temple corrupts this apartness and desecrates the Temple. Evidently, the exemption from pilgrimage granted to Ol-i (strangers, aliens = proselytes) in the Mekhilta is also to be understood in this light: "All thy males. This means to exclude the strangers (rn3), the tumtum [an individual of unknown sex], and the hermaphrodite."28 As I have already noted, the creation of a series of distinctions between the holy and the more holy is inherent to the concept of sacredness. This classification applies both to people and to places, and there is a link between the two. Just as the election of the people of Israel necessitates their dissociation from the nations, similarly, the election of the sons of Aaron requires them to engage in distinctive practices that set them apart from the rest of the congregation and convey their superlative holiness.29 Attendant upon their supreme holiness, priests are granted access to precincts in the Temple from which Israelites and even Levites are excluded. However, as noted earlier, during the pilgrimage festivals these boundaries broke down, along with the dis- tinction between Israelites and priests, and we find Israelites also 26 Lev. 20:6-7; Deut. 7:4-6; 14:1-2, 21. See also Shemesh, "rnp-r MID" 160-62. 27 See J. Milgrom, Studies in Cultic Theology and Terminology (SJLA 36; Leiden: E.J.

Proselytes, however, their corre- spondence to ordinary Israelites on most counts notwithstanding,30 remain a distinct group on this score and are forbidden to enter this area. Note that the midrash excludes o8n1 based upon the interpreta- tion of the phrase "all your males" which implies belonging; aliens cannot belong to this category. Finally, I wish to examine the case of the ipt (old man). As I noted above, according to the plain meaning of the Mishnah he is exempt from appearing before the Lord because he "is unable to go up on foot." The same reason emerges from the baraita in b. Hag. 4a: "Regalim [on foot]: this excludes the lame, the sick, the blind, the aged, and one that cannot go up on foot" (see also y. Hag. 76a). Can we conclude based on the foregoing discussion that the old man is pro- hibited from appearing before the Lord, and not simply exempt? Regard- ing priestly service in the Temple we find the following: "Priests, when they will produce two pubic hairs, and even if they are old, are valid. But a blemish invalidates them. Levites from the age of thirty to the age of fifty are valid. But the blemish does not invalidate them" (t. Hul. 1:16).21 From this baraita it is clear that "age" does not dis- qualify a priest. Note, however, the language of the parallel discussion in b. Hul. 24a: "A priest, from the time that he has grown two hairs until he grows old is qualified for service." The Talmud then inquires: "Until when is this?-R. Ila'a said in the name of R. Hanina: Until he begins to tremble." According to R. Hanina's interpretation, trem- bling is a disability that at some point disqualifies the old age priest from performing the Temple service. If R. Hanina's statement reflects an alternate tradition and is not simply offered as a rationale, then the old man possesses a deformity. As he is unfit for Temple service, he may similarly not be permitted to perform the commandment "to appear before the Lord." 30 See, for example, Mekh., Pisha 15; Sifre Bemidbar 71, 109. 31 In the parallel in Sifre Bemidbar, 63, we find: "'.. . but minister to their breth- ren ..' ... Years invalidate in the case of Levites but not in the case of priesthood. For prior to the entry to the land, the Levites were valid from the age of thirty to the age of fifty, while the priests were valid from puberty until the end of their lives, but once they came into the Land, the Levites were invalidated only by losing their voice."</page><page sequence="15">THE EXCLUSION OF DEFORMED PERSONS FROM HOLY PLACES 193 [2] Lists of Individuals with Deformities in Qumran Literature Following this exploration of the relationship between the exemp- tions from ;irin rnnr and the disqualification of priests with deformi- ties, we now turn to a consideration of the lists of individuals with deformities found in the literature of the Qumran community.32 1 QM 7:4-7 i- rm V= rtt lq T= &amp;W [:i -M 0,k- 33-U It -11 * MM z -ioni rn- orimrn n"n D n-:nDU oat irr m5z xinrnbo onm iD, tt* n5h 51D .I Wt11C- M 0Tp DKMD ten Neither lame, nor blind, nor crippled, nor a man in whose flesh there is a per- manent blemish, nor a man stricken by some uncleanliness in his flesh, none of them shall go to battle with them.

Similarly, in lQSa we find tr'.r TiZI and rI. Schiffman (Eschatological Community, 4647) suggests that inI is equivalent to E317n nm based on Lev. 21:19: "no man who has a broken leg."

As in rabbinic law, the proximity of "holy angels" who stand for the divine presence itself is adduced as the explanation for the exclusion of these individuals, pre- cluding their participation in battle with "the congregation of the men of the name."37 The first passage, from the War Scroll, treats those 35 Ibid., 1.115-16. 3'6 J.M.

Primarily allotted the priestly role in the heavenly temple, these angels are pos- sessors of knowledge which they convey to humans at divine behest. Scholars who have recently examined the angelology of the Qumran community have noted that the characterization of CMD07 rMrz ("the congregation of the angels") in Qumran litera- ture is closely related to and at times identical to the community's self-description. We can adduce that the members of the Qumran community perceived their service in the terrestrial sanctuary as parallel to that of the holy angels in the heavenly sanctuary. We must also note that there are instances of direct contact between these two groups; the holy angels, who represent the divine presence, can be found within the commu- nity itself on certain occasions. Interestingly, Jub. 15:27 asserts that the angels of pres- ence and the angels of holiness were created circumcised, a claim also made for Adam, as we saw earlier. On angelology, see Y. Yadin (ed.), The Scroll of the War of the Sons of Light against the Sons of Darkness (trans. B. Rabin and C. Rabin; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1962) 229-42; C.

The passage from IQSa is of even greater interest. It ascribes the presence of holy angels as the reason these men "may not enter to stand firm within the Congregation of the men of the name." The use of the verb :'iTbT ("'stand before") in the context of the communal council is certainly derived from Ps. 82:1: "God stands in the divine assembly; among the divine beings He pronounces judgment."' Due to the presence of God within the Qumran community, the aforementioned individuals cannot stand there.39 Indeed, the verb mrnilb denotes standing before God in several of its biblical occurrences.40 We turn now to a consideration of several points that emerge from a closer examination of the lists of deformities. Nonetheless, it is important to note that the Qumran community did not share the pos- itive rabbinic view of the human body as created in the divine image. The author of Hodayot describes human baseness, using expressions like M 1-W (a creature of clay) and VM (flesh) which denote disgust with the physical aspect of human existence. (For an extensive discussion of these terms, see J. Licht, r"nr-,i I, *r' [Jerusalem: Mossad Bialik, 1957] 33-35, and Knohi, "D' rnro: '7p Mt2 ere M-', 22-23.) The human presence is tolerated by the shekhinah only on condition that they are - mm '13r1 ("perfect ones of spirit and flesh"; IQM 7:6), but the physically deformed are barred. 38 The rationale v WM= mp 0 Oft 'I ("for holy angels are together with their hosts") certainly applies to the entire passage and is not restricted to the last item listed, "a man not purified from a (bodily) discharge on the day of battle." The unclean person (nD=) also debases the holy; we cannot assume, however, that deformed indi- viduals are considered unclean. Yadin's comments along these lines (Sons of Light Against Sons of Darkness, 72-73) are in need of revision. As Yadin correctly noted (ibid.), the exemption of individuals with deformities from battle is also found in rab- binic literature. In Sifre Deut., 190, R. Jose the Galilean propounds the following view based on the proximity of the verses: "Whence do we learn that a man should not go forth to war unless he has arms, legs, eyes, and teeth? From the verse, And thine eye shall not pity: life for life (eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot) when thou goest forth to battle (Deut. 19:21-20:1)." Interestingly, Douglas (Purity and Danger, 52), following Pederson, suggests that the reason for the pentateuchal exemp- tion from war of one who has built a house but not dedicated it, planted a vineyard but not harvested it, or betrothed a woman but not married her also emerges from the debasement of the holy. The abandonment of a task prior to its completion itself con- stitutes imperfection. 39 In lQSa 1, "The Rule for all the Hosts of the Congregation," which describes the obligations of all Israelites according to age, the author repeatedly uses the verb ZlTr;f (11. 11, 12, 14, 16). This is certainly deliberate since the verb ktk1= occurs in the sec- tion on levitical duties outlined in Num. 8:23-26, on which this passage is based. 'I See Num. 11:16; Deut. 31:14; Josh. 24:1.</page><page sequence="18">196 AHARON SHEMESH (1) In the passage from IQSa the adjective s)u= ("afflicted") occurs several times. Line 3 mentions "any man who is afflicted with any one of the human uncleannesses" ( niVmD '?= 1mn Pflm), that is individuals with impurities in the category of the Mt or DTI-.41 The statement in line 4, -MWrT) 'r i Dn)D p4rn TntM rrn V1Mn 09' tInl ("[no] man who is afflicted with the [following] afflictions"), is evi- dently a heading for the list that follows which begins with: ... L1=n rnCn miY ("And anyone who is afflicted in his flesh... ").42 What then is the import of the phrase M'PrnI MW* DUa 00 lt in-cluded in the list? The previously discussed homily in Sifra (Emor chap. 3:1-2) concerning priests with deformities elucidates the mean- ing of this definition. How do we know that the law covers a priest who is swarthy, red-skinned, albino, giant, dwarf, deaf-mute, imbecile, drunkard, who has clean negaim? Scripture says, "Any man...," encompassing all of these cases. We have already established in general terms that this amplification, and the detail "who has clean negaim" (that is, suffers from a skin dis- ease that does not cause impurity) in particular, refer to visible blem- ishes. In the language of IQSa, these constitute "a blemish in his flesh visible to the eyes." (2) The ID jpt ("tottering old man") appears last on the list of those denied entry to "the Congregation of the men of the name." The very use of this language indicates that this disqualification is based not on "lack of understanding" but on weakness and physical disabil- ity, considered a deformity by the Qumran sect.43 This description is sur- prisingly similar to the one cited by R. Ila'a in the name of R. Hanina in his interpretation of the baraita that establishes that a priest is fit for service "until he grows old," which he defined as "until he begins to tremble." Perhaps this corroborates my conjecture that R. Hanina's statement is based on an ancient tradition and does not simply reflect his opinion.

Evidently, the author of lQSa chose to con- centrate solely on disqualifications due to physical deformities to the exclusion of those due to "lack of understanding." Having noted this, it becomes readily apparent that the list is both very specific and in keeping with the rabbinic definition of deformity. Although "the arn of whom the Sages have spoken in all cases is one who can neither hear nor speak" as we saw earlier, regarding pilgrimage even a deaf person with the ability to speak is exempt, since the exemption is due not to lack of understanding but to deformity. Moreover, in contradis- tinction to other Qumran works, IQSa lists the s'in (deaf) and the ML7 (dumb) separately. This implies that the deaf individual, as in rabbinic tradition, includes one who can speak, and that the mute includes one who can hear. It is now clear why lQSa simply states 11D (blind per- son) and does not specify, like CD, ntri m5nl rv ml: ("one with dimmed eyes who cannot see")"; this is because the list is restricted to the physically deformed and does not include the "mindless." While the description in CD definitely refers to someone who is blind in both eyes, in IQSa -rnD may also refer to an individual who is blind only in one eye. An additional list of individuals disqualified from entering the Tem- ple is found in 4QFlor 1:3-5: : it mn : "n=o7w 45[10, I1W:j: -ORK 0,1% 11W W1% tt*- trrn;l -iKmr .?m-r T5.v VrM m5iD[5 nn:] ri[']2 46= lEmip t: -'W TD in That is the house where there shall not enter any one in whose flesh there is a permanent blemish and an Ammonite and a Moabite and a bastard and an alien for ever and ever for his holy one there will be.

As scholars have already noted, the list in 4QFlor is based on Deut. 23:2-4: "No one whose testes are crushed or whose member is cut off shall be admitted into the congregation of the Lord. No one misbegotten.... No Ammonite or Moabite shall be admitted into the congregation of the Lord." If we consider the pas- sage in 4QFlor in consecutive order, the phrase CD 11= "ItUA O"t D'1W evidently refers to the one whose testes are crushed or whose member is cut off found in the Deuteronomic reference. In sectarian writings the term &amp;ID am denotes permanent disability.49 In the pre- sent context, its intent is to subsume additional individuals barred from entering the Temple because they suffer from deformities above and beyond those explicitly mentioned in the biblical verse. The inclusion of the m2 in the 4QFlor list of individuals barred from the Temple, despite his absence from the biblical verse, has troubled scholars, particularly in light of the fact that CD 14:4-6 explicitly as- signs the proselyte the fourth place in the "Rule for the Settlement of all the Camps," after the priests, the Levites, and the sons of Israel, thereby indicating that proselytes do have a place in the community. In the past, some scholars attempted to solve the difficulty by sug- gesting alternative readings for the word mV'o With the publication of the Temple Scroll, however, it has been established with certainty that the sect explicitly restricted proselytes to the Temple's outer court until the fourth generation.5' Baumgarten52 was the first to suggest a satis- factory explanation for this ostensible contradiction by comparing the status of the proselyte in the Qumran community with that in rab- binic sources. 49 See Yadin, Temple Scroll 1.289-91. s Yadin ("Midrash on 2 Sam. vii," 96) suggests rD1; Strugnell (1.

Judah says: There are four assemblies: the assembly of priests, the assembly of the Levites, the assembly of Israel, and the assembly of the proselytes. The Sages say: There are only three." R. Judah's opinion, which classi- fies proselytes as a separate group, reflects the ancient tradition found in m. Qid. 4:1: "Ten classes of definite genealogy came up from Baby- lon... ." On the one hand, this list views proselytes as permitted to marry Levites and Israelites, but it also allows them to marry bastards and nethinim who are unacceptable marital partners for the others. At Qumran, as in rabbinic law, the proselyte is assigned an intermediate status. On the one hand, he is a member of the community and has the right to participate in its general meetings; but, on the other, his access to the Temple and TI Tp is restricted. (Accordingly, it seems that like individuals with deformities, proselytes are barred from par- ticipation in the Qumranic 0npFT rDsx [holy council]). A renewed look at the conclusions reached in the first part of this paper further clarifies the question of the proselyte. I argued that the exemptions from the injunction to appear before the Lord are in es- sence prohibitions barring access to the precinct between the sanctuary and the altar, an area entered by pilgrims on the festivals. Examina- tion of the homily in Mekhilta reveals that it exempts from pilgrim- age not only individuals with deformities but proselytes as well, just as the list in 4QFlor links deformed individuals with proselytes and non-Jews. As I argued above, these categories are denied entry to the Temple because their very presence debases holiness.-' 53 Scholars originally argued that the sect interpreted the biblical verse as applying solely to the prohibition against entry to holy places. However, the discovery of MMT has made it clear that this supposition is incorrect 54 The affinity between Qumranic and rabbinic law concerning the complex status of proselytes as it emerges from the above discussion supports Baumgarten's position ("Exclusion of 'Netinim'," 219) against D.R. Schwartz's suggestion ("Priestly View of Descent," 165-66) regarding the sectarians' position on the acceptance of proselytes. Schwartz argues that, unlike the rabbis, in consonance with its "priestly torah," the Qumran community totally rejected the idea of conversion.

From the Temple Scroll, in contrast,</page><page sequence="22">200 AHARON SHEMESH In actuality, the rabbis and the Qumran community alike understood the prohibition against 'l 5,npn Wn as applying both to marriage55 and to entry into holy places (whether the Temple, the Holy Council, or even war in Qumran literature),56 in line with the scriptural para- digm.Y' At present, we know of the Qumran community's concern with this dual prohibition from MMT B 3941, where the author complains: "[And concerning the Ammonite] and the Moabite and the mamzer [and him whose testicles] have been crushed [and him] whose male member [has been cut off], who (nevertheless) enter the congregation [and ... and] take [wives to be]come one bone [and enter the sanctu- ary ... ]"S As for the rabbis: although the homily in Sifre treats forbid- den marriages alone, we have demonstrated that in rabbinic tradition the same individuals are also unfit to enter the Temple. The disputed issue between the two groups then narrows down to determination of the boundaries of the holy precincts in Jerusalem and on the Temple Mount.59 Although this controversy has practical consequences and gives rise to significant differences between Qumranic and rabbinic halakhah, it essentially boils down to a single question: how are the pentateuchal laws concerning the sanctity of the Tent of Meeting and the priestly, levitical, and Israelite camps to be applied to the reality of a permanent Temple in Jerusalem? Since in the rabbinic view the only area from which persons with deformities are barred is the one between the sanctuary and the altar, this halakhah is relevant for non- priests only during the pilgrimage festivals. This explains its restric- we see that from the fourth generation on, proselytes are admitted to the Temple; there- fore, they can be assimilated within the Jewish people (see Schwartz, n. 43). Whatever the case may be, I have already demonstrated that in rabbinic law, proselytes are not allowed to enter precincts that pilgrims are permitted to enter. ss Concerning forbidden unions (m': On1'9) as debasing holiness, see Shemesh, "DW MpnMM," 186-90. -" This is true for rabbinic literature as well. On the prohibition against the partici- pation of deformed persons in war, see n. 37 above. The same applies to those dis- qualified from sitting in judgment (which bears similarity to the Qumran community's Znpr f r=) where we find categories from the list under discussion. M. San. 4:2 states: "All are eligible to try cases concerning property, but not all are qualified to judge cap- ital cases, but only priests, Levites and Israelites who may give [their daughters] in marriage to priests." Tis indicates that the proselyte and the bastard are ineligible to judge capital cases. 57 See Z.W. Falk, "MpM Wit' CMVK-1," Beit Miqra 62 (1975) 342-51. 5 Qimron and Strugnell, MMT, 51.

The Qumran community, however, due to its stricter viewpoint, which applied the sanctity of the "inner Temple" to a larger area, found it necessary to confront the question of deformed and other disqualified individuals in the daily context.60 [3] Conclusion: Pilgrimage and Assembly In summation, we can articulate the shared perception of the Qum- ran community and the rabbis regarding the exclusion of persons with de- formities (whether physical or genealogical) from holy places. In their view, it is the divine presence, in the Temple and elsewhere, that con- stitutes its basis. The origins of this conception lie in the pentateuchal prohibition barring deformed priests from the sacred precincts on the grounds that this profanes the sanctuary. Based upon the perception that the presence of deformed persons in the sacred area is antithetical 10 Two additional halakhot in the Qumran literature touch upon the prohibition against the entry of deformed persons to holy places. As they are not directly related to the thesis of this paper, they were not discussed in the body of the text. In MMT B 49-54 we find: "(And concerning] the blind who cannot see so as to beware of all mix- ture and cannot see a mixture that incurs [reparation]-offering; and concerning the deaf who have not heard the laws and the judgements and the purity regulations, and have not heard the ordinances of Israel, since he who has not seen or heard does not know how to obey (the law); nevertheless they have access to the sacred food" (Qimron and Strugnell, MMT, 51-53). For a detailed discussion of this halakhah, see ibid., 160-61. Clearly, in this case, it is not the deformation which disqualify the blind and the deaf but rather the fear that the blind and the deaf, who cannot be precise in their obser- vance of the laws of impurity, will accidentally desecrate the Temple and its holy offerings. (As Qimron correctly points out, their disqualification is similar to the rab- binic category of Imp1 iri'o ,O1F.) In addition, the Temple Scroll (45:12-14) states: "No blind man shall enter it all their days, so that they will not defile the city in which I dwell" (Yadin, Temple Scroll 2.193). Yadin, (ibid., 1.289-90; and in his commentary, 2.193) is forced to suggest that the "blind man" stands here for the broad nomencla- ture of deformity, basing himself on the plural forms found in the continuation of the sentence (R* vt= tiL ;iWi'). In light of the discussion above, however, the rationale of "defiling the city" seems strange, as we have nowhere found that the Qumran com- munity treats individuals with deformities as impure. It seems that Qimron's sugges- tion (MMT, 160-61) that "'IiM KWM- is to be interpreted as "lest they profane the holy things" is correct. Again, like MMT, this source does not disqualify the blind man due to his deformity, but rather due to fear that he will profane the city as a result of his blindness. Naturally, this interpretation assumes that the blind man in these two texts is blind in both eyes, as MMT explicitly notes (DI'iD D'b-1). However, as I suggested above, in the halakhah of the Qumran community, the disqualification of a blind man as possessing a deformity applies to the case of a person blind in one eye as well.</page><page sequence="24">202 AHARON SHEMESH to the divine presence, we find both groups ruling stringently in the case of "visible blemishes." At the same time, however, both the rabbis and the Qumran com- munity clearly viewed individuals with deformities, proselytes, and bas- tards as an integral part of the community, bound by the obligation to observe the commandments and, therefore, to know them.6' It is instruc- tive to contrast the injunction to "appear before the Lord" (7r7'inl nrnlD) with that of "assembly" (jrrpfl rl=-Deut. 31:913). Only for the for- mer does Scripture limit the obligation to "all your males." Concern- ing br;pr l innr, we find a different picture: "Gather the people-men, women, children, and the strangers in your communities-that they may hear and so learn to revere the Lord your God and to observe faithfully every word of this Teaching" (Deut. 31:12). IQSa draws a similar distinction. The passage cited above which forbade those with deformities "to stand firm [wi]thin the Congregation of the m[e]n of the name," continues: "But if there is [one of] these [(who)has a mat]ter to say to the Council of Holiness, [then he (the Master)] shall exam- ine [him] directly. But within [the Congregation] the man [shall nojt enter for he is afflicted" (1QSa 2:9-11 ).62 The prohibition against the participation of individuals with deformities in the gathering of the inner council notwithstanding, we must consider the scroll's opening section: "And this (is) the rule for all (in) the Congregation of Israel in the end of days.... When they come, they shall assemble all those who enter, (including) children along with women; and they shall read in [their] h[earing] [al]l the statutes of the covenant and instruct them in all [th]eir judg[ments] lest they err g[reatly]" ( QSa 1:1, 4-5).63 The inspiration for this future assembly is clearly the biblical model of assembly. We can therefore conclude that the Qumran community modeled its halakhah on a dual paradigm-pilgrimage and assembly. 61 See n. 29 above.

Evidently the original version was CMtz kVnrb which was replaced by D' if since the next homily derives the exclusion of proselytes from the verse: "Thou shalt read this law before all Israel (Deut 31:11). This excludes strangers and slaves." It seems that the repetition of the homily concerning ZU illustrates the lack of unity of the homily as a whole and reflects its nature as a collection of short homilies from various sources. 67 The pericope on assembly (Deut. 31:9-13) explicitly singles out "men, women, children, and the strangers in your communities." It seems then that the homily-"Thou shalt read this law before all Israel (Deut. 31:11). This excludes strangers and slaves"-has as its intent the point that strangers and slaves are obligated to observe the commandment of 'Mprt, but not the annual commandment of firt.</page><page sequence="26">204 AHARON SHEMESH A cursory glance at the above texts reveals that the homily in Mekhilta is both longer and more detailed, and consists of homilies on three separate verses from which the various exemptions are derived. The homily in Sifre, on the other hand, is brief, and interprets a single verse: "Three times a year all your males shall appear." The homily in Sifre-"As one comes to see, so does he come to be seen"-is cryptic. The commentators understand it is as an exposition whose purpose is to exclude the blind from the ranks of those obli- gated to "appear before the Lord," an interpretation that emerges from comparison of the homily to its parallels in the Mekhilta and the baraita in b. Hag. 2a: "For it is taught: Johanan b. Dahabai said in the name of R. Judah: A man who is blind in one eye is exempt from appear- ing [at the Temple/or exempt from bringing the pilgrimage-offering] as it is said: Yir'eh [He will see], Yera'eh [He will be seen]."68 Indeed, comparison of these two midrashic sources elucidates the difference between them; after all, the cryptic remark in the Sifre lacks an accom- panying explanation of the halakhah to be derived from "As one comes to see, so does he come to be seen." This homily's distinctiveness is highlighted by comparison to the succeeding one: "Thy males, thus excluding women." Concerning "appear," however, we do not find the statement: Appear, thus excluding the blind (Q'pnIM ra1 m wrb ... mmr). As Samuel David Luzzatto (SHaDaL) has noted,69 we would expect the biblical forms derived from the root m-1 found in the context of pilgrimage to be read in the active voice, not the passive dictated by tradition. The vocalization in the passive voice is evidently a sort of scribal correction (m'nio lppn) made out of respect for the divine.70 Recently, Shlomo Naeh has demonstrated that the rabbis were attuned to the plain reading of XI M fnl MAfl in the active voice; the read- ing in the passive voice was based on the parallel in Exod. 23:17: 'tttIr M "n t 7 'PM"ti trurr ("shall appear before the Sovereign, the Lord God of Israel.")7' Evidently, the import of our homily lies 0 See n. 72 below. 69 Commentary on Isaiah (Padua, 1867) 30-31.

In all cases, these changes are slight, generally no more than one or two letters. In the matter under consideration, there is no consonantal emenda- tion; rather the change is in the vocalization. See E. Tov, wtlpwt nMM MIp' (Jeru- salem: Mossad Bialik, 1989) 51-52 and the bibliography cited therein. 7' Naeh, "nim= DK cm ," 416-19.</page><page sequence="27">THE EXCLUSION OF DEFORMED PERSONS FROM HOLY PLACES 205 precisely in this point. The homilist read the verse in Deuteronomy according to its plain meaning, in the active voice, but chose to stress, following comparison with Exodus, that the verse must also be read in the passive voice: "As one comes to see, so does he come to be seen." ... C flIT does not denote "in the same fashion," but rather "just as." The dual reading of the verse suggested by the homily describes pil- grimage as a human-divine encounter; the pilgrim stands before God, sees God's face, and is seen by God. As explained in the initial sec- tion of this paper, a similar conception governs the halakhic stance that individuals with deformities are prohibited from performing niTs rRtril. It must be stressed that this homily does not specifically exempt the blind man and is equally applicable whether it refers to eyes, legs, hands, ears, etc.72 It is now clear why the Sifre finds its unnecessary to adduce additional examples excluding individuals with various de- formities from appearing before the Lord. According to its method, the homily "as one comes to see, so does he come to be seen" is all- inclusive. The fact that the homily in the Mekhilta derives each exclusion from appearing before the Lord separately, by means of close reading of the biblical text, demonstrates that it does not share the view of the essence of pilgrimage reflected in Sifre. Therefore, it was necessary to anchor the tradition in extrapolations from the biblical verses. Briefly stated, the Mekhilta does not perceive the exemptions from MAtIM M3D as belonging to the framework of the blanket prohibition against the entry of deformed persons to the Temple and restricts its treatment of the topic to the narrow confines of the obligation itself. n2This enables us to trace the evolution of the tradition found in R. Johanan b. Dahabai's opinion. As we have seen, R. Johanan's opinion exempting the blind man from MTW is briefly cited in t. Hag. 1:1: "Yohanan b. Rahbai said in the name of R. Judah, 'Also a blind person [is exempt from the requirement of making an appear- ancel,' since it is said, Will see (Exod. 23:14), 'excluding the blind person."' Accord- ingly, R. Johanan read the verse in the active voice, concluding that someone unable to see is exempt from the commandment. In the talmudic baraita, we find R. Johanan exempting an individual who is blind in one eye, even though he can see. The homily there reads as follows: m-*' tuK 'lmn i rwr' '30 MIN010 m m rr'D rII mm ,"Vrr' rIW k fT 3l VD 'FW rn&amp;m rm rwrrb k: lt'h-r In (the text is cited accord- ing to MS Maimon-Sanhedrin). The rishonim had great difficulty explaining this baraita (see Naeh, t'7 ot lM, 413 n. 33). I hope that the following remarks are consistent with the explanation that Naeh has promised to provide elsewhere. It seems to me that the explanation is straightforward: this baraita in the Babylonian Talmud is the realization of the homily "see-be seen" regarding the blind man, about whom R. Johanan stated in his original homily that he is deformed and therefore exempt from ilt'^-1T M=. Since the blind man has a deformity, in line with the homily in Sifre, "flwK'-rTm"'-it makes no difference whether he is blind in one or both eyes.</page><page sequence="28">206 AHARON SHEMESH Comparison of the Mishnah to Sifre and the Mekhilta indicates that the Mishnah further distances itself from the notion that deformed persons, by dint of their imperfection, are unfit to enter the Temple. Two significant changes must be noted. First, the Mekhilta extrapolates the exemption of the orT from the verse: "Thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing. This excludes the deaf ones," and of the minor from close reading of the verse "Thou shalt rejoice. This excludes ... the minor." The Mishnah however unites the two, adding the imbecile who is not mentioned in any of the legal homilies. In so doing, it creates the usual concatenation of "a deaf man, an imbecile, and a minor" who are exempt from all commandments, not just from pilgrimage. The second change concerns the sick person. According to the Mekhilta, he is exempt because of his inability to rejoice, but the Mishnah conjoins him with the lame man and the blind man, plus the old man who is not mentioned in the legal midrashim, thereby creat- ing a group exempt due to its members' limited locomotion. It seems then that although the basis for the Mishnaic exemptions from appearing before the Lord lies by and large in the ancient con- ception that the presence of deformity desecrates holiness, this recog- nition was blurred over the generations. Evidently, the homily in Sifre still reflects this view of the exemption. The Mekhilta, on the other hand, derives each exemption separately from close reading of verses directly relating to pilgrimage, while the Mishnah organizes them in accord with the usual categories governing exemptions from the com- mandments in general: a deaf man, an imbecile, and a minor, who are exempt because of their "lack of understanding"; women, slaves, and the like who are exempt from time-specific commandments; and a third group whose members are exempt from ;rmi due to their limited mobility.</page></plain_text>
