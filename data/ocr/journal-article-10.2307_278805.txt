<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURRENT RESEARCH EDITED BY FRANCIS A. RIDDELL SOUTHWEST UTAH. The University of Utah had three excavation crews in the field in 1966. Kent C. Day excavated a large Fremont village in the Uinta Basin, Floyd W. Sharrock excavated a large Fremont village at Nephi in west-central Utah, and Mel Aikens dug a small Fremont-Promontory campsite on the Bear River in northern Utah. It is too early to make definite con- clusions, but Day found pit houses, Sharrock found above-ground adobe structures, and Aikens got numerous small shallow pits of irregular form and unknown use, a much-used hearth area, much bison and wildfowl bone, and no structures. The Uinta Basin and Nephi sites are definitely horticultural; the Bear River site appears to be a semi-permanent hunting camp, though the practice of horticulture by these people is not ruled out. These three sites all tend to support the notion of areal differentiation within the Fremont culture. Aikens' site is much different than the Fremont of central Utah, and he thinks it will bolster the hypothesis of Fremont- Promontory cultural relationships which he already sus- pects from other evidence. COLORADO. Larry L. Leach, University of Colorado, excavated a stratified rockshelter in the Jones Hole locality of Dinosaur National Monument, northwestern Colorado, under the sponsorship of the National Park Service. The site, Deluge Shelter, has 9 or 10 definite occupation levels, each separated by sterile material. The top two occupations are "Fremontoid" and overlie "Archaic" levels. The lowest levels, down to 4.25 m. produced bison bones and "pseudo-fluted" projectile points. SOUTHWESTERN COLORADO. A University of Colorado Museum party, under the direction of Joe Ben Wheat, continued its excavation program at Porter Pueblo near Yellow Jacket, Colorado. Work was concentrated on one of a series of Pueblo II-Early Pueblo III pitroom villages built around circular or oval plazas with central kivas. Post and adobe structures appear to be associated with some of the pitrooms. Frank Eddy, of the Museum staff, is currently under- taking to refine the chronology of Mancos Black-on- white pottery, using stratigraphic lots of potsherds from Porter Pueblo as a basis for his work. A variety of activities by the Department of Anthro- pology, University of Colorado, is taking place in the Mesa Verde area under the direction of Robert H. Lister assisted by Al Lancaster and David A. Breternitz. Exca- vation of the Morfield Canyon Great Kiva, begun in 1965, was completed. The kiva is not unlike the Great Kiva at Aztec National Monument, and it is the first such structure excavated on Mesa Verde proper. It was probably constructed in late Pueblo II, was ravaged by fire, and was cleaned out and modified in Pueblo III times. Extensive testing in the surrounding room blocks had aided in establishing the overall relationships of the variety of habitation units at this large and complex site and their relationships to the Great Kiva. Six Undergraduate Trainees in Archaeology, a pro- gram sponsored by the National Science Foundation, worked on a variety of projects, including the Morfield Canyon Great Kiva and its environs. In addition, they completed the excavation of MV1104, a Mancos phase pueblo, the excavation of which was begun by their predecessors in 1965. They also dug a 4-room early Pueblo II pueblo without a kiva. Both sites will be destroyed by the new Wetherill Mesa road. The second season of an archaeological survey on Bureau of Land Management land between Mesa Verde and the Utah state line has produced a significant num- ber of new sites and a much better picture of the extent and variety of the Mesa Verde culture. In connection with a current juniper eradication pro- gram on the Ute Mountain Indian Reservation, a flagging operation was undertaken to protect ruins on some 30,000 acres which are being chained. Mesa-top sites, in particular, were surveyed in the area south of the Mancos River and Johnson Canyon as part of this pro- gram. NEW MEXICO. John P. Wilson, Museum of New Mexico, spent seven weeks excavating at Fort Fillmore. Room blocks and refuse areas were examined, and both modifications and verifications with old maps and records were obtained. Weekly newsletters were sent out to interested parties during this project. The Museum of New Mexico recently has completed a series of excavations in southwestern New Mexico at sites endangered by highway construction. Near Cliff, New Mexico, the sites included a section of a Mangas phase pit house village, a Mimbres phase unit, and about two-fifths of a large pueblo characterized by Gila Polychrome pottery. Below the latter ruin were pit houses dating from the Georgetown phase. L. C. Ham- mack, S. D. Bussey, J. P. Wilson, and R. J. Ice were the field supervisors. The last section of the road project from Silver City to the Gila Cliff Dwellings included four sites. One, covering the period from the Three Circle phase to the Mimbres phase, also had a historic ranchhouse as the last component. A historic structure was excavated at a second site, while Georgetown, Mangas, and Mimbres phases were represented at the other two sites. Excava- tions were made under the supervision of L. C. Ham- mack and R. J. Ice. The important result of these excavations is the po- tential for a review of archaeological concepts of south- western New Mexico when the analyses of materials from these sites, as well as others excavated by the 129</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Museum in the same district, are completed. Studies here were made possible by contracts with the State Highway Department, the National Forest Service, and by a grant from the National Science Foundation. Another State Highway contract provided the finances for excavations of a small Red Mesa phase site near Laguna, New Mexico. S. D. Bussey directed this project. Again, a sufficient number of sites has now been studied from that phase to examine variations in the Red Mesa phase in its eastward extension from the district where it was defined. A number of recent programs have been concerned with historic site development or salvage. New con- struction at the Cathedral in Santa Fe has permitted us to accomplish some investigations of the early por- tions of that structure which date in the 1700's. At Nambe Pueblo, S. L. Peckham conducted excavations in an old section which is to be covered by new hous- ing. Limited tests were possible at an old cemetery in Santa Fe which is to become the site of a new building. Besides remains from the 1859 to 1914 period, a great deal of material from the early 1700's was recovered. The development of historic sites in New Mexico is nearing realization with the completion of a state-wide inventory and the selection of the first groups for work. The long-range program includes sites of every period and major activity important to the history of New Mexico and the Southwest. In cooperation with the National Park Service, exca- vations have continued in the Cochiti Reservoir. The summer of 1966 will see the completion of field work with the excavation of two historic sites, one dating about 1625 and the other shortly after 1700, and minor work at three other sites that were not completed in earlier seasons. From this time on, there will be a con- centration on analysis of data and completion of reports. Publications recently released, or at the printers, that deal with research done in the last few years include a social-economic study by Anne M. Smith, New Mexico Indians, and An Archaeological and Historical Survey Along New Mexico Highways, by R. K. Alexander, con- ducted for the State Highway Department. A report of excavations at the 14th-century site near Albuquerque, by L. C. Hammack, The Tunnard Site, will be released by the printer shortly. Papers from studies at the Waldo Dam and a summary of archaeological investigations in the Navajo Reservoir are currently being edited. ARIZONA. With cooperation of the National Park Service, the Department of Anthropology, Northern Ari- zona University, Flagstaff, has excavated a small Sinagua pueblo on the grounds of Walnut Canyon National Monument. This ruin will be stabilized as a mesa-top exhibit. Additional excavations were begun in two small rockshelters south of Flagstaff. A twice-yearly news- letter, Anthropology in Northern Arizona; A Research Newsletter, has been established by the Department; Roger Kelley is the editor. George Gumerman, Museum of Northern Arizona, excavated two rooms and a trash deposit at Inscription House for the National Park Service, resulting in a sub- stantial artifactual return. Roger Kelly and Calvin Jennings surveyed the right- of-way for an Arizona Public Service transmission line across northern Arizona. In the area of Red Butte, between Williams and the Grand Canyon, 12 sites were found. All sites have lithic material, and some con- tain pottery. They are not the Pinto Basin sites reported by Euler and McNutt but are probably Pueblo II and III hunting sites. Prescott College, a new, private, liberal arts college in Prescott, Arizona, which enrolled its charter class in September, 1966, received a National Science Founda- tion grant to support anthropological research involving culture history and prehistoric settlement patterns of the Grand Canyon. Field work was initiated in May, 1966, by Robert C. Euler assisted by Lawrence E. Powers. In approximately one month of survey by helicopter, every immediate tributary of Grand Canyon, from its eastern edge west to the mouth of Supai and Kanab canyons, was investigated. Some 250 new sites were recorded below the rims of the canyon ranging in age and cul- tural placement from the 4,000-year-old Split Twig Figurine complex to historic Southern Paiute, Pai, and Anglo-American habitations. The bulk of these, how- ever, were early Pueblo III Kayenta Anasazi sites. In addition, soil samples for pollen analysis were collected from behind supposedly agricultural check dams and terraces associated with Kayenta structures, and a labora- tory re-analysis was made of collections from over 700 sites previously recorded by Grand Canyon National Park and Gila Pueblo. Prescott College, which has established a core major in anthropology, an anthropological research center, and Prescott College Press, will publish the results of this research. The Department of Anthropology, Arizona State Uni- versity, Tempe, has been involved in a variety of archaeo- logical work. John Ives, aided by Dan Opfenring, has worked in two early Hohokam sites during the past year. First, salvage was conducted on the important Red Mountain site (ASU U:10:2) northeast of Mesa. This site, trenched during the spring of 1964, has been nearly destroyed by run-off from summer rains. A second flexed inhumation, 150 yds. west of the first, was located in the south bank of the arroyo that splits the site and was excavated by Opfenring and D. H. Morris. Two inhumations are now known for both the earliest (Vahki phase) and latest (Snaketown phase) portions of the Pioneer period in the Red Mountain area. No crema- tions have been found with Pioneer associations in this area. It seems possible to think of a Red Mountain Branch of the Hohokam during the Pioneer period, based upon inhumations, burial cairns, and differences in the earlier metate-mano complex. After the salvage site U:10:2, Ives and Opfenring began work at ASU T:16:19, a Hohokam site marked by large, deep middens located about 5 mi. west of Snaketown on the Gila River. Three Vahki phase 130 [ VOL. 32, No. 1, 1967</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT RESEARCH houses were cleared, one of which Ives believes to be a shaman's house. The houses are variable in shape and orientation but are considerably smaller than the two houses found at Snaketown and originally thought to be characteristic of Vahki phase. Neither inhumations nor cremations were found in the site T:16:19 excava- tions. Analysis of materials from two sites near Kinlichee, Navajo Reservation is under way. Reynold J. Ruppe6 is working with materials from a late Pueblo site, ASU K:7:14, and is experimenting with computer analysis of local pottery types. Joyce Lowenstein, a graduate stu- dent, is making an ethnobotanical study of vegetal re- mains from ASU K:7:12, a cave site east of Kinlichee. Robert Chenhall has been working closely with the Arizona Archaeological Society in the excavation of a compound on the Agua Fria River northwest of Peoria. The analysis of artifacts from this site, ASU T:7:1, will be done in part by using computer techniques. Chen- hall is directing excavation and formulating the me- chanics of computer analysis for the site data. Sylvia W. Gaines, using materials from three Hoho- kam sites, completed her master's thesis, "Use of Com- puting Techniques in Classifying Archaeological Data," during spring, 1966. Two Arizona State University students, Godfrey Whiffen and Paul Fish, surveyed the Upper Verde River Valley in the vicinity of Perkinsville. Norman Alger is writing up the results of the excavations at ASU N:4:2, a pueblo at Perkinsville. During the spring of 1966, Bernard L. Fontana's class in historical archaeology (University of Arizona) analyzed and wrote histories of the various classes of artifacts re- covered from those parts of Camp Grant threatened by a highway realignment project. The material was ob- tained in 1962 from excavations under the direction of William W. Wasley. A published report on the history and archaeology of Camp Grant is forthcoming, and it includes detailed typological descriptions and techno- logical histories of mule shoes, horseshoes, screws and threaded bolts, and a limited range of arms parts, house furniture, farming tools, metallic cartridges, wagon parts, ceramic smoking pipes, and 19th-century bottles. The Arizona Archaeological and Historical Society has completed excavations at San Gabriel de Guevavi, a few miles northeast of Nogales, Arizona. This Spanish mission was built by the Jesuits between 1746 and 1751 and is believed to be the oldest standing Jesuit struc- ture in the United States. Excavations concentrated on the convento and other associated buildings. The con- vento was built in the form of a hollow "U" and attached to the church on the west side. The analysis of artifacts, which consist mainly of kitchen refuse, native ceramics and stone work, and a small amount of Spanish goods, is nearly complete. Evidently most of the useful artifacts were removed when the mission was abandoned in 1772. Documentary research is being conducted by John Kessell of the National Park Service as part of the Tumacacori mission history project. Arizona State Museum highway salvage excavations in Hohokam sites on Interstate 19 in the vicinity of San Xavier Mission, carried out by James Sciscenti from June to September in 1965, were resumed by Cameron Greenleaf in November and continued until March, 1966. The excavations yielded 62 houses and 16 crema- tions in addition to ramada and cooking areas, hearths, cooking pits, trash-filled borrow pits, and caliche mix- ing bowls. The sites have been identified as dating from approximately A.D. 800 of late Rillito phase to early Tanque Verde, A.D. 1200. The majority are representa- tive of the Rincon phase, A.D. 900-1100. New highway salvage excavations on Interstate 19 were begun in June, 1966, in an area between Amado and Nogales. This work, under the direction of James Sciscenti, includes the excavation of a village tentatively identified as belonging to the Trincheras culture. A quarry and tool preparation area with San Dieguito-like tools was salvaged on the same project by Jeffrey Brown, who gridded and surface-collected the site for testing random sampling techniques. The review project of Southwestern dendrochronology by the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research is now in its fourth year. Starting with quadrangles near the Four Corners, re-analysis has now been completed for 22 quadrangles in southern Utah, northern Arizona, and western New Mexico. This analysis has involved the handling of over 15,000 specimens from 400 or more sites and has resulted in nearly 5,000 dates from an approximate 250 sites. Publication of the results has begun with four reports issued covering seven quad- rangles. These reports, together with recently published syntheses of Chaco Canyon and Mesa Verde dendro- chronology, will provide ever more precise chronological controls for the prehistoric Southwest. Charles C. Di Peso and associates have been exca- vating a site of the Cochise culture located a few hun- dred yards from the San Pedro River just outside of Benson, Arizona. The cultural materials were discovered by the owners of a sand and gravel quarry who were in the process of opening up a new area. Thus far, a burial made beneath a stone cairn containing broken artifacts, a firehearth situated a short distance away, and numerous grinding tools have been uncovered. The metates have been identified by E. B. Sayles as being of types made during the Chiricahua stage. Members of the Southwest Archaeological Expedition of the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, con- ducted further research on culture changes, as exempli- fied in archaeological sites in Hay Hollow Valley, eastern Arizona. Staff members are Paul S. Martin and John M. Fritz (Field Museum), James N. Hill (University of California at Los Angeles), and Mark Leone (Harvard University). The project is financed by the Field Museum of Natural History, the National Science Foundation (Grant No. GS-984), and Undergraduate Research Par- ticipation Program of the National Science Foundation (Grant No. GY-97). Under the latter grant, 8 under- 131</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY graduates were given first-hand experience in all aspects of archaeological research, from collecting data through analysis to hypotheses. Hay Hollow Valley was chosen because of the major changes in settlement and social systems that occurred there from about 1200 B.C. to A.D. 1300. The study will illuminate these cultural processes and their relationship to the appearance of agriculture. Hypotheses can be formulated which will be concerned with how each society is organized for the performance of tasks and with the development of hierarchies, status units, and changes in social organization. The current research is concerned with delineating the cultural system of the Desert culture at the Hay Hollow site. By means of random samples, enough vital data are expected to be recovered to reconstruct an image of the total range of activities that might have been carried on in a village of hunters-and-gatherers who were becoming acquainted with maize and ceramics. Naturally, models derived from ethnographic analogies are used in analyzing data. At present, the site is regarded as a seasonal camp used as a winter base from ca. 500 B.C. to ca. A.D. 250 for a group of two to four families. In the training of the NSF URPP students, the recon- struction of social organization is considered. This catch- all phrase includes those observable patterns of social relationships that enable the members of the community to function effectively in their social and natural environ- ment. The Hay Hollow site covers about one acre and is located on a terrace some 30 ft. above the alluvial plain. Four surface houses have been excavated, and five more have been discovered. These may have resembled con- temporary Apache dwellings in size and in wattle-and- daub super-structure. Butchering, roasting, barbecuing, and other forms of cooking meat, as well as tool manu- facture, were performed in distinctive areas. Other than houses, the only artifacts are tools of stone, and stone-knapping debris. As all inferences and hypotheses must be extracted from the lithic artifacts, new and radical methods of analyzing them had to be devised. Fritz has been resourceful in organizing the task involving more than 100,000 stone items. His methods are based partly on the researches of Lewis R. Binford, amplified and refined by means of help from Don E. Crabtree, who is a master of stone-working techniques. NORTHERN MEXICO CHIHUAHUA. The Casas Grandes research team under the sponsorship of the National Science Foundation is continuing the analysis of materials from the joint Casas Grandes Expedition. Research on the painted decorated pottery of the later phases is almost completed. Charles C. Di Peso, John B. Rinaldo, and Gloria J. Fenner are currently working' on the ceremonial architectural units and the textured and plain pottery types of the Medio and Tardio periods. This study has resulted in several interesting items. The Casas Grandes ball courts are being correlated with the later type in Mesoamerica. The techniques of decoration on the textured pottery types have been classified into modes and related to those used in the American Southwest and on the west coast of Mexico. The combination of tree-ring dating and radiocarbon dating linked with architectural sequences, trade pottery, and local pottery distributions has resulted in some changes in the series of phases and in the ex- tension of the Casas Grandes culture sequence into his- toric times in out-of-the-way areas not in contact with the Spanish trade routes. WEST COAST. During the months of May and June, 1966, Robert K. Alexander (Museum of New Mexico) conducted a survey of the area around the Bahia de Banderas on the Mexican west coast. A great many sites exist in this area, and the similarity in pottery from most of the sites examined suggests a single period of dense occupation. The exact period has not yet been determined, but both pottery and observable architecture compare favorably with Early Postclassic materials else- where on the west coast. It is hoped that specimens of shell obtained from one site will provide an accurate radiocarbon date. The project, under the auspices of the Museum of New Mexico, was sponsored by a private individual in Santa Fe. DAVID A. BRETERNITZ WESTERN MESOAMERICA Major discoveries of related Early Formative materials in three areas of southern Mexico occurred in 1966. In the Valley of Oaxaca, the "Olmec" area of southern Veracruz, and the border region of Tabasco and Chiapas, the new finds will make necessary the recasting of many familiar ideas and will fill in a number of long-standing gaps. In January, 1966, the Smithsonian Institution began a 3-year program of investigations into the prehistoric human ecology of the Valley of Oaxaca. The project, directed by Kent V. Flannery (U.S. National Museum), was based at the Museo Frissell de Arte Zapoteca in Mitla. A team composed of anthropologists and natural scientists spent the first six months gathering environ- mental and cultural data relevant to the rise of farming communities and urban civilization in that area. Geomorphologists Michael and Anne Kirkby (Cam- bridge University) began by mapping the landforms and geological strata of the valley, proceeding then to a detailed study of soil types, drainage, water table, and erosion rates. Results of their study include some con- clusions vital to archaeological research and interpreta- tion. For example, they demonstrated that the Valley of Oaxaca is a riverine formation and never had the legend- ary lake attributed to it. Botanist Wallace Ernst (Smithsonian Institution) col- lected specimens of the native flora to facilitate a defini- tion of vegetation zones and plant communities in the 132 [ VOL. 32, No. 1, 1967</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT RESEARCH region. A preliminary visit to the valley was made by C. Earle Smith (U.S. Department of Agriculture), form- er staff botanist of the Tehuacan Archaeological-Botani- cal Project, who will undertake the identification of plant remains from dry caves in Oaxaca. Ethnologist Aubrey Williams (University of Mary- land), also a veteran of the Tehuacan Project, has begun a series of studies aimed at comparing and contrasting the various types of land use in the valley. He is study- ing dry-farming communities, intensive irrigation com- munities, and communities using a combination of dry- farming and irrigation techniques. Fresh from his work at the prehistoric Purron Dam in the Tehuacan Valley, James A. Neely (University of Arizona) investigated ancient water-control systems in the Valley of Oaxaca. Neely's first project involved the mapping and excavation of Hierve el Agua, a vast com- plex of agricultural terraces and irrigation canals fossil- ized by travertine-rich water, in the mountains near Mitla. The site appears, from early indications, to have a sequence running from Monte Alban I (about 600 B.C.) to the Spanish conquest, climaxing in a large habi- tation center with a pyramid, house platforms, a salt- making industry, and intensive terrace irrigation. Flannery, assisted by Chris Moser, Richard Orlandini, Silvia Maranca, and Eligio Martinez, undertook surveys and test excavations in two carefully delimited "pilot areas" in the Valley of Oaxaca, chosen for their con- trasting geomorphological and floral characteristics. In addition, surveys and test excavations were made in the oak woodland and pine-oak forest zones above the valley, as well as in the tropical canyons below the valley at the headwaters of the Tehuantepec River. The Smithsonian team drew upon the experience of John Paddock (University of the Americas), Ignacio Bernal (National Museum of Anthropology), Jos6 Luis Lorenzo (Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia), and Cecil R. Welte, all of whom had done previous work in the region. Results as seen near the end of the first year's field work include the conclusion mentioned that the Valley of Oaxaca is riverine (not lacustrine), cut by the tribu- taries of the Atoyac River on its way to the Pacific coast. The legends of a lake in the valley, recorded by Burgoa and other early chroniclers, now become a problem in themselves, for the valley floor has been shown to have been occupied since many centuries before the lake, according to them, was finally drained. Broad, semi-arid, and relatively erosion-free, the valley floor has neverthe- less far scantier alluvium than might be thought by the casual observer. Its key zone is a band of sandy or clayey alluvium near the Atoyac itself, where the water table lies less than 3 m. below the surface. In this zone the density of early farming villages equals or exceeds that of virtually any other valley in the Mesoamerican highlands. In other parts of the valley, the absence or scarcity of early sites is striking. While the valley floor, at 1500 m. above sea level, was probably once characterized by mesquite, prickly pear, and short grasses, the flanks of the surrounding hills at 1800 m. are oak woodland with many edible products of plant origin like maguey, nanche, acorns, wild onions, cactus fruits, and a variety of wild fruits for which, at present, only local names are available. Plant remains in dry caves in this area indicate that this zone was probably the most intensively used for hunting and collecting in prehistoric times. Two other zones - the pine-oak forest at 2000 m., and the hot canyons at 1400 m. - were visited, but not as intensively exploited. Although two localities with Pleistocene fauna (in- cluding mastodon) were located on survey, no "kill sites" with implements of human manufacture have yet turned up. The oldest remains recovered in stratigraphic excavations belong to the Coxcatlan phase as defined by MacNeish at Tehuacan. Those early agriculturalists hunted deer and cottontail in the mountains near Mitla, where their remains were found in the lowest levels at Cueva Blanca. Frank Hole is now studying the flints, among which are Coxcatlan, Tilapa, San Nicolas, and La Mina, and Trinidad projectile points, as well as metates, manos, choppers, scrapers, burins, scraper planes, and bifaces. A similar complex was recovered by Flannery at the Martinez rockshelter, also near Mitla. Excavations at another cave, Guila Naquitz, yielded a later complex with Almagre points and tripsacoid maize. Plant remains, which were abundant, included cucurbits, small black beans, acorns, maguey quids, prickly pear fruit, and other species. The Early Formative of the Valley of Oaxaca, which only began to come to light as survey proceeded into the high-water-table area near Guadalupe Etla, 10 km. north of Monte Alban, appears to be as rich and com- plex as any found in Mesoamerica. Deeply buried levels at the site of San Jose Mogote yielded a series of packed- clay house-floors with well-preserved post-molds and fragments of burned wattle-and-daub walls, typically showing square corners and burnished or whitewashed surfaces. The pottery from these lowest levels, tenta- tively assigned to the "San Jose phase," resembles most closely that of Chiapa de Corzo I (1100-1200 B.C.). Tecomates with zoned rocker-stamping, zoned puncta- tion, specular hematite bands at the rim, or a combina- tion of these traits, are present, as well as red-on-white bichrome bowls, polished black cylinders with "raspada" decoration and red paint rubbed into the excising, white monochromes, and white-rim black ware. Figurines are of the "El Trapiche plowed-eye" type, or resemble "Type D" from Tlatilco. Small polished hematite mirrors also are present. Higher levels in the same stratigraphic trench, tenta- tively assigned to the early Middle Formative "Guada- lupe phase," have white monochrome bowls with incised "double-line-break" patterns like Chiapa de Corzo II and a few grey wares, probably ancestral to Monte Albin I; the period may date to 900-600 B.C. Already in these levels there is evidence of construction in the form of clay platforms or terraces with stone retaining 133</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY walls, oriented slightly off true north. "Type A" figur- ines are present in this phase. At the very top of the stratigraphic trench lay a thin layer of Monte Alb'an I debris washed down from a nearby pyramidal mound. The project also recovered material from later phases of the Monte Albin sequence, since these were present in the uppermost levels of a number of dry caves. The richest of these was Level A at Guila Naquitz, which apparently dated to Monte Alban IIIb-IV (perhaps around A.D. 900). Storage pits of this phase yielded tens of thousands of plant specimens, yet to be studied, in- cluding maize, beans, squash, chili peppers, avocados, white zapotes, and cotton. Nets, baskets, string, textiles, sandal fragments, and fire drills were among the perish- able remains. One storage pit had a number of whole bean plants pulled up by the roots, harvested in pre- cisely the way in which this particular type of bean is being harvested today in the Mitla area, according to the ethnographic study by Williams. The Smithsonian project schedule was for field work until September, 1966, returning then to the United States for a period of analysis before the 1967 field season. Plans for further work include faunal studies, mapping of all edible species in certain selected vegeta- tion areas, and more intensive work on the late pre- ceramic and Early Formative phases of the valley. Also beginning in January, 1966, Michael D. Coe (Yale University) directed excavations at San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan, probably the largest "Olmec" site on the Gulf coast of Mexico, in southern Veracruz. By the time field work ended in June, it was clear that Coe had begun resolving one of the great problems of the "Olmec" florescence in the area: the chronological place- ment of the colossal sculptures. A new colossal head was found accidentally at San Lorenzo in 1965, the twelfth now known. Of the 12, 6 are from San Lorenzo. Coe - with Paula and Ray Krotser, Richard Diehl, and Francisco Beverido-found more major sculptures. These were not carelessly rolled into an arroyo, but rather had been ritually defaced and thrown down; they were found in convincing association with well-dated ceramic com- plexes, a product of the times of the Chiapa I-II, Ocos, and Ajalpan pottery phases (and of those just found by Flannery in the Valley of Oaxaca). Such an interpre- tation would place the beginning of the great period in the Gulf coast "Olmec" sites at 900-1000 B.C., with a pre-climactic occupation dating from about 1200 B.C. The climax period probably lasted several centuries after 1000 B.c., but La Venta and the other "Classic Olmec" sites were past their greatest days and influence by the time of Monte Alban I (perhaps 700-800 to 300 B.C.) and the florescence of Izapa. The 1966 developments make it possible to propose a much greater importance for the ceramic complex first identified at Chiapa de Corzo than was attributed to it at first. If Chiapa I is a local variant of a southern Mesoamerican horizon not wholly unknown even in the Valley of Mexico, then that horizon (it would be proto- "Olmec" or proto-Tenocelome, to use Jimenez Moreno's term) gave rise to several regional developments of the utmost importance. Out of it arose the Gulf Coast "Olmec" or Tenocelome, the Monte Albain tradition as seen in Monte Alban I, and the Izapa florescence that in turn appears to underlie the Peten Maya Classic. Surveys in the Yanhuitlan Valley during the sum- mer of 1966, directed by Ronald M. Spores (Vanderbilt University), showed so many sites that not all could be recorded in a single season. Many of them appear to have had relatively short occupations, although some clearly have very long sequences. Occasional sherds of Monte Alban I diagnostics, and very rare ones of II, were turned up, but after that the ceramics are notably divergent from those of the Valley of Oaxaca. Even during Monte Alban I and II there may be a preponder- ance of local products. Some major stone architecture, apparently rather early, was reported. Recent estimates from documentary sources of an almost incredibly large population for this valley would seem to be supported by the survey results as seen at this preliminary stage. (The same is true for Flannery's cave remains of late pre-Conquest times. They suggest a very large popula- tion in the Valley of Oaxaca). Isabel Kelly has returned to the archaeology of west- ern Mexico after a period of some years spent in other anthropological areas. Under the sponsorship of the Instituto Nacional de Antropologla e Historia and the Rockefeller Foundation, she spent April and May, 1966, at work in Colima. Investigation was concentrated on surface survey and small-scale testing; the aim was to check, refine, and amplify the chronological sequence proposed in her last publications on the region. She reports that she has yet to find satisfactory stratified sites but that some of the previously defined lacunae in the sequence have been reduced. Further, preliminary examination of the materials recovered suggests that the full study of them now under way may make possible the identification of two additional phases at the early end of the existing sequence, as well as subdivision of the already recognized horizons. Publication of the original work in Colima was postponed because of the incom- pleteness of the material. Now, with some radiocarbon dates for which she has samples and with the added survey and excavation collections, that difficulty has apparently been overcome even though Kelly warns that there will be as many questions as answers in her report. The Mission Archeologique et Ethnologique Fran- qaise au Mexique, founded in 1961, and directed by Guy Stresser-Pean, has been at work since its founda- tion in the Huasteca. Studies include geological, geo- graphic, botanical, zoological, ethnographic, and archaeo- logical research. Three years were spent at Tamtok, a monumental Postclassic site near Tamuln; a full site report is in preparation. In 1965 and 1966 the Mission has worked at Vista Hermosa, another Postclassic Huas- tec site near Nuevo Morelos, Tamaulipas. Numerous burials were studied, providing ample material on fu- 134 [ VOL. 32, No. 1, 1967</page><page sequence="7">CURRENT RESEARCH nerary practices. Also studied was a large amount of pottery. In and around the Huasteca Potosina, other sites have been surveyed. Chilijutub, which has notable re- semblances to Tamtok, was mapped. Salvage work was carried out at Platanitos, near Ciudad Valles, producing further Postclassic remains. West of the Huasteca, in the semi-arid part of San Luis Potosi, Jean LeSage visited a number of early sites during 1965 and found remains of hunting-and-gathering cultures. In 1966, he exca- vated two rockshelters and a burial in an open site called Cerro de Silva, southwest of the city of San Luis Potosi. At the request of the Instituto Nacional de Antro- pologia e Historia, a group from the University of the Americas, directed by Evelyn Rattray, carried out a salvage project during late 1965 and early 1966. They worked at Pueblo Perdido, a site in a new subdivision at Satellite City on the northwest edge of Mexico City. This area, in the municipio of San Bartolo Naucalpan, State of Mexico, is on the western shore of the former Lake Texcoco. The site was discovered when construc- tion of a project called Bulevares was begun. The first excavations were confined to the northeastern part of the site, where construction workers had already removed what they reported as over 20 burials and had damaged seriously the buildings in the area. There were no large artificial mounds; however, there were abundant remains of stucco-floored houses. The dam- age to these by the construction crews made it impossi- ble to determine whether they had been a group of about 15 small houses or a single palace. Ceramics ob- tained from four stratigraphic pits and six burials indi- cate continuous occupation from Teotihuacan II through IV. Many of the more elaborate ceramic types of late Teotihuacan III (Xolalpan), however, are lacking. Fig- urines show the same sequence. Without exception the burials excavated are of the Teotihuacan IV (Metepec) phase, as was also most of the pottery excavated and collected on the surface. It was concluded that the major occupation was of this period. One burial offering in- cluded an item of outstanding interest: a light-brown polished hemispherical ring-stand bowl with the Calli (house) glyph incised on the inside bottom after firing. Although temples are shown very frequently in Teoti- huacan paintings and at times on pottery, the front elevation is invariably depicted. In this case the small temple, on a pyramid, is shown in profile in exactly the way that later was the norm in the codices. To the southwest, on the highest point of the site, more extensive excavations were carried out. Both archi- tecture and ceramics indicated that this area was unre- lated to the Teotihuacan part of the site, suggesting abandonment by the Teotihuacan people and later re- occupation by the people who made Coyotlatelco pot- tery. Excavations in the Coyotlatelco part of the site have uncovered stucco floors and walls of a multi- roomed palace structure with complicated drainage sys- tem, stone-lined firepits, and a stuccoed reservoir. The artifacts recovered under the floors are similar to those found by Rattray at Cerro Tenayo, Tenayuca, and re- ported here recently. They include grey obsidian pro- jectile points, bone awls, manos, stone polishers, scrapers, and axes. The pottery is predominantly of the Coyotla- telco complex, mixed with a very few (15 up to time of reporting) sherds of the earlier Teotihuacan occupation and a larger proportion of still earlier Preclassic sherds. Work was continuing in July, 1966, on four house lots of the Bulevares subdivision, where streets and drainage system were already installed. Fifteen test pits, the majority through intact stucco floors, had been made there, and there was still a possibility that the limits of the palace structure might be defined. The site extends beyond the construction area onto ejido lands of Santa Cruz Acatlan, where further pits have produced con- centrated deposits of Coyotlatelco ceramics, figurines, obsidian, and charcoal, as well as more stucco floors. JOHN PADDOCK EASTERN MESOAMERICA WESTERN CHIAPAS. A jointly sponsored salvage project has been completed in the Mal Paso (Netzahualcoyotl) Dam basin by the Mexican Instituto Nacional de Antro- pologia e Historia and the BYU-New World Archaeo- logical Foundation. Closing of the Netzahualcoyotl dam in June, 1966, has flooded approximately 25 mi. of the Middle Griyalva river region and about 20 mi. of the lower Rio La Venta as it joins the Grijalva. In late 1965 a surface survey was made by the BYU-NWAF of over 100 sites found within the future lake area, between 90 and 190 m. above sea level. The area is hilly with little level land, and almost all flat alluvial terraces now either planted to cacao or in wilderness proved to have had pre-Hispanic occupation. Under the general supervision of Carlos Navarrete for the INAH, excavations of varying intensity were made during 1966 at 20 of the typically small Mal Paso mound sites, utilizing staff of both participating institu- tions, student archaeologists from the Escuela Nacional, and labor supplied by the Comision de Electricidad. A satisfactory cross section of the cultural history of this previously unstudied region was secured. More extensive investigations were undertaken at the larger ceremonial complexes of San Antonio and Banco Nieves on the Rio La Venta and at the major San Isidro ceremonial center on the Grijalva. Detailed topographic maps were prepared of all investigated sites by Eduardo Martinez E., with a preliminary report prepared for early release. The principal occupation periods seem to have been the Late Preclassic and the Late Classic, though there is a widespread Early Preclassic occupation also. The occu- pational pattern and ceramic types show close links both with the Central Depression of Chiapas and south- ern Veracruz and Tabasco on the Gulf Coast; there seems to be little doubt now that the region served as a corridor between these two areas, with traffic moving away from the rivers before they enter their respective 135</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY canyons which physically separate the dry interior val- leys. Architectural investigations by Eduardo Pareyon of the INAH at Banco Nieves midway in the Rio La Venta basin revealed well-developed stone masonry during the Late Classic, accompanied by occasional sub-floor slab- covered burial chambers on the mound summits. This pattern is repeated at several sites, particularly at San Antonio near the upper extremity of the Rio La Venta arm of the reservoir. Excavations by Pierre Agrinier of the BYU-NWAF staff at San Antonio made the out- standing discovery of a temescal or sweat bath directly associated with a ball court. Not only is this combina- tion unique, but the sweat room is the largest ever recorded in Mesoamerica, measuring about 10 by 3 m.; the benches lining the walls could easily accommodate a group of 30 persons, or all of the players expected to participate in the ball game adjacent. Remains of a large charred log were found in the hearth area, and piles of burned jar sherds seem to have been used for generating steam. The sweat room underwent three reconstructions, finally eliminating entirely its original antechamber. San Isidro, the most important and by far the largest site discovered in the Mal Paso basin, occupied an ex- ceptionally large level area over a kilometer square a few miles downstream from Quechula but on the left bank of the Grijalva River. It includes four pyramidal mounds, two rectangular courts, and eight platform complexes ranging from simple to complex substructures of huge dimensions. Also mapped and tested were an extensive residential zone and a terraced hill slope cul- minating in a late stone-faced platform overlooking the entire valley. The site proved to have had a long occu- pation, with 3 m. of undisturbed refuse found at various points distant from the river. The central zone is every- where underlaid by debris of the Early Preclassic era corresponding to or slightly preceding the Cotorra (Chiapa I) phase of central Chiapas. Deep trenching by Gareth W. Lowe, BYU-NWAF field director, en- countered a series of stone chisel or axe offerings laid out much in the La Venta Olmec manner, both with and without associated human interments. These offer- ings, intrusive into the underlying refuse zone, followed an axis extending westward beneath one of the major pyramids and an unknown distance beyond the center of the plaza 25 m. to the east. The rising waters of the reservoir prevented recovery of more extensive data respecting this intriguing Olmecoid intrusion into the apparently only slightly earlier refuse zone. These two early complexes appear to center on about the 1000 B.C. horizon and to correlate rather well with a generally parallel situation excavated this year by M. Coe at the not-far-distant Olmec site of San Lorenzo on the Rio Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz. Crossties of the lowermost complex with the earlier Chiapas and Guatemala Pacific Coast phases are also apparent and a derivation from an Oc6s-like culture is postulated. Overlying the zone of axe offerings at San Isidro was a series of later Preclassic caches and burials, outstand- ingly exemplified by urn burials of infants or children, a trait noted within or surrounding all major pyramidal structures, with over a score being recovered by the limited excavations. Additionally, sub-floor platform offerings dating to about the beginning of our era appear to have originally contained hundreds of vessels, many of them of the coarse bowl type intended exclu- sively for offertories; there was never sufficient time to follow these giant offerings to their extremities. Structure 4, the largest of the San Isidro pyramids, was deeply trenched by Thomas A. Lee of the BYU- NWAF staff, and a steady succession of burials and offerings was uncovered. The complicated and much disturbed architectural remains evidence an apparently unbroken occupation extending back from the end of the Late Classic on the surface, through the Early Classic, and into the Late Preclassic approximately halfway through the pyramid. Work here also was stopped due to the closing of the dam; consequently, the earlier phases of the construction never will be known. Platform floors and walls were of clay, fre- quently highly polished and fired and having inset stair- ways. The practice of intruding urn burials through these platform surfaces greatly destroyed uncovered por- tions of the architecture, but the associated pottery will permit an outstanding ceramic correlation. Relation- ships seem strong with the Central Depression of Chia- pas throughout. On the Preclassic level it is already obvious that San Isidro was, by 400 B.C., one of the several really impor- tant ceremonial centers in southern Chiapas, ranking with Chiapa de Corzo, Mirador, and Izapa in importance and culturally closer to the foregoing sites, as might be expected. Stone sculpture is uncommon and poorly de- veloped and both clay figurines and clay stamps are extremely rare in contradistinction to most other Pre- classic centers so far investigated. Relationships with the Olmec sites in Tabasco and southeastern Veracruz will be clarified by pending studies. At present it can only be said that, although the Olmec art style was not found in the limited excavations, pottery ties and the axe-offering custom leave little question about contempo- rary close contact. The situation seems to support the idea of Olmec art being a cultist manifestation not accepted by all neighbors of La Venta. San Isidro in its final occupation, toward the close of the Late Classic era, was a formal complex laid out around large rectangular raised courts on the north and south sides of a central plaza. The northern structure was a simple rectangular enclosure measuring 80 by 60 m. with a single floor-level entrance on the east toward the river. The embankments or surrounding platform walls were 6 m. high; only the south or plaza side was investigated, uncovering a steep cut-stone inset stairway with narrow balustrades. The complicated rectangular enclosure on the south side of the central San Isidro plaza was investigated by 136 [ VOL. 32, No. 1, 1967</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT RESEARCH Eduardo Matos of the INAH staff. His work proved beyond question that the structure was a double-alley I-shaped ball court with inter-connected end zones. Though much of the ball court construction was in disrepair due to slumpage over silt fill, some sections of excellent masonry were found intact. Both interior and exterior stairways as well as sloping playing walls and an end-zone drain were uncovered. Except for a triple court identified at Tikal this is the only multiple ball court known, and it differs from the Tikal instance in being entirely enclosed. Numerous slab-covered Late Classic burial chambers were explored by Matos and others at San Isidro. These explorations produced a few outstanding carved jades and a quantity of pottery and alabaster vessels which show clear relationships to both Gulf Coast and central Chiapas cultures. The Mal Paso material is being processed and studied in the Departamento de Prehistoria laboratories in Mexico City for prompt publication by the participating institutions. EASTERN CHIAPAS. In February, 1966, the Milwaukee Public Museum conducted a brief reconnaissance in the archaeological zone east of Comitan, Chiapas, with the threefold purpose of making an aerial, terrestrial, and underwater survey of the Lake Montebello area. Stephan F. de Borhegyi, director of the museum, was assisted by Gertrude Duby de Blom and the museum's research associates in underwater archaeology, Lon Mericle and Charles Stanley. The archaeological zone is dominated by the ruins of Chinkultic, a magnificent and extensive archaeological site which was first described by Edward Seler, who reported two carved limestone stelae, some burials, and an effigy of a plumbate jar with a dog or jaguar head. In 1925 Franz Blom and Oliver La Farge made a sketch map of the acropolis area of Chinkultic and illustrated and described six additional stelae in situ, some of which were erected over underground chambers, lined with large stone blocks. Blom returned to the site in 1928 and found three additional Classic- period stelae. Noted during the flying visit of the Mil- waukee Public Museum group were about 200 scattered large and small mounds at Chinkultic proper, cluster- ing around six main centers. Four of the principal groups were mapped by the Milwaukee party, including group "C" which has a large I-shaped enclosed ballcourt (54 m. long, 25 m. wide, with a playing alley 30 m. long and 15 m. wide) with three standing carved stone stelae on its northeast wall. The bush was cleared, and aerial as well as land photos were taken of the entire zone. Meanwhile, the beautiful Agua Azul cenote, first discovered by Blom in 1928, deep below the towering Temple I and the sheer vertical cliffs of group A, as well as Lakes Tepancuapan, Chanujabab, and Yalmuz were tested by the divers for the presence of underwater offerings. While none was found due to the silty con- ditions of the lake bottoms, Borhegyi believes that a strong probability still exists that eventually such finds will be located in some of the lakes (there are about 30 in the area). The surface pottery collections made by the Milwaukee Public Museum are indicative of a long occupation of Chinkultic from Late Preclassic through Postclassic times. The most dense pre-Columbian occu- pation of Chinkultic, however, must have been during the Late Classic period. The few figurine fragments noted at Chinkultic were all of Late Classic date. The Classic period coarse-ware jar and bowl fragments found at the site seem to tie in with the Lowland Maya tradi- tion, while the incense-burner types found on the sur- face are suggestive of strong ties with the highlands of Chiapas and western Guatemala. Among the numerous and elaborately decorated censer fragments, there are some Classic period pieces with vertical side flanges and applique effigies featuring birds, jaguars, serpents, etc.; there are also some Late Preclassic three-pronged examples with solid, plain prongs and deeply scored censer covers. Late Classic burial urn fragments were observed in an area dotted with caves and crevices and situated on the west banks of Lake Tepancuapan. In the same area, called Huxjal, Blom discovered a cave in 1928 which was filled with pottery fragments, human bones, and artificially deformed skulls. A more detailed report on Chinkultic, to be accompanied by sketch maps, is being prepared by Borhegyi for publication in Estudios de Cultura Maya. Future underwater work at the site is planned by the museum for the year 1968. TIKAL. The final period of investigation at Tikal, Guatemala, directed by William Coe, was terminated in 1966. Due to heavy field work during the summer, the summary of Tikal research is being postponed for the July issue. An intensified program of restoration under the direction of Alfred Kidder has been begun at Tikal by the University of Pennsylvania Museum in cooperation with the Guatemalan government's national park project. SEIBAL. The Peabody Museum, Harvard University, has submitted a detailed report of the third field season of its Seibal project in the Department of Peten, Guate- mala, which ran through February, March, and April, 1966. The staff consisted of Gordon R. Willey, director; A. Ledyard Smith, field director; four graduate students, G. Tourtellot, J. Sabloff, M. Leone, and R. Schuyler; and Jose Antonio Oliveras, artist from Guatemala. Ian Graham returned to camp from England for a short stay to add a few details to his map of the main group. Also, John Graham, of the University of California, and E. R. Littmann spent about a week at Seibal; the former was continuing his study of carved monuments, and the latter was collecting plaster samples of floors for analy- sis. Tourtellot continued his survey of the site beyond the limits of the three main groups and, with the aid of Schuyler, investigated a number of groupings of probable house mound structures. Willey and Sabloff continued their study of the ceramics and other arti- facts. Smith supervised the restoration of a small tem- ple mound, Structure A-3, and with Leone carried on excavations in Groups A, C, and D. 137</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY A full season of investigations in small structures involved seven different groups; 27 individual struc- tures were examined, of which 22 were partially exca- vated. Generally speaking, these groups were of two types: a 3-mound plazuela with the patio opening on the east, and a 4-mound plazuela without opening. The most common house type is a simple room-dwelling with a continuous bench along the back and side walls. The excavations yielded a large inventory of artifacts and ceramic samples, plus six burials. The examination of these finds indicates that all of the structures in the groups so far excavated were built more or less con- temporaneously during the latter part of the Late Classic period. However, the great quantities of Preclassic material in the lower level of the fill in these structures and below patio floors, even in the absence of definite stone architectural remains, point toward previous occu- pation of the same sites. The ceramic evidence here corroborates the paucity of remains in the three main ceremonial groups during Protoclassic to early Late Classic times. A major project was the restoration of the small temple mound, Structure A-3. This 3-terrace pyramid supporting a 3-room temple has been described in the January, 1966, issue of this journal. By the end of the 1966 season all restoration had been completed with the exception of the medial moulding on the north side, the installing of the sapote beams, and the construction of the vault. This work will be finished in 1967, at which time it is planned to mend and reset the four stelae, one on each of the four sides at the foot of the pyramid, as well as the stela in the center room of the temple on top. Excavation in the ceremonial area at Seibal consisted of test pits in Groups A, C, and D, and excavation in seven constructions: Structures C-4, D-12, D-29, D-30, D-32, 79 (at the south end of Causeway II), and the platform at the juncture of Causeways I, II, and III. During these excavations five burials were uncovered; one burial was from the Late Preclassic period, one from the Late Preclassic or Early Classic, one from the Early Classic, and one from the late Late Classic. All were simple burials with very little or no furniture. There is little doubt that Structure C-4 supported a house of perishable materials and that it may well have had two rooms, a front room on the lower level and a back room on the upper level with benches on three sides. At the north end of the main platform of Struc- ture C-4, a small inset stairway leads down to a low platform which may well have been a kitchen; a mano and metate were found, and in its center is a stone- lined pit which was full of utilitarian sherds. Pottery from Structure C-4 and the possible kitchen place them both in the latter part of the Late Classic period. A 2-m. trench cut through Structure D-30 from south to north exposed five superimposed inner plat- forms, several of which were painted red. The two latest superimpositions are of the Bayal Boca phase, latter part of the Late Classic period without fine paste sherds. The next is probably earlier in the Late Classic, and the bottom two may possibly date from Cantutse Chicanel (Late Preclassic). Structure D-32, the principal temple-pyramid in D Group, rises about 15 m. above the floor of the Central Plaza. It is the largest of a group of three temple mounds resting on a platform on the east side of the Central Plaza. All three mounds have stairways rising from the platform upon which they rest. About halfway up Structure D-32 there is a wide terrace which divides its stairway into two levels, and only the upper part of the pyramid was investigated. All that remained of any construction was a series of disintegrated floors at various levels. Apparently any building these floors were asso- ciated with must have been of perishable materials, possibly rising from low stone walls. On the west or front side there were three superimposed stairways indi- cating at least three architectural periods. Only the north half of these stairways was excavated. At the base of the latest stairway and centered on it was a square stone box; traces of charcoal in the box suggest it was used to burn offerings. The third, or innermost stairway, had been painted red, but only the seven bottom steps remained, the upper part having been ripped out for construction of the second stairway. Flanking the bottom five steps on the north side of the third stairway of D-32 was a sloping wall 2 m. high and 3.5 m. wide. This wall supported a large mask, a grotesque anthropomorphic face, built up of stone and mortar and covered with plaster. Against the north face of the sloping wall supporting the mask is a narrow stairway of six steps which is purely ornamental. A similar arrangement of sloping wall, mask, and steps should surely exist south of the stairway. With the ex- ception of some sherds from the core of the pyramid, the pottery recovered from Structure D-32 was from Bayal Boca times, without fine-paste sherds. Structure 79, located at the southern extremity of Causeway II, provided one of the most interesting exca- vations of the season. It lies to the east of what has been called the Jaguar Altar, a large, roughly circular stone, 2 m. in diameter, with a jaguar head protruding from one edge. The altar was supported by three stone legs, one plain and two carved to represent crouching figures. Excavation of Structure 79 proved it to be a round construction 18 m. in diameter and 3 m. high rising in three terraces and supporting a low rectangular platform. The main stairway was on its west side and centered on the Jaguar Altar. At the base of the center of the stairway was a small stone box filled with sherds and charcoal; as in the case of the box found at the late stairway in Structure D-32, this was probably used to burn offerings. On the back of Structure 79 there is evidence of three small stairways leading up from ground level to the top of each terrace. These stairways, only 50 cm. wide, are placed so that one stairwall is against the terrace. Where the stairways occur, the terrace walls overlap by 50 cm. so the steps can rise to the next terrace, forming a spiral of the terraces. A pit in the 138 [ VOL. 32, No. 1, 1967</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT RESEARCH center of the platform, 4.6 m. deep, revealed three inner floors. The sherds from the top 1.5 m., above the first floor, date Structure 79 as having been built in Bayal Boca times, the latter part of the Late Classic period. Below the top inner floor there were no sherds later than Contutse Chicanel, indicating possible earlier construc- tion in Late Preclassic times- further excavation should determine this. The platform at the juncture of Causeways I, II, and III supported two smaller rectangular platforms placed along its west side. Stelae 14 and 15 were set in these two platforms. The butt of Stela 15 was still in place in the southernmost platform and faced west. It is almost certain that Stela 14 also faced west. These two stelae, among the latest at the site, and the pottery found with the platform, place it in the latter part of the Late Classic period. The second season of ceramic analysis at Seibal was concerned with both the description of types and the classification of new material. During the first month, all of the existing collections were re-examined. New types and varieties were established and some old ones discarded. Preliminary descriptive statements about all Preclassic and some Classic types and varieties were written. Photographs of whole vessels and type sherds were made, and artistic illustration was begun. A preliminary ceramic sequence for Seibal was estab- lished, and various ceramic complexes were named according to the rules outlined recently at the Conference on the Ceramics of the Lowland Maya held in Guate- mala City. The Seibal sequence is based on a combina- tion of stratigraphy, associations, and broad intersite comparisons. The general outline of the sequence, how- ever, was based on the ceramic stratigraphy found in the test pits around Structure A-3 in the South Plaza of A Group and pits in Structure A-2. These data are supple- mented by the stratigraphy in Structures D-30 and D-32 in D Group. Activity during the second and third months focused on classification of recently excavated sherd lots. One of the most interesting results of over 59 test pits and 17 architectural excavations at Seibal during the past two field seasons has been the emergence of the proba- bility of a differential intrasite distribution of the various ceramic complexes. The changing intrasite distribution through time may have important implications for under- standing the history of Seibal in relation to foreign influ- ences, and it may aid in understanding the culture of the group or groups that occupied Seibal from 800 B.C. to A.D. 900. A brief example of how intrasite distribution data can be used in interpreting a site's history is pre- sented below. It should be emphasized that other inter- pretations are possible and that work during the 1967 season may strengthen some parts of the interpretation while invalidating others. It should also be noted that most of the ceramic material which has been uncovered in test excavations comes from deposits which were probably used as architectural fill. Very few deposits have been discovered so far which are definitely of an occupational or refuse nature. It is a reasonable assump- tion, however, that architectural fill between building floors or plaza floors would come from nearby sources. It would also seem reasonable to make the further assumption that the distributions of ceramics from fills should generally approximate occupational (or perhaps in the case of the ceremonial center, usage) distribu- tions. These assumptions are bolstered by the observa- tion that there are consistent trends in both the geo- graphical distribution of the various ceramic complexes and of the quantity of sherds belonging to them. These trends form the basis of the following hypotheses. Looking at the graphic distribution of complexes on the map of Seibal, one can see definite distributional trends. Briefly, Real Xe (early Middle Preclassic) is found in greatest concentration in the South and Central Plazas of A Group and in the area near the Jaguar Altar at the south end of Causeway II. Escoba Mamom (Mid- dle Preclassic) has a similar but somewhat wider distri- bution and is found in all of A Group, nearby small structures, part of C Group, and the area near the Jaguar Altar. Cantutse Chicanel (Late Preclassic) has an even wider distribution and is found almost all over the site. Late Cantutse Protoclassic material (especially Usulutan sherds and related types) has a very restricted distribution which is concentrated in the northeast cor- ner of D Group. Junco Tzakol (Early Classic) is found in the same area as well as in the South Plaza of A Group. Tepejilote Tepeu (early Late Classic) is concen- trated in D Group and in part of C Group, while Bayal Boca (late Late Classic) without fine paste sherds is also found all over D Group. Finally, the full Bayal Boca complex (including fine-paste sherds) is found in A Group, C Group, and a plaza at the end of Causeway III in D Group, as well as in all the small units tested so far. In other words, there seems to have been a general intrasite expansion in Preclassic times until the terminal part of this period. Then there was a great contraction which is reflected in the very limited distribution of late Late Preclassic and Protoclassic material. The Classic period at Seibal was one of slow expansion which climaxes in Late Bayal times. During the latter phases, much of the present site of Seibal was occupied. The quantitative trends (based on sherd counts) for each complex fit quite well with the distributional trends, as would be expected. The same can be said for the tree- fall collections in the areas surrounding the center of Seibal. They show large Preclassic and Bayal Boca con- centrations and little else. GUATEMALA HIGHLANDS. R. E. W. Adams (University of Minnesota) was assisted by R. J. Nash (University of Alberta) in the 1966 season of work on the ceramic chronology of the Southern Maya. Field activities con- centrated on two sites, Chajcar near Coban in the Alta Verapaz, and Tzicuay in the Cotzal Valley of Northern Quiche. Both rain and difficulty in procuring labor 139</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY hampered the work, but satisfactory samples of pottery were obtained from each site. During May, Adams and Nash worked on the excavated material and completed description of types and analysis of all collections. Com- parative work was also done on collections in Guate- mala City. An unexpected and rich collection of ma- terial from northern Quiche was recently acquired by the Milwaukee Public Museum whose director, Stephan Borhegyi, generously placed it at the disposal of Adams for study purposes. The collection, which includes about 165 items, most from one grave lot, has been recorded, and information concerning it will likely be published as a separate unit. The project's two major objectives have been the establishment of a regional ceramic chronology and the detection and definition of Maya Highland-Lowland re- lationships, especially on a Preclassic level. Due to the apparent lack of a Preclassic in the Cotzal Valley (a conclusion based on last season's work), Adams decided to try the Alta Verapaz region. Chajcar was selected and excavated with the result that two sequent complexes were defined, but there was no Preclassic. Returning to the Cotzal Valley and the site of Tzicuay where the earliest material had been found (Protoclassic), 10 addi- tional test pits were excavated in residential localities around the ceremonial center. Again, the result was that, although a complete and continuous ceramic se- quence from Protoclassic to Conquest period was more clearly defined and confirmed, no earlier remains were found. Based on this sequence derived from four Cotzal sites, the investigators conclude that there is no Pre- classic in the Cotzal-Chipal River junction region. In surface collections from Nebaj, from sites between Nebaj and Tzicuay, and in the Milwaukee collections from around Chajul and Ilom, there also seems to be nothing earlier than Protoclassic pottery. The sample is much smaller from the Alta Verapaz, but the very large Diesel- dorf collection, which mostly derives from the region, lacks any vessel which can surely be dated as Preclassic. Likewise, the surface collections from the many sites in the region lack certain Preclassic pottery. Although it is much more difficult to prove a negative conclusion than a positive one, Adams feels that there is probably at most a feebly developed Preclassic in the northern high- lands, and that in some regions, such as the Cotzal Valley, there was no occupation by ceramic procedures before the Protoclassic period. There is also, therefore, no evidence at all for Highland-Lowland contact through these northern regions in Preclassic times. During the Classic period, there is definite contact, but it seems to be strictly on the basis of trade of luxury ceramic pieces. The domestic and therefore residentially manu- factured types are quite within the trends and traditions of adjacent highland sequences. Considering that the southern highlands were occupied earlier, it seems likely that the highlands were settled and colonized from south to north. The lack of a north highland Preclassic also seems to negate any reasonable derivation of Maya low- land population from it, and it seems that the earliest Peten colonists must derive from adjacent lowlands. According to Adams, the Motagua Valley is the last geographically feasible (though tortuous) route from the seat of the elaborate southern highland Preclassic cultures to the Peten. Unfortunately, little is known about the valley's prehistory, especially on the Preclassic level. What little work has been done and the private collections derived from it do not indicate a strong Pre- classic development. If this is so, and it is risky to put too much weight on this, then one may conclude that Maya lowland and highland Preclassic developments were essentially independent of each other. In any case, it seems quite likely that the earliest Peten popu- lations were derived from the adjacent Gulf Coast low- lands. Considering the temporal priority of the Pacific Coast of Guatemala and the adjacency of it to the south highland Preclassic loci, it is also indicated that the south highland Preclassic derives ultimately from the Pacific Coast. These inferences fit very well with the lexico-statistical data of Swadesh, especially as used and integrated by Warren, into his Hypothetical Construction of Mayan Origins (1964, Actas del 35a Congreso Inter- nacional de Americanistas). A major implication of the Early Classic and Proto- classic occupation of the entire Maya highlands, as de- fined by the current project, seems to be that of popula- tion growth. Since this is the beginning of the period of maximum cultural elaboration, the phenomenon also has implications for culture process. More data on ancient settlement patterns, land use, and demography were collected this year. In the Cotzal Valley there was apparently a peak population just prior to the conquest with complete depopulation occurring after the conquest. The valley remained essentially unoccupied for about 330 years until the coming of the European coffee planters in the 1870's. BRITISH HONDURAS. The unusually heavy and constant rains prevalent throughout the Maya area during most of the 1966 "dry season" were particularly detrimental to investigations in British Honduras, reports the archaeo- logical commissioner, A. H. Anderson, whose own un- timely illness combined with the unseasonal weather to reduce activity this year. At Altun Ha, according to David M. Pendergast, field director, the Royal Ontario Museum-British Honduras Expedition managed to con- tinue excavation of several structures both in the site center and in some outlying mounds. Investigations in the area of the last tomb discovered in 1965 produced the additional burial of a youth accompanied by an unusual range of objects, many suggesting toys and pocketpieces. Notable among the artifacts were three bone human figurines, the largest approximately 13 cm. high. Elsewhere in the site center, work continued on Structure B-4, the tallest of the six major structures, which had yielded five tombs in 1965. The 1966 exca- vations produced an additional tomb which contained, among a wide range of jade and other objects, an oblong jade plaque weighing 1 lb. 5 oz., having the obverse [ VOL. 32, No. 1, 1967 140</page><page sequence="13">CURRENT RESEARCH elaborately carved with a seated figure and a series of faces, and the reverse bearing a 20-glyph text. The glyphs appear to include two dates, tentatively rendered as late sixth century. Remains of three and possibly four codices, all highly fragmented, have been found by the expedition to date. In outlying areas of Altun Ha, excavations recovered additional indications of trade relationships with Copan as part of a long and full series of ceramic data which includes approximately 80 whole vessels. A wide range of Early Classic sherd material was recovered, and, also, at the other end of the time scale, clear evidence of a Postclassic occupation, dating to the 13th and 14th cen- turies and related to Tulum and other Quintana Roo sites. GARETH W. LOWE CARIBBEAN During April and May, 1966, the Bullens made a series of stratigraphic excavations in Trinidad, Barbados, and St. Lucia for the Florida State Museum. Field work, done in collaboration with the Barbados Museum and Historical Society and the St. Lucia Archaeological and Historical Society, was sponsored by the Center for Latin-American Studies at the University of Florida. Emphasis was placed upon archaeological Carib which they were able to isolate on Barbados. There they also found crosshatched-incised and white-on-red pottery relating, apparently, to a middle phase of the Caribbean Saladoidian period. So far this is the earliest pottery known for Barbados. They also visited the famous Lovers Retreat site on Tobago where Bushnell and, later, Gilchrist found Carib pottery on top of Erin and Palo Saco pottery. In St. Lucia they identified the site of the first (1605) English settlement in the Caribbean, based on the geographical relationship of this site to a Carib site mentioned in the original accounts. In June an informal conference of anthropologists met at the New World Museum on San Salvador in the Bahamas. Discussions centered around typology and terminological problems, the archaeology of that island and of Jamaica, Carib archaeology, and the chronology of Puerto Rico. Those present at the conference, which was sponsored by the Center for Latin-American Studies at the University of Florida, included Ruth G. Wolper, Director of the New World Museum; Charles A. Hoff- man, Jr., of Florida Atlantic University, who organized the meeting; Adelaide K. and Ripley P. Bullen of the Florida State Museum; William C. Haag, of Louisiana State University; Fred Olsen, of Antigua; Irving Rouse, of Yale University; Ronald Vanderwal, of the Institute of Jamaica; and Elizabeth S. Wing, of the Florida State Museum. In June, William H. Sears made a site survey of Cat Island in the Bahamas, at which time he recorded several sites. RIPLEY P. BULLEN CENTRAL AMERICA Archaeological investigations in Central America have not been very intensive during 1965 when compared with the peak of activity in the region during the late 1950's and early 1960's. Foreign field parties were rare in 1965; therefore, most excavations and investigations have been made by locally based groups. EL SALVADOR. Stanley Boggs is preparing reports on his earlier excavations, especially at Tazumal and Cihuatan. He is also preparing a site catalogue for El Salvador. Robert Sharer (a graduate student, University of Pennsylvania) is currently in San Salvador to study the sherd material excavated by William R. Coe in 1954. In El Salvador the export of such material, even on a loan basis, is not permitted. NICARAGUA. A study of the Ometepe material gathered in 1962-63 by Peter J. Schmidt and Wolfgang Haber- land (Museum fur Volkerkunde) has allowed them to establish a new phase, named El Gato, which covers the transition between the Early and Middle Polychrome periods. At least parts of the Los Angeles Cemetery belong to this phase, which is characterized by a Tola Trichrome-derived ceramic type as well as by true polychromes related to the Papagayo type. One impor- tant vessel shape consists of an olla-like body with a high shoulder and a conical neck. This shape is repre- sented in most types of the phase. The El Gato phase shows that transition between the periods was a gradual one and that the new, possibly imported or foreign- derived polychromes did not replace the older traditions of bichromes and trichromes at once. These latter tra- ditions faded away gradually after being applied to new shapes. This fits well with the transition of burial cus- toms as reported from this region and may solve some of the puzzling questions raised in connection with it. COSTA RICA. In a recent number (19) of the Boletin de la Asociacion de Amigos del Museo, Maria E. Bozzoli de Wille gave some more information on the archaeo- logical sites of Play6n de Aguirre and San Antonio de Damas in the valley of the Rio Parrita, situated on the Pacific slope south-southwest of the capital. On low hills above the flood plain of the river, stone circles are found whose interiors are covered by small stones. Exca- vations in them revealed only sterile soil down to a depth of 1.50 m. Archaeological objects (broken me- tates, manos, celts, and a few potsherds) are only found among the stones of the surface. Because of the scarcity of material, Wille doubts that these circles could have been house foundations. No other explanation, however, seems to be possible, at least for the time being. Special trash dumps, erosion of the surface soil, or a very short occupation may account for the scarcity of objects. The sherds recovered are all rather crude and reddish-brown in color. The ornamentation through incising and applique is unfortunately not illustrated. The exception is a tall tripod which was allegedly found in an other- wise unreported grave together with two similar vessels and three glass beads. If this association is correct, these 141</page><page sequence="14">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY sites, as well as similar ones in the region, were occupied at the time of the Conquest, or shortly afterwards. The same article also gives some dates on the com- pletely looted cemetery "Panteon de la Reina" in the Valle del General. Other investigations in Costa Rica have been con- ducted by William Kennedy under the auspices of the Middle American Research Institute, Tulane University. After some reconnaissance, he made excavations in the Reventazon Valley connecting the Central Highland with the Atlantic coast. PANAMA. The main activities in this country have been in Chiriqui. The formation of the Sociedad Chiri- cana de Antropologia at David was noted earlier in Current Research. In the meantime, this group began to issue a small mimeographed periodical called "Boletin del Museo Chiricano" under the editorship of Roberto de la Guardia. The second number brings to light inter- esting and important accounts on some sites of Chiriqui. From them as well as from other communications, the following investigations can be reported: Roberto de la Guardia and Marco Guerra opened a new grave at Solano, the type site of the Concepcion phase. Of regular construction it contained 5 metates with manos, at least 12 pottery vessels, and a crude human pottery figurine which might have been used as a pestle. Pottery vessels and metates are well within the range of types and varieties associated with the Con- cepcion phase, confirming anew the separation of this group as a special phase. Efendi Friedmann and Maximo Miranda were in charge of the excavation of an unknown number of graves at the site of Guarico, near Caldera, District of Boquete. The shape of the graves has not been reported, but there seem to be indications of a short shaft, possibly semi-circular. Three metates with manos, 2 celts, 2 stone points, and 12 pottery vessels were recovered from these graves. The bulk of the ceramics belongs, without doubt, to types of the Aguas Buenas phase, while some others are Concepcion types. This mixture is consistent with the results from various habitation sites of the Aguas Buenas phase excavated and sampled by Haber- land. They always contain a small percentage of Con- cepcion types, especially the tall chimney-like vessels with solid straight feet. An important piece is a vase- like vessel which, at least in its shape, reminds one of the "flower vases" from Guacamayo. This confirms some of Haberland's ideas about connections between the early phases of Chiriqui and Cocle proposed earlier. These excavations at Guarico are important because they are the first graves reported on for the Aguas Buenas phase. Of even more importance are the finds of Dan Sander in the highland of Chiriqui, which have not yet been described. While these investigations confirmed phases already established, a third group of excavations by various members of the Sociedad Chiricano brought something to light which might turn out to be an entirely new phase. These excavations were conducted at different times at Dolega. They yielded a number of middle- sized to large urns (up to 60 cm. when encountered unbroken) at depths between 1 and 2 ft. under three layers of river stones, the uppermost at the surface. These layers were either circular or rectangular. The urns themselves have an elongated round body, a rela- tively tall neck, and an outcurving lip, and are painted reddish-brown. The only ornaments are knob-like han- dles, sometimes elaborated to a human face. The lids seem to be formed by a deep bowl with a low annular base. Most urns were accompanied by one or more smaller vessels, some showing the same shape as the urns and also covered by a lid. De la Guardia con- siders tripods with feet in the shape of human figures as especially characteristic. Other finds include three- legged metates and beads of stone and resin. This group of urns, the first thoroughly reported from Chiriqui, poses some important questions, most of them centering on the chronological position. De la Guardia thinks that the pottery belongs to the type Isla Palenque Maroon-slipped, a type of the Burica phase, established by Olga Linares de Sapir, and dated A.D. 500 to 800. If this is true, this complex of secondary urn burials is sandwiched-in between other phases which obviously had primary burials and certainly did not use urns for burial purposes. The occurrence is not only temporally, but also spatially isolated, since no other group with secondary urn burials is known from the vicinity. All this still needs a lot of investigation, which is under way and which already confirms, without doubt, that the burials are secondary. Besides Dolega, burial urns of the same type have been encountered at Bfgala, Divala, Querevalos, Bugavita, and Tinajas. At Divala, Henry E. Adams (Library of Congress) made some investigations, including excavating some urns and inspecting others. All he found and saw con- firms the results of de la Guardia and associates as given above. Besides this, Adams investigated some stone mounds at San Lorenzo, between the Tabasara and Fonseca rivers in the mostly unknown southeastern part of Chiriqui. These were dwelling sites which yielded, among other ceramic material, red-line deco- rated sherds whose distribution is therefore greatly ex- panded. It now nearly touches the distribution of the buff ceramic of Veraguas, with which it shares some shapes. Perhaps the most important excavation by Adams was at Boquete, a long-time favorite hunting-ground of huaqueros, where, however, some graves still remained intact. One of them was excavated and was found to have walls constructed from river boulders. The same material covered the top of the grave to a thickness of 30 in. The ground plan was cruciform. The four re- cesses, or "arms," each contained a stone slab which was inclined about 60? and stood with its lowest part on the sterile ground. Underneath the slabs were deposited from one to four pottery vessels which Adams describes as Bisquit and Maroon in the terminology of Holmes. Unfortunately, "Maroon" is a very amorphous group in 142 [ VOL. 32, No. 1, 1967</page><page sequence="15">CURRENT RESEARCH which very different types are combined. One of the Maroon vessels is said to be a miniature of the Divala urns, thus possibly putting this grave (if the connection of the urns as mentioned above is correct), into the Burica phase. During this phase, however, no Bisquit has been found by Linares, who assigns this type to the following San Lorenzo phase. Obviously much more work is needed here before this riddle can be solved. Recently the Museo Nacional de Panama was burglar- ized and the complete gold collection stolen. There is a chance that pieces from this loot will appear in the art market; it is, therefore, recommended to all con- cerned to contact the director of the National Museum, Dr. Alejandro Mendez, who has a set of photographs of the stolen objects which he will distribute to assist in the recovery of this collection. WOLFGANG HABERLAND HIGHLAND SOUTH AMERICA PERU. Thomas C. Patterson (Harvard University) carried out an archaeological survey in the south high- lands between June and August, 1965. The reconnais- sance was carried out primarily in three regions: Aya- cucho and Huanta, Cuzco and Sicuani, and the northern end of the Lake Titicaca Basin. In the vicinity of Huanta, an urban center of considerable size was found in the upper part of the Mayoc Valley; the site is located on the floor of the valley and was apparently the major settlement of the Huanta area during part of the Middle horizon, judging by a few sherds found on the surface that are associated with Vifiaque pottery of Middle hori- zon Epoch 2. In Cuzco, Patterson worked in collaboration with John H. Rowe (University of California). They focused their attention on refining an early part of the local cultural sequence. The earliest unit in the sequence of the Cuzco Valley was isolated by Luis Barreda (Univer- sidad Nacional de Cuzco) in an excavation in habitation refuse at the site of Marcavalle. Barreda found strati- fied refuse extending to a depth of more than 1 m. below the surface and recovered more than 11,000 sherds from his small test excavation; several hundred of these had painted or incised decoration. A large number of vessel forms are represented in the excavated collection; these include several varieties of flat-bottomed plates and bowls with painted decoration, small ollas with decorated neck interiors and outside surfaces, and bottles with painted designs. A number of pigments were used in the Marcavalle pottery designs. A sample of charcoal associated with the ceramics from this excavation has yielded an age of 695 B.C. + 115 (GX-0453), suggesting that the assemblage dates to the middle part of the Early horizon and is more recent than previously sup- posed. The second cultural unit in the Cuzco area is repre- sented by sherd collections from Marcavalle and Chana- pata. The pottery in these assemblages shares vessel shapes and design features with both the excavated col- lection from Marcavalle and the Chanapata style as defined by Rowe's excavations in 1941-42 and is stylis- tically intermediate between them. At Chanapata, the assemblage was associated with a charcoal sample that has yielded an age of 650 B.c.+ 150 (Gak-?). The third unit in the sequence is the Chanapata style that has already been described by Rowe. The fourth unit is defined primarily on the basis of collections made at Chanapata, but these are quite simi- lar to an assemblage found on the eastern edge of Marcavalle. The ceramics are characterized by lower frequencies of reduced fired pottery and by new olla forms which resemble those found in the upper levels of Rowe's excavation. The fifth phase which has been called Derived Chana- pata or Pacallamocco is basically a red-ware style with both painted and incised decoration; the typical pigment in this phase is white, and it is used on both interior and exterior surfaces of plates and bowls. Perhaps the most typical features of this style are thickened rims on enclosed vessels and thick beveled or flat rims on open plates and bowls. A number of the plates have differentially fired interior surfaces, a feature which was common on the coast between the Chincha and Chillon valleys during the first part of the Early Intermediate period. Sherds of this style have been found at Chana- pata and across the Cuzco Valley at a site called Wim- pilla or Wimpilley, where they occur in association with a hill-top shrine. A survey of the Batan'urqo site near the town of Huaro yielded a large amount of evidence suggesting that the site was occupied more or less continuously for a long period of time. Small amounts of brown- colored pottery are reminiscent of the early wares found at Marcavalle and Chanapata in the Cuzco Basin and suggest that there was an Early horizon occupation at Batan'urqo. A sherd with red, black, and white bands separated by deep, wide incised lines represents a pre- viously unknown style in the south highlands of Peru; the decoration is vaguely reminiscent of the Pucara style, but the sherd itself is unlike any specimen found by Alfred Kidder II (University of Pennsylvania) or Julio C. Tello in their excavations at Pucara. In addition to these styles, Huari sherds from looted Middle horizon tombs on top of the hill and a local variety of the K'illki style dating to the Late Intermediate period are also found at the site. Another early ceramic stage site was located on the north shore of Lake Pomacanchi near the town of Cha- huai. The pottery from this site bears resemblances in shape and design to the early Marcavalle style of Cuzco and to an early ceramic style with incised decoration found in a road cut at Yanamancha near San Pedro de Cacha. Two early sites were examined in the vicinity of Puno. One site, Cerro Huacsapata which is located in the town of Puno itself, has been largely destroyed by recent construction. The site yielded a few Pucara style sherds and debris from the manufacture of stone imple- ments. Earlier investigations carried out by Manuel 143</page><page sequence="16">144 AMERICAN Chavez Ballon (Universidad Nacional de Cuzco) pro- duced several willow-leaf projectile points of the kind that were used 7000 to 8000 radiocarbon years ago throughout the south Andean area. The second site, Incatunahuiri, produced large numbers of stone tools and flakes which occurred on the surface or were eroding out of habitation refuse containing both Pucara and Qaluyu-like ceramics. Since similar kinds of stone imple- ments do not occur in other sites containing the same kinds of pottery, it is possible that the tools come from an earlier, preceramic occupation of the site. According to Hansjiirgen Miiller-Beck (University Freiburg/Breis- gau) who examined the collection, it was similar to a late preceramic assemblage that he found at Copaca- bana, Bolivia, and to a small lithic assemblage recently found in the Cochabamba Valley, Bolivia. A stratified habitation refuse deposit in the town of Taraco yielded five superimposed cultural units. The earliest of these contains pottery which is similar to the Qaluyu style of the Pucara area and to assemblages found at Incatunahuiri and Chiripa. The second unit contains Pucara pottery that is reminiscent of the Pucara sherds found at sites in the vicinity of Puno. The third assemblage from the site contains Tiahuanaco pottery. The fourth unit contains sherds that are similar to the Collao Black-on-red style which dates to the Late Inter- mediate period. The most recent unit contains a mix- ture of Cuzco and Collao pottery and dates to the Late horizon. Lawrence E. Dawson (University of California) is currently engaged in research on the Vicuis pottery style from the Ayabaca region near Chulucanas in the upper part of the Piura Valley. Dawson recognizes three units in the Vicu's style that seem to be chronologically dis- tinct. The earliest vessels frequently bear negative- painted designs and often have stirrup spouts that are irregular or lack bilateral symmetry. The second phase is composed of vessels with negative and white-painted designs and stirrup spouts that have a slight bulge at the base; vessels of this unit share certain design fea- tures with the Gallinazo style as it is defined in the Viru Valley. Vessels assigned to the most recent phase are typically white-painted and frequently exhibit fea- tures of the Moche I style, such as spouts with beveled rims. In addition to the Vicuis-style specimens in the third phase, there are a number of local imitations of Moche I vessels. Rosa Fung Pineda (Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos) is currently engaged in excavating and con- serving a pyramid at the site of Maranga in the lower part of the Rimac Valley. The structure was built in several stages during the later part of the Early Inter- mediate period and the Middle horizon and has yielded a great many sherds of the later phases of the Lima style, fragments of the Nieveria style of Middle horizon Epoch 1B, and other styles dating to Middle horizon. The site was apparently abandoned during the later part of the Middle horizon and was never reoccupied. THOMAS C. PATTERSON ANTIQUITY [ VOL. 32, No. 1, 1967 LOWLAND SOUTH AMERICA BRAZIL. The first year of a continuing program of archaeological survey under the co-sponsorship of the Conselho Nacional de Pesquisas and the Smithsonian Institution ended June 30, 1966. Delays in beginning field work shortened the field season in some areas, but all projects reported encouraging results: Bahia. Survey of the lower Rio Sao Francisco by Valentin Calderon (Universidade da Bahia) and Nas- saro A. de Souza Nasser (Universidade do Rio Grande do Norte) located 14 sites, including rockshelters with pictographs, and cemeteries and habitation areas. A problem was raised by the discovery of cemeteries for which no corresponding habitation sites could be found. A few nonceramic sites were also investigated. Analysis and classification of pottery and other artifacts are in progress. Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro. Ondemar Ferreira Dias Junior, assisted by members of the Instituto de Arqueologia Brasileira, investigated seven ceramic sites and two nonceramic sites in the state of Guanabara, three of which contained burials. Twelve additional sites were studied in the state of Rio de Janeiro, of which one-half were pottery-bearing. Stratigraphic excavations were made where depth of refuse permitted. Artifacts are in the process of being analyzed, and a seriated ceramic sequence is being developed. Parana. Sixty-nine sites were located by Igor Chmyz (Universidade do Parana) in a survey of the central part of the Rio Paranapanema; 38 of these are on the Parana side, and 31 are on the Sao Paulo side of the border. Of the total, 12 were nonceramic; the remainder sometimes produced burials in addition to sherd refuse. Stratigraphic excavations, from which it is planned to develop a seriated sequence for the area, were made wherever possible. Santa Catarina. The first survey area selected for this state, the Rio Itajai-acu flowing into the north coast, produced few sites. Search by Walter F. Piazza (Uni- versidade de Santa Catarina) revealed seven nonceramic shell middens but nothing farther inland. Investigations are continuing in an effort to explain the absence of ceramic sites since the situation contrasts with that to the north and south. Rio Grande do Sul. Eurico Th. Miller has mapped, sampled, and tested 101 sites in the valleys of the Rio dos Sinos and Rio Maquine and adjacent portions of the north coast. These are broken into the following cate- gories: 62 ceramic sites (53 with Guarani pottery and the others representing 2 non-Guarani ceramic phases); 8 burials; 4 nonceramic rockshelters and 14 open sites; 17 shell mounds, some nonceramic and others with Guarani or non-Guarani pottery. After analysis and seriation are completed, a relatively complete cultural sequence should be available for this area. r</page><page sequence="17">CURRENT RESEARCH Mato Grosso. Mario Sim6es (Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi) conducted a survey of several tributaries of the upper Xingu, providing the first extensive data on the prehistoric occupation of this portion of the Amazon basin. VENEZUELA. The Instituto Venezolano de Investiga- ciones Cientificas (I.V.I.C.), the official government re- search establishment, opened a Department of Anthro- pology in 1959 under the direction of J. M. Cruxent. The Department has since expanded to the point where there are three specialists in ethnology and two, in addi- tion to Cruxent, in archaeology: Alberta Zucchi of the Universidad Central, who is doing graduate work under Cruxent's direction, and Erika Wagner, who received her Ph.D. recently from Yale University. A radiocarbon laboratory began operating in November, 1963, under the direction of M. A. Tamers. In addition to producing more than 200 dates, the laboratory has made studies of the suitability of certain types of material for dating and has suggested improvements in basic laboratory tech- niques. J. M. Cruxent is preparing two monographs on Vene- zuelan archaeology. One deals with Paleo-Indian material and will emphasize methodological aspects. The other is a study of Majolica and is based on examination of large collections of European and American Majolica obtained from several Latin-American and European countries and from excavations in Venezuela and on Caribbean Islands. In 1965, Cruxent surveyed the islands of Bonaire, Aruba, and Curagao as a preliminary to intensive excavations. He also arranged 37 exhibits at the request of C. J. H. Engels, head of the Curagaosch Het Museum. Barinas. Alberta Zucchi has been working in the west- ern llanos, where she excavated the ceramic site of La Betania. The pottery belongs to the Cafio del Oso style of Cruxent and Rouse, and the description of this style will be expanded and corrected by her work. New infor- mation has also been obtained on the earth causeways (calzadas) and mounds in the region. Trujillo. In 1963 and 1964, Erika Wagner did field work in the Carache area, which served as a basis for her Ph.D. dissertation, now revised and ready for publi- cation. Three successive phases have been recognized: Miquimiu, Mirinday, and La Ermita. Stylistic evidence, radiocarbon dates, and the presence of European pottery place this sequence in Periods III-V (A.D. 300-1500) of the Cruxent-Rouse chronology. BETTY J. MEGGERS INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS AMERICAN ANTIQUITY publishes original papers on the archaeology of the New World and closely related regions. Contributions in which data from fields such as botany, ethnography, geography, geology, and history are pre- sented in terms of an archaeological problem are also appropriate. Articles on theory, method, or technique, are accepted even though the supporting examples may be drawn from regions outside the New World. Manu- scripts which have been accepted are published in the approximate order of receipt within the limits of space demands and issue balance, except for those articles which have been solicited by the Editor. Papers are accepted with the understanding that they have not been published, submitted, or accepted for publication else- where. Authors will usually be notified of acceptance, rejection, or need for revision in 4 to 6 weeks. Each article will be dated the month an acceptable version is received by the Editor's office. STYLE The Manual of Style of the Universtiy of Chicago Press (1949 revised edition) should be followed for most matters of style. Issues of the current volume of AMERI- CAN ANTIQUITY should be consulted for exceptions and special practices. Webster's New International Dictionary (second edition, G. and C. Merriam Co.) should be used as the authority for spelling except for some archaeo- logical terms and certain forms preferred by AMERICAN ANTIQUITY. The Elements of Style by William Strunk, Jr., and E. B. White (Macmillan, 1959) is an excellent guide to the writing of proper English. In addition, every contributor to this journal should be familiar with Mar- garet Harrison's paper, "The Writing of American Archaeology," which was published in AMERICAN AN- TIQUITY in 1945 (Vol. 10, No. 4, pp. 331-9). PREPARATION OF MANUSCRIPTS All manuscripts submitted for publication must be typed double-spaced on one side only of a good grade of white bond paper. Do not use paper which has been coated to make erasing easy. Be generous with margins; leave more than an inch on all sides. Retype any page on which complicated corrections have been made or whenever there are more than four or five minor correc- tions. Do not break words at the ends of lines. Note that all parts of every manuscript, including abstract, text, quotations, lists, tables, references, notes, and acknowl- edgments, must be typed double-spaced, that is, so there is one line of space between every line of typed matter. ABSTRACTS An abstract should consist of informative, but brief, statements which summarize the significant content and conclusions of an article.
