<plain_text><page sequence="1">Section I: ANCIENT INDIA Sectional President's Address SCIENCE AND SOCIETY IN ANCIENT INDIA SOME REFLECTIONS O.P. Jaiswal Mr President, friends and Fellow Delegates, I am verily overwhelmed by the honour bestowed on me by the executive committee of the Indian History Congress by inviting me to preside over the Ancient India Section in this 66lh session of the Indian History Congress at Vishwa Bharati University, Santiniketan. Since we are meeting here, I feel it my bounden duty to pay my deep sense of respect to the greatest humanist India has ever produced, Kavivar Gurudev rabindra Nath Tagore, who held human being as the best creation and above every thing in the world. With this ideal in view, in order to promote universal brotherhood and fraternity, peace and tranquility, he founded this Vishwa Bharati and made it an abode of peace. I am really proud of getting an opportunity to preside over this session of the Indian History Congress at this place. At the very outset I must confess that I have chosen a path where Angel fears to tread, so pitfalls are mine. However, there are few exceptions like Professor Irfan Habib1 and Professor R.S. Sharma2 along with Professor V.K. Thakur.3 I also must admit my sincere gratitude to my old friends Late D.P. Chattopadhyay4 and Dr. P. Gupta5 who nearly forty years back initiated and encouraged me to probe into the problems of science and society in Ancient India. Science and society are inseparable. We can't dream of science without society and vice-versa. Science is the means by which the whole of our civilization is rapidly being transformed. Science is growing by leaps and bounds. It has responded in the past to the successive forms of society and in its turn it has served to mould them. Dr. J.D. Bernai, an eminent scientist of the preceding century elaborated the basic perspective of the historiography of science and society in his magnum opus "Science in History" in the following words:6 "This is an attempt to describe and to interpret the relations between the development of science and other aspects of human history. Its ultimate object is to lend an understanding of major problems which</page><page sequence="2">44 ĪHC: Proceedings, 66th Session, 2005-06 arise from the impact of science on society . Civilization as we know today would, in its material aspect, be impossible without science. In its intellectual and moral aspects science has been as deeply concerned. The spread of scientific ideas has been a decisive factor in remoulding the whole pattern of human thought." Indian Background: Science and Metaphysical Phantasy Despite certain outstanding efforts by several eminent scholars, like Stcherbatsky, Jacobi, Hoernle, Jolly, Csoma de Coros, filliozat, P.C. Ray, B.N. Seal, D.P. Chattopadhyay and others to resurrect the history of ancient Indian Science, which concentrated chiefly on astronomy, physiology and psychology, making great progress in plant knowledge to list their properties for food, medicine or technical use. One with a sense of objectivity will be candid enough to admit that several aspects of the dynamics of the complex correlation between science and society in the ancient Indian context continues to be a terra incognita. There are some distinct views relating to near absence of exact sciences in Ancient India. In this context let us refer to the following rebuttal made by Acharya Prafulla Chandra Roy:7 "It is generally taken for granted that the Hindus were a dreamy, mystical people given to metaphysical speculation and spiritual contemplation. Due credit is, no doubt, assigned to them for the production of priceless treasures as the Upanishads, the six systems of philosophy, including the abstruse Samkhya and the Gita, with their transcendental teachings. But the fact that the Hindus had very large hand in the cultivation of the experimental sciences is hardly known in these days." Today we know much more about Indian Sciences in comparison to the days of Ray; yet we also find copious examples of the amalgam of scientific categories with metaphysical dogmas and unscientific mythological phantasies. This blending has wrought some devastating consequences in our understanding of the nature of Indian culture, sometimes leading to its distortion to suit the purpose of the cntemporary ethno-communal politics. So it is all the more necessary to comprehend the role of science in the genesis and subsequent evolution of the ancient Indian culture and its relevance to the modern context. Bovine Divinity In order to examine the amalgam of science, philosophy and mythology, we can refer to the concept of "Bovine divinity", which is the cause of several sectarian conflicts on the issue of Beef eating in modern India.</page><page sequence="3">Ancient India 45 The dogma of the sanctity of cow .along with Brahmanas has been assimilated within the scientific treatises like Caraka (medicine), Rasarnava (Chemistry) and others. The Caraka Samhita extensively discusses the therapeutic values of different types of meat. According to scientific procedure, the medical compendium classifies the flesh of animals into the following groups - 1. Prasaha 2. Bhumisaya or Bhusaya 3. Anupa 4. Barisaya 5. Baricari 6. Jangam 7. Biskira birds 8. Bartaka birds 9. Pratuda birds Subsequently features and therapeutic values are enumerated. Beef has been included within the group of Prasaha. The therapeutic indications of Gomansa have been referred to in the following Sloka:9 "ïïczi SJTRÍf^Ť TTTOTO 'l fi? cl While recommending heifer's meat for certain ailing conditions, Caraka simultaneously issues directives to worship of cow along with gods and Brahmanas on a several occasions; one of them is the following from Caraka (1.8. 18). 10 ČTOTČTT- ^ "*fr ffrSPTT ^ *TRïfa ^cj I I Thus we reach a very contradictory position by recommendation of beef as a dietary adjunct to health along with the worship of cow. Again we find similar relation of sanctity of cow along with the scientific postulates of ancient Indian Chemistry. Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray refers to Rasesvara darsana, a chapter dedicated to the science of Mercury in a philosophical compendium of several systems of philosophy entitled Sarva darsana samgraha compiled by Madhavacarya.11 Scientific advancement is seen pretty accurate in discussions on chemical apparatus, techniques of flame tests to detect various types of metals and finally extraction of metals from ores through the medium of dialogues of Siva and his consort Parvati. Regarding technique of flame tests we find the following descriptions of the colors of flames</page><page sequence="4">46 IHC: Proceedings , 66th Session , 2005-06 emitted by different metals which can be considered accurate even today: (1) Copper emits blue colorflame (2) Tin emits pegion colorflame (3) Lead emits pale color flame (4) Iron emits twenty colorflame On the other hand we come across the following mythological phantasy relating to the science of Mercury which is assigned to Siva: "Take a gold leaf of 3 niskas in weight and quick sivler 9 niskas and rub them with acid for three hours. Make the amalgam unto a phallus (emblem of Siva's creative principle). It is said that mere sight of the phallus of mercury, Sins accumulated by killing 1000 Brahmanas 10,000 cows are redeemed."11 The juxtaposition of scientific precepts with the dogma of Bovine Divinity is not an outcome of any scientific persuit. What is then the alternative historical explanation? Prof. Chattopadhyay points out: "There is a strong religious sentiment for the cow... the origin of this may be the subject of a serious socio-historical investigations."12 One of the earliest attempts to deal with this aspect of ritualism vis-à- vis Bovine Divinity and heifers meat was undertaken by R.L. Mitra. He had made a narrative of his extensive exploration of ancient texts (both scientific and religious) in his well documented monograph entitled "Beef in Ancient India." In this connection Mitra refers to Nirnay - Sindhu which prohibits cow slaughter because of the prevalence of wide spread disparagement though such killings were ordained in holy scriptures like the Vedas. "If such be the case, the question arises, whence comes this public feeling against the ordinance of the Vedas? And we can nowhere meet with a more appropriate reply than in the fact that when Brahmanas had to contend against Buddhism, which emphatically and so successfully denounced all sacrifices, they found the doctrine of respect for animal life too strong and too popular to be overcome and therefore gradually and imperceptibly adopted in such a manner as to make it appear as a part of their Sastras. They gave prominence to such passages, which preached benevolence and mercy for animated creations, and pushed to the background the sacrificial ordinances as to put them entirely out of sight."13 Prof. R.S. Sharma deals with the problem of this Sastric transition as mentioned above on the basis of archaeology and Buddhist texts like "Sutra-nipata." According to him this change was brought about by the corresponding change in agricultural tools like iron ploughshare as evidenced in Atiranjikhera, in Etah district (U.P.). During the pre- iron plough era cultivation was carried out with hoe and dribbling</page><page sequence="5">Ancient India 47 stick and without the labour of cattle. At that time the domestication of animals both by Aryan and non-aryan peoples were practiced to provide non-vegetarian component of food. Probably the experiences gathered in connection with the nature and therapeutic values of meats of different animals were later on systematically compiled in medical compendia like Caraka and Susruta. Similarly one may note that the observations of the forest people on herb and plants were included in the ancient medical texts. The introduction of iron plough and yoking cattle for agriculture revolutionized the method of production and brought about a change in the corresponding ideological parameters. Professor Sharma summarises the issue in the following way: "The Buddhist emphasizes on non-injury to animals assumes a new significance in the context of the need of new agriculture. The Pali canons donot stress so much the need for non-violence towards men as towards animals. The earliest Buddhist text, the Sutta-nipata (verses 286-97) states that the cattle should be protected because they are givers of food, beauty, and happiness (annada, vannada, and sukhada). This was certainly a revolutionary teaching at a time when non-Aryans slaughtered cattle for food &amp; Aryans for religion."14 The transformation of the role of the cattle should find exegetical justification for non-violence in other scriptures also. Probably the Brahmanical preceptors had greater difficulties in doing so because of earlier scriptural injunction for cattle slaughter for food and rituals. So they had to adopt the path of deification of cow, as Chattopadhyay referred to Gautam's (IX. 13.4) conversion of cow to "Devata"15 Buddhists remained satisfied with the enunciation of the policy without any mythological garb; the Brahmanical preceptors had to do it otherwise. Thus we reach a complex investigative terrain where we find the amalgam of myth, metaphysic and science. So it is necessary to trace out this expression in several branches of ancient Indian sciences in order to comprehend the role of science in the evolution of the vast canvas of our culture. We propose to briefly refer to the following branches: (1) Medicine (2) Astronomy (3) Psychology Medicine: Atma and Cosmo Biological Hymns Caraka has adopted the concept of Atma (Soul/self) a metaphysical category to the understanding of the physio-pathological mechanism</page><page sequence="6">48 IHC : Proceedings , 66th Session, 2005-06 of the human body. According to him, mind, atma, body (which includes sense organs) Constitute Life (Ayu). He further argues that body and mind are subjected to diseases but Atma which is not prone to pathological processes is eternal.16 "*re Nedieni f% f^TT"-Caraka If we try to trace out the origin of this postulate one can find the echo of its conceptual kinship with the following observations of Chand. Upanishad: Prajapati said: "That is the self, this is immortal, fearless, this is Brahmana.17 He said, Sir, although it is true that self is not blind even if the body is blind, nor lame, if the body is lame, though it is true that self is not rendered faulty by the faults of the body.18 It is necessary to study the dynamics of the blending of the medical phenomenon with that of metaphysical dogma. There are copious examples of such amalgam. They are the earliest attempts to comprehend biological, physiological and pathological phenomena in terms of protophilosophical or proto-scientific concepts. Let us refer to the following hymn of Br Ar Up.19 The same are three worlds. This Terrestrial world is speech. The middle Atmospheric world is mind. That Celestial world is Breath. Such correlation between the elements of macro-cosm (universe) and microcosm (body) is based on the naïve understanding of the influence exerted by the universe on earth and man in the forms of tide, seasonal change etc. This proto-scientific or proto-philosophical postulates of cosmic correspondence is responsible for the plethora of hymns relating to body and universe. These hymns have been designated by Filliozat20 as Cosmo-biological or Cosmo-Physiological hymns. In some of these we find that Honey doctrine the concept of Atma or soul has been interpolated into cosmo-biological hymns. Let us take the following example of Br Ar Up. SI.

First various components of the body (microcosm) are being correlated with some components of the universe (macro-cosm) viz. Eye corresponds to sun or mind corresponds to moon. Secondly all these elements (both macro &amp; micro-cosmic) are clubbed with soul and Bramha who is a shining &amp; immortal entity. Besides there are few hymns (from 11 to 15 noted above) in which Dharma (law), truth, mankind (Manusa) are also correlated with soul and Brahma. This so called honey doctrine was communicated to celestial physicians - Asvins about whom we shall deal with in subsequent pages. But the most interesting appendage of this doctrine is the list of the teachers who elaborate cosmo-physiological hymns clubbed with the postulate of Atma. Similar list has been referred to by Caraka.21 Some of the following names are common in both lists. 1. Sandilya 2. Atreya 3. Galava 4. Gautama 5. Angirasa 6. Kausika 7. Bharadvaja 8. Kapy a and others As far as our knowledge is concerned no systematic study of the process of transformation of these proto-historical dogmas into scientific precepts has been carried out. It is also necessary to trace out the evolution of these preceptors into medical scientists who have contributed tremendously to the science of ancient Indian medicine.</page><page sequence="8">50 IHC: Proceedings , 66th Session , 2005-06 Here we propose to indicate in this connection some reflections on the problem. One of the earliest references we find of healer in the nomenclature of bhisaj. This term is assigned to other deities also like Rudra as per Rg-veda.22 But in R.V. 1 1 .3923 we come across with the name of As vins without the status of bhisaj. Subsequently Asvins emerged as a major healer acquiring the status of celestial physicians. Macdonnel in "A Vedic reader" mentions that there are fifty major hymns relating to Asvins in rgveda. In one of them we come across the linkage of bhisaj with amivacatana. According to Monier- Williams24 catana stands for sorcery, where as amiva denotes disease, affliction, demon, tormenting spirit etc. Thus bhisaj, the healer is clubbed with catana, the sorcerer. Accordingly healing power of catana is merged with bhisaj. In fact, in Vedic hymns catana has been assigned the status of Rsi. The term bhisaj has been generally made equivalent to the English word physician. Etymologically Monier- Williams25 breaks the word Abhi + Saj. Saj stands for to join or plaster. So early bhisaj may be compared to bone setter, Filliozat translates the term as cure man. Possibly it stands for medicine man. It neeďs further investigation. Why the cure capacity was attributed to twin- Asvins? Is there any tradition of attributing healing powers to twins? In this connection let us refer to Dorothy Fisk's26 monograph entitled "Bouquet for the Doctor", she observes. "If child may be chosen by the medicine-man himself or by the tribe or be dedicated by his parents, in most cases some physical peculiarity marked for the profession: twins, albinos, those born blind or those born feet first were often selected " When we reach the ninth Mandala of the Veda, we find that bhisaj acquires the status of an independent secular profession. In this connection one can refer to Rv.27 where composer sisu is a poet (Karu), his wife is a grinder (upal praksin) and his son a doctor (bhisaj): It will be interesting to note that some healers (of Vedic literature) have not acquired the status of medical scientists. In this connection we come across a toxicological litanies of Atharvaveda, which are attributed to Rsi Garutman. These hymns accurately describe the venomous creatures like scorpion, snake etc. They deal with the various rituals to cure snake bite etc which are similar to the practice carried out by contemporary ojhas. In A.V.28 Rsi Catana refers following witch crafts: (1) Uluky atu (Owl Sorcery)</page><page sequence="9">Ancient India 51 (2) Susuluk yatu (Owlet Sorcery) (3) Svayatu (Dog Sorcery) (4) Koyatu (cuckoo Sorcery) (5) Suparna yatu (Eagle Sorcery) (6) Gridhra yatu (Vulture Sorcery) Suparna being another name of Garutman is thus described as Suparna Yatu' though we don't find the nomenclature of Garutman yatu. In Taittiriya Samhita29 Suparna is defined as diviner. Divination is a craft to make prophesy through non-human media like birds or by casting lots. If we correlate Suparna, the diviner with toxicologist Garutman we find the combination of two crafts into one single individual. Earlier mentioned about Bhisaj as medicine man, they are also medicine men clubbing together a number of functions. According to Sigerist30 medicine man has manifold functions. He is a priest, sorcerer, and physician in one. In Vedic literature we also find reference to the ultimate destiny of medicine man in the garb of Asvins. In the beginning of Taittiriya Samhita:31 Asvins are eulogized as divine healers; in the later part the twin is despised for impurity born out of their association with man and physician. Subsequently, their deified status is restored in an attenuated form by purification with Bahispavaman Stotra with strict injunction: "A Brahman should not practice medicine for the physician is impure, unfit for the work of sacrifice". At the same time, their healing power is divided into three parts and distributed among Indra, water and Brahmans. Necessary investigation should be done to find out the mechanism of emergence of a polity where Brahmanical domination over healer's art was possible. Astronomy and its Mythological Manifestation: In course of the elaboration of celestial phenomena, the science of astronomy developed. Along with it a set of mythological dogmas in the shape of astrology evolved. In the Indian context, stars and planets traversed a distinct path of mythological transformation. As a result astronomical facts are presented in a loose amalgam along with mythological concepts.32 Let us deal with them very briefly. Cosmic correlation: First we find the correlation of celestial entities with that of human entities. We have already mentioned about the</page><page sequence="10">52 IHC: Proceedings , 66th Session, 2005-06 sympathetic linking of sun and eye or moon and mind as examples of cosmic correspondence. Such aliveness of celestial bodies is the extension of Taylor's concept of animism. Theriomorphic or anthropomorphic: In next of step we notice theriomorphic or anthropomorphic transformation heavenly bodies. We have copious examples in this connection. In Rg Veda33 sun has been described as the beautiful winged bird; divya suparna Garutmana. Or sun has been described as human being moving on a car drawn by a number of horses. Apotheosis: Then we see the transformation of celestial bodies into deities. In case of surya, we find later's deification into following forms of deities: (1) Surya (2) Sabitr (3) Pusan (4) Bhagu (5) Vivasvat (6) Aryaman (7) Mitra (8) Visnu Catasterism: The subsequent stage is characterized by catasterism. By catasterism we mean the correlation of common popular deities and heavenly planets. In Greece we see Apollo-Helios - i.e. the unification of Apollo with the Sun. In the Indian context we find the following:- Planet Mythological deity 1. Mangala Skanda 2. Budha Narayana 3. Brhaspati Devaguru 4. Sukra Daityacarya 5. Sani Yama Thus it is necessary to study the conceptual evolution of celestial bodies as mythological deities from animism to catasterism in greater details precisely because these dogmas have tremendous grip over our culture even today, which obstructed the natural growth of science in India.</page><page sequence="11">Ancient India 53 Psychology - Science Mind &amp; Body The most original and advanced Indian Science was psychology, which made use of Psychical and physiological techniques, i.e. yoga, for the achievement of mastery over mind and body. The observation, analysis, and classification of mental phenomena were pursued with untiring energy and refreshing vigour. In this field none have laboured with greater industry and acumen than the Buddhist thinkers, whose whole philosophy and their religion on psychological basis. Not only so, but some of their main contentions are very similar to the later views advanced by the dominant schools of modern research on psychology.34 Buddhism considers only four realities; namely - Citta; Cetasika; Rupa and Nibbana. Citta: Citta means the consciousness. There are four bhumis of citta, which is the gradual development of human mind towards the achievement of Nibbana. Lord Buddha was not only a philosopher but he was a great psychologist too. He put the human mind into a laboratory before the microscope and studied the cittas minutely from different angles, in relation to vedana, hetu, kicca, dwara, alambana, vatthu. Cittavithi is the courses of cognition. We know that we have five sense organs and a mind by which we perceive something. How a man perceives through these sense organs, is the subject matter of Cittavithi. Cetasika Cetasikas or psychic factors originate and dissolve with the cittas. They have not their separate entities apart from cittas. They are of fifty two types. Rupa Rupa means matter. To be more explicit, the quality of a thing is rupa. As when we say earth and water, it does not mean the gross earth and liquid water, rather the quality of roughness and lubrication is the actual earth and water. Nibbana Nibbana is the highest goal of life, according to Buddhism. This is the foundation on which the entire edifice of Buddhism rests. It is a state</page><page sequence="12">54 IHC: Proceedings , 66th Session, 2005-06 of our mind free from desires. Nibbana is full of bliss and serenity. Lord Buddha also explained the way how to achieve the Nibbana. With an idea to achieve this state one should have control over mind or to cultivate such a state in mind so that there may not be desire in it. The process for such mental culture has been explained by Lord Buddha as Samadhi or Buddhist yoga. Buddhist yoga is of two types - Samatha and Vipassana, which is the practice by which all the defilements are uprooted and the true nature of existence is realized, then it is followed by the state of cessation of desires - that means the highest achievement of Nibbana or the summum bonum of life.35 Emergence of Independent Preceptor of Science While dealing with the mechanism of interlocking of scientific concepts with mythology and philosophy, in the Indian context we have referred to several nomenclatures, denoting healer's profession. We have noted several functions performed by the healer, which are comparable to the functions of primitive medicine man. Sigerist equates several terms like sraman, seer, leech, sorcerer etc with medicine man.36 In our opinion the term Rsi has some resemblance with medicine man in the early phase. Probably the term - 'Vaidya' first mentioned in Ramayana is comparable to medical scientist.37 From Caraka samhita (a medical compendium) we learn that several seminars on medical subjects were held in ancient India. Dr. Satya Prakash mentions some of them in his book entitled "Founders of Science in Ancient India":38 (1) Symposium I: Subject: Salutary and unsalutary influences of Vata (2) Symposium II:- Subjet: origin of man and diseases. (3) Symposium III:- Subject: Teste and its enumeration (4) Symposium IV:- Subject: Growth of foetal limbs In these seminars we find basically three categories qf participants. Before we classify them let us present the list of participants noted below:- (1) Kush</page><page sequence="13">Ancient India 55 (2) Kumarasira Bhardvaja = Referred in 4 symposia (3) Kankayana - referred in 4 seminars (4) Badisa Dhamargava - mentioned in 3 seminars (5) Royal Sage Varyovida - mentioned in two seminars (6) Marici = twice referred (7) Kapya = Thrice referred (8) Atreya Punarvasu - Practically referred to in all the Symposium (9) King Vamaka of Kasi - (10) Pariksi Maudgalya (11) Saraloma (12) Hiranyaksa (13) Kausika = referred twice (14) Saunaka = referred thrice (15) Bhadra Kapya = referred twice (16) Bharadvaja (17) Sakunteya (18) Maudgalya Purnaksa (19) Kausika Hirnyaksa (20) King Nimi of Videha (21) Agnivesa (22) Bhadra Saunaka (23) Marici Kasyapa (24) Dhanvantari (25) Bhrigu (26) Pulastya (27) Asit (28) King Janak of Videha These names can be broadly classified into following groups:- (1) Kings Varyovid Nimi Janaka</page><page sequence="14">gg IHC: Proceedings , 66th Session , 2005-06 (2) Rsis Bulk of the participants belong to the category of Rsis (3) Foreigner Kankayana from Bactria Car aka : č^t čítčpt ēf&gt;j^rRrft cnef|cr&gt; P^jčttťí: Caraka confirms the participation of Kankayana from Bactria, which imports international complexion of the seminars. Rsis Who were Rsis? Let us recapitulate the contention of Herman Jacobi about Rsis. According to Brahmanical mythology they were authors of vedic hymns and founders of several clans, families and dynasties. Basing himself on Max Muller he collates them into two groups:- (1) Those who have descended from seven Rsis (saptarsis): (1) Bhrgu (ii) Angiras (iii) Visvamitra (iv) Vasistha (v) Kasyapa (vi) Atri (vii) Agastya (2) The second group consists of above seven Rsis plus Bharadvaja. On the other hand the Mahabharata refers to following list. (i) Marici (ii) Atri (iii) Angiras (iv) Palana (v) Kratu (vi) Pulastya (vii) Vasistha These limited numbers gave rise to 49 clans which were subdivided into larger numbers with distinct patronymic identity for each of them. Fot example we find the name of Atri in the original list. He appears to be the composer of the Vth book of RgVeda. Atri is also referred to in Atharvaveda, Mantra Brhaman, Taittiriya Aranyaka, Brhad Aranyaka and finally in Caraka. In Br Up. We come across the following".</page><page sequence="15">Ancient India 57 These two (sense organs) here (i.e. ears) are Gotama and Bharadvaja .... These two here (i.e. eyes) areVisvamitra and Jamadgni ... These two here (i.e. nostrils) are Vasistha and Kasyapa. The voice is Atri, for by the voice the food is eaten ... verily, eating is the same name as the name of Atri ...". The above stanza of Br. Ar. Upanishad correlates some human sense organs with several Rsis including Atri. Probably each Rsi has some role in understanding the medical function of the corresponding sense organ as mentioned above. In Caraka Atri occupies an important position as a preceptor in the dissemination of the discipline of Ayurveda. The following Chart elaborates the point:- Origin of Ayurveda discipline Bramha I Imparts to I Daksa Prajapati I Asvina twin Indra I More than 53 Rsis including Atri 6 disciples with books I i I I I I Agnivesa Bhela Jatu Parasara Harita Ksarapani Agnivesa Samhita Karna Parasara Samhita Samhita Jatukarna Samhita Samhita It is extremely necessary to trace out the transformation of Atri Rsi - the composer of Vth book of Rg. Veda to a medical preceptor training 6 disciples each being a composer of medical compendium. One may discern following phase of transition: (1) Mythology - Bramha to Indra. (2) Proto scientific phase: cosmobiological &amp; cosmophysiological phase, as we find in upanishadic speculations. (3) Scientific phase: Several Rsis including Atri and their six disciples with books. Despite some characteristic &amp; distinctive features for</page><page sequence="16">58 I HC: Proceedings , 66th Session , 2005-06 each phase, everyone is interlocked with each other. The clear separation of one phase from the other is not complete. Rsis predominated the scene. Comparison with the Evolution of the Greek Preceptors of Science As noted above, ancient Indian medical preceptors had the opportunity to interact with the foreign preceptors like Kankayana from Bactria - an Asiatic Greek Colony. It will be interesting to refer briefly the stage of transition leading to the emergence of the Greek preceptors without any mythological or metaphysical frill. Singer39 points out a long line of Asiatic Greeks - (Mostly of Miletus) headed by Thaïes and followed by Anaximander (611 - 557 B.C.), Anaximenes (570 B.C.) Tenedos, Hecataeus and others were responsible for the separation of science and philosophy from mythology. Earlier the mythology was the hall mark of science but Hecataeus was sceptic about the legends associated with scientific phenomena. In fact his castigation of mythology can be deduced from the following comments: "the stories of Greeks are no less absurd than numerous" Similar transition from mythology to science is evident in the comprehension of Anaximenes relating to the phenomenon of Rainbow. Earlier rainbow was considered as a goddess. Anaxmimenes explained the phenomenon in terms of the effect of sunrays on compact air. All these speculative act of the Greeks were influenced by the development of the corresponding branches of science. Burnet40 points out that mathematics influenced Plato, whereas biology Aristotle. Roger and subsequently Filliozat refer to the growing tendency of philosophy to turn to physiology as the source of scientific explanations due to significant progress of the medical science.41 This led to the separation of science from philosophy. Later other branches also followed the same path. The gradual disengagement of Greek science from mythology and philosophy and corresponding emergence of scientific preceptors bereft of philosophical and mythological postulates was possible due to a number of factors. One of them was the roving characters of the Asiatic Greeks which helped them to bring about various branches of knowledge from different places. Because of the federal system of Ionian polity; scientist could relatively flourish favourably and independently. In this connection, Singer referred to the example of Thaïes who was a merchant and a traveler. Besides he was a great protagonist of federal system. Similarly Hecateus travelled to Egypt,</page><page sequence="17">Ancient India 59 Persia, and Gibraltar etc. In ancient Indian context, the disengagement of science from mythology and philosophy did not take place. On the contrary they remained interlocked. Unlike the Greek preceptors of science ancient Indian counterparts were not great international travellers acquiring knowledge from different countries. Besides, Indian polity being a hierarchical polity based on varnashrma system the Brahmanic hegemony over every ideological persuit is maintained mainly by the Rsis. The Rsis are original composers and enchanters of Vedic hymns. Herman Jacobi42 proposed that this act grew into a powerful theosophical movement following the participation of Ksatriyas while re-interpreting the meaning of mantras. To elaborate the aforementioned point as mentioned in Ch. Upa.43 a group discussion was organized on udgitha's identification with ultimate category i.e. SPACE: Participants were: (1) Silaka Satvalya (2) Caikitayana Dalabhya (3) Pravahana Jaibali Hume refers to Pravahana Jaibali as non-Brahman, in fact he has been spoken as one of the princely clans (rajanya). This stanza emphasizes that certain knowledge is exclusive to Ksatryas initially and later on passed over to Brhamanas. There is no place for craftsmen &amp; physicians etc. As pointed out earlier, Taittiriya samhiata V4 injunction rules that Brhamana should not practice medicine but one third of healing power is adduced to Brhamana and the rest two third is equally assigned to Indira and water. This makes Brhamana's hegemony of everything including science. The speculative nature of many scientific discussions is similar to the method followed by Upanishads. For example scientific seminar of Caraka on the origin of man and diseases appear to be a continuum of the earlier postulates of Svetasvatara Upanishad.45 In Caraka,46 the following participants discussed the causes of the origin of man and diseases:- Name of Participants Concept of the nature of Causes 1.

Atreya Time In the beginning of Svetasvatar upanishad we come across the following question regarding the conjectures concerning the first cause:- What is the cause? Brahma? Whence we are born? Where do we live? Over ruled by whom in pain and pleasures. The answers are following:- (1) Brahma = similar to that of Kankayana (2) Time = Similar to that of Atreya (3) Chance (Yadriccha) (4) Bhutas = Hiranyaksa's concept of 6 elements (5) Female and male = Comparable to Kusika's concept of parents (6) Atman (soul) = Maudgalya etc. (7) Svabhava, Nature = Bharadvaja Upanishadic search for such answers did not lead Rsis to scientific experiments to solve the problems. On the contrary the emphasis was given to dhyana and yoga to develop Atmasakti of God hidden within:- Those who followed meditation (dhyanas) and abstraction (yoga) saw the self power Atmasakti of God (deva) hidden in his own qualities (guna). He is the one who rules over all these causes, from time to soul. The yogic emphasis is the outcome of assimilation of the element of Tapas within the earlier priestly practices of sacrifice and sacrament. Therefore, Yoga and Dhyana can solve all problems. Hence, there is no need of scientific experiments. Filliozat47 observes: Although Indian Science speculates rationally, seeks detailed knowledge, observes and forms explanatory hypothesis, rarely does it experiment except in psychology, where it made greatest progress, thanks to body-mind control."48 Thus we can observe how theosophical speculationof vedic mantras had led to the enunciation of many proto-scientific and scientific concepts. At the same time how the adopters of yogic methods of</page><page sequence="19">Ancient India 61 asceticism had acted as constraint to the progress of experimental science. As a result Ancient Indian Science could not come out of the grip of religion, hence, is blending of scientific concepts with religious dogmas. The situation of India is different from the situation of Greece. In Indian context, we find incomplete detribalization of the Neolithic society where craft and agriculture remain blended. So craft could not develop significantly. Agriculture largely depended on magical rites particularly fertility cult. This fusion at the material plane gives rise to amalgam in ideological plane i.e. the interlocking of science, philosophy, mythology and religion. In this connection let us refer to the following comment of Walter Ruben:- " in the Indian village community underdeveloped small agriculture and handicraft were linked together. The village was the base of despotism and religion in contrast to Greece where a peasant was citizen just like town people who were traders and craftmen. In Greece democracy and the power of religion was not so strong. Thus in Greece, science and technology flourished better than in India. NOTES AND REFERENCES 1 .
