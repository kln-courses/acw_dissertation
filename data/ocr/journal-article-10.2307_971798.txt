<plain_text><page sequence="1">Saburo Sugiyama TeotEhuacan was probably laid out from its inception according to a master plan intended to express a specific worldview in material form. It is argued that a proposed measurement unit of 83 cm reveals mesoamerican calendrical numbers such as 52 (x 10), 73, 260, 584, and 819, when applied to city axes and major monuments. The channelized Rio San Juan divides the central zone into two sections: the watery underworld to the south, especially represented at the Ciudadela, and to the north the earthly representation of the passage from the underworld to the heavens, where the Sun Pyramid at the center symbolizes a sacred time bundle in the 260-day ritual calendar. The sacrificial burial complex found at the Feathered Serpent Pyramid seems to have been a part of the city-foundation program, and the iconography of the pyramid apparently commemorated this dramatization of the creation of time and space. Este articulo trata de identificar elfenomeno ideologico expresado en datos arquitectonicos, planiRacion de la ciudad, iconografa y enterramientos. Se propone que la ciudad de Teotikuacan fue planeada desde sus inicios con elfin de plasmar una cosmovision especifica a partir de un plan maestro. Para su contrastacion, se introduce como estrategia un estudio preliminar acerca de la unidad de longitud usada en Teotikuacan (83 cm). Al aplicarse dicha unidad a las medidas de monumentos mayores y otras obras publicas, se observa que los multiplos de esta unidad revelan numeros calendaricos mesoamericanos, tales como 52 (x 10), 73, 260, 584 y 819. Este articulo tambien propone que la parte canalizada del Rio San Juan dividio en dos secciones basicas la zona central de la ciudad. El inframundo acuoso esta simbolizado por la seccion sur, particularmente representado en la Ciudadela, y la seccion norte representa el paso del inframundo hacia el cielo. En este sector, la Piramide del Sol se ubica exactamente en el centro, y aparentemente simbolizaba un atado del tiempo sagrado en el calendario ritual de 260 dias. El complejo de sacrificios humanos descubiertos recientemente en el Templo de Quetzalcoatl parece haber sido una parte integral en la planificacion, disenada y realizada por el estado para plasmar esta cosmovision. La iconografa de este ediRio aparentemente conmemora la dramatizacion de la creacion del tiempo y el espacio. Se concluye que estos programas para manifestar una cosmovision especifica, llevados a cabo durante siglos con un vinculo entre si, afectaron significativamente a la formacion sociopolitica y economica del estado y al urbanismo de Teotikuacan. Mesoamerican societies seem to have explicitly expressed specific ritual meanings, cosmology, worldviews, legendary history, and calendar systems in material culture. Archaeological identifi- cation of ideational phenomena by means of material remains having sociopolitical implications has been a focus of interest in Mesoamerica (e.g., Ashmore 1989, 1991; Benson 1981; Broda 1987; Coe 1981, 1988; Demarest 1984; Demarest and Conrad 1983; Freidel and Schele 1988; Grove 1987; C. Millon 1973; Umberger 1987a, 1987b). In the present paper I explore ideological aspects underlying Teotihuacan archaeological materials. As yet, these aspects have been insufficiently studied in a scientific manner at Teotihuacan and elsewhere. Specific meanings can be inferred from monumental architecture, city layout, iconography, and burial forms. Ritual can be studied con- textually in the light of new excavation data, and the implications of the proposed ritual meanings for sociopolitical formation and transformation processes are discussed. The search for the measurement unit used for construction at Teotihuacan is outlined, and the results are applied to the interpretation of the sizes, forms, and locations of major monuments. The data used for the study include the maps from the Mapping Project directed by Rene Millon (R. Millon 1973; Millon et al. 1973), and architectural data obtained by the author (Sugiyama 1982, Saburo Sugiyama, Department of Anthropology, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287 Latin American Antiquity, 4(2), 1993, pp. 103-129.

(Cabrera C. et al. 1982a, 1982b), of the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia (INAH). Evidence from the study of architectural plans suggests that the measurement unit used in Teotihuacan was around 83 cm. This 83-cm unit will hereafter be referred to as the Teotihuacan Measurement Unit (TMU). It is argued, as a result of the study of this unit, that the principal monuments (the Sun Pyramid, the Moon Pyramid, the Ciudadela, the Great Compound, and other major public works) were situated at intervals with interrelated cosmological and calendrical significance. In short, a master plan forming a representation of the universe existed from the beginning of the city's configuration. Iconographic references, as well as the data from the sacrificial burial complex discovered at the Feathered Serpent Pyramid, are also included in the discussion of symbolic meanings involved in Teotihuacan material culture. It is argued that the iconography and the sacrificial burials at the monuments also make sense as expressions of a worldview related to the time-reckoning system of the state government. The building of these long-term public works must have touched on religious canons, behavioral norms, and sociopolitical and economic structures that substantially affected the foundation and transformation process of Teotihuacan urbanization. PREVIOUS EXPLANATIONS OF THE CITY LAYOUT Since the excavations by Batres (1906) and Gamio (1922) at the Sun Pyramid and the Ciudadela, respectively, in the first two decades of this century, exploration in Teotihuacan has concentrated on prominent compounds, often those with conspicuous mounds and/or mural paintings located in or near the modern tourist area of the Zona Arqueologica, mainly north of the Rio San Juan. The Avenue of the Dead was believed to begin with the Pyramid of the Moon to the north and end near the Ciudadela to the south, and the religious and political center was located along the main street (e.g., Armillas 1950; Gamio 1922), while residential areas were scattered around this core. The results of two major scientific operations directed by Rene Millon (e.g., 1973, 1981) and by William Sanders (e.g., Sanders 1981; Sanders et al. 1979) since the 1960s have changed the old view of Teotihuacan as simply a ceremonial center to one where the city is considered to have been a real urban center. On the basis of extremely precise maps of the entire city, surface collections, test pits, extensive architectural information, and data from INAH's extensive excavations and reconstructions in the central part of the city, the members of the Mapping Project reconstructed, among other things, the spatial distribution of constructions, approximate city boundaries, population density, and chro- nological relations of major buildings (e.g., Cowgill 1974, 1987; Cowgill et al. 1984; Drewitt 1967; R.Millon 1967,1973,1976,1981;Millonetal.1973).Abriefsummaryofthearchitecturalsequence as reconstructed by Rene Millon follows. After the early "Old City" had been founded in the northwest part of the later city, the Sun Pyramid was built during the Tzacualli phase (ca. A.D. 1-150). The existence of a subterranean cave (Heyden 1975) seems to have determined the location of the pyramid, which sits above it. The innermost Moon Pyramid also seems to have been built at this early stage of city foundation. East Avenue and West Avenue, discovered by the Mapping Project, existed as important streets intersecting with the Avenue of the Dead near the Ciudadela since probably around the time of Christ, but at least by the second century A.D. (R. Millon 1973:42, 52, 1974:354). The Ciudadela, the penultimate Moon Pyramid, and the very uppermost part of the Sun Pyramid appear to have been constructed during the Miccaotli phase (A.D.150-200) (R. Millon 1973:54-55). The Feathered Serpent Pyramid, as well as the Sun Pyramid, suffered modification, including enlargement, at least once during the Tlamimilolpa (A.D. 200450) and Xolalpan phases (A.D. 450-650), respectively (R. Millon 1973:57, Figure 17a). However, it is believed that the Ciudadela became the religious and political center by Miccaotli or Early Tlamimilolpa, and the city was supposed to have entered its most stable period after about A.D. 350, which lasted until the Metepec phase (A.D. 650-750) (Cowgill 1983; R. Millon 1973:60-61). This stable period is proposed on the basis of (a) the lack of recovered evidence for marked change within the city, and (b) the fact that Teotihuacan influences abroad were conspicuous in many sites throughout Mesoamerica, particularly in the Maya Lowlands.</page><page sequence="3">Sugiyama] WORLDVIEW MATERIALIZED IN TEOTIHUACAN 105 Several characteristic features of Teotihuacan's city layout have been noted. For example, con- cerning the orientation established for all constructions in the city, James Dow (1967), David Drucker (1977), Vincent Malmstrom (1978), and Anthony Aveni (e.g.,1980) have argued that the orientations of the north-south and east-west axes were determined with relation to celestial objects. They have hypothesized that the orientation of the city may have been related to the 365-day vague year, the 260-day sacred year, or the Long-Count calendar systems and to the orientation of the Pleiades, the zenith passage of the sun, and the summer solstice (Millon 1981 :239-240). It has consequently been suggested that the Avenue of the Dead, East Avenue, and West Avenue divided the whole city into four sections, just as Postclassic Tenochtitlan was divided into four sections, each with sociopolitical implications (e.g., Carrasco 1971; Monzon 1949). The Ciudadela was no longer believed to be at the southern edge of the city, but came to be considered the religious and political center of the metropolis. This was based on the fact that the "Avenue of the Dead" was supposedly intersected by East Avenue and the West Avenue at this point and continued to the south, as far as the foot of Mount Patlachique (e.g., R. Millon 1973:37-38, 55, 1981:203). The results from research undertaken after 1980 have been integrated into this model, providing a modified reconstruction of the city's layout and chronological sequences of major monuments (e.g., Cowgill 1992; Millon 1988a, 1988b; Pasztory 1988). Although the slow achievement of some kind of city layout has been suggested in the reconstruction mentioned, there is currently no expla- nation for the locations, sizes, and relations among the major buildings in Teotihuacan that may indicate the existence of a master plan for the whole city (e.g., R. Millon 1973:43, 1974:354). In this paper I attempt to add specific meanings associated with the city layout and monumental buildings to the framework elaborated by the Mapping Project. PAN-MESOAMERICAN WORLDVIEW It is useful to review briefly some general principles of mesoamerican belief systems that can be expected to be found in Teotihuacan material culture. With respect to the indigenous concept of time, it is well known that there were elaborate calendar systems in use throughout Mesoamerica, probably from the very early stages of its formation as a distinctive culture. For example, the Classic Maya used the 365-day solar calendar, the 260-day ritual calendar, the lineal Long Count, and the 819-day cyclical calendar systems. These were used in combination with cycles of celestial objects to create periods of diverse length with astrological or cosmological significance. Concerning spatial dimensions, there were two basic scales, horizontal and vertical, although they seem to have been meaningfully combined for Mesoamericans. Horizontal divisions of the world were characterized by four quarters plus a center, with specific ritual meanings, colors, gods, birds, and trees associated with each direction. The primacy of the east-west dimension in structuring spatial relations has been mentioned especially vis-a-vis the path of the sun, the moon, and the movements of other celestial objects. In fact, sixteenth-century maps of mesoamerican cities and regions placed east at the top (Ashmore 1991: 200; Roys 1933: 132; Thompson 1934). Moreover, the fact that principal pyramids at many religious centers, including Tenochtitlan and Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico, face toward the west, also suggests the primacy of the east-west axis. On the other hand, the north-south axis seems to have been associated with different meanings. The symbolism associated with north-south directions differs significantly from region to region and/or seems to have changed through time. For example, for the Aztecs north represented Mictlan, Region of the Underworld, and south represented the Region of Thorns (de Sahagun 195&gt;1969: Book 7:21; Nicholson 1971 :403-404). However, in some Mixtec codices (e.g., Codice Borgia 1963: 52; Codex Cospi 1968: 13; Codex Fejervary Mayer 1971 :34) death and Mictlantecutli, Lord of the Underworld, were related to south. Meanwhile, in the Maya universe, north signifies the direction of the ancestral dead, and south means the right hand of the sun (Schele and Miller 1986:42). l The Aztec world was conceived of as a vertically multilayered universe (e.g., Caso 1967; Nicholson 1971 :406408). Vertical relations among multiple layers in the heavens, the earth, and the under- world were represented by supernatural and natural objects, such as various kinds of gods, super- natural forces, sky, mountains, earth, caves, water, as well as celestial bodies that move cyclically</page><page sequence="4">106 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 4, No. 2, 1993 through the multiple layers. Water especially was fundamental, both in real life and in cosmology. According to the Popol Vuh (Tedlock 1985:72), only sky and water existed at the beginning of the world before the creation of earth. A crocodile-like creature, called Cipactli by the Aztecs, was created from the water, and the earth was made later from Cipactli (Garibay K. 1965:25). In the present world water appears as clouds or rain in the sky, and as lakes, rivers, springs, and seas on earth. Oceans were regarded as the boundary of the world in the horizontal dimension, and under- ground water, often represented as that in caves and springs, was believed to be connected to oceans and finally to the underworld. It is known from iconographic and hieroglyphic studies that the Classic Maya thought of the underworld as a watery world (e.g., Schele and Miller 1986:267). One of the most characteristic features of mesoamerican belief systems was that space and time were intimately related and combined (e.g., Coe 1981: 161; Kubler 1962; Leon-Portilla 1963:55- 56). Mesoamerican days, months, years, and centuries designated with numbers and signs were assigned to the four directions with divinatory associations (e.g., Codex Fejervary Mayer 1971: 1). Space, conceptualized as a multiple-layered universe, seems to have been measured with cyclical physical movements or morphological transformations of natural and supernatural representations. Sun-moon, day-night, sunrise-sunset, hot-cold, sky-earth, man-woman, birth-death, youth-old age, fire-water, etc. were dualistically interpreted as two objects or phenomena opposed or linked to each other in Mesoamerica. They were represented and interpreted in relation to the complex of deities or supernatural forces in the heavens and underworld. The aforementioned native interpretation of time, space, natural objects, and other phenomena seems to have been deeply rooted in the creation myth of the gods and mankind. The fundamental account describes the theory of a contract with the gods at the time of creation of the "universe," the sun, the moon, the earth, and mankind (e.g., Bierhorst 1992; de Sahagun 1950, 1953:v9). According to the mesoamerican worldview, humans and the world came into existence through the autosacrifices of the gods. Therefore humans must feed the gods by human sacrifice to sustain the universe. In fact, one of the most important principles that made mesoamerican culture distinctive may be beliefs of traditionally institutionalized human sacrificial rituals and the perpetuation of this primary myth of origin with a great variety of the natives' interpretive versions in different times and places. Although specific meanings and the way in which the principles were interpreted and expressed probably varied from culture to culture according to ecological, sociopolitical, and other conditions, the aforementioned general principles seem to have structured the traditional mesoamerican world- view. In the following interpretation I try to describe the underlying principles of Teotihuacan cosmology as they were involved in the city layout, monumental architecture, iconography, and burial forms. SEARCH FOR THE TEOTIHUACAN MEASUREMENT UNIT Standardization in architectural orientations and construction forms, and symmetric and highly proportional spatial distributions of buildings suggest that the city was laid out according to a plan or plans, perhaps using a standardized measurement unit or units. However, previous searches for the measurement unit have not reached a consensus because of the complexities of architectural units and superimposed modifications that covered or destroyed original plans. The fact that we do not know how and which part of construction Teotihuacanos measured also has been an obstacle for systematic studies. For example, in the case of residential compounds, complicated features (often from several different construction stages exposed today as a single unit) make the deter- mination of original measurements difficult or impossible. Nor is there any reason to believe that the entire city was laid out using a single measurement unit. Several measurement units might have been used in different locations within the city, and they might have changed through time. Almaraz (1865:212-213) suggested 80 cm was a measurement unit used in Teotihuacan, while Drewitt (1987) and Drucker (1974) hypothesized 80.5 cm. Sejourne (1966) independently proposed 60 m as a large measurement unit at Teotihuacan, while Drewitt claimed 57 m (Drewitt 1967), and later 322 m (80.5 cm x 400) as a large unit (Drewitt 1987).

A plan of the west facade of the Feathered Serpent Pyramid, with numbers resulting from the TMU study. In this case, the unit applied is 82.26 cm. hypothesized 147 cm as a measurement unit used in Maya Puuc-style archaeological sites. Although these appear to be reasonable propositions within the limited data used for the studies, the question of how to verify the proposed unit has remained unresolved. The present research began with the idea that the earliest structure of each monumental building probably reflects the original plan more explicitly than later constructions, conditioned as they were by earlier ones and other variables. The measurements used here were from constructions that belong to early phases of the city. Measurements used repeatedly at various locations were also given special attention. One of the few monumental buildings in Teotihuacan whose exact dimen- sions are known is the Feathered Serpent Pyramid (Figure 1). It was noted during the mapping survey of the monument that the width of a balustrade (1.66 m) is roughly twice the measurement unit proposed by Almaraz, Drewitt, and Drucker; 1.66 m is also almost half of the distance (average 3.29 m) between head sculptures jutting regularly from the west facades and one eighth of the width ofthe staircase (13.06 m). The side dimension (approximately 65 m) ofthe lowest platform ofthe square pyramid is nearly 40 times the same distance (1.66 m x 40 = 66.4 m), although the difference between them is significantly large. These data from the Feathered Serpent Pyramid led me to propose tentatively that 82.3 cm was a measurement unit used at Teotihuacan during the phase in which the pyramid was constructed. Similar measures between 80 and 85 cm have been found in many other construction maps I made at a scale of 1 : 100. Finally, I have concluded from this study</page><page sequence="6">108 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 4, No. 2, 1993 that 83 cm was probably used as a standard measurement unit for Teotihuacan architecture, although measurements need to be refined with more precise maps to determine possible variations through time and space.2 Ethnohistorical records also seem to support the 8s83 cm unit. Castillo F. (1972) studied mea- surement units used by Nahua speakers and pointed out that the linear units were based on the proportions of the human body, because the indigenous measurement units were expressed by the name of body parts. For example, the unit names, cemacolli (one shoulder) and cenyollotli (one heart) indicate that the distances (80-90 cm) between shoulder or heart and the tip of the finger in extended arm position was used as a unit before the Conquest. He also suggested as possible units, among others, approximately 80 cm (octacatl, meaning model or pattern), and 1.60 m or a little more (cennequetzalli, meaning straight position of man, namely, height of a standing man), which is twice 80 cm. The data also accord well with ethnohistoric documents about the method for measurement that the Maya used with the human body (O'Brien and Christiansen 1986: 145-149). One of the main reasons for proposing an 83-cm unit (TMU) at Teotihuacan is that, applied to the Teotihuacan constructions, this unit reveals that the dimensions of monumental structures and distances between them correspond to the specific numbers of ritual calendar systems, as described in detail below. The fact that many basic measurements in principal monuments and the city layout can be reproduced by applying the same unit to meaningful and important numbers in a pan- mesoamerican system seems to verify both the measurement unit proposed here, as well as the existence of the calendar systems disclosed by applying the TMU. Although some measurements mentioned are approximate, the described coincidences in a highly planned city cannot be considered accidental. It can be argued as a preliminary conclusion that the study of the Teotihuacan measurement unit(s) should be addressed to detailed examinations of the distribution in time and space of units of about 83 cm, making use of new excavation data and more precise maps than those currently available. In the remainder of this paper I turn to the more specific readings of ritual meanings involved in different kinds of archaeological materials, directed toward the discussion of the soci- opolitical implications of ideational matters at Teotihuacan. TEOTIHUACAN'S LAYOUT AS AN EXPRESSION OF A WORLDVIEW I began a search for an "emic" point of view of the city with a detailed study of a map made by the Teotihuacan Mapping Project. Figure 2 gives an idea of the extent of the ancient city ca. A.D. 600 and the locations of prominent mounds more than 2 m high which have been interpreted as independent temple platforms by the members of the project (Millon et al. 1973). The height of mounds is one unmistakable aspect of monumentality. There is a high density of residential units north of the channelized Rio San Juan. Major tall and prominent buildings are clearly concentrated around the Avenue of the Dead, mostly to the north of the Rio San Juan. Only a few temple platforms lie south of this river. The Ciudadela seems to be the only exceptional complex with tall temple platforms to the south of the river. The Great Compound, interpreted as a possible bureaucratic center and/or the locus of the principal market- place (e.g., Millon 1981:229), completely lacks mounds, according to the current topography and the data from the small excavated portions of the compound (Test Excavation 17 of the Teotihuacan Mapping Project [Millon et al. 1973:75] and INAH excavations [Cabrera C. and Soruco S. 1982]). Figure 2. The map shows the extent of the ancient city ca. A.D. 600. Rectangles indicate architectural complexes reconstructed theoretically on the basis of the Teotihuacan Mapping Project survey of surface remains. Black rectangles indicate excavated temple platforms or unexcavated mounds more than 2 m high that were interpreted as temple platforms (not just as platforms) by the same project. Notice that the channelized Rio San Juan evidently divides the city into two major zones. The numbers indicate the distances expressed in TMU (after Millon et al. 1973).</page><page sequence="7">* i ./T.i '&gt;,k,&lt; i ,1(.

The channelized Rio San Juan divides the landscape into two major zones. Two large compounds, the Ciudadela and the Great Compound, may have been exceptional architectural units in the southern section of the city. This deliberate division into north and south sections can be detected in measurements of city layout (Figure 2). The distance between the north limit of the Moon Pyramid and the south edge of the Rio San Juan (1,662 m) is approximately the same as that (1,654 m) between the south edge of the Rio San Juan and the north edge of the Rio San Lorenzo on the southern extension of the Avenue of the Dead. This north-south separation is further supported by the fact that the distances mentioned correspond approximately to 2,000 TMU (1,660 m), suggesting that two major zones have been created to represent the north and south in equal dimensions.3 The Rio San Juan was evidently modified from the northeastern part of the sector N 1 W3 (Figure 2) to the eastern part of the sector N1E2. It consists of a channel more than 2,500 m long, and 15- 40 m wide, which runs north-south and east-west in accordance with the highly standardized Teotihuacan architectural orientations in the central part of the city. The Rio San Lorenzo also appears to have been modified by Teotihuacanos. Millon and Cowgill (personal communication 1992) believe that a portion ofthe water course ofthe natural riverwas changed to a straight channel, possibly with specific significance for the east-west direction. If this is true, the aforementioned data imply that the water-management works at the Rio San Juan and the Rio San Lorenzo were one of the principal elements in the whole city layout, which may have determined, in part, the locations of the Moon Pyramid, the Sun Pyramid, the Ciudadela, and the Great Compound at an early stage of the city's foundation. The existence of the East Avenue and the West Avenue as major streets is still debatable, since there is no evidence of temple platforms or long, low platforms delimiting the proposed streets on the basis of current topographic data. Also there are no data from excavation to corroborate the presence of these streets, though there are no data to reject it either. Similarly, the proposed con- tinuation of the Avenue of the Dead to the south of the Ciudadela also remains to be verified by excavation. There are only a few temple platforms more than 2 m high (1 and 2 of S2E 1 in Millon et al. [1973]), which might have delimited the proposed southern portion of the avenue. The extensive excavation carried out on the Avenue of the Dead in 1980-1982 by the INAH project uncovered evidence for two walls delimiting both sides of the street immediately to the south of the Ciudadela but without clear evidence of construction farther southward (Cabrera C. et al. 1982b:13; Romero N. 1982:53). The poor quality of roughly made low walls is in no way comparable to the talud-tableros of long and high platforms uncovered to the north of the Rio San Juan. The notion of the whole city divided into four quadrants by East Avenue and West Avenue and the Avenue of the Dead seems disputable, since the data supporting the existence of East Avenue and West Avenue are very weak. The data with which the Mapping Project identified the East and West Avenues and the southern Street of the Dead might have been remnants of smaller streets, low platforms, or remains of former water courses. Although the Ciudadela and the Great Compound are geographically at the center of the entire city territory, this does not necessarily imply that the two major compounds served as the bureau- cratic, religious, and commercial center of the ancient city as has been suggested (e.g., R. Millon 1973:37). The city seems to have been divided not into four quadrants, but rather into two major zones with high concentrations of monumental structures and residential compounds in its northern portion. According to the city layout and studies of iconography and burials described below, the Ciudadela had specific symbolic significance as the cosmological representation of the south and the underworld. In the north, the principal pyramid seems to have been the Sun Pyramid, since the central east- west axis of the Sun Pyramid divides the central ceremonial and civic zone. The distance between this axis and the large talud edge on the back (north) side of the Moon Pyramid measures 833 m, which corresponds to 1,003.6 TMU (Figure 3). The distance between the axis and the current south edge of the Rio San Juan is 829 m, or 998.8 TMU. Even considering the possible errors in the maps of the pyramids, the Avenue of the Dead, and the channel of the Rio San Juan, which is currently</page><page sequence="9">WORLDVIEW MATERIALIZED IN TEOTIHUACAN Sugiyama] 1 1 1 16 m wide, the almost-round numbers in TMU suggest that the nearly equal distances on both sides of the axis of the Sun Pyramid were not accidental.4 Besides, the north limit of the Moon Pyramid and the south edge of the river seem to have been the most likely boundaries of the central symbolic zone. Now, what were the likely eastern and western limits of the central zone? Unlike the case of the north-south direction, it is not clear what might have divided the space in the east-west direction. However, one possibility is suggested by the three major architectural units: the Sun Pyramid complex, the Ciudadela, and the Great Compound. The central north-south axis of the Avenue of the Dead has been traced both in the field and in maps by the Mapping Project. This line seems to be close to, if not exactly the same as, the axis used by Teotihuacanos for the city layout. There are evidently other planned lines parallel to this north-south central axis of the city (Figure 3). The line from the east edge of the East Platform of the Sun Pyramid complex to the eastern edge of the East Platform of the Ciudadela forms another north-south axis exactly parallel to that of the Avenue of the Dead. The fact that this long parallel line is deliberate is unquestionable, since the eastern line was the limit of the two major constructions, and the distances between the two axes at the Sun Pyramid complex and the Ciudadela (431 m and 432 m respectively, according to the reconstruction maps of the Mapping Project), are almost identical. Moreover, the distance coincides with the measurement units multiplied by 520 TMU (.83 m x 520 TMU = 431.6 m), twice 260 (the number of days in one Tonalpohualli sacred year) or 10 times the important calendric number of 52, which is the number of 365-day years required to return to the same "New Year's" date in the intermeshed 365- and 260-day cycles. The west edge of the Great Compound might have been the west limit of the central zone, located in a similar way. Although the distance from the central north-south axis of the Avenue of the Dead to the west edge in the reconstruction by the Mapping Project measures 425 m (512 TMU), the distance between the two axes could still have been 520 TMU originally. The western limit of the low platform of the compound has been disturbed and seriously damaged, leaving no remains of the platform to allow for reliable reconstruction according to its current topography. Notice also that the western limits of various architectural complexes reconstructed by Mapping Project in the sectors N2W1, N3W1, and N4W1 correspond to this proposed west-edge line in general (Figure 3). Another public work of unquestionably high energy expenditure at Teotihuacan was the chan- nelization of the Rio San Juan. It is obvious that the water course of the natural river has been changed in the central zone of the city as mentioned before (Figure 2). However, the reasons why the channelization took place in this specific form have been unclear. While functional roles, such as drainage, transportation, water supply to the city or agriculture, etc., may have existed, the data from the measurement-unit study also suggest symbolic representation. The portion of the straight channel running east-west and crossing perpendicularly the Avenue of the Dead would measure approximately 1,360 m, or two times 819 TMU (1,360/.83 = 1638.6 = 819 x 2 + .6 m), again the number of a calendric cycle known from the Classic Maya inscriptions (e.g., Thompson 1960: 212- 217). This suggests the association of public water-management works with the concerns of the time-reckoning system.5 For reasons unknown, the midpoint of this channel portion does not correspond to the central axis of the Avenue of the Dead, as we might expect. However, Teotihua- canos' awareness of the midpoint can be supported by the fact that a large, deep, somewhat irregular, and artificial round pit/well (5.67 x 4.70 m in diameter and more than 5.5 m deep) was found in 1982 by Patricia Quintanilla M. (1982) in the middle of the great plaza of the Ciudadela directly to the south of the midpoint mentioned. In addition, Quintanilla M. also found a small north-south canal that starts near the edge of the Rio San Juan, passes beneath the North Platform of the Ciudadela, and extends close to the edge of the pit, as if the water would have been carried through the canal from the river to the edge of the large pit (Rodriguez G. 1982:56, 67-68). That the small canal and the North Platform formed an interrelated construction unit at their intersection indicates clearly the contemporaneity of the two features. Moreover, the spatial relations of the small canal with the Rio San Juan and the large pit/well located exactly in front of the principal pyramid in the Ciudadela also support strongly the idea that the pit/well was made as an associated element of a larger water-management plan including</page><page sequence="10">LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY 112 [Vol. 4, No. 2, 1993 the channelization of the Rio San Juan. The Ciudadela seems to have stood in the central area of the water-related plan, which may have something to do with the 819-day calendar system. MONUMENTAL ARCHITECTURE The Teotihuacan cosmos seems to have been represented not only in the large-scale city layout, but also in temple pyramids, public buildings, residential compounds, and even households. How- ever, analogous symbolic structures might have been represented more explicitly in major monu- ments than in smaller ones or residential compounds, whose forms might have been determined by other factors. In general terms, the temple pyramid in Mesoamerica has been interpreted as a symbol associated with birth, origins, mountains, earth, and the celestial realm (e.g., Krickeberg 1950). In the case of the Aztec Templo Mayor, the temple pyramid seems to have been regarded as the mythical mountain, Coatepec, an important location connected with the birth of the Mexica patron god Huitzilopochtli (e.g., Matos NI. 1987; Umberger 1987b:66). In the case of the Sun Pyramid at Teotihuacan, a well- known cave under the pyramid has been associated with Chicomoztoc, the legendary cave or underworld through which humans were believed to have emerged (Heyden 1975; Millon 1981: 231-233; Taube 1986). This interpretation agrees well contextually with the fact that the size ofthe Sun Pyramid seems to have been determined by calendric numbers, according to the measurement- unit study. The Sun Pyramid has a square base plan. The completely excavated south side wall at the base gives evidence of two architectural stages. The older and smaller one measures 216 m, while the exterior one is 222.7 m long. The dimension of the earlier pyramid appears to reflect the original plan, because it is exactly half of the distance between the north-south central axis of the Avenue of the Dead and the east edge of the Sun Pyramid complex. It coincides with the proposed mea- surement unit multiplied by 260, which is the number of days in one Tonalpohualli sacred cycle (260 x .83 = 215.8 m). The same measurement was also used in the Great Compound (Figure 3). The main plaza measures 214-218 m north-south, according to the reconstruction by the Mapping Project (Millon et al. 1973). I believe that repeated use of this measurement in major constructions suggests that the Tonalpohualli cycle was used at Teotihuacan, although only a few epigraphic data have suggested actual Tonalpohualli dates (Caso 1937; R. Millon 1973:4142). The exact original height of the Sun Pyramid is unknown because of both natural and deliberate destruction and inaccurate reconstruction of the upper portion. At present it measures about 63 m, including the unreliable reconstruction on the top. However, the excavation (TE 22 of the Mapping Project) carried out inside the tunnel in the uppermost body suggests that the original pyramid may have been lower than it is now (R. Millon 1973:Figure 17b). The likely original height of the Sun Pyramid could be around 60.6 m, which corresponds to 73 TMU (73 x .83 = 60.59 m). Because the horizontal dimensions of the four pyramid sides represent the number of days in one ritual cycle, the vertical dimension, completing the three-dimensional shape as a representation of the universe, may symbolize a large-cycle time bundle. Seventy-three seems to be the most probable number becaus¢ it represents the number of Tonalpohualli cycles in the 52-year "century." This interpretation is speculative and needs to be verified by excavation. However, the fact that an approximation of 60 m was used repeatedly by Teotihuacanos as a basic unit for the manipulation of space as described below may support this proposition. Figure 3. The central ceremonial zone along the Avenue of the Dead. The numbers indicate the hypothetical distances expressed in TMU. See the text for the question of fractions in the computation. This map with east at the top shows the central location of the Sun Pyramid in the northern portion. A parallel relation between this monument and the Ciudadela is indicated by the same east-west distance at the both complexes, and the direction of the principal pyramids toward the west. The Avenue of the Dead connects the two monuments in the north-south direction, significantly with interposition of the channelized water course and six transversal platforms between them (after Millon et al. 1973).</page><page sequence="11">Sugiyama] WORLDVIEW MATERIALIZED IN TEOTIHUACAN 1 1 3 f } iRlm g r- ,=9t L !,-  o ' oUf \ u k 9, f-::t Xo - l i. r- 'Ir---- ; I 1 ' L I l = = = l E R '-L=== r--' , -__1- - r 1 =_) _ = .-..r = .</page><page sequence="12">114 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 4, No. 2, 1993 Sejourne (1966:212-213) has proposed 60 m as a possible large measurement unit on the basis of standardized dimensions of apartment compounds (frequently called "palaces"), such as Tetitla Zacuala, Yayahuala, and Atetelco. The measurement was derived from the side dimension of the almost square compounds, which were excavated extensively. The compounds were defined by thick straight walls and separated from others at their four sides with access ways 24 m wide. Sejourne proposed that the compounds were constructed according a standardized size and were distributed originally with a square grid system (Figure 4-A). According to reconstructions exposed today, the distances between walls delimiting the compounds vary significantly, although the measurements between exterior sides of walls limiting the compounds concentrate at around 61 m. It is therefore difficult to get a precise measurement as a standardized unit. Moreover, the superimpositions and modifications again make the understanding of the orginal plan difficult. The Mapping Project provides a hypothetical reconstruction of compounds at the area of "palaces" that reflects the complexity of the distributional pattern (Figure 4-B). However, this figure also suggests that the 60-m unit, or 60 m plus the width of access ways, was preferentially recognized as a basic unit to delimit apartment compounds. If the 83-cm unit was used for the layout, this indicates that 73, the number of Tonalpohuallis in a 52-year cycle, was an important element in determining the standard size of habitational compounds. The Ciudadela is another major construction unit that might have held highly symbolic meanings through its location and the size and form of its architecture. Coggins (1986) has suggested that the Ciudadela was used for the dramatization of New Fire ceremonies within mythical settings of the primordial sea described in the Popol Vuh (Tedlock 1985:72-73). Although Coggins likely misin- terpreted some archaeological data, the point of her argument-that the pyramid facades may represent the primordial sea, time, or calendar-seems to have been correct. Drucker (1974) has analyzed architectural references for the possible calendric implications of the layout of the Ciu- dadela. He proposed that the 15 temple pyramids atop the four platforms served for calendric counts of the Tonalpohualli and the Venus cycle. Although his proposition cannot be definitively proved, some results from the present measurement-unit study seem to support his basic idea that the builders of the Ciudadela purposefully encoded calendric numbers in the location and the sizes of buildings. For example, the distance between the central north-south axis of the city and the eastern limit of the Ciudadela is 520 TMU, as mentioned previously. The distance (484 m, according to the theoretical reconstruction maps of the Teotihuacan Mapping Project) between the eastern limit of the Great Compound (the western edge of the Avenue of the Dead) and the eastern limit of the Ciudadela corresponds to 584 TMU (584 x .83 = 484.72 m), the day number of the Venus cycle (Figure 3). The distance (485-487.5 m, according to the theoretical reconstruction maps of the Teotihuacan Mapping Project) between the south edge of the South Platform at the Ciudadela, and the north side of the north wall that limits the extension space (Compound 2 of NlEl in Millon et al. [1973]) north of the Ciudadela, also corresponds to 584 TMU. Compound 2 was apparently built later than the North Platfolm of the Ciudadela. However, the 1980-1982 INAH excavations demonstrated that the space was functionally part of the Ciudadela (Munera B.1985; Rodriguez G.1982). Therefore, it is hard to believe that the builders of Compound 2 were not aware that the total size of the larger Ciudadela complex matched the cycle of Venus. In fact, Venus seems to have been represented symbolically in the iconography at the Ciudadela. ICONOGRAPHY OF THE MONUMENTS Beliefs and cosmological principles have been interpreted through iconographic studies at Teo- tihuacan. However, the interpretation of specific symbolism in imagery is very difficult because of the mythological, symbolic, esoteric, and apparently nonindividualistic and nonhistorical nature of the representations and because of the lack of writing. One of the main problems derives from the fact that the anthropomorphic and zoomorphic representations are difficult to categorize in our conceptual terms. Marcus (1989) has discussed the nature of the Otomanguean religion of the Formative and Classic periods as being characterized by powerful supernatural animistic forces. Teotihuacan religion also can be described as a belief system with supernatural forces and animistic</page><page sequence="13">Sugiyama] WORLDVIEW MATERIALIZED IN TEOTIHUACAN 115 ^ @ 60.6m=73TMU L i O l C I I FIGURE 4-B Figure 4. A map with a hypothetical reconstruction by the Mapping Project (Figure 4-B) shows three excavated apartment compounds and their spatial relation, which suggest a grid system of around 64 m (60 m for apartment compound and 4 m for access ways). Sejourne (1966:212-213) first suggested the grid system (Figure 4A). Although her proposition has not yet been confirmed with excavation data, the fact that the unexcavated areas between the compounds fit the grid system well may indicate that the original plan of "palaces" was made with 73 TMU.

The images ofthe feathered serpents at the Feathered Serpent Pyramid and those of jaguars at the Sun Pyramid seem to have been representations of such supernatural and animistic forces or spirits, rather than those of personified gods as in Western thought. In the case of the Sun Pyramid, iconographic information is limited to the sculptures of large animal heads, probably of jaguars, a serpent's rattle, skulls, and circle motifs, together with blocks of various sizes that were found in the Sun Plaza. Many of those stone blocks and sculptures</page><page sequence="14">116 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 4, No. 2, 1993 - = ; Figure 5. Sculptures of feathered serpents and possible representations of headdresses in the form of Cipactli. The headdresses were superimposed on the body of the feathered serpent (after Sejourne 1966). apparently adorned talud-tablero walls of the adosada platform superimposed on the west facade of the Sun Pyramid, in a manner similar to the facades of the Feathered Serpent Pyramid (R. Millon 1973:Figure 21a). However, the isolated motifs have been decontextualized by their removal from the monument, so the ritual meanings of jaguar representations at the Sun Pyramid have not been determined. I have studied the Feathered Serpent Pyramid iconography using a structural analogy, comparing it to other iconographic representations found in Teotihuacan and other sites (Sugiyama 1989b, 1992). I have argued that the unidentified monstrous head-like figures with a large knot on the top were not heads of natural or supernatural beings, but representations of a complex headdress (Figure 5). I also pointed out that the serpent bears this object on his body and that the temple was dedicated only to the Feathered Serpent and not to a sacred duality. Karl Taube (1992) also interprets the unidentified figures at the Feathered Serpent Pyramid as representations of a headdress, although he hypothesizes, in contrast to my interpretation, a dualistic representation of the Feathered Serpent and "War Serpent" at the pyramid. On the basis of the results of this study, specific ritual meanings attached to the representations of the Feathered Serpent and the headdress were sought by Alfredo Lopez Austin, Leonardo Lopez Lujan, and me through the application of mesoamerican ideological principles reconstructed mainly from Postclassic ethnohistorical sources (Lopez A. et al. 1991). We concluded that the Feathered Serpent, creator of the calendric division and the extractor of the divine-temporal-destiny force, transports on his body the complex headdress of Cipactli, another supernatural and animistic force that appears to have symbolized the beginning of time, in order to begin a "world" era. We believe that the pyramid was primarily dedicated to the myth of the origin of time. The association of the feathered serpent with Venus seems to have been represented in the Ciudadela at the time of its foundation, as suggested by the TMU study. Moreover, it is well known that Quetzalcoatl, the name of a supernatural force in the form of a feathered serpent in the Postclassic period, was identified in ethnohistorical documents with the planet Venus. If the meanings have not been separated from the forms through time, the Feathered Serpent Pyramid itself was a symbol of Venus. Moreover, the mural painting (Figure 6; Cabrera C. 1982:85-86) found on the structure 1B': NlEl (Millon et al. 1973) in the large plaza ofthe Ciudadela may have been a representation of Venus. This iconographic interpretation of mythology needs to be examined further for verification or modification by comparative and contextual studies. However, as far as related data are concerned, the proposed interpretation carried out within iconographic contexts appears to make sense in the context of new archaeological data, as described below.

Photograph by George Cowgill. took place in connection with the foundation of the monumental architecture. The graves found at the corners of the Sun Pyramid seem to have contained sacrificed children and adults (Batres 1906; Millon 1981:213). Mass burials found at the Feathered Serpent Pyramid contained sacrificial victims on a much larger scale. Sempowski (1982) already pointed out the uniqueness ofthe burials at the Feathered Serpent Pyramid, even before recent discoveries, in her analysis of mortuary practices at Teotihuacan. These distinctive features may be understood as part of an official program of the manifestation of a worldview. Here I discuss only burials at the Feathered Serpent Pyramid, since the information from the graves excavated there is far more extensive (Cabrera C. and Sugiyama 1982; Cabrera C. et al. 1989, 1990a, 1990b, 1991; Dozal 1925; Gamio 1922; Mercado R. 1987; Perez 1939; Rubin de la Borbolla 1947; Sugiyama 1985, 1989a, l991a) than for the Sun Pyramid (Batres 1906). I will briefly summarize some published data relevant to this paper and comment on them since the offerings and skeletons are currently being analyzed (e.g., Cabrera C. and Cabrera C. 1991; Cowgill and Cabrera C. 1991; Serrano S. et al. 1991; Sugiyama 1991 b). These excavations suggest that about 200 individuals were buried around and inside the Feathered Serpent Pyramid (Figure 7). There were individual burials and multiple burials, which contained different numbers of skeletons and different kinds of offerings. Many of the skeletons were found with their arms behind their backs and crossed at the wrists in a position that implies that their hands had been tied. The individuals found inside the pyramid were accompanied by rich offerings and laid directly on the tepetate subsoil; then, without further attention, they were covered simply with stones and mud, which formed the fill of the pyramid. Stratigraphic data indicate that all burials found at the pyramid took place at the initial construction stage of the pyramid. Therefore, the skeletons were interpreted as sacrificial victims apparently dedicated to the Feathered Serpent Pyramid (e.g., Cabrera C. et al. 1991; Sugiyama 1989a). The numbers and the distribution of individuals interred in a burial pit, as well as the numbers and the distribution of offerings of certain kinds, suggest that the burial complex was also related to the calendar systems. For example, the symbolic numbers expressed by skeletons in a grave or</page><page sequence="16">118 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 4, No. 2, 1993 I ill Ill.lUuGuA4I ,IXUL, 1-- Ill , , - - - -- _ _ _ _ _ _ I I A_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ i , .

[l991:Figure 11). in a grave unit were 4, 9, 13, as well as 18 and 20 (all significant numbers in the cosmological- calendric system). The multiple burials found at the Feathered Serpent Pyramid can be categorized as military groups because of the association of martial objects. There was intentional differentiation among soldiers or soldier-like victims by the differences in quality and quantity of the offerings associated. In general terms the nearer to the center a burial was located, the richer the offerings associated with it. Burials were apparently distributed symmetrically in regard to the north-south and east-west axes, although grave forms along the north-south axis were significantly different from those along the east-west axis. The multiple burial found at the center of this complicated sacrificial burial complex seems to represent other symbolic behaviors, as it contains the richest offerings known to date from , . , W eotl zuacan. The 20 individuals (probably all male adults) found at the center appeared to be aligned on the east-west axis rather than on the north-south axis of the pyramid, suggesting the primacy of the east-west dimension and particular ritual meanings associated with the direction of the burial complex. The individuals' spatial distribution gives the impression that the easternmost individual had some particular significance, since 17 individuals were oriented toward him. However, in other respects this individual does not appear to have been afforded special treatment. Moreover, he was one of the 10 people in the group who were found with hands and arms positioned behind the back or pelvis as if they had been tied. The offierings consisted of a great variety of objects made of shell, obsidianS slate, green stone, ceramics, and different organic materials (Figure 8). Continuing studies of material remains should make possible more specific interpretations about ritual meanings in- volved in these offierings. As a preliminary conclusion, it can be argued that the 20 individuals at the center of the Feathered Serpent Pyramid were interred in an anonymous fashion. There is no single individual who is buried !1lll t-4 -ANCIENT PIT FOR BURIAL |.. E - POSSI BLE BURIAL</page><page sequence="17">- l | fl l l o rn rn D rn - z m o z D .5 Im s- sxl /q2 o Figure 8.

Some objects were found only in a reduced area near a person or among several people, but no one had unique offerings of different kinds to himself. As to the general character of the artifacts, many offerings can be considered as an explicit manifestation of ritual-symbol sets spatially distributed above a mass of bodies in collective form. Besides the martial character, the several types of offerings suggest an association with water. One of the principal offering sets in the central burial consists of thousands of worked and unworked shell objects. The unworked spiral shells and bivalves found dispersed at the central burial suggest the importance of watery symbolism in the center of the principal pyramid at the Ciudadela. At least three incomplete Tlaloc vessels suggesting water association were also found in the central burial, and more were found at the top ofthe Feathered Serpent Pyramid (Gamio 1922:158-161). Obsidian eccentrics in the form of feathered serpents, which appear frequently in association with water in Mesoamerica, were also included in offerings. Approximately 1,000 green-stone objects (chalchikuitl, the Nahuatl word for precious green stone, was a symbol of water and riches for the Aztecs) in these offerings also might have had carried water association at the time of the construction of the pyramid. As a whole, the data suggest that the sacrificial victims at the Feathered Serpent Pyramid seem to have been dedicated to a ritual in which soldiers and water symbolism played important roles in relation to the calendar system. The question as to whether a ruler was interred at the pyramid has not been determined yet, and it may not be possible to determine definitively because of the damage caused by looting6 and lack of further excavations. Cowgill (1992) has suggested that the sacrificed soldiers were not captured enemies, but rather retainers accompanying a deceased ruler buried at some undetermined location at the pyramid. However, in spite of a significant amount of data about status differentiation among people buried, we also observed the lack of a conspicuous person standing out from the others, careless treatment of the bodies,7 anonymity in all the burial forms, and explicit expression of calendrical meanings and watery attributes. These facts complicate the simple idea that the mass sacrifice was dedicated to the ruler buried somewhere at the pyramid at the time of the pyramid construction. On the other hand, it is also possible that dead ruler's body might have been integrated into the burial program after the completion of building the Feathered Serpent Pyramid (e.g., Sugiyama 1989a:104). In any case, whether or not a ruler was buried at the pyramid, it is clear that the ruler was involved in some way in the burial program, and that the explicit objective of the burial complex was the mass human sacrifice of symbolic soldiers/priests. This would have been intelligible in a larger plan of the state as an earthly representation of the worldview outlined in this paper. FIJRTHER DISCUSSION OF THE TEOTIHUACAN WORLDVIEW The studies described previously lead to further hypothetical interpretations of the Teotihuacan worldview. The Sun Pyramid seems to have been the principal temple pyramid representing, in a sense, the most important cycle, the 260-day ritual calendar, at Teotihuacan. I believe this was the reason for the particular size of the Sun Pyramid. The ritual meanings fit with the interpretation of the cave under the pyramid (Heyden 1975; Taube 1986). Rene Millon (1981:232-233) argued that the Sun Pyramid and the Moon Pyramid were dedicated to the origin myth of the sun and the moon, as suggested by the Nahuatl names for them. His argument agrees well with the interpretation described here. The construction of the pyramid dedicated to the sun, together with the cave, seems to have been one ofthe major factors that attracted public attention and triggered the city's foundation at that specific location and may have made it a sacred pilgrimage site. The city's layout has been traced from the central east-west axis of the Sun Pyramid, and from its relation to the channelization of the Rio San Juan and Rio San Lorenzo, mainly on the north- south direction along the Avenue of the Dead. The primacy of the east-west direction most likely derived from the axis of the sun. The cave under the Sun Pyramid with its east-west orientation also might have been conceived of as the entrance to the "underworld" from which human beings</page><page sequence="19">WORLDVIEW MATERIALIZED IN TEOTIHUACAN 121 Sugiyama] were originally believed to have derived. In contrast, the north-south direction seems to have been used for the earthly representation of the universe. The Avenue of the Dead may have been conceived, in a sense, as a passage from the heavens to the underworld on the horizontal dimension. The northern end ofthe Avenue ofthe Dead culminated with the Moon Pyramid complex, which might have been a representation of the "heavens."8 The higher elevation of the complex in natural topography relative to the southern portion of the city also may have been a circumstance favorable to the representation of the hierarchical order of the universe. Moreover, the setting of the Moon Pyramid with the silhouette of Cerro Gordo exactly behind the pyramid (Gamio 1922:110; Linne 1934:32-33; Tobriner 1972:103) appears to have offered the people on the Avenue of the Dead a view of the cosmological relations of the pyramid mountain with the celestial realms toward the north. Along the Avenue ofthe Dead, there is a series oftemple-residence compounds that are distributed symmetrically or proportionally with relation to the central north-south axis of the city. They may have represented supernatural forces and symbolic attributes associated with specific ritual meanings in multilayered levels in accordance with the master plan. The six transversal platforms across the Avenue of the Dead might have had the cosmological significance of subdividing the "present world" into seven sections. To the south, the channelized portion of the Rio San Juan crosses the Avenue of the Dead at the point that corresponds to the boundary between the "heavenly" and "earthly" realms. I suggest that the water channel symbolized, in a sense, the limit of the present world. The 819-day calendar system, involved in the water-management program, seems to have been related to this earthly representation of the south limited by water. Farther south, beyond the channelized river, water symbolism is abundant mainly at the Ciu- dadela, as previously discussed. The iconographic representations on the Feathered Serpent Pyramid of shells, spiral shells, and green rings or chalchihuites also may have offered a watery setting for the ritual represented at the building. In addition, the Ciudadela must have been built very near, if not on, the former course of the Rio San Juan, which was apparently forced to change its course to the north. The large pit/well found in the central part of the main plaza seems to have been an integral element of the Ciudadela and probably was used for ritual purposes rather than the functional storage or supplying of water. The main image of the feathered serpent at the Feathered Serpent Pyramid possibly symbolizes Venus and the supernatural force that brought time and space, with another image of supernatural force, identifiable as a prototype of Postclassic Cipactli, which represents the beginning of time and space. The Ciudadela may have been located here to represent the underworld where the primordial myth related to the feathered serpent/Venus took place. Abundant Postclassic and Colonial accounts of the important myth of Quetzalcoatl's struggle in the underworld may suggest further specific interpretations about what the Ciudadela might have represented (e.g., Bierhorst 1992; Mendieta 1945). In fact, it is further possible that some iconographic representations of rituals, often depicted with symbols of human sacrifice, at Teotihuacan and at other sites of Mesoamerica might have commemorated historical events that took place at the Ciudadela (e.g., Taube 1986:Figure 2). The sacrificial burial complex discovered at the Feathered Serpent Pyramid makes sense as a part of the proposed programmatic realization of the Teotihuacan cosmogony in microcosmic form. The distribution pattern and the numbers of people buried at the onset of the monument's construction seem to have been determined by particular ritual meanings associated with time-reckoning systems and mythical origin accounts of the feathered serpent/Venus in the underworld. A specific number of people were most likely selected, sacrificed, and interred according to this prescribed large-scale plan. After sacrificial rituals were carried out, the monument was decorated with the images of relevant supernatural forces to commemorate the ritual dramatization of the creation of time and space.9 In summary, the Rio San Juan at Teotihuacan may divide the ceremonial center into an upper-world part, associated with the birth of the sun and moon, and a lower-world part associated with the activities of the Feathered Serpent (related with Venus) in the underworld, both types of events important in central Mexican cosmogony. Thus, Millon's (1981:23s233) and Coe's (1981:</page><page sequence="20">122 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 4, No. 2, 1993 167-168) idea that Teotihuacan marked the beginning of time is made more specifically meaningful and concretely manifested on the ground. SOCIOPOLITICAL IMPLICATIONS According to the analyses of archaeological materials, all dedicatory events mentioned seem to have occurred during the first two centuries A.D. During this period the original master plan might have been affected by sociopolitical, economic, technological, or even environmental changes. It is also possible that some part of the earthly representation of worldview might have been created and merged with some earlier plan, and/or might have modified partially the original plan. However, the strong and obvious physical relationships, and the meaningful cohesion as a cosmological representation among the major monumental works suggest strong sociocultural continuity during this early period. These long-term public works must have affected at different levels the foundation and transformation process of urbanization. The city layout, monumental architecture, mural paintings, and commemorative sacrificial burials were a symbolic manipulation of sacred space and provided an important medium for the ideological foundation, all of which tended to structure the minds of the public in a particular way. People from different social strata appear to have participated in the realization ofthis ideologically specified framework through social groups and work forces of various kinds. These long-term public works must have helped to structure religious canons and behavioral norms that led the public to interpret state politics, economy, society, and history habitually as events taking place at the center of a meaningful "world. " Sacred space conceptualized symbolically as a cosmological representation seems to have been divided into co-related units with particular religious meanings and sociopolitical and economic implications. For example, many temple-pyramid complexes with residential compounds along the Avenue of the Dead may have been associated with people who had specific sociopolitical and economic functions attached to particular ritual, cosmological, or divine meanings at the compound according to the microcosms represented by the city's space management. Not only ruling groups but also state officers from middle or lower classes, traders, merchants, craft specialists, agriculturists, slaves, and other types of citizens living in the metropolis may have been distributed meaningfully and functionally in accordance with the microcosmic significance of various sectors. It seems that the religion represented by monumental architecture and the surrounding landscape were integrated into the state polity at Teotihuacan. In the case of Tenochtitlan, it has been pointed out by ethnohistorical studies that the socioeconomic structure was closely tied to religion (e.g., Berdan 1978), and that the Aztec rulers tried to locate symbolically their political hegemony within the order of the cosmos (Broda 1978). The materialization of the creation myth in the center of the "universe" can be understood as an essentially political performance that was embedded in religious metaphor (Umberger 1987a, 1987b). Umberger's analysis of Aztec sculptures, hieroglyphs, and history indicates that the images of the gods Tlaloc, Huitzilopochtli, and Coyolxauhqui at the Aztec Templo Mayor were not only representations of deities used for worship, but also political instru- ments of the ruling group in the Aztec state to proclaim the justification of Mexica inheritors of cultural tradition, to proclaim the right and the duty of a selected sun tribe to move the present "world," and to humiliate enemies. Aztec political and historical events were recreated metaphor- ically by rulers with mythic settings, especially using the contrast between the sun/light and the moon/dark, for the manifestation of the Aztec rulers' domination over the Aztec people, conquered tribes, and those tribes being conquered (Umberger 1987a). In accordwith this metaphorical politico- religious structure and its materialization program, the Templo Mayor seems to represent Coatepec, the Serpent Mountain, which is the site of Huitzilopochtli's birth in myth, and therefore the symbol of very profound reasons for the existence of Aztec state politics (e.g., Matos M. 1987). In the case of Teotihuacan, Millon (1988b: 112) has argued that the Teotihuacan state seems to have been founded by a powerful rulership with a new ideology and militaristic characteristics. The</page><page sequence="21">Sugiyama] WORLDVIEW MATERIALIZED IN TEOTIHUACAN 123 initial depopulation of most of the Valley of Mexico and the concentration of this population in Teotihuacan (Millon 1981 :221-222; Sanders 1981: 176-178) now can be explained, not only because of the cave and the construction of Sun Pyramid above it, but also because of the necessity of the labor required for the completion of the whole city plan, which was most likely organized and executed by strong leading groups. These public works may have been carried out in metaphorical religious settings that were profoundly interrelated with political motivations. However, archaeo- logical identification of the relationship between Teotihuacan state politics and religious contexts is not an easy task. It seems that mythical settings in Teotihuacan were quite different from those of Tenochtitlan in terms of the specific meanings involved in the manipulation of space. There was no one principal temple apparent, but rather three temples in two conceptually different realms at Teotihuacan: the Feathered Serpent Pyramid in the underworld to the south, and the Sun and Moon Pyramids in the "present" world to the heavenly north. The Ciudadela and the Great Compound appear, according to my analysis, to have been located in the underworld. They have been regarded as the religious, political, administrative, and economic foci of the Teotihuacan state. However, Cowgill (1983) pointed out that the Ciudadela does not seem to provide enough facilities for the administrative works of the state government. The present study of the Teotihuacan belief system also stresses that the Ciudadela was fundamentally a religious locus with specific connotations and significance. Although it is likely that the Ciudadela was a temple-residence complex for a ruling entity, sociopolitical and economic centers may have been located in the portion north of the Rio San Juan. Cowgill (1983) has hypothesized that the major physical locus of political management at Teotihuacan may have shifted to the Avenue of the Dead Complex located between the Sun Pyramid and the Rio San Juan. His suggestion seems plausible, both because of the high concentration of temple-residence compounds on the north portion of the Rio San Juan, and because it makes sense that earthly representatives of supernatural forces would administer in the "present" world. How- ever, if the religious hierarchy was reflected along the north-south axis of the microcosm as suggested here, particularly the Sun Pyramid complex at the center and the Moon Plaza complex at the northern edge of the Universe seem to be most likely candidates for the center of political, admin- istrative, and possibly economic functions in the "present" world, with their own ritual/political rights and duties metaphorically materialized. More analytical and detailed studies of specific mean- ings involved in space management, architecture, iconography, and commemorative burial com- plexes may offer further insight into the question. As the population increased, the habitation area expanded far beyond the central ceremonial zone. At the same time the interrelations among the sociopolitical, economic, and cultural sectors expanded functionally and meaningfully, the relations with other social entities outside the me- tropolis may have become more complicated and perhaps more intimate. For more precise recon- structions of the sociocultural process of urbanization we need specific and precise descriptions of the archaeological material from different points of view, methods, and theories. It is hoped that the outcome of the on-going study outlined in this paper will be integrated within them, providing a perspective stressing the meaningful contents of ideology encoded in Teotihuacan material culture. Acknowledgments. I regard this paper as a by-product of the Mapping Project directed by Rene Millon, since the study presented here would not have been possible without the precise and detailed maps made by the project's members and Millon's insightful and scientifically rigorous interpretation of Teotihuacan society. A very brief summary of the present research was read at the 57th Annual Meeting of the Society for American Archaeology in Pittsburgh, in April 1992. I am grateful to George L. Cowgill, Emily Umberger, and Barbara Stark for their valuable comments and editorial suggestions on earlier versions. Cowgill also read the final version. Although the paper benefited from their comments, they may not necessarily concur with the ideas expressed herein. Misinterpretations and errors remain the sole responsibility of the author. The comments and editorial suggestions from the office and four anonymous reviewers of Latin American Antiquity were also particularly helpful. I am thankful to Ian Robertson for his editorial suggestions on the final version of this paper. My thanks should also be addressed to Kumiko Sugiyama who applied the TMU to other mesoamerican sites and gave the author more confidence in that proposed measurement unit. Kumiko Sugiyama also prepared some of the drawings for this paper.</page><page sequence="22">124 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY lVol. 4, No. 2, 1993 REFERENCES Cl l ED Almaraz, R. 1865 Apuntes sobre las piramides de San Juan Teotihuacan.

NOTES ' Ashmore (1989, 1991) stresses the importance of the strongly marked north-south axis in the spatial or- ganization of Classic Maya religious centers. In her interpretation, the north stands for the celestial supernatural sphere and the south for the underworld. Schele and Miller (1986:276-277) discuss the Mayan worldview including the relation between the underworld and the heavens, arguing that the Maya identified the north sky as a logical place where the ancestral dead finally arrive to assist and guide descendants after their journey into the underworld where the soul of the deceased faces a series of trials and competitions with the Lords of Death. This concept seems to be tenable for the case of the Teotihuacan layout as mentioned in the text. 2 A detailed description of this study is in preparation. The research by Drewitt and Drucker led me to have confidence in 80-83 cm as a Teotihuacan measurement unit at the initial stage of this study. However, since the difference between 83 and 80.5 cm is significantly large, especially when multiplied for a large building measurement, the proposed 80.5 cm remains to be examined as a possibility for another measurement unit.</page><page sequence="27">Sugiyama] WORLDVIEW MATERIALIZED IN TEOTIHUACAN 129 The difference between 83 cm and the 82.3 cm proposed as a measurement unit used at the Feathered Serpent Pyramid is also puzzling. According to the most precise measurements taken at the pyramid, an 83-cm unit seems to be slightly too large as a construction unit. 3 It should be mentioned that if the centers of the channelized rivers are considered as the boundaries of the space dimension, the distance of the north portion is 1,654 m, while the south portion is 1,678 m on the central north-south axis of the city. Given data available on the current topography of the rivers, it is impossible to know both which part of the river Teotihuacanos really measured from and exactly where the channelized rivers were almost 20 centuries ago. The fact that the considerably eroded barrancas of the Rio San Juan and the Rio San Lorenzo currently measure about 16 m and 40 m wide respectively on the central north-south axis of the city may give the reader an idea about the degree of accuracy to which the study of TMU to this scale can be carried with the information available. However, I believe that the distance mentioned does not accidentally correspond to approximately 2,000 TMU, which makes sense as a part of the whole calendrical and numbering system. It is definitely necessary for precise and detailed interpretation of specific features for a TMU study to conduct a mapping survey, especially of architecture, at a much larger scale than the Mapping Project did with 1 :2,000. 4 The distances mentioned should be considered to be approximate figures calculated on the basis of data available to date, since there are several factors making accurate computation difficult or impossible. For example, the axis of the Sun Pyramid can be traced in different ways depending on what kind of architectural features the calculation is based on. The fact that Teotihuacan north-south and east-west orientations do not exactly form a 90° angle also affects the computation. Particularly the minimum difference between two distances (833 -829 = 4 m) might also be due to the fact that the Moon Pyramid has earlier construction inside that would make the distance of the north portion approximate to the south one or exactly 1,000 TMU. 5 The measurement of 819 TMU is again based on the approximate length of the east-west channelized portion. The channel turns to the south at the east and west ends of this portion connecting with north-south channelized portions, whose width varies from 12 to 40 m in current topography. The number 819 is derived from the distance between two middle lines of these north-south portions, reconstructed theoretically from the maps of the Teotihuacan Mapping Project. Only a few cases of the 819-day calendar cycle are known for the Classic Maya, and we do not know yet where the number 819 came from (Schele and Freidel 1990:78). Therefore, the proposition of the 819-day calendar at Teotihuacan sounds venturesome. However, the fact that the number is the result of 7 x 9 x 13, all sacred to Mesoamericans for calendrical cycles and cosmology, suggests that the channel was actually planned with the combination of them. 6 The exploration carried out in 1989 inside the Feathered Serpent Pyramid found an ancient tunnel-an irregular hollow passage left by the removal of a large volume of stones and mud by looters. Two graves discovered near the center of the pyramid had been looted, and the burial contexts were disturbed very seriously by the looter's tunnel (Cabrera C. et al. 1991 :82-84). A large pit found in front of the staircase of the Feathered Serpent Pyramid also seems to have been looted completely before the construction of the Plataforma Adosada (Cabrera C. et al. 1991: 88; Cowgill and Cabrera C. 1991). 7 Concerning the treatment of the bodies, there was a rather exceptional case in a looted multiple burial found near the center of the pyramid (Burial 13). The complete skeleton of an adult male, unusually robust, was discovered near the edge of the burial pit, with green-stone beads, ear spools, and a particularly large nose pendant. Unlike the others found inside the pyramid, he appears to have been protected with an arrangement of stones around the body. These features, somewhat unusual in the burial complex, certainly indicate his higher position in the ritual and/or social hierarchy of people buried at the pyramid. However, they may not be a strong enough indication to identify him as a ruler, since he was one of the people laid together and covered with the stone and mud fill of the pyramid, whether or not his body and possibly others were roughly protected with the stones of fill. 8 The idea here basically agrees with Coggins's (1980) and Ashmore's model (1989, 1991) of Classic Mayan cosmology that the north represents the heavens and the south stands for the underworld. In particular, the notion introduced by Coggins (1980:730-731), citing Brotherston (1975), that the north and south directions signify "moments between" east and west and between "above and below" in Yucatec Maya strikingly matches the concept interpreted here about the Teotihuacan quadripartition. It is, however, contrary to Postclassic Aztec cosmology described in some ethnohistoric documents as mentioned before. The present interpretation is instead based on what archaeological materials and the natural landscape suggest by their own configuration. Therefore, the possible coincidence of the interpretation of directional significance at Teotihuacan with that of the (:lassic Maya is not intended to imply contact between these societies. 9 John Carlson (1991), in his recent iconographic study of mural paintings at Cacaxtla, convincingly hypoth- esizes Venus-regulated warfare and human sacrifice throughout Mesoamerica, particularly at Cacaxtla, Teoti- huacan, and the Classic Maya Lowland city-states. His argument, based on new excavation data and recent iconographic studies, that the Feathered Serpent Pyramid at the Ciudadela was a monument to a very specific cult of warfare, sacrifice, and fertility regulated by Venus and the Venus Almanac fits well with the interpretive framework described in this paper.
