The study of the Cypriot plastic arts has benefited from the publication of two volumes treating the subject of stone sculpture. In May 1993, an international conference held at the Universite de Liege and the Vrije Universiteit Brus- sel considered various aspects of sculptural production in stone. The conference proceedings, Cypriote Stone Sculp- ture, are comprised of 20 papers reflecting diverse ap- proaches and the complexity of the subject. V. Karageor- ghis, in the proceedings' introduction, provides a lucid overview of the development of stone sculpture in Cyprus and raises fundamental points about availability of indige- nous materials, limitations imposed by size and function, and sensitivity to foreign stylistic trends and iconographic motifs. Two papers deal with the issue of size. L. Wriedt-Sorensen argues that the size of the statue reflects the status and socioeconomic importance of the donor, while E Vanden- abeele compares small-scale production in stone and ter- racotta to determine the evolution of iconographic types during the Cypro-Archaic and Classical periods. Several</page><page sequence="2">790 BOOK REVIEWS [AJA 100 papers treat the impact of extra-insular influences on sculp- tural production. Phoenician influence at Palaepaphos is reflected in the Persian siege mound material examined by V. Tatton-Brown. W. Dashewski presents selected prob- lematic pieces revealing the eclectic taste of the Roman proconsul at Nea Paphos. The role of Miletos in the diffu- sion of sculptural style in the eastern Mediterranean is considered by R. Senff, who posits no distinct Cypriot style present in the Milesian repertoire. M. Yon convincingly argues that the Stele of Sargon II from Kition was signifi- cant in introducing Assyrian sculptural style to Cypriot artists. Most of the papers from the conference focus on the theme of origins and development. A. Le Brun appraises male anthropomorphic preceramic Neolithic figurines, ar- guing that material connotes symbolic content. Three pa- pers concentrate on the Bronze Age. S. Lubsen-Admiraal presents plank figures from the Zintilis Collection in Am- sterdam, interpreting them as indicators of social status. In his discussion of the anthropomorphic bas relief panel from Karmi Palealona tomb 6, R. Merrillees notes generic parallels with select Red Polished ware examples. The min- imal corpus of Bronze Age sculpture is enlarged by P. Astr6m's presentation of a stone basin with a bucranium relief from Hala Sultan Tekke. Material from various city-kingdoms is treated in a num- ber of papers. In noting the connection between scarcity of good limestone at Amathus and the dearth of large stone sculpture, A. Hermary reminds us that other Cypriot ur- ban sanctuaries, unlike rural sanctuaries, reflect a similar scarcity of stone sculpture, which suggests that sanctuary location may determine choice of material for some ded- ications. W. Childs reexamines the Marion stone corpus, underscoring the artistic debt owed to the Near East, East Greece, and northern Greece in sculptural style. The newly rediscovered Lang's Temple of Apollo Amyklos at Idalion is discussed by P. Gaber, who posits Adonis worship at the temple and promises that future study of the sculpture will inform about cult worship. A. Caubet and M. Yon main- tain that Phoenician influences on sculpture from Kition resulted in the widely diffused Herakles-Melqart type and the Hathor capital, while the importation of Greek marble heralded the decline of sculptural originality in the Clas- sical period. M. Br6mmer suggests that a limestone head wearing the Cypriot version of the Egyptian double crown reflects the contemporary political situation. Focusing on a draped adorant in a private collection in Paris, H. Cas- simatis discusses the treatment of the himation through time and claims the specificity of mantles denotes differ- ent cultic personnel. Specific iconographic issues are addressed by three au- thors. E. Gubel notes that Freud's appetite for Cypriot an- tiquities was jointly stimulated by Maria Bonaparte's gift of a Cypriot stone head together with the impact of the Metropolitan Museum's Cesnola Collection. Similar ico- nography and sculptural treatment is used by M. Vander- vondelen to attribute a group of ring dancers and anal- ogous fragments in the British Museum to the same workshop. Finally, a reassessment of temple-boys is under- taken by R. Laffineur, who links iconographic features of necklaces worn by temple-boys to the infant Herakles, while convincingly arguing that statues of temple-boys function as offerings placing youthful dedicants under the protec- tion of the divinity. Although content and detail vary and chronological scope ranges far, the eclectic nature of the papers under- scores the breadth of the subject, while disparate method- ologies remind us that there is room for multiple ap- proaches. The conference organizers and editors are to be congratulated for assembling speakers of diverse na- tionalities and varied viewpoints. Each paper is generously illustrated with plates, while pertinent notes guide the in- terested reader to further bibliography. In sum, the vol- ume is certainly requisite for further study of Cypriot stone sculpture. Equally welcome is Cecilia Beer's Temple-Boys. The pres- ent volume is intended as the first part of a two-part com- prehensive treatment on the subject. Part 1 comprises a catalogue of 264 extant examples of temple-boys in stone and terracotta currently housed in various museums in Europe, the Middle East, and the United States. Addition- ally, Beer includes 20 missing or untraceable temple-boys (known from the Cesnola Atlas), minor fragments associ- ated with this sculptural type, and various heads. With the intention of encompassing all relevant material, Beer adds three appendices to include what she terms "uncertain temple-boys" (appendix A: vagaries of dress, pose, and at- tributes render inclusion within the corpus uncertain; ap- pendix B: standing youths wearing diagonal amuletic chains; and appendix C: possible temple-girls). The organization of the catalogue begins with material housed in the Cyprus Museum in Nicosia, which contains the largest number of examples of this type (97 entries). Thereafter, the catalogue is organized by museum collec- tions arranged in alphabetical order according to city. Each section on museum collections is preceded by an informa- tive introduction or historical outline. Catalogue entries include a complete description, provenance, and excava- tion history (where applicable), suggested date, and bib- liography. Most entries are illustrated by numbered plates placed at the end of the volume. Their arrangement de- pends on stylistic groups and series, which the catalogue does not take into account; this makes finding illustrations somewhat awkward if one is intent on examining works from a particular collection. The quality of the illustrations varies. Multiple views of the same object provide reward- ing details, but particularly troublesome are several quickly sketched illustrations with detail summary at best. More- over, a concordance arranged by site would have been help- ful. The author provides dates for objects but, in the ab- sence of definitive contexts, precision is impossible. Criteria for dating are not given and the reader is promised dis- cussion of chronological concerns in part 2 of Temple-Boys. The terminology used in the catalogue descriptions is also to be explained in the forthcoming volume. Nevertheless, Temple-Boys succeeds on several levels. The author's aim to provide a comprehensive catalogue of known Cypriot examples is realized, and particularly valu- able is the inclusion of many unpublished pieces, some of which are housed in obscure collections. The extensive bibliography is imperative for further scholarly work on the subject. The second volume is eagerly awaited, as the text will focus on iconographic and stylistic analysis, con- siderations of function, and questions of cult worship.
