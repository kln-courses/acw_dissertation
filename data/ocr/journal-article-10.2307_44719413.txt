Foster Bioengineering Center, Wayne State University Copyright © 2002 SAE International ABSTRACT Recent action by some racecar sanctioning bodies mak- ing head/neck restraint use mandatory for competitors has resulted in a number of methods attempting to pro- vide head/neck restraint. This paper evaluates the per- formance of a number of commercially available head/neck restraint systems using a stock car seating configuration and a realistic stock car crash pulse. The tests were conducted at an impact angle of 30 degrees to the right, with a midsize male Hybrid III anthropomor- phic test device (ATD) modified for racecar crash testing. A six-point latch and link racing harness restrained the ATD. The goal of the tests was to examine the perform- ance of the head/neck restraint without the influence of the seat or steering wheel. Three head/neck restraint systems were tested using a sled pulse with a 35 mph (56 km/h) velocity change and 50G peak deceleration. Three tests with three samples of each system were performed to assess repeatability. The systems tested were the HANS®, the Hutchens de- vice, and the D-CEL device. Head accelerations, neck loads and moments were analyzed to provide a compari- son of the various systems ability to control head dy- namics. Kinematic control of the head was also deter- mined from analysis of the high-speed video recordings to obtain forward head excursion. The results of the tests on each device are presented in absolute terms, compared to baseline tests (no head/neck restraint) and normalized to the best per- forming device. INTRODUCTION Racecar drivers in most forms of motorsports have been required to use multi-point torso restraint for crash pro- tection for many years. These five and six- point restraint systems (consisting of two shoulder belts, two lap belts, and either a single forward-running crotch strap (5-point) or two rearward-running crotch straps (6-point) can pro- vide significant control of forward and oblique forward crash motions of the torso. Torso restraints only provide control of the corresponding crash motion of the driver's helmeted head by holding the shoulders and relying upon the neck to actually restrain the head. Military air- craft pilots have similar restraint systems and have been shown to have the same protection problems as racecar drivers in heavy crashes. Unterharnscheidt (1981) documented the endpoint of head/neck loading under full torso restraint in a series of tests with anesthetized monkeys subjected to increasingly severe crash accel- erations on an impact sled. In these tests, fatal injuries were produced in the heads and necks of the subjects with highly restrained torsos when the sled accelerations reached the 100G level. A common outcome was basal skull fracture or high cervical spine separation due to the whipping of the head forward relative to the highly re- strained torso. The head vertical or z-axis acceleration is the loading mechanism for this fracture (Melvin, et al. 1994) as this inertial load produces axial tension in the neck, which is carried to the neck through the base of the skull. The source of this tension is the head z-axis acceleration, which is a centrifugal force due to head ro- tational velocity early in the forward rotation of the head relative to the torso. The tolerance of the base of the human skull to this type of loading has been shown ex- perimentally by Hopper et al. (1994) to be 4,300 ± 350 N. Another mechanism by which basal skull fractures have been shown to occur is impact to the chin and lower face, with or without helmets. Accordingly, any device in- tended to prevent basal skull fractures needs to limit for- ward head excursion (to minimize potential head con- tacts with forward structures) as well as limiting axial neck tension. Crash investigation of Indy car crashes with crash record- ers has shown that a racecar driver, when properly re- strained and protected, can sustain crash chassis decelerations of over 100G without serious injuries (Melvin, et al. 1998 and Melvin, et al. 2001). The average peak chassis deceleration in 202 cases of front, side and rear crashes was 53G with an associated average velocity change of 28.3mph (45.3km/h). Peak chassis decelerations ranged as high as 135G and velocity changes ranged as high as 70mph (112 km/h). Accord- ingly, the goal of a head/neck restraint should be to pro- vide a similar level of protection at the 100G crash level. Unfortunately, it is difficult for typical automotive safety crash sleds to reach such high levels of deceleration at 2308</page><page sequence="2">this time. As a result, much of the sled testing associated with racecar crashes has been done in the range of 45 to 50G. METHODS The tests in this study were conducted on the Wayne Horizontal Acceleration Mechanism (WHAM III) sled. This sled is a deceleration sled using a hydraulic snubber to produce the crash pulse. A racing stock car driver com- partment section was mounted on the sled at a 30- degree angle to the left. This simulated a 30-degree right front impact for the driver. The sled deceleration pulse used for these tests is shown in Figure 1 . The pulse represents a typical moderately severe racecar crash (Melvin, et al. 1998). It produces a 35-mph (56 km/h) velocity change with a peak deceleration of 50G. Figure 1 . Typical 35 mph (56 km/h) Sled Deceleration- Time History A mid-size Male Hybrid III dummy was used to simulate an average driver. The dummy was modified with a steel lower neck bracket in place of the cast aluminum bracket because of the extremely high neck loads produced in racecar crash testing (Melvin, et al. 1994). High-speed video recordings were used to document the motions of the dummy. The dummy was instrumented with the standard Hybrid III head, chest and pelvis triaxial acceler- ometers, an upper neck six-axis load cell and a chest de- flection transducer (Mertz, 2002). The critical parameter for basal skull fracture injury assessment is axial (Fz) neck tension. The biomechanical limit used for judging these tests is 4000 N based on the work of Hopper, et al. (1994). A six-point latch and link racing harness restrained the ATD. New belts were fitted for each test. The goal of the tests was to examine the performance of the head/neck restraint without the influence of the seat or steering wheel. Accordingly, an aluminum stock car racing seat with a lateral shoulder support and no lateral rib or head support was used with no steering wheel or column. The seatback angle was 23 degrees from vertical. Due some difficulties in obtaining samples of the various restraint devices some were reused in repeat tests. This is noted in the first column of Table 1 . Reusing these devices in tests, as long as they inspected for damage and are readjusted to the original fitment of the device on the dummy has not proven to cause significant perform- ance problems in our experience. The HANS® device used in these tests was a Model 20RE, which used a new single point attachment method on each side of the driver's helmet. The details of the HANS® device features are documented by Gram- ling, et al. (1998). It consists of a composite collar with tethers running horizontally to the sides of the driver's helmet. The collar has side structure on either side of the neck over the shoulders where the double shoulder belts are placed over the device. A more detailed de- scription of the device can be found at chansde- vice.com&gt;. In a forward crash, the device lags the for- ward motion of the torso until the tethers pull tight and the device then moves forward with the head. When the forward motion of the driver's shoulders begins to be significantly restrained by the shoulder belts and the head starts to move forward relative to the chest, the de- vice minimizes that relative motion by the tension forces in the tethers being transferred to the collar and on into the taut shoulder belts. In effect, the device's main func- tion is to prevent or minimize forward head rotation rela- tive to the torso and the associated angular velocity. In so doing it minimizes the source of the high forces that loads the head and neck in a forward crash. This action also serves to reduce overall forward head motion in the vehicle. The Hutchens device used in these tests consisted of two main straps which run from the lap belt buckle, down through the crotch, and up the back ending with a D-ring on the upper back of each shoulder. The straps are sta- bilized laterally by auxiliary straps at the mid-chest and the waist. Short tethers are run from the D-rings up to a two- point attachment strap on each side of the driver's hel- met. A more detailed description of the device can be found at &lt;hutchensdevice.com&gt;. As the torso moves forward in a crash the forward motion of the pelvis into the lap belt tensions the vertical body straps. As the torso stops from shoulder restraint and the head begins to rotate forward relative to the torso, the vertically ori- ented straps running from the D-rings to the helmet are intended to diminish forward head rotation. Also, due to their orientation, the straps help reduce the neck tension load by sharing the load with the neck. The D-CEL device is similar to the to the Hutchens de- vice in principle, however, instead of attaching to the lap belt, the device uses a pelvic harness arrangement simi- lar to a parachute harness to anchor the vertical straps. It attaches to the helmet the same way as the Hutchens device. A more detailed description of the device can be found at &lt;hutchensdevice.com&gt;. 2309</page><page sequence="3">RESULTS The results from the tests are summarized in Table 1 for the peak neck axial tension (+) and compression (-) forces (Fz), peak fore (+) and aft (-) neck shear forces (Fx), peak neck fore (+) and aft (-) bending moment (My) and peak lateral bending moment (Mx).

D-CEL Device Neck Force-Time History 2312</page><page sequence="6">DISCUSSION The baseline average neck tension value of 5100 N Is indicative of a potentially fatal basal skull fracture condi- tion. In this test condition, the HANS® device significantly reduced the average peak neck tension value to 22% of the 4000 N limit. In fact, as has been noted in previous studies, during the phase of the forward motion where the baseline neck tension is produced, the HANS® device produces a low (average value 1121N) neck compres- sion force. The neck tension value occurs later during the rearward rebound motion of the head. The average neck tension values for both the baseline tests and the HANS® device tests are very comparable to those pro- duced in an entirely different study on a different type of crash sled as reported by Gideon, et al. (2002). The cor- responding values were 5091 N for the baseline and 938N for the HANS® device for the "early Hi-G" pulse of 47G peak at a 36 degree angle and a velocity change of 44 mph (71 km/h). The other two devices allowed neck tension to occur, but the Hutchens device reduced the average peak neck tension to the limit value of 4000N and the D-CEL device reduced the average peak neck tension value to 99% of the limit value. Figure 6 displays this information as comparative bar charts. Note that, although the Hutchens and D-CEL devices do not produce any sig- nificant neck compression forces, they both produce significant rearward neck shear forces. The neck com- pression injury assessment reference value used with the mid-size male Hybrid III dummy is 4000N and the cor- responding shear force value is 3100N (Mertz, 2002). Figure 7. displays the comparative neck moment data for the tests. Note that a high extension moment occurs in all tests. This is a characteristic of the dummy construc- tion when subjected to severe acceleration environ- ments and does not indicate an injury potential, even though they exceed the 57 Nm limit (Mertz, 2002) used with the dummy in all tests except those with the D-CEL device. This extension moment occurs early in the time sequence and is due to a "start-up" torque applied by the neck to the head as the torso is arrested by the shoulder belts. It occurs with very little relative rearward rotation of head upon the neck and is due to the stiff nodding block construction at the top joint of the Hybrid III neck. The HIC (Head Injury Criterion) values for the head accel- erations were below the FMVSS 208 limit value of 1 000 for the HANS® while the values for the baseline, Hutchens and D-CEL devices were above the limit. The Hutchens and D-CEL device HIC values were actually 20 % higher than the baseline due to slightly higher peak z-axis de- celeration values. When the head does not contact an object the validity of the HIC is not proven. Accordingly, the HIC values for all the devices are only useful to com- pare control of head motion, not injury potential. Thus, the values indicate significantly better control of the for- ward head whipping by the HANS® and a slight modifica- tion of the head motion for the Hutchens and D-CEL de- vices. The Hutchens and D-CEL devices allowed almost identical average forward head excursions to that of the baseline test. They were 46% and 50% greater than those allowed by the HANS® device. Figure 8 displays a comparison of this excursion data. The goal of racecar driver protection is to be effective at crash severities twice as great as those used in this test series (100G rather than 50G). In these 50G tests the Hutchens and D-CEL devices demonstrated borderline improvement in reducing the neck tension forces to at or below the 4000 N limit, and little or no reduction in for- ward head excursion. This indicates their effective range of protection in right frontal crashes is in the range of 50G severity. In comparison, the HANS® demonstrated a sig- nificant reduction in neck tension and forward head ex- cursion at the 50G test severity. This indicates that the HANS® device may provide effective protection at the 100G range of crash severity. It is likely that doubling the crash severity from the 50G level to 100G level would double the neck forces pro- duced in the crash. Accordingly, one approach to judg- ing the neck tension-reducing effective ness of a pro- posed head/neck restraint would be to lower the allow- able neck tension limit for 50G test levels to 2000 N to ensure adequate protection at the higher severity crashes. Limits on forward head excursion should also be included in future testing to help prevent hard con- tacts of the helmet/head with forward structure. Another approach could be to use the excellent per- formance of the HANS® as a baseline for judging all other head/neck restraints in terms of the parameters reported here. One method would be to obtain data on a pro- posed head/neck restraint and normalize the perform- ance parameters to that of the HANS® obtained under the same test conditions. This would minimize problems arising from differing test conditions at different test sites. Figures 9, 1 0, and 1 1 display such an approach for the neck forces, neck moments and forward head excur- sions in this test series. With this approach it is easily seen where the devices are comparable and where sig- nificant differences exist. The final step in judging the performance of a proposed device by this method would be to choose an allowable performance ratio for accep- tance. For example, if it were desired to have perform- ance within 20% of the HANS®, then a limit ratio of 1 .2 would be set on the charts. The method of reducing the neck tension limit suggested above would be equivalent to a ratio of 2.3, if applied in these tests. 2313</page><page sequence="7">Figure 6.

The test comparisons show that there are great differences in performance between the systems primarily due to significant differences in the principles of their design. The HANS® device proved to give consistently excellent results in controlling neck tension forces and forward head excursion at the crash severity used in the tests. The other devices provided borderline performance in controlling neck tension forces and no significant reduction in forward head ex- cursion at the crash severity used in the tests. Crash investigation of Indy car crashes with crash record- ers has shown that a racecar driver, when properly re- strained and protected, can sustain crash chassis decelerations of over 100 G without serious injuries. Ac- cordingly, the goal of a head/neck restraint system should be to provide a similar level of protection at the 100G crash level. Future testing of head/neck devices should judge the performance of the devices normalized to the performance of the HANS® device under the same conditions or use reduced values of neck tension limits to judge effectiveness in tests that are less severe than the 100G goal.
