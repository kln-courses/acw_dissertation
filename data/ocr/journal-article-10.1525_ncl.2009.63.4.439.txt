P. Thompson’s assertion that “the closer we are to 1650 [that  is, the closer we are to premodern antinomian sources], the  closer we seem to be to Blake.”2 According to this persuasive  and now familiar view, we hear Blake’s voice most clearly when  Nineteenth-Century Literature, Vol. 63, No. 4, pp. 439–460.

It is hard to believe, then, that the historicist  Blake we recognize today is only two hundred and fifty years  old; he seems much older, at least by a century, keeping spiri- tual company with Gerrard Winstanley and Abiezer Coppe. By thus attaching Blake to a residual premodernism, these  recent scholars have generally sought to underscore the ten- sion between early antinomian practices and the subsequent  emergence of “enthusiasm” as an enlightenment, regulatory  “smear-word,”3 to say nothing of the semantic changes that  would eventually turn “dangerous enthusiasm”4 into such an  innocuous, feel-good term that Norman Vincent Peale, the  original self-help guru, could supplement his international  bestseller The Power of Positive Thinking (1952) with a volume  urging those competing in the boom corporate economy of the  mid 1960s to understand that Enthusiasm Makes the Difference  (1967).5 Yet if the trend has been to point Blake away from this  modernizing future of regulation and containment, then there  3  As far as I know, Susie I. Tucker was the first to use this term in her still indispens- able Enthusiasm: A Study in Semantic Change (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1972),  p. 3, but in fact it has become commonplace.

Klein and  Anthony J. La Vopa (San Marino, Calif.: Huntington Library, 1998), pp. 29–49. Mee’s  Romanticism, Enthusiasm and Regulation provides the best recent account of the com- plex, various ways in which enlightenment culture came to associate “enthusiasm” with  religious fanaticism, delirium, and error as it tried to define itself against the religious  and political excesses of the seventeenth century.

Blake scholarship and criticism ought to be involved in mak- ing [Blake’s] messages available to a needy world. . . . Blake’s  messages are mainly ones of enthusiasm and good news, and  there is no reason for our sense of our various tasks with Blake  not to be enthusiastic, too.7 Given the reputation of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century en- thusiasm for contagious volatility, and for its tendency to over- come containment and spread to others, the mimetic nature of  the criticism on enthusiasm can hardly come as a surprise. If, ac- cording to Alexander Pope, Longinus became what he beheld  when he wrote his criticism on the Homeric sublime “with a Poet’s  Fire,” then something similar might be said of Blake’s critics: they  often express the enthusiasm they set out to describe.8 Finding  themselves caught up in Northrop Frye’s “fiery understanding,”  early reviewers of his Fearful Symmetry admired the author’s “un- flagging energy” and “great enthusiasm” for his subject.9 Jon Mee  6  “The Greeks represent Chronos or Time as a very Aged Man this is Fable but the  Real Vision of Time is in Eternal Youth” (William Blake, “A Vision of The Last Judg- ment,” in The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake, Newly Revised Edition, ed. David V.  Erdman [New York: Anchor Books, 1988], p. 563). 7  Adams, “Post-Essick Prophecy,” Studies in Romanticism, 21 (1982), 402–3. 8  See Pope, An Essay on Criticism (1711), in his Pastoral Poetry and An Essay on Criti- cism, ed. E. Audra and Aubrey Williams, vol. 1 of The Twickenham Edition of the Works  of Alexander Pope (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1961), p. 316, l. 676. Pope famously  describes Longinus as “An ardent Judge . . . , / Whose own Example strengthens all his  Laws, / And Is himself that great Sublime he draws” (Essay on Criticism, p. 316, ll. 677,  679–80). 9  In 1947, Edith Sitwell writes of Fearful Symmetry, “To say it is a magnificent, ex- traordinary book is to praise it as it should be praised, but in doing so one gives little  idea of the huge scope of the book and of its fiery understanding” (Sitwell, rev. of  Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake, by Northrop Frye, The Spectator, 179 [1947],  466). In the same year, Alfred C. Ames testifies, “Frye conducts his ambitious study with  NCL6304_01.indd   441 4/7/09   4:45:38 PM </page> <page sequence="4"> 442  nineteenth-century literature acknowledges that his own recent book on enthusiasm “is also  perhaps itself a work of reckless enthusiasm” (Romanticism, En- thusiasm and Regulation, p. 1). And any reader of Saree Makdisi  can instantly recognize that the dynamic, materialist “striving”  he admires in Blake—“always becoming anew, tracing and re- tracing different trajectories of actualization, existing in and as  and through striving” (Blake and the Impossible History of the 1790s,  p. 320)—also describes the joyful metamorphic cascade of his  own fierce rushing prose. Blake’s enthusiasm, then, runs back- ward and forward. Gathering its affective force from sources that  “are essentially untranslatable into a modern idiom” (Blake and  the Impossible History of the 1790s, p. 315), it launches itself into an  altogether different historical moment that would seem to pre- clude the very possibility of its reemergence but somehow does  not—as if enthusiasm itself were a continuously streaming coun- terpoint to modernity, a potentiality to be otherwise, a future  waiting to be mobilized by an audience whose faculties will have  been properly roused to act. The very desire to historicize enthu- siasm, and thus to identify its difference from our own moder- nity, is indistinguishable from a desire to activate that difference  anew, to put it to work in our still needy world. In Blake criti- cism, enthusiasm has been every bit as much about enabling the  future as it has been about respecting the archive of neglected  premodern radicals.10 unflagging energy, great enthusiasm, and immense erudition. . . . [Blake’s] vision . . .  is vouchsafed only to ‘the man with an opened center.’ The careful and sympathetic  reader of Fearful Symmetry will have great openings” (Ames, “Escaping Selfhood” [rev.  of Fearful Symmetry], Poetry, 71 [1947], 102–3). See Northrop Frye, Fearful Symmetry: A  Study of William Blake (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1947). 10  To put this another way: in critical practice, the premodern enthusiasm excavated  by scholarship serves as the ground of a countermodern enthusiasm, a set of opposi- tional hopes and desires already evident in Blake and persistent ever after. Blake en- tangled these two enthusiasms from the moment he drew on the dissenting cultures  (religious and political) that preceded modernization in order to formulate his critical  stand against nascent modernization. A similar entanglement of premodernity and  countermodernity recurs today, but with a difference, for Blake scholarship carries the  additional (and often tacit) burden of its late modernity. By reading Blake with enthu- siasm, critics seek to revive and sustain a countermodernity whose historical origins,  receding ever further into the past, can no longer be separated from our own interest  in reconstructing them. The premodern practices that survived into Blake’s era in ac- tive but diminished form now survive only archaeologically. NCL6304_01.indd   442 4/7/09   4:45:38 PM </page> <page sequence="5"> blake and the future of enthusiasm 443 There is more to this recursive relationship between old  and new enthusiasms than the idea, longstanding in the rheto- ric manuals, that strong emotion can leap the temporal and  spatial boundaries between subjects, that (as Edmund Burke  puts it in the concluding section of his Philosophical Enquiry into  the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful [1757] on “How  WORDS influence the passions”) “by the contagion of our pas- sions, we catch a fire already kindled in another.”11 In modern  critical practice, I want to suggest (and this by way of Sartre),  enthusiasm serves to persuade us that there is a future outside  or beyond our own dissatisfying modernity, that “impossible  history” is not only possible but actual, emerging now in the  affective experience of reading.12 Before we turn to Sartre, however, with his distinctive am- bivalence toward affect as an agent of transformation or as an  opening onto another history, there are two other preliminary  points to emphasize. Although their emphasis on enthusiasm  foregrounds the question of affect in criticism, Blake critics  are by no means alone right now in emphasizing the innova- tive agency of emotion. If, as Jon Mee suggests, “affect too has  11  Burke, A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful,  ed. T. J. Boulton (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1958), p. 175. 12  “Impossible history” refers to Makdisi’s title, William Blake and the Impossible History  of the 1790s, which itself quotes from Blake’s “Descriptive Catalogue” (1809): To histo- rians, “all is . . . a dull round of probabilities and possibilities; but the history of all times  and places, is nothing else but improbabilities and impossibilities; what we should say,  was impossible if we did not see it always before our eyes” (William Blake, A Descriptive  Catalogue of Pictures, Poetical and Historical Inventions, in Complete Poetry and Prose, p. 543).  But I also have in mind an account by Jacques Derrida, late in his career, of how the  impossible becomes actual in experience. His description amounts to a confession of  enthusiasm and personal possession: “[The] im-possible is not the inaccessible . . . : it  announces itself; it precedes me, swoops down upon and seizes me here and now in a  nonvirtualizable way, in actuality and not potentiality. It comes upon me from on high,  in the form of an injunction that does not simply wait on the horizon, that I do not  see coming, that never leaves me in peace and never lets me put it off until later. Such  an urgency cannot be idealized any more than the other as other can. This impossible  is thus not a (regulative) idea or ideal. It is what is most undeniably real. And sensible.  Like the other” (Derrida, Rogues: Two Essays on Reason, trans. Pascale-Anne Brault and  Michael Naas [Stanford: Stanford Univ. Press, 2005], p. 84; emphasis in original). Ac- cording to Derrida, then, it is feeling that substantiates the subject’s freedom from the  merely possible. The impossible and the future it opens onto are not just “undeniably  real” and “sensible”; they are undeniably real because they are sensible.

The recent scholarship on enthusiasm in Blake, after all, par- ticipates in a much larger academic trend: a sustained, inter- disciplinary “surge” in the theoretical, historical, and cognitive  study of emotion that has prompted one of its leading contrib- utors, Rei Terada, to “wonder where the attraction to emotion  comes from and why it comes just now.”13 Momentarily setting  aside the question of what emotion is, Terada turns a historicist  eye on the present to ask what emotion does, and what it does  now: what work does our enthusiasm for emotion perform in  our own critical practices and our own academic culture? What  difference would it make, say, if we read the recent work on  enthusiasm not within the context of Blake criticism or studies  in the history of religion but alongside works like Terada’s Feel- ing in Theory, Martha Nussbaum’s Upheavals of Thought, William  Reddy’s The Navigation of Feeling, Brian Massumi’s Parables for  the Virtual, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s Touching Feeling, Charles  Altieri’s The Particulars of Rapture, and Sianne Ngai’s Ugly Feel- ings, to mention only a few of the books on the subject that ap- peared in the same five-year period as the new studies by Mee  and Makdisi?14 At the same time, to call attention to the contemporaneity  of our own uses of emotion is not to claim that our enthusi- asm anachronistically displaces Blake’s. Indeed, I want to argue  rather the opposite: that Blake’s enthusiasm, despite its pre- modern roots, is already a substantially modern phenomenon,  and that the current academic enthusiasm for emotion be- longs to a continuum that includes Blake as one of its earliest  13  Terada, Feeling in Theory: Emotion after the “Death of the Subject” (Cambridge, Mass.:  Harvard Univ.

Our critical practices are not a departure from  Blake’s enthusiasm, or a falling away, but a future already held  within it. Already in Blake we see the poet turning emotion  (pity and wrath, lust and joy) into an object of critical study,  while also insisting that feeling (the arousal of the faculties, the  fiery chariot of contemplative thought) is itself the index of criti- cal agency in action. Already in Blake we see that the affective  moment in interpretation, the one that Satan’s watchfiends  cannot find, promises to open onto an unknown future inac- cessible to strictly instrumental forms of cognition. And, per- haps most important, we already see in Blake’s enthusiasm the  work that many progressive artists and critics will continually  ask of emotion for the next two hundred years: that it supply  immediate, experiential evidence of a transformative agency  whose effects cannot otherwise be measured. Rousing the fac- ulties into action, enthusiasm aims to convince the mobilized  reader that critical engagement does not merely interpret a  needy world but (as Karl Marx would urge) changes it, widen- ing its possibilities—even when no empirical evidence exists to  confirm that outcome.15 In all of these ways, Blake anticipates us as much as he re- vives 1650. And by us I mean not only Blake critics but also a wide  range of enthusiasts—humanists and posthumanists among  them—who, contesting “Descartes’ Error,”16 would agree with  15  According to Antonio Negri, Marx’s eleventh thesis on Feuerbach does not op- pose philosophy (interpreting the world) to action (changing the world); rather, it  calls upon philosophers to develop materialist practices of interpretation that func- tion as transformative actions: “It is possible to transform the world at the same time as  it is interpreted” (Negri, Time for Revolution, trans. Matteo Mandarini [New York and  London: Continuum, 2003], p. 158, n. 9.6; emphasis added). Derrida makes virtually  the same point in Specters of Marx with his revisionary paraphrase of Marx’s thesis, call- ing it “Marx’s injunction not just to decipher but to act and to make the deciphering  [the interpretation] into a transformation that ‘changes the world’” (Jacques Derrida,  Specters of Marx: The State of the Debt, the Work of Mourning, and the New International,  trans. Peggy Kamuf [New York and London: Routledge, 1994], p. 32). Regardless of  whether Marx would approve of these modifications, my interest lies in the frequency  with which critical intellectuals turn to affect to substantiate, in the body, their claim  that interpretation has indeed become active and transformative—not least in Time for  Revolution and Specters of Marx. 16  See Antonio R. Damasio, Descartes’ Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain  (New York: G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1994). NCL6304_01.indd   445 4/7/09   4:45:39 PM </page> <page sequence="8"> 446  nineteenth-century literature Blake that the body is a portion of the soul and that emotion  lies at the origin of transformational energies that are at once  intellectual and embodied. Blake stands at the early stage of a  modern critical legacy that posits the agency of emotion within  and against a world that would subordinate the full capabili- ties of response and action to instrumental reason. Against  the old enlightenment charge that enthusiasm overleaps the  space of reflection and is therefore incompatible with the in- tellectual distance required by modern critical judgment, and  against the charge that errant enthusiasm relies instead on ex- periential immediacy as evidence of its authenticity, this legacy  integrates the immediacy of enthusiasm into critical practice,  placing charged affect at the vanguard of critique, creativity,  and change. By the terms “critical practice” and “critical legacy” I  mean to include a whole range of activities: aesthetic (Blake),  scholarly (Blake critics), and theoretical (Sartre). Without col- lapsing important differences, I wish to underscore the con- tinuities among these areas. We commonly recognize that  Blake’s aesthetic production performs critical work, anticipat- ing later methods of critiquing ideology, but we rarely recog- nize the aesthetic and affective work performed by our own  critical acts, even when our criticism makes affect the explicit  object of its study. And I should clarify one further point: by  no means am I suggesting that the emotions involved in this  critical legacy are limited to high-voltage displays of enthusi- asm. In fact, these emotions can take many forms. They may  be thematized or not; they may involve the imperceptible in- fluence of long, slow time or the sudden rupture of a moment;  they may announce themselves as activism or passivity, or as a  displacement of that opposition altogether; they can beat with  a lively humanist pulse or with a strange, posthuman half-life.  In all of these ways and others, however, the emotion is not in- cidental but vital to the experience of change as it takes place,  or as the potential for change becomes active. It would supply  the evidence of change when no other evidence presents it- self. Even the least sentimental criticism has tended to harbor  this minor enthusiasm, holding fast to the idea that affect in  NCL6304_01.indd   446 4/7/09   4:45:39 PM </page> <page sequence="9"> blake and the future of enthusiasm 447 criticism indexes agency as it happens, even in the least prom- ising of situations.17 So what does Jean-Paul Sartre have to say  about Blake and the future of enthusiasm as I am sketching it  here? Although Sartre anticipates recent theories by defining  emotion simply and directly as “a transformation of the world,”  he also explains that affective transformations of this kind indi- cate more about situational constraint than they do about the  subject’s actual powers: At present, we can conceive of what an emotion is. It is a trans- formation of the world. When the paths traced out become too  difficult, or when we see no path, we can no longer live in so urgent  and difficult a world. All the ways are barred. However, we must act.  So we try to change the world, that is, to live as if the connection  between things and their potentialities were not ruled by determin- istic processes, but by magic. Let it be clearly understood that this  is not a game; we are driven against a wall, and we throw ourselves  into this new attitude with all the strength we can muster.18 17  Consider Sianne Ngai’s brilliant recent work on Ugly Feelings. In one sense, Ngai’s  discussion of emotions involved in situations of “suspended” or “restricted agency”  would seem a useful counterpoint to any association between emotion and agency.  “Ugly” emotions arise precisely when, for one reason or another, we cannot act; they  hang about us as reminders that we cannot transform the world. At the same time, how- ever, Ngai credits these emotions with a critical or diagnostic function: despite their  appearance of passivity, they act as readings or “interpretations of predicaments” that  disable agency; they provide crucial information about “general state[s] of obstructed  agency” that lie beyond our current powers of articulation or conceptualization. That  is, they provide critical access to situational constraints we may not otherwise perceive.  “Part of this book’s agenda,” Ngai writes, is “to recuperate several of these negative  affects for their critical productivity” (Ugly Feelings, pp. 1–3). To the extent that ugly feel- ings get rehabilitated as critical feelings (productive forms of critical engagement)— and to the extent that aversion, even in situations of suspension and constraint, opens  onto the possibility of future agency, acting as a prelude to empowerment—these use- ful, recuperated feelings hardly seem ugly at all. One irony of Ngai’s argument is that,  taken to its logical conclusion, it leaves us altogether without ugly feelings. 18  Jean-Paul Sartre, The Emotions: Outline of a Theory, trans.

A man faints in order  to make the object of his fear disappear; the threatening ob- ject “disappears” only in the subjective world evacuated by the  man’s emotion. A girl finds it too painful to confess her symp- toms to her doctor; when she breaks down in tears, her emo- tion substitutes a magical world in which she is no longer obli- gated to speak, turning her doctor into a comforter rather than  an inquisitor, although the condition that brought her to him  in the first place remains unaddressed. Emotion arises, then,  when we must act in an impoverished world hostile to desire  and blocking all but the most meager paths of action (“all the  ways are barred”), a world (as Sartre goes on to describe it)  that we cannot really alter because in it we can initiate change  only instrumentally, by “modify[ing] a particular instrument  and this by means of another instrument which refers to other  instruments and so on to infinity” (The Emotions, pp. 89–90).  Emotion transforms a world dense with mechanisms and ob- stacles, altering subjectively (“by magic”) what it cannot alter  otherwise, modifying appearances “without modifying . . . ac- tual structure[s]” (p. 60). In the affective moment we feel as if  we occupy a world subject to our powers of redescription. By  equating emotion with magic, Sartre recalls a long history of  debate about the power of the imagination to transfigure the  world, but his disenchantment of emotion goes a step further,  explaining how such enthusiasm takes hold no matter how  phantasmatic its transformational agency may appear. Emo- tion, he argues, requires no corroboration beyond its own seri- ous immediacy. Ratified directly by physiological change (ris- ing skin temperatures, vasoconstriction or dilation, and so on),  its “magical action” feels as palpable and effective as any other  form of action in the world.19 As Sartre puts it, emotion “set[s]  19  “Ratify” is a verb that Fredric Jameson uses to describe the work of emotion in  Sartre: “Sartre has spoken of the way emotion, to strengthen itself, to ratify the merely  mental reaction with the solidity of the flesh, fills itself out with physical concomitants,  such as blushing, trembling, cold sweat: these are the moments of ‘seriousness’ in real  emotion” (Jameson, Sartre: The Origins of a Style [New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1961],  p. 94). Jameson recognizes, in other words, that Sartrean emotion serves to substanti- ate and embody experiences that might otherwise remain merely phenomenological,  unrealized anywhere but in the mind. It remains unclear whether Jameson sees this  NCL6304_01.indd   448 4/7/09   4:45:40 PM </page> <page sequence="11"> blake and the future of enthusiasm 449 up a magical world by using the body as a means of incanta- tion” (The Emotions, p. 70). Unable to change our situation, we  instead perceive the world as if it had adjusted itself to the al- tered contours of our embodied feeling. Whatever one might think of Sartre’s account generally  (and it has not fared well among philosophers of emotion),20  its value for thinking about critical practice, Blake’s and ours,  lies in Sartre’s understanding that affective agency arises spe- cifically in response to a perception of overdetermined systems  that seem to preclude the possibility of meaningful agency in  the first place. When Sartre likens the deterministic world to  “the moving plates of the coin-making machines on which . .  . ball-bearings are made to roll . . . across a determined route,  kind of emotional “transformation” as a wish-fulfilling fantasy or as participation in an  actual, historical dynamism, for his own analysis of Sartre renders it either way at differ- ent times. Sartrean emotion is “a kind of second-best intoxication” that compensates  for the “stubborn perseverance” of a seemingly immutable world; it is an embodied fan- tasia that erupts when change outside one’s own body seems impossible. However, it is  also a nearly apocalyptic experience that tears away false appearances of stability to re- veal a rupturing historical turbulence beneath: “the revelation of the historical nature  of something thought of as permanent and changeless” (Sartre: The Origins of a Style,  pp. 92, 95). Already in this, his first book, based on his doctoral dissertation, Jameson  understands the strong appeal of the emotions as an index of change. While their very  appeal renders the emotions suspect, he is not ready to give them up, especially when  faced with the anxiety of blocked history: “a massive appearance of permanence [that]  restricts not only the development of individual destinies but even the mobility of ideas  and the spontaneity of our language” (Sartre: The Origins of a Style, p. 92). 20  Traditionally, Sartre’s critics have complained that he reduces emotion to inten- tional action. Privileging beliefs over physiology, he anticipates the cognitive theory of  emotion, but he goes too far, describing emotions that are so purposive as to be almost  voluntary. According to Robert C. Solomon, Sartre understands emotions as “voluntary  ways in which we alter our consciousness of events and things to give us a more pleasing  view of the world. . . . our emotions are strategies we employ to avoid action, to avoid  responsibility, to ‘flee from freedom,’ in the language of Being and Nothingness” (Solo- mon, What Is an Emotion? Classic and Contemporary Readings, Second Edition [New York:  Oxford Univ. Press, 2003], pp. 191–92). According to Jerome Neu, Sartre “believes all  emotions are actions,” though “not, to be sure, . . . ordinary intentional action.” Neu  writes: “This is a reversal of ordinary assumptions as radical as [William] James’s. We  usually regard emotions as rooted in the body and thus as at least partly passive, as the  word passions might itself suggest—things that sweep over us without our will or con- sent.” Sartre, however, “gives us a sense of being more responsible for our lives than  we might like to believe,” representing emotion not only “as action,” but “as chosen.”  Jerome Neu, A Tear Is an Intellectual Thing: The Meanings of Emotion (New York: Oxford  Univ. Press, 2000), pp. 26–27.

Facing such a complete and therefore  daunting system of forces, the cultural theorist exercises critical  agency at his own risk, encountering the haunting dilemma that  Fredric Jameson aptly calls “a ‘winner loses’ logic”: What happens is that . . . the more powerful the vision of some  increasingly total system or logic . . . the more powerless the  reader comes to feel. Insofar as the theorist wins, therefore, by  constructing an increasingly closed and terrifying machine, to  that very degree he loses, since the critical capacity of his work is  thereby paralyzed, and the impulses of negation and revolt, not  to speak of those of social transformation, are increasingly per- ceived as vain and trivial in the face of the model itself.21 Jameson identifies this self-canceling tendency with Michel  Foucault, but having begun his career studying Sartre and re- turning to him periodically ever since, Jameson also notes its  “strange quasi-Sartrean irony” (Postmodernism, p. 5). He might  as well have called the “closed and terrifying machine” of this  logic “Urizenic” and the irony of its critique “Blakean.” Nicho- las Williams comes close to doing just that in the first, penetrat- ing pages of his Ideology and Utopia in the Poetry of William Blake,  where he identifies a potentially disabling impasse that any  reader of Blake must negotiate, the inevitable standoff between  innovation and compulsory repetition staged by the poet’s  work: “the exhilarating newness of [Blake’s] conceptions” coex- ists right alongside “a crushing, almost debilitating pessimism,”  “a claustrophobic sense of . . . already determined futures.”22  The problem lies in the fact that Blake grasps the constraints of  21  Jameson, Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism (Durham, N.C.:  Duke Univ. Press, 1991), pp. 5–6. 22  Williams, Ideology and Utopia in the Poetry of William Blake (Cambridge: Cambridge  Univ. Press, 1998), pp. 2–3. NCL6304_01.indd   450 4/7/09   4:45:40 PM </page> <page sequence="13"> blake and the future of enthusiasm 451 Urizenic ideology almost too well; the special power of his so- cial analysis lies in its thoroughness, its perception, as Williams  puts it, of a “chain which links all segments of society in a fallen  whole and which ultimately binds consciousness itself” (Ideology  and Utopia in the Poetry of William Blake, p. 19). Given this idea  of “an increasingly closed and terrifying machine,” in which  even the social critic is a product of the system he would cri- tique (a problem that Williams associates with “Mannheim’s  paradox”),23 one begins to understand Williams’s emphasis on  exhilaration, for without “the exhilarating newness of [Blake’s]  conceptions” to ground critical agency in the immediacy of  feeling, one might be tempted to explain the apparent innova- tion of these conceptions as a standard deviation allowed for  by the Urizenic system. Without the exemption of enthusiasm  to ratify the possibility of transformation, the Urizenic subject  might have no future—or as Sartre might say, no exit. A similar conjunction between system and affective agency  lies at the center of William Blake and the Impossible History of  the 1790s, where Makdisi heightens the exhilaration of Blake’s  enthusiasm—the “élan vital ” of his “making, desiring, forming,  changing, striving” (p. 291)—even as he deepens the pessimism  of Blake’s insight into the modernizing constraints of Urizenic  “organ-ization”: “Blake is, in effect, arguing that there can be  no escape from the determination of the social field and its  rule of necessity” (William Blake and the Impossible History of the  1790s, p. 145). All the ways are barred, and although a radical  politics must therefore strive to transform the social field itself,  the totalizing nature of that field seems to have anticipated and  structured any such efforts in advance. But in keeping with my  claim that the future of Blake’s enthusiasm lies not only in Blake  studies but across disciplines as well, perhaps we might briefly  consider the parallel case of Brian Massumi’s Parables for the  Virtual: Movement, Affect, Sensation, a book that shares Makdisi’s  23  “Mannheim’s contribution to the concept of ideology was his realization that  ideology expanded to incorporate his own position as philosopher and observer of his- tory. The curious position of the ideology critic, whose own critique is itself subject to  the charge of ideology, has become known as ‘Mannheim’s paradox’” (Williams, Ideol- ogy and Utopia in the Poetry of William Blake, p. 9). NCL6304_01.indd   451 4/7/09   4:45:40 PM </page> <page sequence="14"> 452  nineteenth-century literature vocabulary of “virtual” energies, as well as his passion for Spi- noza and Gilles Deleuze. Massumi’s distinction between affect  and emotion has proven attractive to recent theorists of feeling:  in his account, emotion names a determinate content belong- ing to a clearly defined subject while affect becomes a dynamic,  modal intensity that escapes fixed identity. It is important to  recognize, however, that Massumi’s entire undertaking begins  as an attempt to reintroduce agency into studies of ideology  and subject position that—following a kind of “‘winner loses’  logic”—have resulted inadvertently in gridlock. When Massumi  laments the effect of aligning spatial concepts of ideology with  airtight, immutable systems, his terms recall the immobilizing  machine-worlds described by Blake, Sartre, and Jameson: Where has the potential for change gone? How does a body  perform its way out of a definitional framework that is not only  responsible for its very “construction,” but seems to prescript ev- ery possible signifying and countersignifying move as a selection  from a repertoire of possible permutations on a limited set of  predetermined terms? How can the grid itself change?  (Par- ables for the Virtual, p. 3) In this model of the social field, how could the subject of ide- ology be anything other than a ball-bearing rolling down a  complicated maze of predetermined paths? As Massumi’s lan- guage already anticipates, it would be by means of the moving  body’s ability to outperform structural, definitional constraint.  Against the gridlock of subject formation, it becomes the task of  affect—of “the slightness of ongoing qualitative change,” “felt  and unforeseen,” of “the charge of indeterminacy carried by a  body” in motion (Parables of the Virtual, pp. 1, 5)—to introduce  a feeling of ongoing difference that makes transformation not  only possible but inevitable. For Massumi the transformative  energies of affect—always at work everywhere, if only one had  eyes to see—turn even the critic’s own practice into an engine  of change. Urging us to adopt “affirmative  methods,” he offers  this advice to the critic: If you don’t enjoy concepts and writing and don’t feel that when  you write you are adding something to the world, if only the  NCL6304_01.indd   452 4/7/09   4:45:41 PM </page> <page sequence="15"> blake and the future of enthusiasm 453 enjoyment itself, and that by adding that ounce of positive ex- perience to the world you are affirming it, celebrating its poten- tial, tending its growth, in however small a way, however really  abstractly—well, just hang it up.  (Parables for the Virtual, pp.  12–13) Apparently, enthusiasm does make the difference: feeling that the  critic adds to the world, tends its growth, celebrates its potential—  and piling on clauses as evidence—makes it so. One could hardly  imagine a better example of Sartre’s definition of emotion as in  itself “a transformation of the world,” or of his idea that emotion  (here “affect”) conjures “a magical world by using the body as a  means of incantation.” In effect, Sartre’s theory disenchants any  such correspondence between the strength of the enthusiast’s  feelings and the strength of his powers. It teaches us to be wary  whenever emotion arises to supply exactly the reassurance that  an anxious and frustrated agent needs. It would be wrong, however, to conclude  that Sartre sets out to discredit emotion altogether, and more  accurate to suggest that he interrogates the implicit claims of af- fective agency in order to decouple emotion from the promise  of empowerment. This motive becomes apparent only toward  the end of The Emotions when he turns a discussion of horror  and wonder into an occasion to introduce a new distinction be- tween types of emotion and the magical practices they involve.  Most emotions, he argues, serve our desire to transform the  world—they emanate from us; but some emotions happen to us,  originating in resources outside our own needs. “In emotion,”  Sartre writes, consciousness . . . abruptly transforms the determined world in  which we live into a magical world. But there is a reciprocal action:  this world itself sometimes reveals itself to consciousness as magi- cal instead of determined, as was expected of it. Indeed, we need  not believe that the magical is an ephemeral quality which we im- pose upon the world as our moods dictate. Here is an existential  structure of the world which is magical.  (The Emotions, p. 83) NCL6304_01.indd   453 4/7/09   4:45:41 PM </page> <page sequence="16"> 454  nineteenth-century literature And moments later he concludes: Thus, there are two forms of emotion, according to whether it is  we who constitute the magic of the world to replace a determin- istic activity which cannot be realized, or whether it is the world  itself which abruptly reveals itself as being magical.  (p. 85) In these latter cases, emotions such as horror and wonder dis- close a world that answers neither to our desires nor to deter- ministic laws, bypassing altogether the problem of agency and  impasse that structures the ordinary uses of emotion. Rather  than transforming the world to serve the subject’s needs, the  magic involved in this kind of emotion (and especially in horror)  estranges both subject and world. It is odd that Sartre’s figure for this affective alienation is  a face—or more precisely, the horror that one might feel upon  seeing a stranger’s face at one’s window: “suddenly a grinning  face appears flattened against the window pane; I feel invaded  by terror” [un visage grimaçant apparaît soudain et se colle à la vitre  de la fenêtre; je me sens envahi de terreur] (The Emotions, p. 82).  All along Sartre has treated the ordinary work performed by  emotion as a kind of general prosopopoeia (prosopon, “face”),  though he does not use that term: emotion magically animates  a mechanical, material world that is otherwise dead to our in- terests. This face, however, undoes prosopopoeia. Suddenly an  originary and inhuman world faces us; it presents a mask that  exposes the limits of the anthropomorphic function, bringing  us “face to face” (The Emotions, p. 87) with an otherness that we  understand has neither subjectivity nor face.24 If this terrifying  24  Reading the famous “roots” passage in Sartre’s Nausea (1938), Jameson describes  Sartre’s effort to turn prosopopoeia and anthropomorphism against themselves. In this  case the lingering, exaggerated prosopopoeia calls attention to its own rhetorical in- adequacy, to the paradox that access to things “mute, stubborn, inaccessible” comes  only when, “through a process of humanization,” they are “rendered in the language  of that which absolutely they are not” (Sartre: The Origins of a Style, p. 108). Rather than  pretending to represent radical otherness transparently, as if that were possible, “the  extreme humanization of things is the one formulation of them which will not falsify  them: we know that they are not human, that they are the absolutely non-human, and  the terms are sufficiently exaggerated for us to make no mistake about it” (Sartre: The  Origins of a Style, p. 109). Thus when Sartre provides the alien world with a face in The  Emotions: Outline of a Theory, or when he writes, “In order that an object may in reality  NCL6304_01.indd   454 4/7/09   4:45:41 PM </page> <page sequence="17"> blake and the future of enthusiasm 455 apparition draws on the archetypal scene of horror in Franken- stein where the creature appears with “ghastly grin” “at the case- ment” outside Victor’s remote Scottish laboratory,25 then Sartre  also departs significantly from this source. Here we experience  the figure as magical not because we have conjured it ourselves,  as Victor conjured his creature by animating a body composed  of dead parts, but because it follows no recognizable rules or  laws. Rather than emphasizing the facial expression of deep  emotion (the “ghastly grin” in Frankenstein), Sartre draws our  attention to the flatness of the face pressed against the window- pane. This face is not a figure for personal, interior turmoil but  for depthless surface. It manifests a suddenly strange world lack- ing the ordinary orientation of three dimensions, and its action  is adhesive (se coller—to cling together; coller—to paste or glue),  joining exteriorities in an all-surface world that no longer allows  for a protective distance between subject and object. Flattened  against the window, this face is also flattened directly against  us, for in the unitary, depthless field of horror, objects touch  immediately without passing through the intervening medium  of time and space. Here neither our emotional transformations  nor our rational constructions can serve us. “We” can neither  faint nor run away. There is no “away,” for events no longer occur  step-by-step over distances.26 Here even “doors, locks, walls,  appear terrible, it must realize itself as an immediate and magical presence face to face  with consciousness” (The Emotions, p. 87), he is not humanizing the alien but demon- strating the limits of language. Writing on the anthropomorphism in Nausea, Jameson  comes very close to observing the horror-effect of the face flattened against the win- dowpane in Sartre’s The Emotions: “behind this terrifying suddenly human mask, the  inhuman being of things makes its presence felt” (Sartre: The Origins of a Style, p. 109;  emphasis added). For another reading of Sartre’s face at the window, see the conclu- sion to Terada, Feeling in Theory, pp. 152–57. 25  See Mary Shelley, Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus: The 1818 Version, 2d ed.,  ed. D. L. Macdonald and Kathleen Scherf (Peterborough, Ontario: Broadview Press,  1999), pp. 190–91. 26  Sartre writes: “In horror . . . we suddenly perceive the upsetting of the determinis- tic barriers. That face which appears at the pane—we do not first take it as belonging to  a man who might open the door and with a few steps come right up to us. On the con- trary, he is given, passive as he is, as acting at a distance. He is in immediate connection,  on the other side of the window, with our body; we live and undergo his signification,  and it is with our own flesh that we establish it. But at the same time it obtrudes itself; it  denies the distance and enters into us” (The Emotions, pp. 85–86). No longer an instru- ment in a world of instruments, the window does not have to be opened or broken or  NCL6304_01.indd   455 4/7/09   4:45:41 PM </page> <page sequence="18"> 456  nineteenth-century literature and arms [instruments that might modify other instruments in  a world where mechanics prevail] are not recourses against . . .  menaces” (The Emotions, p. 89). In sum, Sartre introduces the example of horror in order to  differentiate between two types of emotion: those we initiate “in  order to escape the pressure of the world” and those that happen  to us “when the superstructures laboriously built by reason cave  in” (The Emotions, pp. 77, 84–85), though not because of any- thing we ourselves have done. Here, perhaps, is where his theory  of emotion has something to say about how we read (and how we  read Blake), for Sartre is essentially describing two ways in which  emotion makes indeterminacy available to experience. Through  emotion we discover that there is an indeterminacy that we want  and an indeterminacy that happens regardless of what we want.  We mobilize the first indeterminacy when we observe no other  way to create time and space for agency in a world too difficult  and overdetermined. This indeterminacy serves our needs by  magically transforming the world, opening it to our powers of  reinterpretation. The second indeterminacy—if it exists at all— has nothing to do with our ways of organizing the world, rational  or emotional, except occasionally and abruptly to reveal itself,  like the sudden flattening of a face at a windowpane. In effect,  Sartre is urging us to trust only those emotions detached from  the promise of transformation, emotions that do nothing for us— nothing, that is, but reveal that there is a world that does not act  as object to our subject. And though Sartre’s distinction between  active and receptive emotions does little to advance the cause  of a new politics, and in fact works to slow the pursuit of any  politics built upon the enthusiast’s sense of his ready and impa- tient powers, it does enable us to ask one last series of questions  about Blake’s enthusiasm and our own: in modern critical prac- tices, when do emotions stand in as a proxy for jeopardized or  attenuated agency? When, if ever, do they open onto a world in- different to our desires for transformation, a world that remains  entered in order for this face to touch us. Even our bodily response, our experience of  horror, “is no longer ours; it is the expression of the face, the movements of the body  of the other person which come to form a synthetic whole with the disturbance of our  organism” (The Emotions, p. 86). NCL6304_01.indd   456 4/7/09   4:45:42 PM </page> <page sequence="19"> blake and the future of enthusiasm 457 unfamiliar precisely because it does not correspond to anything  we want? And finally, is it possible to experience affect in read- ing as something other than a pledge of agency or a promise of  empowerment? Of course it is not difficult to locate moments in Blake’s  illuminated books where the magical transformation of the  world seems to coincide with an empowering affective agency.  In the celebrated sequence that concludes the first book of  Milton (1804), for instance, with its glorious vision of nature  transfigured by the sons of Los, there is little question (to  adopt Sartre’s language) as to “whether it is we who constitute  the magic of the world . . . or whether it is the world itself  which abruptly reveals itself as being magical” (The Emotions,  p. 85). When Los declares his newly recovered prophetic om- nipotence (“both Time &amp; Space obey my will”), he speaks as  if the desire for empowerment were fulfilled and the magical  world were something his redeemed agency makes happen.27  Here time and space are the ongoing product of a fully hu- man vision, not an impoverished physics. If revealed “Nature  is a Vision of the Science of the Elohim,” as the last words of  Book the First indicate (Milton, p. 128; Plate 29, l. 65), then  that is because “every Natural Effect has a Spiritual Cause”  (p. 124; Plate 26, l. 44) and “every Generated Body” is in- ternally “a building of magnificence, / Built by the Sons of  Los” (p. 123; Plate 26, ll. 31–33). We tend to associate the  gathering strength of Los’s imaginative powers in Milton with  his enhanced mobility; strapping on Blake’s sandals, Los joins  with Blake and Milton to move through a fallen world that  now yields to his striving. Suddenly all the ways are no lon- ger barred. What we may not notice at first is the extent to  which this change in motion depends upon a prior change  in emotion. Before Milton can fall like a star into Blake’s left  foot, he must first enter Blake’s world by falling “thro Albions  heart” (Milton, p. 114; Plate 20, l. 41). The whole redemptive  sequence begins only when dormant Albion, “Feeling the elec- tric flame of Miltons awful precipitate descent” (p. 114; Plate  27  William Blake, Milton, a Poem in 2 Books, in Complete Poetry and Prose, p. 117; Plate  22, l. 17. NCL6304_01.indd   457 4/7/09   4:45:42 PM </page> <page sequence="20"> 458  nineteenth-century literature 20, ll. 25–26; emphasis added), starts to stir upon his couch.  It is the affect altering that alters all—that is, the transforma- tion of the world begins in a moment of kindled affect, a mo- ment of transmission when “words influence the passions”  and a poet finds a way into a reader’s fallen heart. By the end  of Book the First, all of nature is moving. Even the sky follows  the lead of human feet, for if a man should “move his dwell- ing-place, his heavens also move” (Milton, p. 127; Plate 29, l.  12). The transformed world answers to the motions of heart  and feet, its magic conjured “by using the body as a means of  incantation.” And yet emotion in Blake does not always correspond to  empowered striving, and there may yet be places where his  work opens onto feelings that do not ask the world to shape  itself around our desires. Just before Milton enters into its de- scription of the magical world, Los, in what amounts to his  final speech in the book, issues one last set of instructions to  his sons: . . . Break not Forth in your wrath lest you also are vegetated by Tirzah Wait till the Judgement is past, till the Creation is consumed And then rush forward with me into the glorious spiritual Vegetation; the Supper of the Lamb &amp; his Bride. . . . (Milton, p. 122; Plate 25, ll. 57–61) How can we square Los’s demand—to wait before rushing—with  another that he makes just a few lines earlier urging his sons to  continue their labors before resting: “. . . only a little moment /  Still abstain from pleasure &amp; rest, in the labours of eternity /  And you shall Reap the whole Earth, from Pole to Pole!” (Mil- ton, p. 122; Plate 25, ll. 45–47)? At stake is the transformation  of the instrumental world, for “The Great Vintage &amp; Harvest”  are at hand (p. 121; Plate 25, l. 17), but it is not clear whether  this apocalyptic event would result from one’s working or one’s  waiting. Is transformation something that one should make hap- pen (without waiting) or let happen (without rushing)? Does  transformation accompany the active or the receptive emo- tions? That this is a problem not only for Los’s sons but also for  NCL6304_01.indd   458 4/7/09   4:45:42 PM </page> <page sequence="21"> blake and the future of enthusiasm 459 the reader appears in the treacherous enjambment that Blake  all but dares the reader to negotiate successfully, an impossible  crossing between lines, between worlds, that recalls the long  history of failed revolutionary transitions and unfulfilled apoca- lyptic promises. What would it mean to “rush forward . . . into  the glorious spiritual / Vegetation,” especially when Los has just  warned his sons not to “Break . . . / Forth” prematurely or risk  being “vegetated by Tirzah” (Milton, p. 122; Plate 25, ll. 57–58)?  Just to the right of these lines, Blake positions a small hybrid fig- ure rushing into the transitional space of enjambment and ap- parently vegetating in mid-air—as if to signal the fate of an over- zealous agency.28 By the time that this plate ends, just a few lines  later, Blake’s magical world is already coming into view (“Thou  seest the Constellations in the deep &amp; wondrous Night” [Milton,  p. 123; Plate 25, l. 66]; “Thou seest the gorgeous clothed Flies  that dance &amp; sport in summer” [p. 123; Plate 26, l. 2]), but just  for a moment this enjambment stalls, asking the reader not to  cross over into a world that his own affective agency will trans- form, but to slow the momentum of his enthusiasm. Rather than  “Hurrying the Will in Pursuit of [its] Object” (one definition  of enthusiasm),29 Blake opens a space irreducible to activity or  passivity, where the impassioned work of reading must also ac- commodate the slow time of waiting. Would the feeling of ur- gent but suspended agency required by such a space disclose an  altogether other world, as Sartre suggests? How could we know  the answer to that question when we have hardly begun to no- tice those emotions in Blake that, rather than transforming the  world, transform the reader’s desire for empowerment?

Although this transition is often eclipsed  by the current historicist tendency to locate Blake in the 1790s, with roots even earlier,  Blake’s enthusiasm performs a work that progressive critics will ask of emotion for the  next two hundred years: to supply immediate, experiential evidence of a transformative  agency whose effects cannot otherwise be measured. Historicist interest in attaching  Blake to premodern affects is bound up with a modern desire to mobilize enthusiasm  anew and catalyze a future beyond modernity. Sartre’s The Emotions provides a useful  framework for understanding the aspirations and anxieties that have led criticism to  stake its claims to agency on the evidence of emotion. Describing a machine-world that  points back to the constraints of Blake’s Urizenic starry mill and forward to the ideo- logical systems we associate with criticism after Foucault, Sartre helps identify a critical  legacy that posits a “magical” agency of emotion within and against instrumental rea- son. He also raises key questions about the origin and efficacy of such affective trans- formation. When do critical emotions serve as a proxy for the agency we feel we lack?  When, if ever, do they open onto a world indifferent to our desires for transformation?  Is it possible to think of reading as something other than empowerment?
