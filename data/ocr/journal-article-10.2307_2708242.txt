<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE TEXTBOOK TRADITION IN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY, 1600-1650 BY SISTER PATRICIA REIF Criticism of education-teachers, schools, requirements-has been the therapeutic sport of students through the ages, but it seemed to reach an all-time high in the XVIIth century. A continuous barrage of criticism, sometimes playful, at other times abusive, was directed against the scholastic curriculum of XVIIth-century universities by most of the century's eminent men. Gilbert, Galileo, Bacon, Descartes, Webster, Hall, Hobbes, Glanville, Boyle, Locke, and Newton-to name only a few-expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the kind of education they had received.1 They denounced traditional academic learning for multiple defects: for bookish preoccupation with words rather than things; for an over-reliance on the authority of tradition which discouraged further research; for producing disputatious minds more intent on sophistical victory than on truth; for failing to pre- pare students for the real tasks of human life; and finally, for seri- ously impeding the advancement of knowledge. All parts of the curriculum were assailed, but especially phi- losophy. Descartes' comment in the Discourse on Method is typical: Philosophy teaches us to talk with an appearance of truth about all things, and to make ourselves admired by the less learned . . . it has been studied for many centuries by the most outstanding minds without having produced anything which is not in dispute and consequently doubtful.2 Metaphysics, ethics, and logic were each attacked in turn,3 but per- haps no subject was under greater attack than natural philosophy (also called philosophy of nature, natural science, physics, physiology, and cosmology). Writing at mid-century, John Webster sums up the principal grievances against academic natural philosophy: This School Philosophy is altogether void of true and infallible demonstra- tion, observation, and experiment, the only certain means and instruments to discover and anatomize nature's occult and central operations; which 1 For a collection of typical criticisms, see Richard Foster Jones, Ancients and Moderns: A Study of the Battle of the Books (St. Louis, 1936). 2 Rene Descartes, Discourse on Method, translated by Laurence J.

And to him, this new "experimental phi- losophy" seemed to render obsolete the kind of natural philosophy taught in the schools. The vehemence and universality of the polemic against academic natural philosophy lead one to wonder just what sort of philosophy was actually taught, and whether the criticisms of it were justifiable. What was the content of the natural philosophy course, and by what methods was it developed and demonstrated? How much original work was being done? Were the professors aware of new discoveries and new methods of explanation, and what was their attitude toward them? What sort of doctrinal continuity, if any, existed between Aristotle, the great doctors of the XIIIth century, and the XVIIth- century teachers of philosophy? And in what respects, if any, did these latter philosophers influence the development of science? For historical questions like these to be adequately answered we need a comprehensive picture of the XVIIth-century course in natural philosophy. It is especially important to find out what this course was like during the first half of the century, because from 1640 on there was a gradual substitution of the Cartesian and atomistic philosophies of nature for the traditional natural philosophy taught in the school. One way of building up such a picture is to examine some of the natural philosophy textbooks actually used in XVIIth-century college and university instruction.5 Obviously, to complete the picture we would have to consult the official statutes on curriculum as well as the records of actual classroom or tutorial instruction provided in students' notebooks. However, due to the fact that during the late XVIth and early XVIIth century the textbook as we now know it was 4 John Webster, Academiarum Examen, or the Examination of Academies (Lon- don, 1654), ch. 6, p. 68. 5 Several studies have begun this work: William Costello, The Scholastic Cur- riculum at Early Seventeenth-Century Cambridge (Cambridge, Mass., 1958), 83- 102; Samuel Morison, Harvard in the Seventeenth Century (Cambridge, Mass., 1936), Vol. I, chs. 7-13; and Lynn Thorndike, History of Magic and Experimental Science (New York, 1958), Vol. VII, ch. 13.</page><page sequence="3">TEXTBOOKS IN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY: 1600-50 19 fast becoming one of the most important educational instruments, the main contours in the picture can be drawn by consulting the ordinary textbook tradition. The present study is based on approximately twenty such text- books. Their authors are quite obscure today, but there is abundant evidence to show that they were the most popular and influential manualists of their day.6 Geographically considered, they represent most of the countries of Europe: from Germany there are John Henry Alsted, John Combach, Marcus Friedrich Wendelin, Clement Timpler, John Magirus, Christoph Scheibler, Daniel Sennert, and John Stier; from France, Eustace of St. Paul; from Spain, Rudolph Arriaga and Francis Oviedo; from Holland, Franco Burgersdijck and Gilbert Jacchaeus; from Italy, Julius Pacius and Raphael Aversa; from Danzig, Bartholomew Keckermann; from Denmark, Caspar Bartholin; and from England, John Case and Robert Sanderson.7 Some of them are Protestant, some Catholic. All of their works are written in Latin, the language of formal education in most European schools until the XVIIIth century. At least six of them were known to major non-academic philosophers of the period: Descartes read Eustace at La Fleche; Leibniz praised the encyclopedic work of Alsted; Bayle pays a backhanded compliment to Arriaga; Locke refers pejoratively to Burgersdijck; Magirus' Physiologiae Peripate- ticae libri sex, first published in 1597 with a ninth edition in 1634, was used by Newton, and Daniel Sennert's work in chemistry was critically admired by Robert Boyle. Nor was their influence re- stricted to Europe. Many of their works were brought to America by those who taught divinity to the sons of the first settlers; they were used at Harvard College for several generations. How can one best describe the sort of natural philosophy found in these manuals? To apply such general classificatory labels as "scholastic" or "Aristotelian"-as historians are wont to do-is not very helpful. Even if one uses such qualifiers as "later," "decadent," or "eclectic," the resultant descriptions are still quite uninformative. Furthermore, when such descriptions imply total continuity-tem- poral, doctrinal, and methodological-with the originators of the tradition in question, they are not only vague, but very inaccurate. Like any other living tradition, the philosophy of the schools under- went considerable modification as it was interpreted and handed down by successive adherents. Hence, only by specifying these modi- fications in terms of sources, problems, and method can one give con- 6 See my unpublished dissertation, Natural Philosophy in Some Early Seventeenth-Century Scholastic Textbooks (St. Louis University, 1962), ch. 1, for bases of selection and biographical information concerning these textbook writers. 7 Of these, the most important are cited below.</page><page sequence="4">20 PATRICIA REIF tent and meaning to these abstract, ambiguous labels. It is to this task that the remainder of this study will be devoted. First, let us look at their sources. A careful study of XVIIth-cen- tury textbook writers shows that their immediate predecessors are far more decisive in shaping their philosophy of nature than are the ancient and medieval sources. To be sure, they are all broadly Aris- totelian insofar as they subscribe to Aristotle's theory of nature rather than, for example, to that of the Stoics or Atomists. It is from Aristotle's text that they take the principal concepts and divisions of their science. They also make some use of ancient and medieval commentators on Aristotle. However, the authors on whom they depend most are those of the second half of the XVIth century. Their knowledge of the Aristotelian tradition is derived, in large part, from these recent authors. Who are these latter? A complete list of all the recent sources cited by the manualists would contain more than fifty names. Among these, the most frequently mentioned and highly regarded authors are Julius Caesar Scaliger, Philip Melanchthon, James Zabarella, and the Spanish and Portuguese Jesuits: Francis Toletus, Benedict Pereira, the Conimbricensian commentators, and Francis Suarez. The doctrinal content of early XVII-century scholastic textbooks is largely determined by various blendings of these major philosophical sources. Now let us look at the doctrinal contents in some detail. We will first consider the textbook writers' conception of natural philosophy itself, then their general picture of the cosmos, their awareness of and reaction to the "new science." Then we shall examine the textbook doctrines on matter and form, efficient and final causality. Finally, we shall describe and evaluate some aspects of textbook methodology. In typical Peripatetic fashion natural philosophy is defined as a speculative science which studies the world of changing material things-celestial and terrestrial, animate and inanimate-culminating in the study of man. It is divided into two parts: general and special. Corresponding to Aristotle's Physics the general part considers the principles and properties common to all natural bodies: matter and form, quantity, quality, place, time, and motion. The special part, on the other hand, deals with the principles and properties of par- ticular kinds of natural bodies. In its contents it corresponds roughly to all the other Aristotelian works on natural science: De Caelo et Mundo, De Generatione et Corruptione, Parva Naturalia, De Partibus Animalium, De Generatione Animalium, and De Anima. With such a sweeping scope the total science becomes a kind of giant encyclopedia containing an extremely diverse and sprawling body of information on every conceivable topic. The beginnings of astronomy, chemistry, meteorology, botany, biology, zoology, physi-</page><page sequence="5">TEXTBOOKS IN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY: 1600-50 21 ology, anatomy, and psychology are all included. No wonder "physics" became the object of Moliere's satire!8 It is only because all these different sorts of things are allegedly considered from a single point of view (i.e., as natural, that is, as having an intrinsic principle of change) that natural philosophy has any semblance of unity what- soever. The aim in both parts is the same: to attain essential knowl- edge of natural bodies and their properties. The textbook writers seem quite confident that they can determine specific properties, and from these move on to a knowledge of specific natures. That this was an extremely ambitious, and indeed, humanly impossible ideal is apparent when we look at the results of their efforts. They hit one difficulty after another in trying to account for the properties of par- ticular bodies in terms of essential causes. Not infrequently they try to resolve their difficulties by resorting to such pseudo-explanations as "occult" qualities or simply "nature."9 (Such difficulties attest to the wisdom of St. Thomas' reservation of our knowledge of material essences to the generic level.) The definition of natural philosophy as a science gives rise to a question about the very possibility of a scientific knowledge of singu- lar, changing things. Briefly stated, the problem as posed by the manualists is this: according to the traditional Aristotelian notion, science consists in certain, universal, and unchanging knowledge achieved through causal demonstration. But, how can one square the requisite certitude, universality, and necessity with 1) the admission that detailed phenomena of nature can only be known with prob- ability; 2) the fact that all the objects of natural philosophy are singular; and 3) the fact that all these objects are changing? Easily done, reply the manualists. First, not all conclusions in a science need be demonstrated; it is sufficient if there are at least some certitudes. Which, of course, there are. For example, "Every mixture is dis- soluble," and "Every animal is mortal." Second, natural philosophy does indeed study singular things, but not as singular. It is concerned with the universal natures to which these singular things may be reduced. Third, necessity or immutability belongs to the propositions in natural philosophy, even though the existential referents of these propositions may change or perish. Thus, "Every rose is a plant" is universally and necessarily true, regardless of the fortune of any par- ticular rose.10 8 See "The Shopkeeper Turned Gentleman," Act 2, Scene VI, in The Dramatic Works of Moliere, translated by Charles Herron Wall (London, 1904), Vol. III, 171. [Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme.] 9Thus, for example, they will account for the attractive force of a magnet by saying that it is the nature of a magnet to attract iron. 10 For two typical textbook treatments of scientific necessity in natural philo-</page><page sequence="6">22 PATRICIA REIF This defense of scientific necessity in physics leaves much to be desired. What is perhaps most curious and significant is the manual- ists' explanation of the relation between sensible particulars and uni- versal natures. For a close examination of the textbooks reveals a rationalistic tendency to reify the universal natures, and to make these reified universals the primary objects of scientific knowledge. Not that universals are separated from sensible things. Rather, each sensible singular thing is conceived as a concretion of universal na- tures (e.g., in Peter there is substance, animal, and man). Thus, the necessity ascribed to scientific propositions seems to be founded on universals-in-things, and guaranteed by objectifying logic. This ration- alistic tendency to confuse the logical classification of reality with the order of real beings permeates not only natural philosophy, but the other philosophical disciplines as well.1l Finally, as a science, natural philosophy is altogether theoretical in character. It is, according to Keckermann, "the science of con- templating nature,"12 and as Sennert remarks, it is almost redundant to use the adjective "speculative" to modify "science" for the one term implies the other.l3 With careful scrutiny, reflection, and anal- ysis as his chief tools, the natural philosopher seeks "to pry into the innermost chambers of nature."14 All the textbook descriptions of the natural philosopher depict him as a meditative man, peering out over the vast horizons of nature, gazing long and hard at the actions, reactions, and interactions occurring therein, and seeking to penetrate the hidden principles and causes of these mysterious phenomena simply by looking. The utility of natural philosophy is discussed, but this utility consists solely in certain extrinsic advantages; e.g., it leads to a greater knowledge and love of God, and it is immensely helpful in the study of medicine. But what we find completely absent from any of the textbooks is the Baconian vision and Galilean practice of using knowledge to get control over the forces of nature. There is absolutely no notion of putting knowledge to work, of manipulating natural things to dis- cover their capacities, in short, of a truly practical science. Practical purposes seem to be considered utterly irrelevant to natural phi- losophy. sophy, see Eustace of St. Paul, Summa Philosophiae Quadripartita (Cambridge, 1649), Preliminary Questions, question 1, 111-112. 11 See for example, the logic section of Keckermann's two-volume Opera Omnia (Geneva, 1614), vol. 1, part II, ch. 4.

Theoria is knowledge sought simply for its own sake, while techne is the art or skill involved in applying knowledge to some kind of productive work. Aristotle himself exalted the theoreti- cal over the technical (in Athens technical work was done by slaves), and Aristotelians ever since have opted for the superiority of specu- lative knowledge. Accordingly, our XVIIth-century manualists still seemed to think that the natural philosopher would somehow degrade himself and his science if he tampered with nature. He was a scien- tist, not a tradesman. By thus clinging to this sharp dichotomy be- tween the speculative and the practical, especially in an age which was set on fire with the desire to channel nature's energies for human betterment, the manualists helped to isolate themselves from the scientific mainstream. By contrast with the "new scientists" their continued assertions about the wholly speculative character of natural philosophy could only be interpreted as the stubborn resistance of an entrenched academic system to the disturbing encroachments of a new and more effective approach. A second, and perhaps more important, reason for this anti- or at least a-practical stance is that there is no intrinsic use of mathe- matics in textbook natural philosophy. Mathematics does influence it. In format, for example, there is an increasing tendency to pattern the arrangement of subject matter like a geometrical treatise, with axioms, corollaries, and scholia. (Spinoza's Ethica ordine geometrico demonstrata was not a new idea.) The use of definitions as starting points of explanation is another instance of a mathematical approach. Indeed, the textbook writers so emphasize the importance of cor- rect definitions that one would think the validity and success of natural philosophy depended upon them. But in practice these defini- tions are used more as convenient points of departure for subsequent discussion and as ready touchstones in resolving general disputes than as principles of demonstration. In short, there is no genuine union of mathematics with "physics." Mathematics does not enter into the science in such a way as to affect the very kind of knowledge sought. And without this intrinsic application of mathematics to physical phenomena, there is no possibility of adopting a power-rela- tion to nature. In its broad outlines the world-view of the XVIIth-century text- book writers is still fundamentally Aristotelian. Such characteristic features of Aristotelian cosmology as the division of the natural world into two essentially different realms-heavenly and sublunary, the conception of circular motion and spherical shape as "perfect," the theory of the four elements with their "natural places" and per-</page><page sequence="8">24 PATRICIA REIF petual transmutations, and the causal influence of the heavenly bodies upon the lower world are all retained as basic tenets. The uni- verse is hierarchically ordered, and each natural thing in it is dynami- cally directed both to its own perfection and to that of the whole universe. In some of its details, however, this textbook view of the cosmos is beginning to be modified, or at least questioned. The series of suc- cessive criticisms leveled by later medieval thinkers like Buridan, Oresme, and Albert of Saxony against traditional mechanics and astronomy has definitely left its imprint on the textbooks. In addi- tion to these criticisms there are the more recent telescopic discover- ies in astronomy, from 1609 onwards, discoveries which challenged the very foundations of the Aristotelian cosmic view. Let us see precisely what impact these criticisms and discoveries have made on textbook natural philosophy. In their conception of the earthly realm, few changes have been made. The textbook writers are aware of the attacks of Valla, Cardan, Telesio, and Gomez Pereira on the four- element theory, but they react by affirming all the more staunchly that there are four-no more and no less-elements. But these ele- ments are no longer thought to be arranged in concentric separate spheres. For example, Burgersdijck, Sennert, and Eustace contend that earth and water are dovetailed into one another to constitute a single globe! There is considerably greater receptivity to astronomical discov- eries. Nearly all the textbook writers refer to the Copernican theory, with differing reactions. At one extreme is Magirus, who vigorously rejects it-on Scriptural grounds.15 Most of them take a more moder- ate approach. They accept it as an astronomical hypothesis, useful for the explanation and prediction of heavenly motions, but not as a true physical account of heavenly bodies and their motions.16 Other astronomical discoveries are referred to in passing by several of the manualists. Burgersdijck maintains that, with the aid of the tele- scope, many new stars and comets have been seen, and that there is no question that they are above the region of the moon.17 Moreover, the frequent appearance of supra-lunary phenomena has raised serious doubts about the reality of the impenetrable crystalline spheres, lead- ing Arriaga to entertain the view that the planets float in empty 15 Johann Magirus, Physiologiae Peripateticae Libri Sex (Cambridge, 1642), Book 3, ch. 5, commentary C, 110. 16 Caspar Bartholin's textbook shows he had access to the text of Copernicus' On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres, for he quotes directly from the preface written by Andreas Osiander. See Bartholin's Enchiridion Physicum (Strasbourg, 1625), Book 4, ch. 3, 350-351. 17 Franco Burgersdijck, Collegium Physicum (Leyden, 1642), disputation 11, section 9, 111.</page><page sequence="9">TEXTBOOKS IN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY: 1600-50 25 space, "like birds in the air or fishes in the sea."18 Arriaga knows of Galileo's works on sunspots and the moons of Jupiter, but argues that they do not prove that the heavens are corruptible. Aversa cites Brahe, Kepler, and Galileo, but rejects Galileo's explanation of sun- spots as well as his assertion that the earth partially causes the moon's light, the latter on the grounds that it would invert the order of the universe if the earth illuminated a heavenly body.19 Sennert, too, is aware of Galileo's Starry Messenger, but prefers Brahe's arrange- ment of the planets as the most plausible hypothesis to date.20 Final- ly, several manualists reject the ancient and medieval view that the heavens are moved by separated Intelligences or angels, and attribute heavenly motions to a divinely infused or congenital force. These bits of information taken en masse are not very impressive, but they do show that, at least in astronomy, the early XVIIth-cen- tury textbook philosophers were not totally out of touch with recent developments. Expectedly, their reactions vary. Some cling tenaciously to the tradition; some are content to give a non-committal report of what "certain recent authors" have said; some admit that it is im- possible to give more than a probable opinion one way or the other and a few accept the discoveries as factual and try to make needed modifications. Even this latter group failed to see the consequences of one new fact for the rest of their system.21 They were extremely slow to grasp the far-reaching implications, both doctrinal and meth- odological, of the contemporary scientific movement. The general policy of the manualists toward the "new science," therefore, is quite conservative: to save as much of the Aristotelian system as possible, and for as long as possible--at least as a teaching position. Whatever their private beliefs and doubts, one gets the impression that only when evidence to the contrary has become overwhelming, and there is no room for doubt of any kind, will the textbook tradition as a whole show any radical and thoroughgoing changes in its view of the universe. Such conservatism is not surprising, really. For it is always difficult and disturbing when men have to revise their long- accepted concepts and images of the universe. And there is even greater hesitancy when the men involved are not only educators but Christian believers who associate their faith with the older cosmologi- cal picture. 18 Rudolph Arriaga, Cursus Philosophicus (Paris, 1637), "On the Heavens," section 3, subsection 1, 442. 19Raphael Aversa, Philosophia Metaphysicam Physicamque Complectens (Rome, 1625 and 1627), vol. 2, 154-160. 20 Sennert, op. cit., Book 2, ch. 2, 161. 21 Burgersdijck, for instance, admits that new stars and comets have been seen in the region beyond the moon, but continues to uphold the incorruptibility of the heavens.</page><page sequence="10">26 PATRICIA REIF The matter-form theory constitutes the fundamental core of text- book natural philosophy. There is some recognition that this theory is under attack, but the objections are dismissed as trivial or absurd. All the manualists without exception hold that the essence of every material body is composed of a passive determinable principle, prime matter, and an active, determining principle, substantial form. The main arguments by which they arrive at these two principles are based on two assumptions taken to be the immediately given and primary data of experience: substantial change and essential di- versity.22 Numerous variations in the textbook conceptions of matter and form can be detected, but these differences are neither startling nor original. All of them can be traced to some medieval or Renaissance predecessor. Philosophically speaking, what is interesting about their discussions of hylomorphism is the strong influence exerted by Neo- platonic and Augustinian elements. Sennert's remark that the Peri- patetic doctrine on prime matter is not very different from that of the Platonists represents a rather common attitude.23 Thus, matter and form are often conceived more like the universal intelligible en- tities of Avicebron than the principles of the physical composite posited by Aristotle. The textbook writers know the Thomistic doc- trine of prime matter as "pure potency" but they prefer the medieval Augustinian tradition which accords prime matter a minimum reality of its own, independent of and ontologically prior to its union with form in the composite. From their point of view, unless matter had some being of its own, however partial and tenuous, it could not per- form its functions as subject of generation, receiver of forms, and contributor to the substantial composite. As a matter of fact, they admit, prime matter never does exist apart from form, but it could- by divine power.24 Quantity is held to be a coeval property of matter -which helps to explain Descartes' identification of extension with the very essence of matter. Epistemologically it seems fair to say that the textbook theory of matter and form is governed more by imagination than by reason. It is always tempting to try to crystallize philosophical thought in some sort of image or neat schema, and the textbook writers have succumbed to this perennial temptation. To represent material bodies as composed of two entities; to regard substantial change as the 22See Burgersdijck, op. cit., disputation 2, section 7, 16-17: "Nihil enim Physico evidentius est certiusque, quam esse motus, et rerum diversitatem." 23 Sennert, op. cit., Book I, ch. 3, 39. 24 Eustace, op. cit., part I, tract 1, disputation 2, ch. 4, 123, and John Combach, Physicorum Libri IV (Marburg, 1620), Book I, ch. 2, commentary, section 1, 38-39.</page><page sequence="11">TEXTBOOKS IN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY: 1600-50 27 coming together of two such entities and a concomitant loss of a third; to assert that matter must be actually extended in order to receive form, and that form bestows "much more" upon the sub- stantial composite than does matter; to make the operative power of form dependent upon and proportionate to the size of its matter- all these and other typical positions betray the image-bound charac- ter of textbook natural philosophy. The manualists' conceptual anal- ysis of natural phenomena seems to be a search for imaginable con- stituents rather than intelligible principles. In effect, the conceptual distinctions with which their highly abstract analysis terminates begin to be imagined as things, and the unity of the individual existent from which the analysis began tends to be lost or forgotten. The interplay of Aristotelian and Neoplatonic elements evident in the doctrine on matter and form is also discernible in the textbook theory of efficient causality. The prime instance of this interplay is the rather widespread tendency to reduce the substantial form of a natural body to a kind of agent. In other words, the inner formal nature of a material thing is regarded as an internal or emanative efficient cause acting upon the thing itself. Thus, form as an emanative agent is said to cause such effects as the spontaneous motions of the elements and the production of proper accidents. This reduction of form to agent results from the manualists' conception of formal caus- ality as being utterly static and requires an extension of the traditional Aristotelian notion of efficient causality to include both immanent and transient operations. Naive and abstruse as this notion may be, it is a significant mani- festation of the trend in textbook natural philosophy toward an ever sharper dualism in both being and operation. The substantial unity of material things is already somewhat disrupted by conceiving of matter and form as distinct entities. The doctrine of form as emana- tive agent helps to reinforce this dualism: form is conceived of as an agent, acting upon its own matter as patient. As a consequence, all the operations of the composite, even those customarily regarded as immanent, become more like transient activities in which one part of the being acts upon another. In their study of man the textbook writers treat the body and soul separately, and tend to equate the man with his soul. All these instances make it easier to understand why early modern philosophers trained in this textbook tradition found the dualistic perspective so congenial. The strong teleological orientation of textbook natural philosophy is unmistakable. "Nature always acts for an end" is an oft-repeated maxim. The final cause, that for the sake of which an agent acts, is extolled as the "cause of causes" and the one on which most physical demonstrations are based. When we examine the manualists' under-</page><page sequence="12">28 PATRICIA REIF standing of final causality, at least on the level of non-cognitive agents, it is not difficult to see why Bacon and Descartes regarded the teleological approach as anthropomorphic and ruled out the use of final cause in the explanation of natural phenomena. For the text- book writers are not content simply to say that non-cognitive agents seem to be intrinsically ordered toward definite activities with regular and constant results. They go on to specify the extrinsic purposes of natural things and processes. Examples like these are typical: the final cause of meteors is to foster the health of living things by cleans- ing the atmosphere; the final cause of metals is the completion of nature, the beauty of the universe, and many economic and medicinal uses; and the final cause of the tides is to keep the water from getting stagnant. Voltaire's quip about the human nose being "for" eye glasses is quite consonant with this notion of finality. If one were to select a single epithet to describe the educational atmosphere of the early seventeenth century, it would be "method- ical." In this period the intense interest in method which prevailed throughout the sixteenth century seems to have reached its peak.25 There are numerous treatises on method in general, books of all sorts frequently contained the word "method" in their titles, and textbook authors advertised their wares as "methodically presented" or "ar- ranged in methodical order." Keckermann says, for example, that method is the very form of natural philosophy;26 Burgersdijck asserts that solid erudition is impossible apart from good method;27 and Timpler lists lack of method as the chief reason why so few men have succeeded in their search for truth."28 But the method on which they insist has little, if any, connection with scientific method as we understand it. It is fundamentally a pedagogical method, the method by which all curricular disciplines are taught. Its purpose is to facilitate the understanding and reten- tion of knowledge. To achieve this purpose the proper order to fol- low is one which begins with clear and distinct concepts and the definitions formed from these concepts. It is important to note that this method of teaching is not a method of proof. It involves the ordering and explanation of proofs, but it is not itself a proving pro- cess. Nor is it a method of discovery. In fact, a sharp distinction is made between the method of teaching and that of discovery: "The 25 For an excellent study of sixteenth-century methods, together with their ancient and medieval sources, see N. W. Gilbert, Renaissance Concepts of Method (New York, 1960). 26 Keckermann, op. cit., Physical System, Book I, ch. 1, col. 1371. 27Burgersdijck, Idea Philosophiae (Oxford, 1631), Preface to the Reader, [2]. 28 Clemens Timpler, Physicae seu Philosophiae Naturalis Systema Methodicum (Hanover, 1605-1607), vol. 2, part II, Dedicatory Letter [ca. 2].</page><page sequence="13">TEXTBOOKS IN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY: 1600-50 29 method of discovery is more difficult than the method of teaching, because it is more difficult to discover something to teach than to teach what has been discovered."29 As Alsted explains, the method of discovery rests on sense experience. Through an inductive move- ment from sense experience, the natural philosopher establishes the general principles of his science, and with these principles the method of teaching begins. In other words, the method of teaching presup- poses that induction has been used, begins with its results as the subject-matter-already-there-to-be-arranged, but neglects any effort to retrace the steps in the inductive process by which the original concepts and definitions were discovered. It would be difficult to exaggerate the importance which the text- book writers attached to their use of the teaching method. In a sense they seem to regard it as their principal opportunity for originality- their way of progressing beyond their predecessors. Easy communi- cability is the value which dominates their entire theory of method. and this explains their reluctance to incorporate new hypotheses and discoveries into natural philosophy until "teachable" (i.e., methodical- ly ordered) precepts have been elaborated. Thus, Keckermann re- marks that it is better to teach methodically ordered traditional positions, even if erroneous or questionable, rather than as-yet un- methodized new theories, even if true!30 Given a teaching method which stressed the neat, dogmatic trans- mission of accepted "truths," John Webster's complaint that induc- tion in natural philosophy "hath been altogether laid aside"31 would seem to be well founded. The textbook natural philosophers regard themselves primarily as transmitters of an already established tradi- tion whose main contribution to its progress is a better arrangement of content. The priority given to clear and distinct concepts prede- termines the scientific presentation to be one of conceptual and definitional analysis, deductive reasoning, and an additive use of experience for illustration and confirmation alone. The influence of this pedagogical method on Descartes is evident. Positively, Descartes' criteria of truth-clarity and distinctness- seem to stem from the manualists' insistence on clear and distinct concepts. But, by contrast with their method, Descartes' method emphasizes the scientific and epistemological aspects rather than the pedagogical. Keenly aware of the contemporary skeptic challenge, Descartes realized the need for examining the origin of first principles; one could not simply assume their validity. Likewise, he placed great 29 John Henry Alsted, Scientiarum omnium encyclopedia (Lyons, 1649), vol. 1, Book 8, sec. 2, ch. 19, 442. 30 Keckermann, op. cit., System of Astronomy, vol. 1, Book 1, ch. 11, col. 1883. 31 John Webster, op. cit., ch. 4, 34.</page><page sequence="14">30 PATRICIA REIF emphasis on strict demonstration, that is, on establishing necessary connections between the principles and conclusions of the science. The contentment of Aristotelian natural philosophers with probabil- ity on many issues in special "physics" seemed unnecessary. It was a fault, a corrigible one, and Descartes' strategy was to reduce the probable to the false. In textbook introductions, prefaces, and letters to the reader we find interesting remarks which round out our study of methodology in natural philosophy. Most significant of all, perhaps, are their state- ments about the sources of evidence. Despite the charge of bookish- ness levelled against them, the textbook authors, almost to a man, vigorously repudiate uncritical reliance on written authority-that of Aristotle or anyone else. They affirm over and over again that the primary and properly philosophical criteria of truth are reason and experience. The following declarations are typical: Although I have rarely departed from the common opinions, nevertheless wherever reason or experience has recommended another opinion, I have set forth, without fear of anyone, that which seemed more in harmony with the truth.32 If because of love and respect for the truth, I am sometimes compelled to depart from the common and received opinions both of ancient and recent philosophers, I trust that all good men of honest judgment will for- give me. For they know that it is the duty of a Philosopher, in his teach- ing, to consider not authority and the common consent of others, but to weigh the force of arguments, and to desire nothing else than that truth be sought.33 Though "the common opinions of philosophers" are taken as the point of departure and there is considerable reluctance to depart from them, the manualists insist that it is the philosopher's responsiblity to examine, and if necessary, reject them. So goes their methodological statement. But in practice these declarations against authoritarianism and in favor of reason and ex- perience mean very little. Page after page of the textbooks manifests a very uncritical and eclectic use of authorities. Both the problems and solutions of textbook natural philosophy are derived from their written sources. On almost every major question in the sciences their sources presented them with conflicting solutions; hence, the real task of the natural philosopher consists in selecting the "true" or "most probable" opinion. Moreover, in their use of authorities, the manualists are prone to a superficial type of syncretism. Philosophers of the most diverse backgrounds are often cited to substantiate the textbook writer's position.

This tendency to multiply authorities seems to be their way of proving that their doctrine is in accord with "the common opinion of philosophers"-the greatest authority of all. It never seemed to occur to them that this "common" opinion is only a verbal commonness, with profound differences in doctrinal interpre- tation. The alleged criteria of truth in natural philosophy, reason and experience, seem to be considered as separate sources of evidence. It is not always clear what they mean by reason, but generally it seems to designate discursive argumentation based on conceptual analysis. Occasionally it consists in an application of previous prin- ciples to the particular question at hand. Thus, Eustace "proves" by reason (ratio) that fire, air, water, and earth are elements because the definition of element in general applies to these four bodies alone.34 Experience, on the other hand, connotes our ordinary, primi- tive, and often uncritical confrontation with the natural world. Looking through special "physics," we find all sorts of references to things "known by experience": that there are five senses; that metals and stones are not alive; that sound travels more slowly than light; that two bodies cannot occupy the same place; that sleep can be in- duced by many different causes; that odors are received "materially" into the brain; that there are certain sympathies and antipathies in natural bodies; that the souls of plants and animals are divisible, and so on. Experience seems to mean simply the fund of information which an ordinary, educated man picked up by living in the world. For all their talk about experience as a source of evidence, how- ever, the manualists seldom go beyond their written sources to an examination of actual physical phenomena. Frequently even their descriptions of natural processes are observations reported in books rather than personally experienced. When the descriptions are actual- ly experiential, they are used less as a foundation for reflection and analysis than to illustrate or corroborate a position already accepted on other grounds. Nowhere in the manuals do we find the slightest indication of a deliberately contrived or manipulated approach to nature in order to achieve a better understanding of natural activities. Keckermann uses the word experimentum on one occasion, but it simply means the testimony of the senses.35 In summary, then, the manualists, despite all their assertions about the primacy of reason and experience over authority, are quite enslaved by the written word. For their method of procedure consists more in a perusal of authors than a direct investigation and reflec- 34 Eustace, op. cit., part II, tract 2, disputation 1, question 2, p. 207. 35 Keckermann, op. cit., Physical System, Book 2, ch. 12, col. 1438.</page><page sequence="16">32 PATRICIA REIF tive analysis of sense experience. Textbook natural philosophy does consist, as Webster complained, of "poring continually upon a few paper Idols." It is dominated by textual controversies. The ability of the natural philosopher seems to depend upon the number of con- flicting opinions he can cite: the greater the number, the greater his opportunity to prove his virtuosity by refuting them-all but one, the "true opinion." This feature of textbook method clearly brings out the strong, and mostly undesirable, influence which the practice of academic disputation exercised on the textbook presentation. But that is another story in itself. Immaculate Heart College.</page></plain_text>
