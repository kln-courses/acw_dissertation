<plain_text><page sequence="1">Becoming Animal? Zoo Encounters in Rilke, Inspector, and Kronauer Jutta Ittner Eine vergleichende Analyse der literarischen Repräsentation von Tieren zeigt den grundlegenden Wandel der Beziehung zum Tier im 20. Jahrhundert. Der imagi- nierte Blickkontakt mit dem radikal Anderen entlarvt nicht nur jegliches Wissen über die tierische, sondern auch die menschliche Existenz als Konstrukt. Die Phan- tasien vom Einswerden mit dem Tier erweisen sich als Illusion, genauer, als Spiegel menschlicher Sehnsüchte und Ängste. In der Begegnung mit dem Tier erfährt der Mensch die Entfremdung vom eigenen Ich. I look into her eyes as one who loves can look leaving myself outside. So, at last, through her pupils, I see what she is seeing - Adrienne Rich, The Lioness1 Animals, especially the elusive or dangerous species among them, have always fascinated us. As children we gaped at the toothless old lion at the county fair and gleefully watched the spectacle of hissing tigers jump through hoops at the circus, cowed by their master's whip. Mystified by the strange creatures in natural history museums frozen by the artistry of some taxidermist, we wished they would move for us. But most of all we loved the zoo where we could gaze at the creatures that are so breathtakingly &gt;other&lt;. And we still take our children to marvel at the collection of existences in cages or that have been furnished with token pieces of &gt;nature&lt; to help us forget our guilt. In a time when modern technology enables us to virtually fly with eagles or cavort alongside hippos deep in the Nile, zoos still retain their attractions. In fact, zoos are sad monuments to the impossibility of animal encounters, as John Berger claims in his essay Why Look at Animals?2 So why do we keep going? What did the American poet Gregory Corso, for example, look for in the gray colossus, and how did it relieve him from the nightmares of his life, when he writes »The room got to be unbearable!/ 1 went to the zoo/ and oh thank God for the simple elephant«?3 Rather than being places to connect with or learn about the animal kingdom, Michael W. Fox argues, zoos are 1 In: Adrienne Rich, The Dream of a Common Language. New York 1978. 'berger, John, Why look at Animals? in: About Looking. New York 198U, 19. 3 A Difference of Zoos.

Das allein gibt ihnen ihr Lebensrecht, zu diesem Zweck haben wir sie uns gemacht, ohne Innenleben also, ausgehöhlt zum reinen Bild«.5 These thoughts, expressed by the narrator of Die Frau in den Kissen, reflect a postmodern sensitivity that challenges the traditional anthropocentric con- structs of animals. Seen through that lens, Corso's line »thank God for the simple elephant« obviously does not evoke elephant presence but annihilates it. Instead of the elephant, it creates a reflection of humankind's longing for paradisiacal simplicity. The poem not only exemplifies how we construct an- imals, it also illustrates that, as Steve Baker says in The Postmodern Animal, humans typically want something from animals - we want them to be mean- ingful, and we want to be consoled by these meanings.6 Again, Kronauer 's narrator puts it succinctly: »Wir verstehen die Tiere nicht. Wir weiden uns an der nicht täuschenden, täuschenden [sie] Unverhohlenheit ihrer Oberflä- chen, den vielzüngig redenden«. We do not know what lies below the fasci- nating animal surface, yet we sense some inner existence that we feel we're lacking: »Anders wir Zoobesucher selbst. Wechselseitig müssen wir hoffen auf ein Inneres«, Kronauer writes, wistfully adding: »Was hätten wir sonst?« (FK 176). When the »unashamedly anthropomorphic sentiment«7 of the nineteenth century replaced the Cartesian model of the creature as soulless machine, it never questioned our comfortable self-centeredness, thereby reaffirming the animal's lesser existence. In the philosophical discourse on animals from Leibniz to Heidegger, the transcendental principles of humanity's existence have always been placed above and in contradistinction to that of animality, as Akira M. Lippitt points out in Electric Animal? Aware of the disastrous effect that the exclusion of animals has had on our planet, today's ecological sensibility challenges the old hierarchical structures, attempting to see ani- mals as subjects in their own right to better understand the complexity of our existence. The latest psychoanalytical and philosophical discourses on ani- mals initiate a radically new approach to the human-animal dichotomy by suggesting that animals inhabit not the lesser of two worlds but rather a third, separate realm within the universe of human knowledge. This concept opens the door to a new kind of inquiry into animal as well as human existences. 4 Michael W. Fox, Inhumane Society: The American Way of Exploiting Animals.

Since the turn of the last century, then, art and literature have increasingly reflected human efforts to imagine animal nature in the hope of finding the truth about human existence. It is in terms of this brief history of discourse on animals that I will inquire into several literary zoo encounters. In the selected texts I will focus specifi- cally on the question of how the animal gaze is constructed. That is, how their protagonists inquire into the mind behind the animal eye, and how these inquiries affect their own sense of self, taking them on journeys toward what Deleuze and Guattari call the adventure of »becoming animal«.9 My analysis starts with a comparison between Rainer Maria Rilke's (1875-1926) poem Der Panther and two other descriptions of visual encounters with large cats. In Stream of Life the Brazilian writer Clarice Lispector (1925-1977) describes a dramatic encounter with a panther. Among the many animal encounters in Brigitte Kronauer's (*1940) work, I focus on an encounter with caged tigers in Die Frau in den Kissen. It is hardly surprising that in descriptions of visual encounters with animals tigers and panthers are quite frequent. After all, large cats are as beautiful as they are mysterious and threatening, and their gaze is particularly intense and disconcerting. I will then turn to literary explorations of the eye-to-eye contact with more unlikely zoo animals by both Lispector and Kronauer - a bison in the short story The Buffalo, and a maned wolf in the central passage of Die Frau in den Kissen. 1 Within the traditional anthropocentric perspective the question of how ani- mals see the world was not even posed. Animals were always the observed objects, and were denied their own gaze. As has become evident in recent discussions, the human attempt to exclude the &gt;Other&lt; from our consciousness and its properties - human vision and language - has created a conflict for anyone who attempts inclusion. Derrida's ironic comment about the animal's lack of (human) language is equally applicable to its lack of (human) vision: »Of course, if one defines language in such a way that it is reserved for what we call man, what is there to say?«10 The beginning of the gradual shift in how we think about animals was signaled by Franz Marc's musings on animal repre- 9 Gilles Deleuze/Félix Guattari, Kafka.

In 191 1 the expressionist painter writes about his contemporaries: »The artistic logic of Picasso, Kandinsky, [etc.] is perfect. They don't &gt;see&lt; the doe and they don't care. They project their inner world«. He then ponders the challenge of painting not a picture of the doe but one »called The Doe«, and of going even further: »I may also want to paint a picture, The Doe Feels. How infinitely more subtle must the painter's sensitivity be in order to paint that!«11 The reversal of per- spective from the human's to the animal's point-of-view does indeed demand a different kind of artistic sensitivity, but it also opens up new avenues for the artistic imagination, as Marc's animal paintings illustrate. More importantly, the painterly exploration of what a doe or a horse might feel is an acknowledg- ment that animals are subjects rather than objects, and that their relationship to the world is not a »lesser« but »an other relationship«.12 Rilke's animal poems in Neue Gedichte can be seen as the poetic equivalent to Marc's paintings. They do not stop at imagining external reality as perceived through the animal eye but rather conjure up the subject behind the eye of the cat, the dog, or the panther - that is, the &gt;animal existences It may be helpful at this point to introduce Lacan's attempt to locate this source, or »original point« of vision. His distinction introduces a subject whose intention is to see and to attribute meaning to the image that its eye sees. It challenges us to »give body to the gaze«, that is, to imagine the gaze as »that underside of consciousness«.13 When he differentiates between the eye and the gaze, his focus seems very similar to that of Rilke's poetic explorations in Der Panther or Die schwarze Katze of 1907/08, and, more theoretically, in the Eighth Duino Elegy of 1922. In fact, Lacan seems to construct behind the animal gaze what Rilke calls »das Offne, das/ im Tiergesicht so tief ist«14 and what Kronauer refers to as »ein Inneres«. Rilke's »Dinggedichte« focus on our act of seeing an animate or in- animate object - a black cat, a blue hydrangea, or a headless antique statue. The lyric voice reflects on the impact of the object on the perceiver who looks from the outside and is barred from looking further than the object's surface (»aber da, an diesem schwarzen Felle,/ wird dein stärkstes Schauen aufgelöst«; Schwar- ze Katze, KA 1, 545), unable to escape the dilemma that man's vision always turns back in upon himself.15 The effect of this gaze is even greater when the 11 Franz Marc, How Does a Horse See the World?

When this gaze is created entirely in the perceiver's mind, as in Archaischer Torso Apollos, it has an even more powerful impact. For the perceiver to be »seen« by the ancient torso so imbued with the divine gaze means being recognized for who he is. Just as Apollo's clarity radiates from every part of his body, so it penetrates the perceiver's consciousness where it acts as a mirror, reflecting back the truth - a call to turn his life around (»denn da ist keine Stelle,/ die dich nicht sieht. Du mußt dein Leben ändern«; KA 1, 513). This poem is based on the idea that we can recognize the truth of existence when our gaze is completely open and penetrable. It is, in fact, the gaze that Rilke attributes to the animal which, unlike man, is not limited by self-con- sciousness and thus not separated from reality (»Mit allen Augen sieht die Kreatur/ das Offene [...] Was draußen ist, wir wissens aus des Tiers/ Antlitz allein«; Achte Elegie, KA 2, 224). According to this idea, the human mind de- prives us of the ability to &gt;simply see&lt;. Our gaze is a barrier rather than a bridge. Or, according to Rilke's simile, we never see what is before our eyes because we are trapped within our own ideas about the world (»Nur unsre Augen sind/ wie umgekehrt und ganz um sie gestellt/ als Fallen«; ibid.). In the imagined eye-to- eye contact with Apollo the perceiver's gaze is free from the confinement of his own consciousness. In his contemplation of the ancient torso his gaze is so calm, intense, and free that it allows the object to look back. In other words, it allows the fragment of reality that seems to us »entfremdet« - disconnected from our being - to reveal its meaning, that is »[der Dinge] einzig möglicher Name«.16 The setting of Rilke's poem Der Panther is the static scenario familiar to every visitor to the zoo: DER PANTHER Im Jardin des Plantes, Paris Sein Blick ist vom Vorübergehn der Stäbe so müd geworden, daß er nichts mehr hält. Ihm ist, als ob es tausend Stäbe gäbe und hinter tausend Stäben keine Welt. Der weiche Gang geschmeidig starker Schritte, der sich im allerkleinsten Kreise dreht, ist wie ein Tanz von Kraft um eine Mitte, in der betäubt ein großer Wille steht. Göttin des Katzenschlaf s&lt;, thus moving his understanding of animal essence into a new realm, yet at the same time resorting to an anthropomorphizing concept of a feline deity (KA 2, 395). 16 Alfred Doppier, Rilkes Neue Gedichte.

Dann geht ein Bild hinein, geht durch der Glieder angespannte Stille - und hört im Herzen auf zu sein. (KA 1, 468) With the visitor looking at a panther in his cage and the animal looking out - or rather, not looking - the boundaries between the outside and inside seem clear. However, a closer look shows that instead of firmly establishing a sep- aration, the bars dissolve it. In the effort to understand the panther's caged existence the lyrical voice visualizes what the panther sees, thus reversing the perspective and, in a sense, switching places with the animal (v. 1 f.). By doing so the panther's gaze is interpreted as no longer taking in the outside, so that to its numbed mind the world consists of nothing but endlessly moving bars. The moment the lyrical voice identifies with the animal, his own mind and his construct of the panther's mind conflate - in other words, he is caught in his own anthropomorphizing trap. The possessive pronoun that is still clear in the first verse (»sein Blick« as the panther's gaze) has now become diffuse. What appears to be the animal's concept of the world can only be the perceiv- er's (v. 3 f.). As the animal's mouthpiece he loses his own voice. The middle stanza restores the human/animal divide by using a simile in its description of the panther's movement.17 Then in the first and second verse of the third stanza there is a shift between animal and human exis- tences that is radical yet almost imperceptible. A complete merging of con- sciousnesses occurs, cleverly disguised in what would be the mechanical de- scription of the workings of a camera, were it not for the &gt;humanizing&lt; sim- ile of the »curtain«. The image of the outside world then moves through the panther's still, yet tense, body until it arrives at the heart where it becomes one with the animal's being. In the process human consciousness, too, has returned to the &gt;home&lt; that it longed for - to a place where outside and inside are extinguished in a mystical union. Is this an evocation of paradise or of death in an animalistic un-selfconsciousness? Kauffmann reminds us that even the most sympathetic construction of alterity tends to see the an- imal as merely an imperfect state of ourselves - imperfect even in its per- ceived &gt;superiority&lt; - that is, it denies the existence of the truly other. This insight certainly rings true for the atavistic and regressive elements in Rilke's focus on the »Kreatur«.18 17 »Wie, oder wie wenn [. . .] das sind Hilfskonstruktionen, meistens Leerlauf [...].

Since we don't even &gt;see&lt; animals in the zoo, for »in the zoo the view is always wrong«, as Berger warns, how can we forego human consciousness and »become animal«, even for a moment?19 No matter how hard we try to imagine &gt;being tiger&lt;, we seem condemned to meet only our own projections. Berger undertakes to approach the elusive animal &gt;seer&lt; behind the eye that looks at us by trying to distinguish between the human and the animal gaze. Between two humans the inevitable distance can usually be bridged, he explains. »Language allows men to reckon with each other as with themselves«. Man and animal, however, are both trapped looking across abysses of non-understanding, dissimilar as they may be. While the animal always looks at man warily and attentively, it looks at a tree, a rock, or its prey the same way. It does not reserve a special look for man. To man, however, its look feels familiar. He imagines being seen by the animal the same way as he himself sees his surroundings, immediately pigeonholing every object as dead or alive, good or bad, useful or useless - and for that reason he sees nothing but his mirror image.20 In that sense, the more knowledge we gain about animals, the further away they move from us. Facts will not help solve the mystery of animal being, and trusting our own eyes may already close the door. Several fantasies of animal encounters in Kronauer's and in Lispector's writings suggest that there is a way of looking that might enable us to catch a glimpse of an object's hidden &gt;self&lt;. These moments are reminiscent of the epiphany described in Rilke's Archaischer Torso Apollos. When for a moment the female narrator in Lispector's Stream of Life (1973) manages to put aside her assumptions, as the critic Hélène Cixous explains, she is able to »see« the essence of a chair, because in that moment her gaze is »freed from a world that is neither hers nor that of the chair«.21 Such a moment of grace only occurs when the perceiver moves towards the field of the &gt;Other&lt;. The result is unpredictable. It can be a joyful experience, as Kronauer describes it in Tageslauf mit Unterbrechung und Gegnery or a nightmare as in Lispector's sto- ry. In Kronauer's short story, a woman who has often watched her cat play suddenly forgets herself, and the door to a spiritual experience opens. She &gt;simply&lt; looks. She recognizes that to order and control her life she usually exercises an active mind, shutting herself off from any other mode of exis- tence: »Das ist sonst meine Sache: dies Aufrechterhalten, die Sichtbar- machung von Anfang und Ende, dieses Erfinden einer Bewegung hin auf ein 19Berger(note2),21. 20Berger(note2),2f. Z1 Helene Cixous, Reading with Clarice Inspector. Minneapolis 1990, 38.</page><page sequence="8">Becoming Animal? 3 1 Ziel«. That day, however, she realizes that the cat in its aimless, playful activity connects the disparate elements into a whole for her. The cat leistet es ab, stellvertretend. Sie drückt mich aus. Die Ordnung besteht, denke ich mir, sehe ganz lässig, wie sie den Raum mit Ereignissen vollstopft, wie ich versinke, ja, spiegelbildlich, das ist die Lösung, und jetzt mit Lust, in Apathie, nicht lebend, nur atmend, ununterscheidbar mit meiner Umgebung - ein Gleichgewicht des Benutzens also - vermengt.22 For that one moment of grace she experiences herself as a cat - living from moment to moment, at one with her surroundings, &gt;mindlessly&lt; creating re- ality by simply being. 3 In Stream of Life Lispector describes a similar experience of a woman simply being, surrendering herself to the moment. Completely open and unde- fended, she meets the animal's gaze as a subject turned object among objects, and what might be a titillating flirtation with the &gt;Other&lt; turns into a night- marish experience: A black panther is caged. Once I gazed deeply into a panther's eyes and she gazed deeply into mine. We transmuted ourselves. That fear. I left there totally dazed inside [...]. Everything had taken place behind thought. I long for the terror that the exchange of gazes with the black panther gave me. I know how to make terror.23 This encounter is a fantasy of what Deleuze calls »becoming animal«. Lis- pector refers to it as &gt;animalizing&lt; herself; that is, entering into the animal's realm where silence and the lack of a common language safeguard the ani- mal's distance and its distinctness, and where the human is fully exposed to the impact of alterity. According to Lispector, animalizing »isn't hard and it comes easily. It's a matter of not fighting it and simply surrendering« (SL 38). As this passage indicates, it might take more than simply letting go, however, to reach the place &gt;behind thoughts escaping the mind's entrapment. In this encounter it is the mortal terror that overpowers her when she locks eyes with the panther and makes her &gt;lose her mind&lt;. That she craves another moment of such existential fear is an indication of how intense her longing for this state of pure being must be. It is interesting, though, that even in this moment, where the encounter with the completely &gt;Other&lt; extinguishes her sense of self, there is the &gt;I&lt; that claims a mutuality with the panther's existence: »We transmuted ourselves«. That her loss of boundaries can translate into the 22 Brigitte Kronauer, Tageslauf mit Unterbrechung und Gegner. In: B. K., Gemusterte Nacht.

Minneapolis 1989, 66 (quoted SL).</page><page sequence="9">32 Jutta Ittner fantasy of a similar loss of boundaries on the animal's part undoes in a sense the whole merging experience. It is yet another example of the human con- struction of an animal presence. And yet there may be no way for us other than to try to bridge the abyss that separates us from the animal. If the animal has secrets which are »specifically addressed to man«, as Berger says,24 then our only chance to approach it is to meet it on its own terms, trying to &gt;re- gress&lt; to a deeper level in the hope of finding a commonality, no matter how futile the attempt? 4 For Kronauer's narrator the zoo is a storage place for secret information, »ein unerschöpflicher, zum Bersten gefüllter Speicher von Mitteilungen, [. . .] eine Wahrnehmungs- und Verlautbarungsstation für seine Besucher« (FK 181), where she can explore the multiple possibilities for transformational animal encounters. »Im Zoo bin ich ausgebreitet über den ganzen Bereich und erst am Ausgang wirklich wieder zusammengefaßt in der einfältigen Gestalt« (FK 192 f.). On one of her frequent visits to the zoo the narrator stops at the tigers' cage to look at the animals that are looking back - a scene so similar to Rilke's and Inspector's that it begs for comparison. She keeps looking until her intent gaze penetrates the animals' - or so she imagines. (It is noteworthy that zo- ologists claim that except for pets animals avoid eye-to-eye contact at all cost.) The main difference between Rilke's and Lispector's fantasies is that the con- nection doesn't simply happen but is intentional. While it lasts the boundaries between the human and the animal remain intact: Durch die Augen der Raubkatzen trete ich ein in die unentwegte Tageshelligkeit, in die helle Starre ihres Bewußtseins, in den wie von elektrischen Birnen alleenlang strahlenden Raum ihres Kopfes. Ich wende den Blick nicht ab, bis ich eingetreten bin in das gleichgültige, nie verdämmernde Licht ihrer Iris. Dann drehe ich mich um (FK 193). In fact, Kronauer's and Lispector's fantasies are diametrically opposed. In Kronauer the encounter with &gt;tiger mind&lt;, a deliberate and conscious act, happens in a clinical rather than mystical atmosphere. In Lispector the en- counter with the panther is dominated by sheer terror, a catalyst that shortcir- cuits the human mind and enables the human to connect at a very deep level with the animal essence. In Kronauer's encounter the observer retains her autonomy as she looks; she does not go &gt;out of her mind&lt;. Her mind, on the contrary, is actively creating the images for her experience. To this woman the consciousness of the tiger appears as a space whose emptiness and glaring electrical brightness blot out any human concept or emotion. Here Clarice 24 Berger (note 2), 3.</page><page sequence="10">Becoming Animal? 33 Inspector's novel The Passion According to G.H. (1964)25 comes to mind be- cause its narrator describes a cockroach's gaze as a »terrible neutrality« that »made anything that came in there lose its false transcendence«. G. H.'s har- rowing experience occurs in a space similar to Kronauer's &gt;tiger mind&lt; - in »the world's continual breathing that we call silence«, and in the blinding sunlight that exposes our dark secrets and reveals the truth of our existence (P 88). It seems to be a desirable experience for Kronauer's narrator to enter the tigers' »alleenlang strahlenden Raum ihres Kopfes« where, in her imagi- nation, subjective judgment is suspended and all objects carry the same value - »gleichgültig« meaning here literally »of equal value« -, for not until the observer has reached that realm does she turn away. While Kronauer's narrator retains a clear sense of self, her construct of the tigers' consciousness enables her to switch sides at will and to be both her usual self and to recognize herself in tiger perspective, as it were, as a member of the motley crowd that represents human existence in all its deviousness and distortion: Ich stehe in der Menschenmenge vor dem Käfig mit den Händen in den Taschen und den Beinen auf dem Boden. So sehe ich mich dastehen, aus dem Käfig heraus sehe ich mich in der Menge mit verzerrten Gesichtern, in lästigem Staunen, aufdringlich, eine häßliche, schlecht geschnittene, doch auch nicht natürlich wuchernde Hecke, die der Blick leicht durchstoßen kann, schattenhafte, übervorteilende, sentimentale Wesen, keine Jäger, vielmehr schwache, plumpe Besitzer sie alle [...]. Laß sie zappeln! Sie lenken mich nicht ab auf meiner Wanderschaft über die endlosen elektrisch brennenden Chausseen meines Kopfinnenraumes (FK 193). The shift from human to animal perspective is no less a conscious, clearly marked act than the initial contact (»Ich stehe [...] vor dem Käfig« - »aus dem Käfig heraus sehe ich mich«). Unlike Lispector's narrator who, overtaken by fear, completely merges with the panther (»We transmuted ourselves. [. . .] Everything had taken place behind thought«), Kronauer's narrator seems to consciously adopt the tiger's perspective as a way to experience herself more truthfully. Seen from an imagined tiger consciousness humans appear to her as they are - straight or crooked, scheming and sentimental, ugly, fat, and possessive - but there is no doubt that this list reflects human, not animal categories. The device of the imagined neutral &gt;searchlights&lt; of the animal gaze that shine on the dark, ugly reality of the human condition is constructed by the human mind that longs for a vision free from concepts, distortions, and veils. There is a directedness and objectivity in her self-experiment (»sie lenken mich nicht ab«) which characterizes all the undertakings of this »woman in the pillows«. On the first page of Die Frau in den Kissen she reveals how she coaxes her busy mind to enter the dream circuit of a greater body - sleep. She 25 Clarice Lispector, The Passion According to G. H.

Einmal hat man vielleicht zwischen Morgen und Abend und durch die Nächte hindurch eine vollkommene Wachheit erlebt, eine brennende Tageshelligkeit des ganzen We- sens« (FK 52). Of the various ways in which she experiences the desired state - lucidity uncluttered by thought and of a presence not confined to the human body - it is the eye-to-eye encounters with animals that seem be the most rewarding. She initiates them, and she decides when to terminate them. Coolly, it seems, the narrator summarizes her tiger experience, (»Ich gehe durch den Zoo zwis- chen den Tieraugen, das zählt allein, nicht die Gräben, Gitter, Balken«) mov- ing on to another facet of existence. And again, although this time she per- ceives herself with laser-sharp vision, with eagle eyes in the literal sense, it is without any understanding or concept of her own existence, as an object among objects and without compassion: »Ich sehe auf meine Gestalt unter vielen und begreife sie so wenig wie die anderen« (FK 193). 5 Before taking a closer look at two texts by Kronauer and Lispector - the story of the woman and the maned wolf, and The Buffalo - it may be useful to point out that these writers, who at first glance seem so different, demonstrate im- portant commonalities in the way they explore animal encounters. Both writ- ers' fascination with the process of looking has its roots in the nouveau roman. Both use first-person narrators to draw the reader into their introspective and often mind-boggling universes. As their narrators indulge in their adventures of perception, they tend to be mediums rather than protagonists. This is es- pecially true for Lispector, an author who according to Hélène Cixous is »tuned into her unconscious and becomes a scribe«.26 But where Kronauer's gently ironic and detached narrators keep their readers at arm's length and thoroughly discourage them from identifying, Lispector's passionate narra- tors lure us into an intense dialogue and do not release us until the end. In Lispector's writing the tone is autobiographical to the degree that her most prominent critic does not distinguish between the author and the narrative voice. The most important connection between these two writers, however, is the probing intensity with which they investigate reality. What propels their pro- tagonists far into unmapped territory is their passion for understanding the truth about the human condition. Although their fictional worlds seem as far 26 Cixous (note 21), 14.</page><page sequence="12">Becoming Animal? 35 apart as geography would suggest, the trajectory of their literary adventures is similar. The starting point is always a narrator looking at an object - be it a chair, a rock, or, more commonly, a person or an animal. The narrator's step from safely looking at an object to questioning what is before her eyes is a quantum leap in perception that opens the door to the most intimate of en- counters. Whether the outcome of the adventure of looking is an exhilarating epiphany or a devastating nightmare depends on the gaze one encounters - or rather constructs, as Lispector indicates in The Passion According to G. H. : There »are various modes that mean to see: one being looking at the other without seeing it, one possessing the other, one eating the other, one simply being in a corner and the other being there too: all that means to see« (68). Clearly Inspector's universe is a place for experiences of ultimate challenge. The brief panther passage from Stream of Life shows how this writer imagines the process that unfolds once we surrender to and unflinchingly investigate our experience, irrespective of the outcome. It illustrates that once we jettison the security of anthropomorphism, which »presupposes that we know what the essence of man or anthropos is«,27 the image of the wholly &gt;Other&lt; can emerge, with radical consequences for our selves. Lispector's short story The Buffalo2* explores the impact of animal essence with the same relentlessness, yet she orchestrates the human-animal encoun- ter in a quite different way. Her starting point is more like Kronauer's, or, as a matter of fact, like the elephant encounter in Corso's poem. A woman goes to the zoo in the hope of experiencing herself in a new way. She wants to discover the creature whose being is a part of who she is, or rather, whose being can mirror back to her what she lacks. This undertaking assumes that among the animals' »many surfaces«, as Kronauer says, there are such that enable us to project freely our own states of being. In other words, it proves that, as Bob Mullan says in Zoo Culture, we're creating the animals the mo- ment we think about them, and whatever we say about them will only reflect our own concerns.29 Kronauer actually addresses this usually unconscious process of projection in Die Frau in den Kissen when she writes that Angesichts der Tiere wird die Welt einfach [...]. Für jede Stimmung gibt es den Umriß und Blick eines genau dazu passenden Exemplars. Man lehnt an einem Ma- schendraht, einer Glasscheibe und betrachtet dahinter die Gestalt seines momenta- nen Gefühls oder sein Gegenteil [...]. Fast glaube ich, daß die Luft des Zoos die Fähigkeit besitzt, zu meinen Launen die Form von Tieren anzunehmen (FK 159 f.). In Lispector's story a woman comes to the zoo to look for the &gt;right&lt; gaze - experimenting, in a sense, with her own projections onto the animal being. 27 Will McNeill, Heidegger.

Now she seeks to connect with the animals' uncorrupted inner selves in the hope of discovering a remedy for her own &gt;sick core&lt;. This wish to be healed by the purity of the animal soul points to yet another uncon- scious construction of the animal being. What we sense as &gt;purity&lt; in the animal reflects our mourning an imagined paradise, which, as Lippit says, is a mourning for the self - »a self that had become dehumanized in the very process of humanity's becoming human«.30 Thus, seeing animals is remem- bering ourselves. It could thus be argued that as the narrator walks through the zoo she sees not the animals at all but her own internalized ideal of &gt;animal&lt;, and that for this reason her observations lead to an exquisite vignette of animal existence, matched in sensibility and poetry only by Kronauer's. During her wandering from cage to cage, every time she sees an animal she reacts with her whole being, and every time she only finds the characteristics that finally brought her here. All animals evoke in her the so-called feminine qualities - love, patience, introspection, and compassion. The lovely giraffe, »that silent wingless bird« (B 148), looks at her so innocently that she has to avert her gaze. The elephant's eyes are as kind as those of an old man, and the camel's long dusty eyelashes shield eyes that dedicate themselves solely to the »patience of its internal craft«. She cannot find an animal that would serve as a model for raw vitality, self-as- sertion, even aggression. Not the gorilla, who looks at her, holding onto the bars of its cage with its scrawny arms opened in form of a crucifix. In horror she turns her eyes away, recognizing in its eyes veiled with old age »the sweetness of illness«: »Oh no, not this [. . .]. God, teach me only to hate«. And not the lions, for it is springtime and they are not inclined to revive in her the memory of »the carnage she had come in search of« (B 148 f). When she has all but given up hope she sees the buffalo in the distance, a »blackened shape of tranquil fury« (B 155) in the light of the approaching evening. It seems that this animal lends itself to projection of &gt;male&lt; proper- ties due to its bulk, stance, and gaze. »Oft ist es der Büffel, der exakt das Volumen meines Gemütszustandes hat oder dessen, was mir gerade fehlt. Wie trotzig, gelassen und uralt der Bison vor mir aufgebaut ist«, explains Kro- nauer's narrator (FK 160). With a visceral certainty Lispector's narrator rec- ognizes her ally. She yells, throws stones, and shakes the bars of his enclosure in her increasingly frantic effort to attract the attention of the stoic animal. Then suddenly she feels inside herself »the first trickle of black blood« (B 155). All she felt lacking had always been a part of her, so all it takes to access her own energy is to connect with the image of strength and fury projected onto an animal that, again, has nothing to do with her. Provoked at last, the buffalo approaches the woman, moving right up to the bars. The buffalo lowers his huge head and looks her straight in the eye: 30Lippit(note8), 18.</page><page sequence="14">Becoming Animal? 37 And a pallor so deep was exchanged that, drowsily, the woman grew numb. [...] The woman slowly shook her head, terrified by the hatred with which the buffalo, tranquil with hatred, watched her [. . .] entering ever more into those [small crim- son] eyes that fixed her without haste, ingenuous, wearily sighing, without wishing nor being able to escape, she was caught in mutual assassination (B 156). »Death hummed in her ears«, she feels »something white« spreading in her, and overwhelmed by it, she faints (B 156). Inspector's protagonists are able to »become animal«, only in an unconscious state - they faint. In The Passion According to G.H., the human being can only taste the absolute - be it God or essential nature - as »someone who is [. . .] not even going to tell herself [...]. Just as a lizard's nature sees: without ever having to remember« (P 98). Death here is a metaphor for the transformational experience of &gt;un-becoming hu- man&lt; in the ultimate union with the animal. In this moment of epiphany the woman finally taps into her rage and hatred, accessing the inner strength and peace that will change her life. 6 It seems hardly necessary to emphasize that in this powerful story about the gaze of the &gt;Other&lt; the buffalo's role is entirely assigned by the human viewer. In her passionate inquiries into the human condition and breathtaking jour- neys into a deeper understanding of the self, Lispector does not reflect on the constructedness of these encounters, directly or indirectly. It is up to the read- er to recognize that, as Donna Haraway puts it succinctly, »we polish an ani- mal mirror to look for ourselves«.31 Kronauer's texts, on the contrary, are explorations of the human-animal encounter as well as comments on their constructedness, as a closer look at the most endearing and poignant of the many love affairs in Die Frau in den Kissen will show. The story of the woman and the maned wolf is probably the most memorable animal encounter in the novel's gentle, colorful universe full of zoo creatures. It illustrates how great our need is to connect with the animal, to have our gaze returned by animals and to see ourselves through them. It also ironically points out the pitfalls of human encounters with animals - when we see reciprocity in the animal's gaze we are deceiving ourselves. In this novel there are actually two &gt;women in the pillows&lt; who share their days and their fantasies with animals. We have already met the narrator who goes to the zoo in an effort to escape &gt;active&lt; living and to experience herself in a more essential way. As the typical introspective Kronauer narrator, she is prone to scrutinizing not only her surroundings but also her most hidden desires. She is juxtaposed with another zoo regular, an old woman whose 31 Donna J. Haraway, Simians, Cyborgs, and Women. The Reinvention of Nature.

She keeps them company, talks to them, and surreptitiously feeds them from a huge bag of vegetables and stale bread, watched by the narrator who becomes an omnis- cient presence and the old woman's mouthpiece. One day an exotic wolf, whose pen she may have passed many times before, catches her attention. Einmal, eines Tages, hat die alte Frau zum ersten Mal in ihrem Leben, &gt;zum ersten Mal in meinem ganzen Leben&lt;, sagte sie still bei sich, den Mähnenwolf gesehen, die hochbeinige, schwarzbestrumpfte, brennend rot gekleidete Gestalt (FK 212). The first encounter already includes all the layers of their relationship: »Ich kann meinen Blick nicht von ihm wenden«, sagte sich die Frau. Sie stand allein vor ihrer Entdeckung, die keine Notiz von ihr nahm, die schlenderte, schlenkerte und flanierte für sich allein [...]. »Es war einmal eine alte Frau«, sagte die Frau und schüttelte den Kopf [...]. Etwas erzeugte Wärme in ihr. Sie sah das Tier an (ibid.). Hers is an experience of love at first sight, like the »act of being« described by Martin Buber. Nothing is withheld, and she knows everything of the other, for she knows »nothing isolated about [him] any more«.32 As if to hold on to some sense of self, she speaks to herself about the momentousness of the event, and she does it in words so simple and archaic that they could be from a fairytale. We witness the melting of the old woman's boundaries, and as we see the scene through the omniscient narrator's eyes, we also realize that the two universes are eternally separate. While the old woman stands there trans- fixed, looking at the creature that seems not from this world as it moves »aufreizend, nicht fur diese Welt geschaffen [...] er stiefelt in engen hohen Stiefeln und zwar immer über Wolkenballen hinweg«, a miracle happens - the animal suddenly stops and looks back at her: Der Mähnenwolf [. . .] blieb plötzlich [. . .] stehen, er blieb, er konnte auf seinen eleganten, elegisch-eleganten Läufen gar nicht anders, stehen wie vom Blitz getrof- fen, wie angewurzelt, wie durch Zauberspruch festgebannt, mitten in der Bewe- gung. Nicht ruhig stand er da, sondern erstarrt. Er sah zurück. Der alten Frau schoß das Blut ins Gesicht, so sehr übertraf diese schlagartige Aufmerksamkeit ihre Er- wartungen (FK212). From that moment on she is hooked, hoping every day for another look of recognition. She is saddened when he avoids her gaze; she tries to will him to appear when he hides; and she can't stop thinking about him day and night. She interprets the wolf's every move and look as if they were a teasing lover's secret messages: Er präsentierte sich ihr [. . .] er zeigte sich von allen Seiten [...]. Er lächelte die alte Frau an, er sagte eine Weile nichts, er kam nicht so dicht heran, daß sie ihn hätte berühren können, dann sagte er Duks! Dabei schloß er kurz die Augen und öffnete 32 Martin Buber, I And Thou [Ich und Du, 1922]. Transi. Ronald Gregor Smith. New York 1958, 11.</page><page sequence="16">Becoming Animal? 39 sie wieder, so daß sein Duks! verschwörerisch klang [. . .]. Als wollte er sie locken, so warf er den Kopf herum, blickte sie über den dunklen Pelz der Schulter an (FK 2 14 f ). It is quite obvious that in her infatuation with the wolf the old woman quickly loses contact with reality - or does she, instead, sense a reality beyond what we usually think of as real? How much she herself is conscious of what she feels and what is happening to her is not clear. Her own voice is rarely heard and only in direct speech, as in her dialogue with her cat: &gt;»der Mäh- nenwolf der alten Frau hatte keinen Namen und konnte sprechen^ sagte sie am Abend zur Katze« (FK 214). The old woman's inner experiences and thoughts are mostly filtered through the narrator's mind and interwoven with the narrator's observations and insights. A passage such as »[Der Wolf] flanierte für sich allein, sich selbst mühelos die lockeren Buschlandschaften Südamerikas einredend, weil [er] sonst auf der Stelle zugrundegegangen wäre« (FK 212), reflects how the old woman's empathy with the caged animal has led to identification and, consequently, anthropomorphisation. But the language is the sophisticated narrator's, not the old woman's. The intricate mix of free indirect speech and indirect narrative comment keeps the reader at an ironic distance from the development of the ill-fated love affair. At this distance we witness how the old woman gradually moves from the familiar territory of reason towards that of the imagined &gt;Other&lt;, not by radi- cally switching but rather by tentatively shifting into the liminal areas of magic and mythos. From the very start the wolf seems to her to be more phantasmagoric than an actual specimen. In her feverish pursuit of the be- loved, she attributes to him otherworldly characteristics: Immer hatte sie das Gefühl, er wäre soeben aus dem Zimmer gegangen. Die bran- stige Farbe eines Rotkehlchens, ein Wolkenumriß waren Hinweise, Beweisstücke für seine Nähe. Sie traute es ihm zu. Er konnte, wenn er es nur beabsichtigte, auf verschiedene Arten um sie sein (FK 215). She has no doubt that he would communicate with her if she could only decode his secret messages, yet at the same time she knows that his world is completely separate from hers - »Gleichzeitig war es schön, daß der Mähnen- wolf nichts mit ihr zu tun hatte. Das war es ja!« (FK 213) - and that the whole point of their relationship is for her to move into his world. For a while she wonders whether he, and perhaps all animals, are awaiting metamorphosis, and thus awaiting their redemption by her hand - a fantasy that underlies many fairytales. Dream images from the Grimm Brothers' horse Fallada or the tale of the six swans surface throughout the novel. Here the wolf appears as one of them: »Was muß ich tun, fragte die Frau. Duks! sagte der Mähnen- wolf mit verschlagenem Lächeln. Was sollte er werden: ein Prinz? Ein Bruder, eine Schwester?« (FK 217). Redemption of the other always entails self-re- demption. The old woman, too, »finally understood«: »Sie war es, die sich gefälligst verwandeln mußte, es war ihre eigene Erlösung, die bevorstand. &gt;Ich soll ein Tier werden&lt;, sagte sie zur Katze« (FK 218). Touching yet also rendered</page><page sequence="17">40 Jutta Ittner with Kronauer's trademark irony, the old woman's preparations for her own metamorphosis betray how trapped humans are in their idea of self, even as they are about to relinquish it. Sie lag mit zitternden Gliedern und frohem Herzen, ihr kam der Gedanke, sie [müsse aufbrechen] ohne Personalausweis und irgendwelche Papiere, die ihre Her- kunft und Identität unter den Menschen verrieten. Geld dürfe sie nur so viel mit sich tragen, daß es genau für die Busfahrkarte reichte. Ihren Mantel würde sie anziehen, aber war ihre Brille erlaubt? (FK 218). There remains the ultimate test to be passed, however, which requires an act far more daring than the abandonment of her identity. During the turmoil of growing up and of growing old she had succumbed to societal expectations (»hatte sie sich schließlich dem Bild gefugt, das sie der Umwelt lieferte«) but now she must do the unthinkable: set the wolf free and in the process jeop- ardize her self-image and public image. »Nun wurde sie zur Kasse gebeten und wollte nicht davor zurückschrecken, unanständig zu werden« (FK 220). On the momentous day, however, the wolf will not cooperate or even ac- knowledge her presence, »auch nach einer ganzen Stunde noch nicht, es geschah nichts, es war alles vorbei«. It finally hits home that this most beau- tifiil of animals is no different than the most alien, repulsive, or grotesque creatures of the night: »Er gehörte nicht zu ihr, er war einer von den Geiern und Eulen, den Schlangen und Unken, den Raben und Koboldmakis. Ein rätselhafter Abgrund« (FK 221). Kronauer's story is a remarkable portrait of the human-animal relation- ship on many levels. On the most obvious level the old woman's romance is an ironic and astute psychological study of infatuation. Her choice of pro- tagonists adds a moving as well as an outrageous touch to the ail-too pre- dictable trajectory, and it is the first of several indications that the story is not intended to be read naively. Another one is the uncertainty about whose voice is telling this story - a story which, straightforwardly told, might teeter into anthropomorphism. But the most obvious signal that the woman's story should be taken with more than one grain of salt is the old woman's interaction with her cat. As she reports on the progress of her romance her naïve attitude is juxtaposed with the cat's, whose reactions seem to indicate that it has its own &gt;all-too human&lt; agenda of coping with a partner's fling as best it can. The author orchestrates their pas-de-deux with humor, inge- nuity, and a sly subversiveness, since the cat is anything but the woman's confidante - it actually undermines her credibility. Its function is to serve as a kind of compass for the reader - a reality check, so to speak, to prevent us from aligning with the old woman's fantasy. The comment inherent in the increasingly grotesque juxtapositions cannot be overlooked for long. »Ich soll ein Tier werden«, sagte sie zur Katze, die aus ihrem rundgerollten Leib ein Primaballerinenbein streckte, noch immer weiter vorstreckte. Sollte die ganze klei- ne Masse für diese Verlängerung aufgebraucht werden? Nein, sie schnappte zurück in ihre Rundlichkeit, ohne Kommentar (FK 218).</page><page sequence="18">Becoming Animal? 41 No comment? Certainly this asserts a playful demonstration of the kind of pleasurable cat transformation that humans can only watch with envy. The cat's contrapuntal actions culminate in the final scene: &gt;»Morgen ist es soweit [. . .]&lt;, sagte sie zur Katze. &gt;Morgen werde ich mich und ihn erlösend Die Katze stieß sich rücksichtslos von der Bettdecke ab und rannte zu ihrem Klo« (FK 220). Even more important than understanding the cat's function as an incorrupt- ible corrective, however, is the recognition of it as the &gt;home&lt; embodiment of the completely &gt;Other&lt;. The old woman's confessions to her cat indicate a closeness that is entirely in her imagination. There is no mistaking that just as »der Mähnenwolf nichts mit ihr zu tun hatte« the cat, too, has »nothing to do with her«. The cat surprises the disillusioned woman on her return from the zoo with the magic word - »Duks!« - that no human can understand, as if to flaunt her secret alliance with the wolf. Despite the old woman's longings for intimacy and fantasies of connection, the abyss cannot be bridged. 7 Humans can and do address animals as &gt;thou&lt;, Buber says. Creatures, how- ever, »live and move over against us, but cannot come to us«.33 As this analysis has shown, literary fantasies of animal encounters are invariably based on human constructs. No matter how much we may desire to connect with the &gt;animal mind&lt;, our efforts are doomed to fail, as the various attempts to see animals in their own right lead toward a deeper understanding not of animal but of human nature. Rilke's poem of the panther indicates no awareness of the impasse. In fact, the human mind does not appear as a separate entity - a perfect expression of the illusion that &gt;becoming panther&lt; is possible. Both Lispector's and Kronauer's texts explore animal encounters as the meeting of two minds, or rather two ways of being. Both describe the impact the animal gaze has on a human who surrenders to the completely &gt;Other&lt;, but they imagine the process of &gt;becoming animal&lt; in different ways. Lispector's con- structs of the animal gaze lead to passionate and life-threatening processes that end in a merging of essences and the transformation of the human soul. Kronauer's texts illustrate not only the various ways in which the desire to relate to animals takes shape in the human imagination but they also reflect on why they are doomed. Her texts exemplify the postmodern attitude where human-animal communication is revealed as a construct in which »the other being is precisely supposed to remain what it is and how it is«.34 Dr. Jutta Inner, Case Western Reserve University, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106-7118, USA; E-Mail: jxi6@po.cwru.edu 33 Buber (note 32), 6. 34McNeill(note27),26.</page></plain_text>
