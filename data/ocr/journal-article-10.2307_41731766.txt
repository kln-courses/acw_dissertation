Australia's oldest surviving art form, rock art expresses the Aborigines' social, eco- nomic and religious concerns through the centuries. In the form of petro- glyphs (carvings) and pictographs (paintings) rock art can be found across the continent. It served a variety of functions, and provides the earliest illustration of Aboriginal beliefs, technologies and activities. Australia is a particularly rich region for rock art research because it is one of the few areas where the art is still being produced on rare occasion, a fact that has facilitated the work of anthropologists in collecting many of the myths and meanings associated with the art. By combining ethno- graphic fieldwork and archaeological findings we can begin to interpret the cultural significance of prehistoric rock art in Australia. The Aborigines, who have in- habited Australia for at least 40,000 years, tell of a time when the earth and animals did not yet exist in their present forms. The mythological creatures who inhabited the inchoate land used their supernatural powers to transform the earth into the land- scape which exists today, and to create fire, animals and tribal laws. After completing their creative wanderings these ancestral beings changed into intangible spirits. This mythological period, known as the Dreamtime, is the foundation of Aboriginal religion. Dreaming does not refer to an ordi- nary dream experience; it is a meta- physical concept which structures the world and unites humans with the natural environment and supernatu- ral beings. Through the Dreaming all things become related in a system that links the temporal with the ethereal and the past with the present through mythic and symbolic meta- phors. To the Aborigines, the Dream- time is all-embracing and is expressed in virtually every aspect of life. Various regions developed particu- lar styles of art, and aboriginal rock art is often divided into these main regional types. The earliest known Aboriginal rock art lies underground, in the limestone caves of the southern portion of the continent. Perhaps the best known depository of parietal, or wall, designs is Koonalda Cave, where the simple markings consist of two types: finger meanders, made by sets of parallel finger strokes executed on the soft and pliable areas of the cave wall, and incised lines scratched into the harder surfaces. The markings are located in an isolated and completely dark passage of the cave. The prehistoric use of torches in Koonalda resulted in deposits of</page><page sequence="2">(Left) These paintings from Quinkan Cave depict the malevolent Quinkan spirits . Several figures show evidence of additional painting done at a later date, which suggests that they were maintained and periodically retouched. (Below) This ghost-like Wandjina portrait is from a site on the Gibb River in the Kimberly District . charcoal near dense concentrations of the finger flutings. Associational dating with the charcoal has indicated that this early stage of artistic de- velopment in Australia occurred about 20,000 years ago. Its great antiquity is further supported by the fact that many of the wall markings are covered by 15 meters of rock-falls, some of which are estimated to be 20,000 years old. Recent discoveries of numerous caves containing Pleistocene engrav- ings attest to the extent of the ancient cave art tradition in Australia. In the Mount Gambier region of south- east South Australia, for example, 17 caves are presently known to con- tain archaic rock art. Discovered in 1983, Karlie-Ngoinpool Cave contains thousands of petroglyphs, the most extensive concentration of non-figura- tive cave art known in the world. The oldest markings consist of finger lines across the areas of soft lime- stone, many of which, because of their relatively small scale, appear to have been made by juveniles- a trend consistent with finger fluting sites on other continents, including the Palae- olithic engravings of some European caves such as Altamira. Later motifs include deeply pounded and abraded circles, dots and lines. This petro- glyph tradition, referred to as the "Karake Style" is found in other nearby caves. Another common type of rock art in South Australia is a ground-level style, called Panaramitee after a site containing many petroglyphs of this classification. Panaramitee rock en- gravings are also found in portions of the Northern Tsrritory, New South Wales, Tasmania, and Queensland. They were made by pecking away the dark, patinated outer surface that forms on most exposed rocks, to reveal the lighter, unweathered rock under- neath. Circles, tracks, tectiforms, and meanders predominate. Since rock art cannot be dated directly, we must rely on a variety of other indicators such as re-patination, erosion, distri- bution, subject matter, and associa- tional dating. This evidence indicates that the Panaramitee style is at least 7,000 years old. The rock engravings of central Australia are primarily of the Panara- mitee style. Both petroglyphs and pictographs of the central desert are characterized by their abundance of track designs and abstract geometric motifs. Much of the rock art of this arid region resembles modern Aborig- inal ground and canvas paintings from the area. Although any interpre- tation of prehistoric rock art based on contemporary Aboriginal art is tenuous, some interesting and signifi- cant correlations should be considered. Aboriginal tribes throughout Aus- tralia have expressed the belief that many of the images on rock surfaces are not the product of their own culture, but rather were created during the Dreamtime by the beings who passed through the area during their wanderings. They are a part of the mythological site, made when the site was created, and represent "maps" of important mythological places and events. Ngama and Ruguri caves, two rock painting sites near the Warlpiri tribe's settlement of Yuendumu, con- tinue to play significant roles in modern ceremonial life. Ngama Cave, for example, contains a very large painting of a mythological snake. It is said that when the snake passed Ngama Cave during the Dreamtime, his image was imprinted on the rock and has been there ever since.

The central bent line represents one of the women leaning with her elbow against the rock . certain ritual occasions the pictograph is ceremonially repainted. Rock paintings also occur in abundance at the base of the well- known Ayers Rock in the heart of Australia. The traditional owners of this huge monolith, the Pitjantjatjara people, refer to it as Uluru. TVadition- ally it housed various ritual centers, and continues to be a focal point of Pitjantjatjara religious beliefs; many of their myths explain the Dreamtime events that shaped this remarkable landform. The caves of Ayers Rock contain large numbers of human fig- ures, a relatively rare occurrence in the rock art of central Australia. The Kimberly region in north- western Australia offers some interest- ing examples of the relationship between rock art and mythology. The Aborigines have claimed that some of the paintings in the central Kimberly district contain the spirits of the Ancestral Beings known as Wandjina. When a Wandjina completed his Dreamtime actions he turned himself into a picture containing his spirit and power. The ghost-like Wandjina paintings seem to float against their white background. The eyes and nose of the paintings are connected, and the mouth is not depicted. When the Wandjinas are drawn with bodies, they are decorated with vertical red stripes. It was believed that through their control over the seasonal monsoons the Wandjina regulated lightning and thunder, floods and torrential rain. Wandjina paintings, regarded as the active embodiment of Dreamtime spirits, were believed to be both very sacred and extremely dangerous, since they governed the perpetuation of life for people and animals. The continued well-being of the Wandjina paintings was therefore regarded as essential. TVaditionally, they were maintained and periodically re- touched, and the caves that housed them were kept clean. Touching the paintings was strictly prohibited. Each rock art site belonged to a particular kinship group, who owned the land and had authority over the use of the site. It was their duty to maintain the paintings and rock shelters in their proper condition. TVaditionally, an Aboriginal custodian assumed responsibility as the guardian of a particular site. These men were assigned the responsibility based on their age, degree of religious knowledge, and totemic affiliation. The custodian generally had authority as a ceremonial leader, and it was his duty to insure that the correct rituals were performed at the right time of the year. The Wandjina caves provided a focus for annual rituals which were conducted prior to the monsoon. At this time men sang the songs that retold the Wandjina myths, to placate the spirits and insure that a good, safe season was ahead. It appears that the Wandjina had an ever- changing role in Aboriginal mythology. Some of the most recently executed paintings illustrate sailing ships, men with pipes, and other European-influenced motifs. These paintings, done in the Wandjina style, were incorporated into tribal myths. The practice of retouching the art ended about 25 years ago, after European contact led to the collapse of many cultural traditions, includ- ing the making of rock paintings. rJLhe rock art of the Pilbara region is concentrated in an expansive area that includes the coastal ridges at Port Headland and Dampier, the rock basins of the Hamersley Range, and the Yule and Shaw river catchment area. This region contains the largest concentration of petroglyph sites in Australia- perhaps millions of indi- vidual figures. Several different styles are found throughout the Pilbara region, and considerable variety is seen in subject matter. Along the coast, depictions of fish and marine birds and mammals are common. Further inland, abstractions pre- dominate, and anthropomorphic fig- ures are common. Scattered throughout the Yule and Shaw rivers region are large out- croppings of granite that form islands of shade in an otherwise bleached and dry landscape. The large numbers of human figures in the paintings at these sites show a highly stylized and developed art form, and a great degree of creativity. Some are fairly accurate representations of humans with well-proportioned bodies; others are part human, part animal, appar- ently representing Dreamtime beings. The graceful Kurangara figures, which often appear to be leaping or dancing, have long, flexible limbs forked on the ends. Usually they are shown in profile with a small, pro- truding muzzle. More often than not they are depicted with attenuated head decorations and exaggerated genitals. These agile figures show very little re-patination, and conse- quently stand out in sharp contrast against the dark, weathered surface of the rock. For this reason researchers believe them to be quite recent, es- pecially in comparison to the simpler engravings over which they are often superimposed. Subject matter is a common way of obtaining relative dates for rock art. In the Pilbara, for example, early style petroglyphs lack any depictions of dingoes (wild dogs) or their tracks. The absence of these motifs suggests that the early rock engravings are of great age, since these animals were not present on the continent until about 7,000 years ago. Dingoes are quite important to the Aborigines, and we would expect to find represen- tations of them or their tracks if they had been in Australia during the making of this art. Other styles of anthropomorphic figures are also common in the Pilbara, many of them showing a similarity to the animated Kurangara style. Rock paintings, too, are scattered throughout the region, but this art form never reached the sophistication and development of the engravings. The rock shelters of sub-tropical Arnhem Land hold an abundance of varied and beautifully executed ex- amples of rock art. Here, a rich array of pictographs adorns the walls of July/ August 1986 21</page><page sequence="5">This composition of X-ray -style figures at Nourlangie Rock was painted in 1964 by the Aborigine Najomboli, and was executed on top of older, more faded fig- ures, . The figure in the upper right rep- resents N amargón, the Lightning Man , and the large figure to the left is the malignant spirit Namandjoik . shallow caves and rock overhangs. The two most general pictograph styles in Arnhem Land are the X-ray and Mimi paintings. (An in-depth analysis of the art would, however, yield a more complex categorization. ) Both tend to be basically naturalistic, yet their differences in form and sub- ject matter are striking. The Mimi style is generally more simple in de- sign than the X-ray art, yet its ele- gance is remarkable. The Mimi are spirit people, the beings responsible for teaching the Aborigines to paint, and in fact, it has been said, for cre- ating much of the rock art in the area. Mimi-phase figures are often slender and shown in action- dancing, fight- ing, hunting, and running. They are monochrome paintings, and are said to have been made by the small Mimi spirits. X-ray pictographs, generally large and polychromatic, are usually representations of people and ani- mals, and unlike the Mimi paintings, are essentially static pictures. The X-ray art is so called because it illus- trates not only the body of a subject, but some internal organs and skeletal features as well; the heart, lungs, stomach, and backbone of an animal are often depicted. Both the X-ray and Mimi paint- ings are delicately executed works. Since the X-ray designs consistently overlie the Mimi figures, it is obvious that they represent the more recent rock painting tradition in Arnhem Land. Although the pictographs are no longer produced, the X-ray style is frequently used in the contem- porary bark paintings made by the local Aborigines. The pigments used to create these colorful paintings, and rock paint- ings throughout Australia, were pri- marily derived from pulverized minerals, perhaps mixed with a nat- ural binder such as tree resin. Vari- ous shades of red and yellow ochre were utilized, as well as white pipe- clay and black manganese. These pigments were obtained from quarries throughout Arnhem Land, and were sometimes traded into different tribal territories. Charcoal, a readily avail- able source of paint, was used often, as were brushes, probably made of human hair, bark, feathers, or a twig chewed at one end to loosen the cellu- lose fibers. In 1964 Najombolami, an Ab- original from Arnhem Land, painted the main composition at the well- known Nourlangie Rock. This mural is unique in being one of the few gal- leries decorated within living memory. Painted over earlier works, the com- position illustrates various mytho- 22 ARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="6">Before his death in 1982 , Rowley Gin - jannum was the Aboriginal custodian of the Wanalirri site, where he is shown sitting in front of a panel of Wandjina . logical beings, fish and family groups. The Lightning Man, Namargon, re- sponsible for producing lightning, thunder and storms, and his wife Barginj are portrayed. Namargon is depicted with stone axes emerging from his head, knees and elbows which he uses to strike the clouds and create lightning. Two family groups are painted in the X-ray style, and two of the women are shown with milk in their breasts. Namandjolk, a malevolent spirit being, is the largest of the pictographs in this shelter and is quite detailed. Many of the rock shelters of Arn- hem Land contain painted images considered of vital legendary impor- tance to the Aborigines. Since it was believed that the act of creating or retouching a painting could release the spirit of the subject, these acts were often considered a necessary component of ritual. The practice in- sured the preservation of the paint- ings, but with the breakdown of many aspects of traditional aboriginal cul- ture re-painting has ceased, and the designs are slowly but inevitably and permanently fading away. Scattered around the vicinity of Laura in the southeast Cape York Peninsula of far northern Queensland are some of the richest and best pre- served pictograph galleries of the world. Hundreds of adorned shelters and caves are scattered throughout the hills and valleys of this region. Much of the art is of great antiquity, while the most recent figures are es- timated to be about 50 years old. En- gravings are the earliest form of rock art in the area, and they appear to have died out when the techniques of painting were developed. Many of the galleries are huge and contain hundreds of paintings superimposed in numerous layers. The Cape York Peninsula lies in a subtropical belt where an abundance of animal and vegetable food sources provided a rich area for Aboriginal habitation. Steep sandstone escarp- ments line the valleys, and numerous sheltered overhangs have been etched out of the rock through weathering. The Aborigines spent much of their time in these shelters, especially dur- ing the wet season (November through April), and it is there that much of the rock art is found. The majority of the Cape York rock paintings are human and animal motifs representing totemic animals, mythological beings, game animals, and an assortment of human figures. Weapons, implements and plants are also depicted as are stencils of hands and objects of material culture. Sur- face finds of occupational material have indicated that many of the shel- tered galleries were inhabited exten- July/ August 1986 23</page><page sequence="7">sivěly, albeit intermittently. The motifs found in several of these shel- ters appear to depict Ancestrali Beings and other mythological creatures. The dearth of occupational artifacts in some galleries suggests that these places were reserved as specialized ritual grounds. Some of the pictographs appear to correspond to tribal myths from the region- legends of creation and history made visible and concrete through the rock paintings. Some of the paintings, for example, appear to represent the powerful and dangerous Quinkan spirits, attenuated beings thought to live in crevices in the cave walls. Their portraits served as a warning to the people who entered to obey tribal customs and taboos, Like most Aboriginal art, these paintings helped to preserve and enforce tribal laws, and to maintain the continuity of established custom. A variety of human and animal figures believed to have been imple- mented for sorcery is found through- out the region. Horizontal or inverted humans were the sorcery motifs most often used, although snakes, birds and catfish were also portrayed for sorcery magic. The human figures, often simply drawn, were sometimes depicted with distorted genitals and limbs. To increase the effectiveness of a painting, chanting or singing often accompanied its creation. Find- ing an appropriate place to create the painting, the artist would secretly "sing to death" an enemy. Other motifs were probably utilized as sym- pathetic magic for hunting and court- ing, and as aids to insuring the increase of certain animal species. In Australia and other parts of the world, rock art provides some of the earliest evidence of material culture. Depicted in the rock paintings of the southeast Cape York Peninsula are objects such as spears, boomerangs, stone axes, bark bone-containers and carrying bags, hair-string belts, jewelry, and elaborate headdresses- a wealth of information through which we can reconstruct some ele- ments of prehistory. The study of superimpositionings in rock art can 24 ARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="8">lend insight into the evolution of art styles and techniques. By analyzing them we can establish a chronologi- cal sequence of subject matter that can help us to understand how a cul- ture has changed and responded to new situations. In the Cape York Peninsula, for instance, the majority of sorcery-type paintings are found in the most recent stages of the rock art. This suggests that these motifs were inspired by the European and Chinese invasion of the region which began in the late nineteenth century. In the Carnarvon Ranges of south-central Queensland, the sten- ciling of hands and cultural material objects was a highly developed rock art technique. The stencils are often arranged in intricate patterns which form large murals of a dozen or more paintings within a single composi- tion. Stencils are found in a wide variety of sites, ranging from im- mense rock shelters over 75 meters in length with more than 2,000 motifs to small boulders or potholes with a single painting. They were made by pressing a hand or object against the rock and splattering paint around it to produce a negative imprint. The most common stenciling technique apparently involved spraying a thin paint mixture from the mouth. The translucent-like silhouettes which result are found in every part of Aus- tralia that contains rock paintings. The human hand had symbolic . connotations throughout Australia, and it is one of the most prominent subjects in the stenciled art of the central Queensland highlands. Some of the functions of hand stencil motifs, such as their use by individuals mark- ing their visits to mortuary sites and totemic places, have been recorded by ethnographers. In the Kimberly region, men of a certain rank were required to stencil their hands on the cave walls when they visited a burial site of one of their ancestors; the fact that the majority of hand motifs in (Above, left) In this composition from the Carnarvon Range two boomerang stencils are in superimposition with human hands and marsupial paws . (Above, right) Abstract compositions such as the one in this oblique view of an engraved panel at Ooramina are found at various sites. (Below) This inverted sorcery painting from the Mushroom Roch Gallery is unusual in its elaborate decoration . The catfish and snakes depicted in this gallery may be sorcery motifs; hand stencils are also commonly associated with sorcery figures . the Carnarvon Ranges occurs at mor- tuary sites suggests a connection with this practice. In other regions of Australia hand stencils were used to guard areas where sacred tribal objects were stored. They served as warnings to ill-intentioned visitors and may have been used to derive power from sacred sites in some areas; in other areas a hand stencil or print near the entrance of the caves in which sacred items were stored indicated good intentions, and allowed the person to enter by insuring that the visit would be safe. The hand stencil variations in the rock paintings, diverse in form, in- clude various hand postures and dis- torted finger positions, and an abundance of stencils with "missing fingers." These were formerly inter- preted as evidence of hand mutila- tions (the practice of finger disarticulation has been recorded from various regions of Australia) but recent analyses suggest that most of the variant hand stencils illustrate symbols used in sign language. Most of the stenciled hand variants correspond to recorded sign* language symbols from tribes within the Carnarvon Ranges, and many are similar to the sign language gestures of different totemic groups. This sup- ports the notion that totemic affilia- tion and rank were being expressed. Along with hand motifs the sten- ciled art of the Queensland highlands includes accurate schematic repre- sentations of hafted stone and steel axes, clubs, shields, different types of boomerangs, coolomons (wooden dishes), and a variety of other objects that provide information about the material culture of the region's Ab- origines. Rock engravings, frequently covered by stencils, include animal tracks, simple linear incised and abraded grooves, and the abundant "cup and ring" motif, often appearing as small three-dimensional sculptures carved in the sandstone walls. The cup and ring motifs, consisting of a deep oval groove surrounded by a shallow oval groove, have been inter- preted as fertility signs that may rep- resent the ventral view of the vulva. A small drilled hole is often located between the two elliptical abrasions. These motifs, which appear in only a part of the Carnarvon sites, are often found in large numbers. If they do in fact represent fertility symbols, it seems likely that these places were specified as fertility sites. Thousands of petroglyph sites, with many thousands of Aboriginal engravings, occur near Sydney, be- tween the Hunter and Hawksbury rivers of New South Wales, where numerous exposures of Triassic sand- stone form large, horizontal rock pavements. In the relatively soft rock, the engravers pounded small, shal- low pits close together to create out- lines of their subjects. In some cases, the pits have been abraded together, and solid grooves form the perimeters of the motifs. The petroglyphs de- pict humans and animals, mythical beings, tracks, weapons, and various non-figurative motifs. Some are arranged in compositions suggesting rituals and group hunts. The most unusual feature of this art is its scale. The large, flat rock surfaces enabled the Aborigines to depict their sub- jects life-size- there are human fig- ures and kangaroos measuring over seven meters, eels over ten meters long, and full-size whales. The huge scale suggests that some of these engravings may portray mythologi- cal Dreamtime beings, creatures that are often described as being larger than life. Rock art in Australia was once a prolific expression of material cul- ture and symbolic thought. Its social relevance was understood, in vary- ing degrees, by all tribal members who viewed it. Through their art, the Aborigines communicated ideas and concepts that were at the center of a complex set of cultural beliefs. Symbolism is inseparable from Aboriginal art. Still, it should be understood that Aboriginal rock art was essentially utilitarian; it was one of the symbolic mediums through which the powers of the Dream- time were brought to bear upon every- day affairs. With only a few exceptions, Australian rock art is no longer ritu- ally maintained or re-painted. Periodic re-touching assured the life of picto- graphs for extended periods. But with the outside pressure of European contact and the consequent ebbing of many aspects of traditional Abo- riginal culture, rock art ceased to be a common mode of expression, and its images have become subject to the destructive elements of weather, vandals, livestock, and greed. Rock art remains one of the most enigmatic aspects of traditional Aboriginal culture. Its images still beckon us to understand and appreciate the rich artistic heritage of the Australian Aborigines. □ July/ August 1986 25</page></plain_text>
