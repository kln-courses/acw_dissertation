All rights reserved Seen to be Remembered: Presentation, Representation and Recollection in British Evangelical Culture Since the Late 1970s John Harvey Protestant Nonconformity has, since the establishment of the denominations and permanent places of worship, adapted and adopted religious artefacts as aids to evangelism, teaching, church and domestic decoration, commemoration and devotion. Collectively, they represent the visualization of popular piety, and the emergent iconography of large ecclesio-social groups (Evangelical in theology) which are drawn from the working and middle classes. These groups have seceded from, and actively define themselves against, the ethos, organization and liturgical traditions of the High Church. In this respect, the commercial kitsch-which largely comprises these artefacts and mediates the visual culture of Evangelicalism-reflects a confluence of Low Church religion with low-cultural forms, and of mass religion with mass production. This article examines examples of what might be termed Evangelical 'tie-ins' in the context of the movement's promotion of identity, and of its culture of scriptural memorization, teaching and proselytizing. Using late twentieth- century examples, the discussion focuses on the relationship between the artefacts' combination of image and text, and addresses Evangelicalism's choice of imagery, its deployment of the visual as a conduit for memory and for internalizing the textual (percepts as pretexts for precepts), and the associative function (as opposed to the intrinsic worth) of such imagery. The article also traces the historical precedents for these principles to eighteenth-century Protestant emblemature. Keywords: consumer products-domestic display-Evangelicalism-kitsch-Puritanism- religion Among the recent advances in the study of Protest- antism and art is the acknowledgement that, like art, Protestantism is not an undifferentiated whole. The movement comprises a shifting coalition of theo- logical styles, subsets, churches and individuals, with diverse trajectories, at different times and in different places.1 Protestantism also has a varied and complex visual expression, one which extends well beyond the European High Art tradition of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (with which the movement is commonly associated). This expression includes a visual culture of popular piety, the study of which (while still in its infancy) has shown that Protestants, in spite of their iconoclastic and iconophobic tend- encies, have employed types of visual artefacts and customs of visualization as varied as their constituency is diverse. The essay contributes to this developing specificity and catholicity of approach, and involves a preliminary examination of the visual culture of the largest contemporary Protestant movement-Evan- gelicalism. Up to now, it is chiefly American scholars who 177</page><page sequence="2">John Harvey have contributed to the study of Evangelical visual culture in the twentieth century. They have based their research largely upon examples produced in the United States, and aimed to describe not only the artefacts' intrinsic properties but also their significance within the broader framework of religious rites and customs, and of movements outside Evangelicalism and Protestantism.2 In Britain, there has been com- paratively little work on the material trappings of Evangelicalism used in the country during the last century.3 Possibly this is because the artefacts have been largely either imported from the United States (like many other types of consumer goods) or are imitative of the American variety. One should not, however, assume that identical artefacts transplanted into foreign soil necessarily adapt (or are adapted) in the same way. For example, the emblematic tradition of theological and homiletic discourse in British Evangelicalism may encourage a way of seeing and reading artefacts comprising pictures and verses that is more peculiar to Britain than to the United States.4 Recent scholarship has rightly emphasized the relation between the manufacture and purchase of Evangelical artefacts and trends in consumer culture in general.5 Nevertheless, this has often been at the expense of encouraging other perspectives. There has been little attention paid to the reciprocity and nuances of image and text; the diverse ways in which believers use artefacts as aids to devotion and as signs of affiliation; a comparison of the material and visual expressions of piety with oral and aural mediums such as hymns, prayers, and sermons; and the contrasting ways in which artefacts function in the private and individual realm of the home as distinct from the public and communal realm of the church. Moreover, there has been virtually no inter- action between the scholars in this field across the Atlantic. In an attempt to address some of these deficits, this essay makes specific reference to artefacts in Britain since the late 1970s (a renascent period for some branches of Evangelicalism6), and the group's use of the visual as a means of propaganda and as a conduit for recalling the textual. Like Protestantism, Evangelicalism, while bound by a general agreement on common doctrines, is a heterogeneous ecclesio-social movement. It is found among most Protestant denominations, and describes a global enterprise committed to the spread of a historical understanding of the gospel. Historically, Evangelicalism has three main phases of develop- ment, identified with: first, the Lutheran wing of the Reformation; secondly, the succession of reli- gious revivals or awakenings in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; and, thirdly, since the twentieth century, the Holiness, Pentecostal, Charismatic, Fun- damentalist, and neo-Reformation groups.7 The doc- trinal emphases of Evangelicalism include: conversion (through an experience of spiritual rebirth); biblicism (that is, the acceptance of the Bible as the supreme basis of authority in matters of faith and practice); activism (in preaching and sharing one's faith, prin- cipally); and crucicentrism (a focus upon the merits of Christ's redemptive sacrifice).8 Consequently, Evan- gelicalism is suspicious of Roman Catholic and High Church traditions such as the saving virtues of the sacraments, ceremonies, vestments, the authority of the Established Church, the claims of episcopate, and (of particular relevance to this discussion) the use of images in the public declaration of the gospel and private devotion. Evangelicalism is, therefore, Low Church in orientation.9 During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it was 'low' in many other respects too. The movement's mission to the masses exploited the growing means of mechanical reproduction, dissem- inating its message through low-cultural and ephem- eral forms such as newspapers, broadsides, cheap prints and pamphlets.10 Conversion and devotion were further encouraged by immaterial expressions of Evangelical belief, such as dramatic, emotional, and practical preaching (unadorned by elevated rhetoric and allusions to high culture, so beloved of High Churchmen).11 The laity, for their part, extempor- ized communal and private prayer using everyday language. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Evangelicals appealed to the lower orders of society not only by means of educational, philan- thropic and legislative endeavours to improve the worker's lot, but also by promoting modes of worship and cultural tastes consistent with the working-class milieu: sentimental songs and choruses (popularized by the American singing evangelists Dwight L. Moody [1837-99] and Ira D. Sankey [1840-1908]) whose lilt and melody, which had more in common with the music-hall ditty than the English anthem tradition, accompanied evangelistic and revivalist meetings;12 Pentecostal tongues-speaking and ecstatic dance-again, imported into England from the 178</page><page sequence="3">Seen to be Remembered: British Evangelical Culture Since the Late 1970s United States-provided non-intellectual forms of religious articulation for those who were disenfran- chized from the learned class and culture;13 while banners bright, text-laden tableware, and chromo- lithographic prints of preachers, patriarchs and prophets (with designs derived from artefacts com- monly used to celebrate national heroes and espouse socio-political ideals) helped to cultivate an aspirant working-class religious ethos.14 By the end of the twentieth century, Evangelical- ism in Britain (following, as it had done in the early 1900s, the lead given by United States) had requisi- tioned every conceivable form of mass media and merchandise: it published books and magazines, set up record companies and TV and radio stations, and produced a variety of merchandise in order to provide a now burgeoning middle class with anything from devotional aids to Christian entertainment.15 Consequently, Evangelicalism grew to be not only a theological enterprise but also a counterculture. Today, as then, a significant aspect of this culture's visual expression is its pious 'tie-ins'-commodities which adapt secular conventions of design and im- agery (as in previous centuries) and, in some cases, exhibit a relationship to the broader traditions of Christian art, the visual culture and other creative expressions of Protestantism, and (more remotely) to the cultic objects and practices of biblical times. The merchandise consists of posters, badges, brooches, tiepins, T-shirts, greetings cards, bookmarks, wall plaques, stationery and novelty goods. Collectively, the artefacts reflect the confluence of Low-Church religion with low-cultural forms, and of mass religion with mass production. Much of it is made by small promotional businesses (of which not all are con- secrated to the Evangelical cause), and retailed through Christian bookshops, church bookstalls, and by mail order.16 More often, the artefacts express universally Christian rather than sectarian sentiments, and so appeal across the board of Evangelical churches and Protestant denominations, and to the Roman Catholic community. Like souvenirs, these items are often cheap and affordable and, therefore, without any intrinsic prestige or preciousness beyond their associations or the sentiments they mediate. Similarly, the choice of artefact reveals who the purchaser or recipient is and with what they wish to associate themselves,17 variously serving as a visual statement of religious identity, a seal of allegiance, an affirmation of convictions, or an externalization of the inner motions of the spirit. In addition to serving as a tribal badge, the merchandise fosters a culture of remembering. Remembering is an obligation for Evangelicals. Throughout the Bible, God commands all men and women not to forget his word (Deuteronomy 4: 31; Psalm 119: 176), and to express their obedience by memorizing, understanding and acting upon it, as well as by presenting it to the mind and conscience of unbelievers through evangelism (that is, preaching and personal testimony). Visual artefacts have always played a significant role in fulfilling these duties. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Scripture texts were either painted or carved on the walls of early Evangelical churches and chapels to fill the vacuum created by Calvin's ban on images. Evan- gelicals pasted broadsheets on the walls of the domes- tic interior, and, in the nineteenth century, hung samplers, long-stitch work, printed texts and sten- cilled crockery in both their own houses and those of God-a literal interpretation of the scriptural injunc- tion to 'shew . .. the word of God' (1 Samuel 9: 27) (my emphasis).18 Thus, the Word was seen (in the sense that it was both ensured and visible) to be remembered. Identity and evangelism The use of artefacts to articulate identity and bring about remembrance coalesces in the context of evangelism. During the late twentieth century, Evan- gelicals utilized merchandise to render not only the gospel but also their own movement visible and unforgettable. Having entered the marketplace, they recognized that in a multi-cultural, multi-faith society Christianity was no longer the only religious option; and in an increasingly fragmented denominational and theological framework, Evangelicalism was not the only Christian option.19 In order to secure a distinctive profile for both, Evangelicals adopted the devices, language and gameplay of advertising. Mar- keting the gospel effected a significant paradigm shift: free grace became a saleable commodity, and 'the lost and lone' a large target audience. Moreover, as Evangelicals realized, sinners were not the only consumers; there were two distinct groups-un- believers, who were being prepared to buy God 179</page><page sequence="4">John Harvey READS; In the ems of breakdon. please pt urttgr -mimto to the mtake .. &gt;1 .. . .II M _ J Fig 1.

The branding of Evangelicalism required a distilla- tion of its message into memorable and visible confessional slogans, emphasizing its doctrinal dis- tinctives: the person, work, the second coming of Christ, and the need for conversion. The designs for evangelistic merchandise either incorporate, or else are exclusively, biblical texts, mottoes and catch- phrases expressing a Christian viewpoint. The excep- tions are items based upon traditional Christian symbols such as the alpha and omega, dove, cross and fish. These are popularly realized as 22-carat hard gold-plated lapel badges and scarf pins, and plastic bumper stickers. (Originally, the fish, or ichlthus, was a sign used among the early believers to show, clan- destinely, their loyalty to Christ. Evangelicals sport the symbol to signify the same, but freely and confidently.2") Since the 1970s, cotton T-shirt and bag designs have had a prominent role in promoting the message to young people by young people prin- cipally [1]. During the counterculture offensive of the 1960s, screenprinted T-shirts were the uniform of protest and disenfranchisement; a decade later, the power, action, peace and liberation of which Evan- gelicals spoke was spiritual rather than political. The rationale for propagating the Word by this means (so some Evangelicals believe) is biblical, according to the following principle: the apostle Paul referred to the Christian as an 'epistle of Christ', bearing the spiritual inscription of God's word, 'known and read of all men' (2 Corinthians 3: 3); or, as the Puritan Richard Allestree (1619-81) put it: 'the lives of Christians were the transcripts of their doctrine'. 2 Christians, thus conceived, were tangible memorials to the gospel message. The T-shirt literalizes the metaphor, transforming the wearer into a walking placard. Wearing the Word had an Old Testament pre- cedent too. Gems engraved with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel were incorporated into the ephod and breastplate ofjudgement worn by the high priest, as a permanent, visible, reminder of the people whom he carried with him before God (Exodus 28: 2-30). The high priest also wore, fastened at the front of his mitre, upon his forehead, the plate of the holy crown: 'a plate of pure gold, and [engraved] upon it, like the engravings of a signet "holiness to the Lord"'-a sign and authentication of the people's 180 MP9 till-t- . 2</page><page sequence="5">Seen to be Remembered: British Evangelical Culture Since the Late 1970s 1-0.1 . . -.0 , .4-C, - 7..1. fA e ik. , -jj,&gt; }High Quality T Shirts for Today's Christian Woman ";l..yy 'And We e hrow in some pretty radical nes as well ..

These physical appurtenances were thus a constant reminder of all his statutes and commandments (Deuteronomy 6: 2-9).23 Promotional companies referred to T-shirts, badges and other forms of dress accessories as 'witness wear'-the vestments of laity, worn by a generation of Evangelicals who were ostentatious in worship and courageously 'coming out' about their faith at a time when (in the United States, especially) Evangelicalism was developing into a religious and political force to be reckoned with. These artefacts signify the God they carry with them before a lost humanity and represent not only a non-verbal and informal means of telling by slhowing the gospel, but also a confident assertion of religious identity, serving, furthermore, as a reminder (as much to themselves as to others) of the God whom they serve. The design imagery, some of which also reflects the ex-ecclesial affiliations and consumerist trends of young Evangelicals, tends to be imitative and parasitic [2]. On one level, this is intentional. Evangelicalism ransacks and parodies popular logos and graphic styles unashamedly, con- necting hype and hip, sacred and secular, in an attempt to dispel Christianity's air of starchy serious- ness and otherworldliness, and to address the (so- called) unchurched using a graphic language that is comprehensible in terms of their culture. For example, one T-shirt design consists of a theological adaptation and amalgamation of the famous Pepsi Cola and Coca Cola slogans of the 1970s, with the words: 'Life giving, soul saving, joy filling, peace making, long suffering, load lifting, heart thrilling, rock solid Jesus Christ-he's the real thing.' This endeavour parallels other developments in Evangelicalism during the 1970s. New translations of the Bible aimed for clarity and immediacy, by adapting the ancient texts to the everyday speech of a 181</page><page sequence="6">John Harvey contemporary readership. Likewise, new hymns abandoned the theological ruminations and poetic archaisms of previous centuries' hymnology in favour of modern idioms, prosaic statements, and musical settings influenced by contemporary popular songs. On another level, derivativeness was the fruit of Evangelicalism's own history. Unlike, for example, Shakerism in the United States, the movement never had a conscious and consistent visual style. The closest it achieved to a visual expression of biblical purism was in the form of the earliest Dissenting and Nonconformist places of worship. They were built using simple vernacular building techniques and were characterized by an economic, homespun, plain style and pared-down austerity which conveyed a formid- able visual identity predicated on the invisibility of God and the simplicity of New Testament worship which established a contradistinction to Roman Catholic and High Anglican Churches.24 In spite of the merchandise's street-wise, contem- porary (if hackneyed) graphic style, the meaning of the message very often remains resolutely unintelli- gible to those who are unfamiliar with the whole fabric of the Bible, of which the screen-printed quotes and catchphrases are but as loose threads. The artefacts also reveal a painful naivety regarding the reciprocity of medium and message. In some examples, image and style reflect inappropriately on the biblical text as, to quote Peter Lloyd Jones, 'visual reality clashes violently with the profundity of the religious sentiment leading to bathos'.25 For instance, one typographic design, set in variant Old English Text type, rendered as though in polished chrome (with its connotations of motorbike culture and heavy metal music), refers to salvation as 'Heavenly Metal: It'll Rock the Hell out of You'. The often strident, triumphalist, self-satisfied mottoes, passe allusions (devoid of Postmodern irony), such as 'Try a Close Encounter of the Real Kind', and arbitrary design styles betray a cultural awkwardness-the absence of a developed and confident understanding of forms and their habitual significance-which is not lost on their audience. Piety and commodity 'Wear and share' merchandise enables Evangelicals to propagate the cause as they venture into the world. Their homes, too, are the setting for evangelistic opportunity-the place where the world comes unto them in the shape of unconverted visitors, friends and family members. What could be called 'display and pray' merchandise, chiefly wall-mounted ornaments and utility objects meant for show, hang up the staircase and down the hall, preaching silent sermons to the weary, lost and lone. The home is Evangelicalism's most unecclesiastical context. In the absence of traditional Christian symbols and repre- sentations (such as a crucifixes, crosses and figurines of holy persons, familiar in some Roman Catholic domestic interiors), plaques, posters and ceramic mugs signify the occupants' faith. The plaques are usually 20 centimetres in height, available in a variety of shapes, and comprise veneered or laminated fibre- board, painted in wood effect or pastel colours (appropriate for almost any decor). Many examples bear inscriptions in gold- or silver-leaf stamping, together with stencilled or screen-printed pictures, and are designed to be hung on die-cast metal mouldings finished to imitate antique brass. Posters, postcards and, latterly, photocards, are produced cheaply in a range of sizes on laminated paper and card suitable for either framing or pinning up in more informal areas of the Evangelical home, such as the bathroom, kitchen and children's bedrooms. The mugs are manufactured in white, glazed bone china, ceramic whiteware or plastic, and decorated with transfer prints. (The more expensive range is sold gift-boxed.) They combine, somewhat jarringly, spir- itual sentiment with a desperately mundane utility. The artefacts each comprise a biblical text, inspira- tional maxim, creed, prayer, hymn verse or moraliz- ing poem, often along with a photograph, illustration or decorative adjunct [3]. (Increasingly, commercial prints showing Jesus and acts of Christian piety join with photographs of family, deceased relatives, and friends above the mantelpiece. As Colleen McDan- nell remarks of the same practice in the United States, heavenly kin and earthly kin are brought together at the family shrine.26) The merchandise removes Scrip- ture from the closed covers of a book, converting it into a mobile, purposeful and godly decoration-a perpetual memorial to the faithfulness of both God and the family. In Victorian times, the biblical texts chosen for display were frequently alarming and confrontational: 'Prepare to Meet Thy God' was among the most 182</page><page sequence="7">Seen to be Remembered: British Evangelical Culture Since the Late 1970s Fig 3. Advertisement for 'Colonial Charm Plaques' (1980s), 26 x 20 cm. LD3753 LV3756 popular. They warned the spectator to heed the consequences of sin, the certainty of death, and judgement to come. By contrast, contemporary examples foster a serene and reassuring ethos which aims to encourage faith in the unbeliever and pacify the believer's anxiety. Texts such as 'Peace, Be Still' and 'The Lord is my Shepherd' emphasize the consolations of God and signal the displacement of a fearless, unselfconscious, sandwich-board piety by a religious identity which is more optimistic, heart- ening, soft-bellied and inoffensive in its lack of aggression and wish to wound.27 The appropriately anodyne, romantic naturalism of the accompanying imagery draws for the most part on God's second book-the natural world. Flowers and animals emblematize the texts' references to God's goodness and abundant provision, and the believer's spiritual life and growth, following the imagery of the Psalms. The designs and their deployment, together with the framing devices, engender a nostalgic air of old colonialism and rustic Victorianism, while motifs and subjects recall domestic decals popular in the 1950s. These were eras more sympathetic to Evan- gelical values, in which, some writers argue, Evangelicals remain psychologically marooned.28 Evangelism is not the sole end of visualizing Scripture in these ways. The sentiments of the artefacts' texts also address the needs and experience 183 LD3754 LD3755</page><page sequence="8">John Harvey of those belonging to 'the household of faith', just as they had in the previous two centuries. In Copley's Memorials of Practical Piety (1830), an example of a nineteenth-century biographical genre which por- trayed the exemplary lives of contemporary Chris- tians who had died well, the terminally ill Marianne Beuzevil reflects: 'How humbled would I be, when I consider what trifles have, this week, and do con- tinually keep me from my retired devotions. Oh! when shall I have my heart and affections placed more entirely on heavenly objects'.29 By 'Heavenly objects' she meant spiritual realities. But they could equally have been material artefacts (like those men- tioned already), elevated on the walls to remind believers to fix their hearts on goals and priorities above, when the vain and even the legitimate things of this world press too hard for attention. Today too, such heavenly objects provide a visual focus for devotion amid not only life's distractions but also the clutter of possessions that comprise the domestic environment. While sharing the same substance of such worldly trappings, the message transfigures the object, sanctifying and legitimizing its materiality by association with the divine truth, and providing an uplifting purpose and a justification for its purchase. The relative inexpensiveness of these artefacts in comparison to other household items also serves to play down their status as acquisitions. The objectification of the Word in the home as a means to preserve piety and to express religious identity originates in the early history of Judaism. God charged the Israelites to write his command- ments on the doorposts of their houses and on their gates, once they possessed the land of promise (Deuteronomy 6: 9; 11: 20).30 Previously, in the land of Egypt, he had instructed them to strike the side posts and lintels of their houses with hyssop soaked in the blood of the sacrificial lamb, as a sign to the Lord to pass over (Exodus 12: 7, 21-3). The blood and the Word were both visualizations of the covenantal relationship. The former was an abstract expression, made at the commencement of their wanderings, and before the composition of the Torah, as a symbol of protection, for God to see. The latter was made at the conclusion of their wanderings, as a symbol of their fidelity and obedi- ence, for the families of Israel to see, lest they forget 'the Lord, which brought [them] forth . . . from the house of bondage' (Deuteronomy 6: 12). The con- text of the command suggests that, in all likelihood, the domestic inscriptions were also a means of teaching the children, in addition to oral instruction, and an aide-memoire to instil God's commandments in their 'heart' (Deuteronomy 6: 6-7).31 The practice of setting up text-bearing artefacts on the walls of Evangelical homes retains some of the essential significance of the inscriptions on the Israelites' door- posts and gates. The plaques, posters, plates and prints are, in addition to being consecrated decoration, covenantal signs between God and believers-visual memorials (lest they forget) of the promises and consolations of God and of fundamental Christian duties. The artefacts externalize Scripture (to be seen), in order for believers to internalize it (to be remem- bered). The practice reflects a religious culture, wherein the Word is not restricted to Sunday services but experienced daily in the home. The Evangelicals' predecessors, the Puritans, encouraged believers to read the Bible through at least once a year. They regarded the home as a school in which the children in particular and servants were to be catechized and encouraged to learn the Scripture by heart. Protes- tants published numerous booklets of so-called proof texts, which drew together short and pithy Bible verses to provide a shorthand corroboration of Chris- tian doctrine, God's promises and moral axioms.32 Similar texts, to the same end, are found on con- temporary domestic artefacts. Evangelicals, likewise, view the inculcation of biblical knowledge in children as a priority. For this reason, they Christianize objects that children habi- tually use with the inscription of a Bible verse. These objects are usually accessories associated with their general education and play. The eternal and the ephemeral, the cherished and the cheap, the holy and the utilitarian are conjoined, as pencils, rulers, rubbers and sharpeners are conscripted into sacred service. They also amalgamate religious culture and consumer culture, adopting and adapting the forms of promotional merchandise by printing a biblical verse rather than the company logo on them [4].33 The same accessory is available bearing one of a variety of texts. The relationship between text and support is therefore entirely arbitrary. However, occasionally, fortuitous meaning arises from a conjunction. For example, the inevitable consonance between the inscription 'Christ Died for Us' and its support-a 184</page><page sequence="9">Seen to be Remembered: British Evangelical Culture Since the Late 1970s rnmummrtt6- - III .I Wv11 * X 31 '2 41 ' - 5 - ' 71 W - W - w .-.-.

Correspondences between other artefacts and reli- gious concepts may be forged: thus erasers speak of Christ's expunction of sin; sharpeners of the quicken- ing and exacting nature of the spiritual life; and pencils of holy inscription. Granted, these accessories in themselves, irrespective of the accompanying text, do not convey such ideas (nor are they intended to). Nevertheless, this is neither a wilful nor (necessarily) an idiosyncratic association. Evangelicals encourage a parabolic outlook on life; they are not averse to transforming everyday events -~i*. :!

The Puritan writer Lewis Bayly (d. 1631) advocated that Christians contemplate every aspect of their experience, from waking to sleep, from a spir- itual perspective, thereby transforming their whole world into a veritable tableau of emblems. As they prepare for bed, he suggests: Things to be meditated upon as thou art putting off thy cloathes . . . That the day is coming when thou must be barely unstript of all that thou hast in the World . . . When thou seest thy bed, let it put thee in minde of thy grave . . . Let therefore thy bed-clothes represent unto thee the mould of the earth, that shall cover thee: thy sheets, thy winding sheet; thy sleep, thy death, thy waking, thy resurrec- tion.34 The object assumed religious significance only when vivified by the gloss. Once converted into a sign, it functioned as a mnemonic device. In theory, frequent exposure to the image on devotional merchandise and to the accompanying text helps to instil the verse in the memory. Like Bayly's object lesson, the merchandise's image is subservient to the text (text is always visually prominent), and serves to draw attention not to itself but to a higher, spiritual reality. In other words, the image is a trigger or pointer. The text defines the image's meaning and delimits its multivalence or propensity to be read in a variety of ways, not all of which might accord with sound doctrine. For this reason (and in keeping with the earliest examples of Protestant emblemature), seldom does an image appear independently of a biblical verse. A notable exception is the drawing of hands, clasped in prayer, by the German artist Albrecht Duiirer (1471-1528), who was converted under the influence of Martin Luther (1483-1546). In this example, the visual culture of popular religion meets the European high-art tradition. Diirer's dur- able emblem of earnest piety has been, since the second half of the twentieth century, transformed and reiterated, redrawn and painted, moulded and embossed on cards, plaques and mugs [6]. Usually the plaques are composed of an amalgamation of tech- niques and components, including a plastic relief- moulding of the hands, painted in either a tarnished or a polished bronze effect, affixed to a copper-etched surface, which is in turn glued to a wood or fibre- board support. The popularity of the image derives, in part, from its appeal to the Protestants' pictorial sensibility. This is not, after all, an illegitimate icon depicting God or holy persons, intended to mediate worship; rather, it symbolizes (contemporary Evan- gelicals rarely pray with their hands clasped together) an act of direct, biblically-sanctioned worship. The artefacts based upon this drawing, when placed in the home, serve as a visual reminder for individuals and Fig 6.

Where image and text are present together, the former functions as an illustration, a decorative embellishment or a backdrop. Some images are symbolic, derived directly and indirectly from bib- lical signs, similes and metaphors, while others have a looser connection, depicting picturesque scenes or the physical context of Christian worship. The lighthouse (an image popularly chosen for calendars) is an example of an indirect, biblical symbol. It is used as a metaphor either for Scripture (illustrating its propensity to enlighten) or of Christ as 'the light of the world'. The emblem, derived from nine- teenth-century British hymnology, adapts the Old Testament image of the lamp or candle to the circumstances of a seafaring nation. Pictures of the sea, coastline and harbour are the stock-in-trade of Evangelical text-pictures. They hang beside scenes of unidentified forests, fields, vales and glens, printed with an artificiality of colour one associates with 1950s and 1960s picture postcards. The pictures represent idyllic settings of enjoyment, tranquillity, fair weather and well-being-a slice of heaven on earth, as it were. The relation between picture and text is, here, casual: the picture is not an illustration but a mood setter, representing the natural world to evoke a sense of supernatural bliss and serenity, and to remind the viewer of the benefits of faith in, and obedience to, the text's sentiments. Images such as Fig 8. Calendar picture: 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ' (2001), 12 x 14cm these sometimes have an emblematic content too. Harbours, in the literary imagery of Protestant hymnology, are associated with the concepts of spiritual embarkation, arrival in heaven, and a safe haven from the storms of life [7].35 The rock in the foreground of this picture resonates in the Evan- gelical mindset with allusions to Christ, the rock of salvation (Psalm 28: 1).36 Likewise, fishing vessels connote those used by the disciples to fish (the metaphor for evangelism) and from which Christ preached. At first, the juxtaposition of the text 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ' and a picture of Alpine skiing seems wholly incongruous [8]. How- ever, in the Old Testament snow is a symbol of purity and cleansing from sin, which, in the New Testament, is a consequence of faith in Christ (Isaiah 1: 18; 1 John 1: 7). In the same vein, the picture of a hovercraft on the button badge is, perhaps, an ex- tremely oblique allusion to Christ walking on the water [9]. Thus for those with knowledge of the Bible who see with the eye of faith, otherwise neutral images are connotatively rich. Artefacts designed to appeal particularly to young children often sacrifice the pious seriousness of the adult variety [10]. The texts are simple, upbeat confessional statements, and gentle encouragements to praise, pray, seek, trust, do good and be converted, and are exemplified by brightly coloured illustrations of anthropomorphic, cute and chirpy animals and insects printed on stickers, bookmarks and badges. 187 Acrt 16. 31</page><page sequence="12">John Harvey h v .th ..... Fig 9. Badges (1981), 3.8 cm diameter They serve as gifts or rewards for good behaviour. In the course of time, such artefacts (especially those given as Sunday School prizes) become mementos which evoke memories of particular places, persons and events associated with childhood and early religious experience. This cosy and ebullient version of Christianity also appeals to adults who are unable to heed the apostle Paul's example and relinquish 'childish things'. The advertisement for holy teddy bears (beatification by 'Beanification'37) declares that: 'HolyBears teddy bears answer to a calling. Our teddy bears honour Christian themes, the Sacraments and life-cycle occa- sions. Ideal as gifts for children and adults alike, each bear comes with an inspirational quote from the Bible. There is a place for Christianity in today's world' [11].38 Quite how a text-bearing teddy bear provides evidence of that last assertion remains a Fig 10.

Horizons Distributors, advertisement for 'The Original HolyBears', Christian Bookseller (2000) moot point.39 In the secular realm, promotional and fund-raising teddy bears, inscribed with the names of companies and slogans, are common. The association of a teddy bear with Christianity is not an entirely arbitrary conjunction. According to medieval legend, bear cubs, which teddy bears closely resemble, were believed to be born shapeless, their form being given to them by their mother. This act became a symbol of Christianity in its capacity to reform and regenerate the heathen. Today, however, these bears project neither theology nor fable, but an uncomfortable amalgam of profundity and banality, and a soft- centred approach to evangelism and piety (literally so, in this case). The use of merchandise to give form and shape to gospel and godliness has led to a convergence of the ethos of Holy Land and Disneyland, a cheapening of religious feeling, together with a gratuitous espousal of themes, motifs, devices and, ostensibly, the ethics of advertising. As a result, the prophet's message is overlaid with a message about profit, and churches become places we now go to to shop for not only a particular brand of Christianity but also its branded goods. Evangelicals have engaged one of the central elements of contemporary culture-consumerism- while ignoring and despising every other element. Consequently, they reproduce the forms of culture uncritically (creating, to use Greenberg's expression, 'simulacra of genuine culture'40), while the signific- ance, value and usefulness of the merchandise reflect little understanding of, or interest in, concepts of aesthetic subtlety, material and design quality, medi- ation, uniqueness and ambition. British Evangelical merchandise is kitsch in a precise and exclusive sense. It is essentially conserva- tive-lacking the excess and eccentricity, the sense of the comic, camp and crude, and the flamboyance or pretension more usually associated with this category of objects. What Evangelical kitsch shares with the secular variety is its espousal of the cliched, trite and trivial; aesthetic mediocrity, and a devaluation of true feeling by association with processes of commodifica- tion, plasticity, imitativeness and affectation. Most Evangelicals would not consider the hard- ware of their religion as a species of kitsch. The heterogeneity of the movement (as of any other community) prevents the evolution of consensual criteria of judgement; class, gender, race, age, and social and intellectual identity all condition opinions as to what is kitsch.41 More importantly, as Stern- berg observes, the 'recognition of kitsch comes from the way things are looked at, from the way they affect you'.42 Evangelicals, for the most part, stand in need of a more highly developed visual literacy and familiarity with high-art forms (the acquired self- consciousness and cultivated standards regarding taste and tastelessness) with, and against, which to per- ceive what is trashy and tacky. Aesthetic principles and issues are rarely considered relevant in the cult(ure) of Evangelicalism. Consequently, Evange- licals regard religious artefacts (as things in them- selves) to be neither beautiful nor ugly, nor intended to illicit visual gratification, nor to embody aesthetic virtue for its own sake. Rather, these products are intended to serve God's glory and 'Man's' good. (This is deeply utilitarian merchandise.) The Evangelical's esteem of religious artefacts (thus con- ceived) is based upon the object's objective and the message's meaning. (The pleasure of the text is, again, paramount.) 189</page><page sequence="14">John Harvey The paraphernalia of Evangelicalism has turned the abstract and didactic word into a concrete sign. Whatever benefits there are in terms of establishing religious identity and stimulating piety, such artefacts as those hung on domestic walls sacramentalize the Word. It is as though the mere presence of the word (elevated like the host) imparts grace. Alternatively, they risk turning the Word into a talisman, with which to ward off evil and doubt. Paradoxically, the ubiquitous presence of the Word, on almost every conceivable object, undermines the very process of remembrance that it was intended to encourage. After all, what motivation is there to memorize that which is everywhere and constantly visible? Long before the commodification of Christianity, believers were consumers of the Word in a very different sense. They ingested Scripture by commit- ting verses to heart through diligent study, reciting it repeatedly, and by applying the texts not to objects but to their lives: the Christian, wrote the Puritan Thomas Watson (1620-86), 'copies out the Word in his daily walk'.43 Thus, one could conjecture that, just as the nature of Evangelical piety shapes the character of the visual artefacts, so too the nature of the artefacts shapes the character of Evangelical piety (and of evangelism, for that matter). In other words, the quality of the visual culture may serve as an index to the quality of the faith. Only now are speculations like these being aired, and cautiously. In this respect, contemporary scholarship lags behind much earlier attempts to theorize. Indeed, it was the first Protestants who identified the reciprocity of faith and its fabric: how inappropriate doctrine gives rise to false representations of God and holy persons, which in turn corrupt a proper view of religion. Some of them, and their successors, ad- dressed this observation with whitewash and ham- mers. Today a subtler and more intelligent response is required.

Of the many religious examples published in the seventeenth century, Fran- cis Quarles's Emblemes (1635) was the most popular. The eighteenth-century hymnist Augustus Toplady led Calvinistic Methodist ministers in sponsoring the reissue of Quarles's work in 1778 under the title Emblems, Divine and Moral. He com- mended the work for its evangelical tenor and potential 'to convey the most important lessons of instruction into youthful minds' (Francis Quarles, Emblems, Divine and Moral, John Bennett, 1834, p. iii). 5 See Colleen McDannell, Material Christianity: Religion and Popular Culture in America, Yale University Press, 1995; David Morgan, Protestants and Pictures: Religion, Visual Culture, and the Age of American Mass Production, Oxford University Press, 1999. 6 Oliver Barclay, Evangelicalism in Britain 1935-1995: A Personal Sketch, Inter-Varsity Press, 1997, pp. 79-113. 7 Derek J.

Low Churchmen attributed a 'low' or unimportant position to the claims of the episco- pate, priesthood and sacraments. In so doing, they distanced themselves from those members of the Church (High Church- men) who stressed its historical continuity with the Roman Catholic Church and the authority of Church and State. Ecclesiologically, the convictions of Low Churchmen accorded with those of Protestant Dissenters and Nonconfor- mists (such as the Baptists, Congregationalists, Methodists and Presbyterians). In the nineteenth century, 'Low Church' was applied to Evangelicalism. The term underlined the movement's commitment to the importance of the congrega- tion (the laity); to independency; to plain and unadorned contexts for religious meetings, and to simple, predominantly oral and textual forms of worship (in keeping with the practices of the New Testament Church), comprising preach- ing, reading, singing, praying and the celebration of the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's Supper, exclusively. This was in contrast to the significance that High Churchmen accorded the priest or vicar, the liturgy, architectural elabora- tions and accessories (including images), vestments, choirs and ceremonies. Today, the term Low Church also connotes concepts associated with popular piety. 10 See Tessa Watt, Cheap Print and Popular Piety 1550-1640, Cambridge University Press, 1991. 11 Shultze sees the same shift as having taken place in the United States, as the first stirrings of a movement towards the mass evangelism of the lower class: 'the rapid popularization of a media gospel began in the early nineteenth century.

Norton, 1683, p. 24. 22 The position of the plate on the high priest's forehead (literally between his eyes) is also significant. In the Judaeo-Christian tradition, the forehead, being open and fully visible, was the most obvious place for a mark or seal of designation (Ezekiel 9: 4; Revelation 13: 16). 23 The practice is expressed, in its present form among the Jews, through the custom of wearing phylacteries-two hollow cubes containing a parchment, worn on the head and hand. 24 However, by the late-Victorian period Nonconformist chapels no longer sported a reactionary style; instead, they deployed architectural forms, elaborations and furnishings that were, in many cases, little different from those found in established churches. In the late twentieth century, some Evangelicals from both Nonconformist and Anglican traditions desired to remove Christ from (what they considered) the pompous, antiquated and intimidating ecclesiastical surroundings. They formed the so-called house church movement, which advo- cates that believers meet in homes (rather than in ecclesiastical buildings), following the pattern in the New Testament, and espouses new modes of presenting the gospel which are relevant to the person in the street (William R. Davies, Rocking the Boat: The Challenge of the House Church, Marshall Pickering, 1986, pp. 140-51; Harvey, Image of the Invisible, pp. 6-25). 25 Peter Lloyd Jones, Taste Today: The Role of Appreciation in Consumerism and Design, Pergamon Press, 1991, p. 66. 26 McDannell, Material Christianity, p. 34. 27 Victorian text-ware incorporated consolatory verses too.

In the early 1990s, Beanie Babies (the first in a series of limited-edition themed, plush toys) developed into a collectable, much sought after by young and old alike. 38 The bears are made and distributed internationally by a com- pany based in the United States via bookshops and by e- commerce (Horizons Distributors, 'The Original HolyBears' [advertisement], Christian Bookseller, no. 8, 2000 [back cover]). 39 Another American company called Legends of the Faith dis- tributes 'toys that teach', including teddy bears. Sales figures for 2001 indicate that '700,000 Biblical character bears' had been sold. (They produce a range of 46 bears, covering Old and New Testament characters.) Their modest expectation is to reach 5% of the Evangelical community in the United States, represent- ing some 4 million people.
