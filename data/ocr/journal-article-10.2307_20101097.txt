<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jewish History Vol. 5, No. 1 Spring 1991 History of Halakhah - Methodological Issues: A Review Essay of I. Twersky's Rabad of Posqui?res Haym Soloveitchik To Marvin Fox on his retirement In 1962 a work appeared by Isadore Twersky on the controversial figure of Rabad of Posqui?res. The biography was massively documented and knowledgeably written, and its formulations were so judicious and so carefully calibrated that it became a benchmark in Provencal Jewish studies. Though widely praised, the biography was scarcely reviewed. Such was the fate in those years of works in such marginal areas as the history of halakhah. Some thirty years have since elapsed, and with them has come a growing recognition that Jewish intellectual history without halakhah is partial history only. A revised edition of Twersky's study has appeared in recent years, including a new introduction, supplementary bibliography, and extensive addenda by the author.1 Its paperback form has now enabled it to reach the wider audience it deserves. This reissue is timely, for it provides us with an opportunity to critically assess this intellectual biography for the first time, to ask how accurately it delineates Rabad9 s works and influence. It enables us to address what has become a standard work and examine the extent to which it has realized its own goals.2 Indeed, addressing a standard work is especially timely now. The past two decades have witnessed an efflorescence in the history of halakhah and in the study of halakhic literature. Before these developments harden into accepted forms, it may be wise to pause and take measure, to stop and ask how one goes about this enterprise. Does halakhic history or biography have unbreakable canons of research, evidence, and argument? If so, what are they? Moreover, are they unique to the halakhic genre or the same as those that apply to all forms of intellectual history?</page><page sequence="2">76 Haym Soloveitchik To evaluate any approach one should take its finest representative, and Twersky's revised and updated Rabad of Posqui?res is the natural candidate. Our undertaking assumes the form of a detailed review, and in every sense is one. At the same time it is an essay in methodological ground rules. Critical guidelines are desirable in all fields, but nowhere more so than in new ones - and the history of halakhah is, as we shall see, a very new field. Even in established disciplines, in-depth reviews can have a revelatory and salutary function. Never more so than when review engenders dialogue, as we have recently been given vivid reminder. Natalie Davis's well-known study The Return of Martin Guerre was subject to vigorous, extended scrutiny in the pages of the American Historical Review, and the historical craft was made vibrantly aware of the considerable disparity between the account of the affair in the historical record and that presented by this distinguished historian. Professor Davis took this inquiry into the relationship between her narrative and its documentation as an opportunity to discuss the problem of historical evidence that confronted her in the legal record and to set forth the methodological principles that underlay her reconstruction. She then detailed why, on certain occasions, she felt that the testimonies and depositions accurately mirrored reality, and how, in other instances, the cumulative evidence led her to conclude that the written record was only a part of a complex reality, and a refracted one at that.3 Seldom have the problems and processes of historiography been set forth with such clarity. Critical audit led to response and exposition, and the discipline is more rigorous and richer for the process. The history of halakhah deserves no less. The goals of Twersky's benchmark study are explicitly defined and programmatically stated by the author at the very outset. On the second page of the book, in clear and simple language, Twersky informs us that he has set out "to reconstruct his [Rabad's] biography as precisely as possible, to chronicle his role in the intellectual history of the Jews in southern France during the twelfth century, and to chart his influence on subsequent generations." This entails, of course, reassessing "the stereotyped image of Rabad" in Jewish historiography. While Twersky notes that the emerging European kabbalah and the first contacts of Provencal culture with philosophical thought will be treated, he wisely and correctly sees that the task of the halakhic biographer is to emphasize that which most needs and deserves emphasis. He concludes his programmatic opening with a forceful declaration of intent: "The major emphasis, however, must remain on Rabad's contribution to halakhic literature and methodology, for though he was conversant with cognate areas of nonhalakhic learning, he was first and foremost a Talmudist." Well-stated goals and important ones - and they deserve our fullest attention. Assessments can be made only after scrutiny. In stating this simple fact, we immediately encounter our first methodological problem. What parts of any scholarly work may justly be scrutinized? When confronted with a work with a</page><page sequence="3">History of Halakhah - Methodological Issues 77 wealth of references, one can be overwhelmed by the profusion and proclaim it a work of scholarship. Just as easily, one can pick out some two dozen inevitable errors, scattered throughout the book, gather them under the roof of an essay, and make them the subject of a carping review. The first will not do, obviously, for judgment can be rendered only after critical audit; but to avoid the second, criteria of scrutiny must be clearly set down, and at the very outset. First, one must distinguish between central and peripheral passages. The sections evaluated must be axial. Second, if references in footnotes need to be checked, as often they do, these footnotes cannot be stray ones, only those of a coherent block. They must constitute both a sustained and successive series, and, moreover, a series intentionally sustained by the author himself to provide the documentation for a central argument of the book. Finally, they must be of the type that demonstrates the author's conception of the discipline or the degree of his command of the field. To evaluate anything less is to trifle or quibble. Disjointed notes may be addressed in one instance only; namely, if points vital to the thesis or its undergirding are consigned to sundry notes. Then, it may be proper to question whether such a cursory treatment is appropriate and whether a larger problem may not underlie such a relegation. Only by abiding by these guidelines, thus focusing on the essential and examining only the axial, can impressionism be avoided, and the scholarship expended in a work be given the attention it genuinely deserves. To violate these canons is to slide from productive analysis and methodologically controlled evaluation to triviality or nitpicking. *** Twersky devotes some fifty pages to a study of Rabad's life and personality. A good deal of the biographical spadework was already done by Alexander Marx, whom Twersky generously acknowledges; and in locating Rabad in the emerging school of Provence, Twersky openly follows in B. Z. Benedict's footsteps. Twersky, however, integrated the works of these scholars and others with numerous insights of his own, and the results were so rich and full that for the first time a full-fledged, finely nuanced biography of a major halakhic thinker saw the light of day. Twersky's recreation of the circumstances surrounding the composition of the Hilkhot Lulav is a superb example of his ability to construct a persuasive picture from the most fragmentary material.4 Recent research, especially that of I. Ta-Shema, has challenged some of the chronology and some of the assumptions of Benedict's analysis.5 The issue is still moot. But whether the judgment of subsequent historiography is in favor of Ta-Shema or of Benedict, Twersky's delineation of Rabad will remain the basic portrayal to which all will have recourse. The first goal of his study unquestionably has been achieved.</page><page sequence="4">78 Haym Soloveitchik The only caveat that I would offer about this definitive presentation is the striking absence of any discussion of the violent controversy between Rabad and Razan, which is found in the Divrei ha-Rivot. The Divrei ha-Rivot is the most vituperous and revelatory halakhic correspondence to survive the Middle Ages. One may discuss it in the context of Rabad's life or in the context of his work, but discuss it one must. Alexander Marx, in his basic article on Rabad, to which Twersky often refers, drew attention to many of the salient, puzzling features of the controversy, and Ta-Shema has recently made it the point of departure of an important study.6 For some strange reason, Twersky never discusses this exchange,7 never really draws upon it, not even to quote the magnificent characterization by Razah of his stormy contemporary, to which all else is commentary: "The wiseman [sage] whose wisdom boils him [keeps him at a boil] and whose insight unrests him [gives him no rest]."8 It is the life of Rabad's mind, however, that holds our attention and constitutes the methodological challenge. Any intellectual biography should be examined from at least three perspectives: bibliographical foundations; historical context; and, most determinately, command of the intellectual discipline under discussion - in our case, halakhic technique. Let us address each of these points in turn. A. Bibliographical Foundations Medieval works, in particular, confront the historian with bibliographical questions. One must know and inform the reader whether one or several recensions of the work were written. If several, the author most disclose to the reader whether they have survived - for an analysis of changes of position of the author may be halakhically significant and biographically revealing. Moreover, does the printed text accurately reflect the manuscript? In other words, is one studying the author's own words or some printer's abridgement? Finally, it is important that the date and place of the first edition and those of subsequent ones be provided, since dissemination is a sine qua non for influence. One cannot be influenced by a book one has never seen. A discussion of individual works usually begins with a bibliographical survey. Twersky chose not to do this. His bibliographical observations are strewn throughout the book - sometimes in the middle of a section, sometimes at the end; at times in the text itself, at times in a footnote only. Location, of course, is a matter of choice, and every author is free to orchestrate his presentation as he sees fit. Nevertheless, the fragmented and highly variegated nature of the presentation suggests that a closer look at the bibliographical underpinnings of Twersky's study may be in order. Let us take five works of Rabad for a sample analysis: Hilkhot Lulav, the Commentary on the Mishnaic Tractate ofQinnim; the highly influential Ba falei ha-Nefesh; his biting critique of Razah, the Katuv Sham; and, of course, the famous Hassagot [Strictures] on Maimonides' Mishneh Torah.</page><page sequence="5">History of Halakhah - Methodological Issues 79 l.Hilkhot Lulav Twersky writes: Rabad's lost code entitled Hilkot Lulab, concerning which there is precise testimony of ha-Meiri ... On the basis of ha-MeirVs stenographic account and extensive discussion, the nature of Rabad's Hilkot Lulab can be reconstructed [emphasis mine].9 Indeed, Rabad's Hilkhot Lulav is not to be found in the third edition of the Temim De'im (Warsaw, 1897), which Twersky used.10 It is, however, found - introduction and all, in both of the two previous editions - in the Tummat Yesharim (Venice, 1622) and that of Lemberg of 1812. This is not to say that Twersky did not use the editio princeps. In his discussion of the precise meaning of ruah ha-qodesh in Rabad's writing (especially in his famous Maimonidean gloss at Lulav, VIII, 510 Twersky writes:12 ... see also TD, 227 (Hassagot on Alfasi) which I take to be the stylistic counterpart of "ruah ha-kodesh": As I have perceived unexplained matters in the laws of lulav which were not elucidated by the Talmud, nor by R. Isaac [Alfasi] in his Halakhot. ... And I with Heaven's mercy clarified those matters from the Tosefta and the Yerushalmi and partially from the [Babylonian] Talmud, and principally by clear and true intellect... and most principally [from] God ... who teaches man wisdom.13 Strangely enough, Twersky was unaware that he was transcribing sections of the introduction to Hilkhot Lulav. Even more puzzling is the fact that in scrutinizing the eight and a half folio columns that follow in the Temim De'im (to see, I would assume, whether Rabad, here too, invoked ruah ha-qodesh as regards hadasim qetumin, as he did in the well-known gloss under discussion), Twersky did not realize that he was rereading what he had termed "ha-Meiri's stenographic account" of Rabad's code.14 Is this remarkable instance of incognizance simply a scholarly lapse, or does it possibly betoken something larger? 2. Qinnim The Commentary on Qinnim was one of Rabad's most original works and won the awed approval of his father-in-law, R. Abraham of Narbonne. This commentary is not found in the early editions of the Talmud. It first appeared in Constantinople in 1751, when it was bound with the enigmatic work currently known as Shittah L'o Nod'a Le-Mi'al Qiddushin. The editors of the standardly used Rom Talmud (Wilno, 1885) reprinted this text. Some twenty years later, the editors of the famed Rom Mishnayot drew upon a Jerusalem manuscript. That Twersky did not compare the printed text in the Rom Talmud with that of the Shittah L'o Nod'a Le-Mi is understandable; that he did not use the standard Rom Mishnayot of Qinnim is less comprehensible.15 Indeed, that he was able to make his way through the</page><page sequence="6">80 Haym Soloveitchik impenetrable thickets of Qinnim, possibly the most obscure and gnomic tractate in the Talmud, without recourse to the basic commentaries contained in that famous edition, is remarkable.16 The text of Rabad's commentary there differs widely from the text printed in the Talmud, and the comparative work was already done with their usual thoroughness by the editors of the Rom press, who prefaced the work thus: Printers' note: We have published the Commentaries of Rabad and Razah from a manuscript that was in the possession of the author of the Melekhet Shelomoh. The passages [in our text] which differ from the previously published edition or those which are not to be found [in the previous edition] at all we placed in square brackets, and [in juxtaposition] we placed the text of the previous edition in round brackets. The reader may [thus] choose [for himself] the proper text.17 Clearly, there are two major recensions of the work currently extant and available for examination, and the massive changes of position by Rabad revealed by a comparison of the two texts are both significant and revelatory. Indeed, a somewhat closer check of his own citations might have led Twersky to note the existence of another text of Rabad's commentary that differs radically from the one printed in the Rom Talmud. Twersky writes that the Qinnim commentary preceded that on the Sifra, for it is "quoted in the Sifra Commentary, 24b."18 At 24b Rabad brings one interpretation of a certain phrase (atzm 'a shel hattat) and then another, and writes of the second view: "There is much in this interpretation that needs scrutiny, and I have already written [on it] in another notebook [version] of the Qinnim Commentary."19 Rabad is obviously referring to the very first mishnah of Qinnim-, the second opinion is, not surprisingly, that of his already mentioned critic R. Zerahyah Ha-Levi of Lunel (Razah), in his counter commentary (ad loa). Our printed version, however, has no treatment of R. Zerahyah's views. Obviously, Rabad referred to a more comprehensive version than the printed one - one that, at least in part, took R. Zerahyah's strictures into consideration.20 No mention, however, is made in Rabad of Posqui?res of the existence of a second and revised version of the Qinnim commentary. Medieval halakhic literature contains several examples of an author's defense of his position in the face of criticism. But the phenomenon of massive, systematic changes of position by the writer himself as a result of contemporary strictures is virtually unique. When such rethinking is done by no less a figure than Rabad, the thought processes revealed in such a revision are of unparalleled significance. Revealing such a shift, however, requires examining all editions of the text. 3. Ba'alei ha-Nefesh The Ba'alei ha-Nefesh (on the laws of sexual abstinence during and immediately after the period of menstruation) is, in Twersky's words, "the most important of Rabad's codes and one of the choice flowers of medieval Jewish codification in</page><page sequence="7">History of Halakhah - Methodological Issues 81 general."21 Twersky treats it more extensively than any of Rabad's other works (other than his Hassagot [Strictures] on Mishneh Torah), but he does not include any bibliographic discussion, not even in a footnote. In his bibliography he lists the work thus: "Ba'ale ha-Nefesh (with the hassagot of Razah) New York (photostat of 1812 edition)."22 In fact, he used a photo-offset of the 1927 Piotrkow edition with a wholly different pagination. How Twersky arrived at the conclusion that this is a photo-offset of the (Warsaw) edition of 1812 is perplexing. The title page of the edition he employed reads "as was printed in 1812." Before the age of photo-offset, this commonly used phrase necessarily meant that the current edition draws its text from the 1812 edition, but, obviously, is not that edition itself. That Twersky mistook the seventh edition for the fourth is of no consequence. That he did not compare either with the first is unfortunately of considerable importance. The Piotrkow text differs considerably from that of the first edition published in Venice in 1602. Quantitatively, the additions are so massive in certain places as to constitute a different text. For example, the third chapter of the famous penultimate section, the Sha 'ar ha-Mayyim, is two and a half times as long in the later edition as in the first.23 Qualitatively, it contains numerous passages not found in the editio princeps, new interpretations that at times complement, at times conflict with, the text of the first edition. The question is: What are these additions and how did they get there? In 1741, R. Isaiah Bassano published for the first time Razah's Hassagot [Strictures] on the Ba 'alei ha-Nefesh. He further compared the Venice edition with a manuscript in his possession, noticing that his manuscript contained numerous passages not found in the first edition. R. Isaiah also noted that some citations of the Ba'alei ha-Nefesh in the Beit Yosef ?xffextd considerably from the printed text. He transcribed the variant passages and published them in 1741 as corrigenda and addenda to the Ba'alei ha-Nefesh, together with Razah's Hassagot on that work. In 1762, R. Abraham Mencke decided to publish (in Berlin) a single volume of both the Ba'alei ha-Nefesh and Razah's Hassagot on that work that had been printed by Bassano some twenty years earlier. He printed the text of the Ba 'alei ha-Nefesh according to the Bassano corrigenda and addenda. He inserted most of the additional passages of Bassano into the text of the Ba'alei ha-Nefesh, occasionally preceding them with a parenthetic abbreviation (k"3 = o.v., other versions) or following them with a brief note "until here the gloss." The Berlin text became, in effect, the basis of all subsequent editions, including that of Piotrkow 1927. However, since the notations "o.v." and "gloss" were not uniformly entered, passages both supplementary and dissonant entered the Berlin text unmarked and unbracketed. The Warsaw edition of 1812 incorporated all of Bassano's additions and improved upon the Berlin text in many small ways, but not by systematically noting the addenda of Bassano with such markings as "o.v.," "gloss," or the like. Thus, the Berlin conflation remained fully intact in this edition and in all subsequent ones.24</page><page sequence="8">82 Haym Soloveitchik None of this is recondite knowledge. The Berlin edition states explicitly that in addition to its innumerable errors, the 1602 edition also suffered from lacunae, or, as they quaintly put it, "it was missing a number of pieces (hatikhot [!])," and that they had set matters right by incorporating into the text the "haggahot" (corrections, glosses) to the Ba'alei ha-Nefesh that was published in Venice in 1741. Much of this information is repeated by Azulai in his Shem ha-Gedolim and by Benjacob in his 'Otzar ha-Seforim (both s.v. "Ba'alei ha-Nefesh"), and is reiterated in Michael's "Or Hayyim (s.v. "Abraham ben David").25 Indeed, intimations of this state of affairs are to be found in the Piotrkow edition itself, which Twersky used.26 Even without bibliographic spadework, any study of the topics actually discussed in the Ba'alei ha-Nefesh or of that work's general impact (to which Twersky devotes several pages) will swiftly reveal that both Nahmanides and ?deret cite passages not found in our text; that, conversely, they present doctrines of Rabad that are only possible if passages that are found in our texts did not exist in theirs.27 Indeed, a simple reading of the Ba'alei ha-Nefesh reveals textual anomalies. In one passage Rabad writes "as we will explain below," and yet no further explanation is forthcoming.28 In another passage he presents in his words "ten menstrual cycles," yet in the enumerated list on the same page the concluding entry reads "the eleventh cycle is ..."29 Again, in that same list the controversial "day of the week" cycle is strikingly missing. Indeed, Nahmanides reports that Rabad disallowed its validity. Yet, several pages back in all our printed texts (of both Venice and Berlin), Rabad presents an alternative explanation of the controlling Talmudic passage that confirms the validity of that cycle.30 Clearly, our printed text is a conflation of different recensions. "Recension" is perhaps a misnomer; "text in flux" or "text in transit" would be more appropriate. Rabad continued to revise the text of the Ba 'alei ha-Nefesh even after he had "published" it, that is to say, permitted others to copy it. He had not the time, quite possibly not the patience, after he had made a change, to "edit" the entire manuscript in order to fully align it with the most recent alteration. What we possess is not so much "recensions" as different "snapshots" of the text in various stages of its evolution. ?deret and Nahmanides had one such "stillshot," R. Josef Karo possessed another, R. Isaiah Bassano yet a third, the printers of the first edition a fourth, and, by the nature of things, one can assume that yet others await us in the manuscripts. Few medieval works at all, certainly no halakhic work of vaguely comparable influence, have been in the hands of so many scholars in so many varied forms. The restless and impatient creativity of Rabad, which Razah had already perceived as his hallmark and so trenchantly characterized,31 can nowhere be better observed than in the numerous extant texts of the Ba'alei ha-Nefesh. Unfortunately, not a word of all this is to be found in Rabad of Posqui?res. The bibliographic silence is total.</page><page sequence="9">History of Halakhah - Methodological Issues 83 4. Katuv Sham Twersky's final words about Katuv Sham, the one systematic work that issued from Rabad's pen, are: Those hassagot printed in the standard folio editions are extremely fragmentary and are hardly representative of the whole. They were selected rather capriciously by the author of a certain collectaneum (Tumat Yesharim) from an initially jumbled and incomplete manuscript. Not only were the contents reduced but the style was often mollified and its acerbity eliminated. This is clearly revealed by a comparison of the printed fragments with the two available manuscripts as well as quotations in later works.32 That "the standard folio editions" are incomplete has been known since 1937, when Hasida finished publishing a text of Katuv Sham three times the size of the "standard folio editions."33 No recourse need be had to manuscripts and testimonia to establish this. The question is: Is Hasida's text complete? Hasida's central and often-cited text is, surprisingly enough, never evaluated, not even described. And a description is in order. The standard folio editions of Alfasi have Rabad's biting notes on much of Mo'ed, but not on Nashim and Neziqin. Conversely, Hasida's text contains glosses on all three sedarim, but a comparison with those in the standard Alfasi on Mo'ed shows that his text lacks entire chapters in certain tractates.34 Clearly, neither the text in the standard Alfasi nor that of Hasida is complete. Katuv Sham on two tractates has been printed by B. Bergmann from a manuscript in the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (hereafter JTSA).35 Indeed, it contains entire tractates missing in Hasida's edition.36 Clearly the JTSA manuscript together with the one in the Bodleian (which alone contains Makkot) constitute the basis for any analysis of this work. No reference whatsoever is made in Rabad of Posqui?res to the JTSA manuscript, not to speak of its being used. This is surprising, in view of the fact that Alexander Marx made this manuscript the cornerstone of his famous article in Revue des ?tudes Juives?1 in which he described in detail both its wider scope and richness, and, more importantly, demonstrated its indispensability for any assessment of both the Katuv Sham and Rabad's relationship to Razah. The Bodleian manuscript is never cited, but Twersky does mention it, writing: The Bodleian Hebrew MS 2357, of which I have a microfilm, contains Rabad's hassagot on Razah for Gittin, Yebamot, Ketubot, Baba Kamma, Baba Mezia, Baba Batra, Sanh?drin, Makkot?* This, indeed, is the way Neubauer has registered it in his catalogue. A perusal of the manuscript, however, shows that it also contains hassagot on Qiddushin (fols. 9b-13b) and Shevu'ot (fols. 72b-79a).</page><page sequence="10">84 Haym Soloveitchik 5. Hassagot on Mishneh Torah Twersky views the glosses on the Y ad, the hassagot, as Rabad's crowning achievement, and makes the analysis of this work the centerpiece of his study. The poor state of the printed text of these hassagot is a commonplace. The Bomberg printers of the 1524 edition had bemoaned the absence of manuscripts, and any student of Maimonides knows only too well that the Maggid Mishnah often will refer to (but not cite) a hassagah found neither in the printed text nor in the Migdal 'Oz. Gross, in the very first study of Rabad, devoted a paragraph detailing the corrupt state of our text,39 and Twersky devotes a paragraph to enlarging upon the subject40 He opens his discussion by forcefully stating: "The printed text of the hassagot seems to be far removed from the original version which left the author's desk." It seems reasonable that such a vibrant awareness of the problem would mandate first determining the full and accurate text of the work that is to be the focus of sustained scrutiny, especially if that work consists of gnomic glosses in which every word counts. Doubly so, if one seeks to uncover, as Twersky does, Rabad's personal posture toward Maimonides. It is tone and tenor, especially when they are acerbic, that tend most readily to be lost in transcription, not because of "censorship," but rather because jurists usually have little interest in ad hominem remarks. One is not asking for a critical edition of the hassagot as a "praeparatio" for their analysis, desirable as this might be. For such a task entails treating all aspects of every note, irrespective of their relevance to the author's argument. This is the task of an editor, not a historian. However, using the most accurate text to analyze a passage that is deemed relevant, or, more basically, simply to determine which passages are indeed relevant would appear to be the task of any student of history. Otherwise he is scrutinizing the vagaries of scribes or printers. Nor is the task of determining the text a formidable one in the case at hand. The hassagot are a small work, running in manuscript form an average of 160 to 170 pages.41 Furthermore, deciphering it is easy, since 80 to 90 percent of the text is almost identical with the printed one. One need simply to read and compare. E. E. Urbach collated the text of three manuscripts with that of the printed one, and the sum total of his collations fills only twelve pages.42 Neither a large nor daunting task, but still a necessary one. It is one, however, that Twersky chose not to do, although five manuscripts of the hassagot are registered in the catalogues listed by S. Shunami in the 1936 edition of his Bibliography of Bibliographies.,43 Instead, Twersky drew upon the manuscript collection of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. In his bibliography he lists two manuscripts from that collection. The first, Adler 1179, is described both in the bibliography and the text as "containing hassagot on Hilkot Issure Bi'ah and Ma 'akalot Assurot."44 This is correct as far as it goes, but it would have been better to inform the reader that this is neither a full nor a complete</page><page sequence="11">History of Halakhah - Methodological Issues 85 manuscript, but consists rather of four Genizah fragments from the above halakhot. Twersky writes of the second manuscript (and this is his only comment in an otherwise straight-lined bibliography) that "a number of interesting variants are to be found there."45 Since the hassagot on these books are cited in the study hundreds of times, one would expect that these "interesting variants" would surface often and their significance be developed. All told, there are two references to them in the work. The first reference is to the famous gloss on the Introduction to the Yad, where Rabad criticizes Maimonides' policy of not citing his sources. Twersky, quite correctly, opens his central chapter, "Mishneh Torah Criticism," with a full translation of this "essential,... lengthy, partially programmatic" hassagah. Aware of the centrality of this gloss to Rabad's attitude toward codification, Twersky notes that he took care to "correct the printed version by the manuscript 38477."40 Twersky translates the phrase maqom ehad as "based on some other authority," i.e., aher. The emendation of dalet to reish, if correct, is useful, though it is somewhat difficult to see how maqom yields the translation "authority."47 Surprisingly, the rest of the citation has not been emended by the manuscript. For example, the very first line of the printed text reads Kbi ]pnb nao (onnax "iax =) x*x pn , and so Twersky translates: "He intended to improve, but did not improve." The manuscript, however, reads: "This author [zeh ha-mehaber] intended to improve," etc. It is difficult to imagine that the "chillingly neutral" opening "This author" (Twersky's apt phrase for this classic opening of Rabad48) is not authentic, especially in view of the rest of Rabad's remarks. Other than this emendation of nanan nr and, possibly, that of binera eh, neither of which are adopted by Twersky, it is difficult to know what could have been emended from the rather garbled JTSA text, which reads: ]pnb iao inmn m xwx ,DnHaT? mn wan an "o .vis1? rn npx ananan Va -pn ary xm *a jpn x*?i loitcn |""m 2b by r\bT man trays *a ,nb*m nVyin nm n&gt;m ,onax o^a onann lanai rbsm *uaa Vm tonara v 'a yr ftxi ,-inx mpaa www Tr\nb ix {Dpi1? vnom m bv man Vawa ?jwotot vriqpD yix x1? nnyi .ia -inn n&gt;n nnnx nyi1? ?nyiaw ,iai myn "asa Tiyn *??ax na1? uaa Vm ^3X ox ?&gt;? *aoa bra ^y pbinn ax nanan.49 The second reference to a hassagah variant is to the absence of the "than him" (mimmennu) in the well-known gloss on anthropomorphism.50 This was already noted with understandably great satisfaction by M. M. Kasher. Given the medieval outcry at the personal affront to Maimonides implied by "many greater and better than him," the manuscript reading appears to be an emendation.51 It provides no insight into Rabad's opinion, but is merely an interesting (if late) footnote to the history of the growth of the Maimonidean image. On two other occasions Twersky refers anonymously to "the manuscript." The first, touching upon a standard variant in manuscripts, must refer to Adler 1179, as the reading in MS 38477 is identical with the printed text.52 The second probably refers to both manuscripts, although without independently checking them it would be impossible to know this from Twersky's formulation.53</page><page sequence="12">86 Haym Soloveitchik This task is not made easier by Twersky's habit of citing manuscripts without ever providing folio numbers. Citing a book without providing a page number makes its use or corroboration a major burden. Doing this with manuscripts makes it doubly so. Whether the manuscripts of the Jewish Theological Seminary actually have been used is, perhaps, an open question. That they have not been used effectively is certain. Unfortunately, it appears equally certain that the object of scrutiny throughout Rabad of Posqui?res is the "printed version of the hassagot," which, as Twersky himself forcefully notes, "seems to be far removed from the original version which left the author's desk."54 6. First Editions Regarding the dates of first editions and reprintings, no information is to be found. This is not simply a bibliographical lacuna; it is also a historiographical one. An idea cannot have impact if it has not achieved dissemination. An unprinted book is usually uninfluential. Twersky, for example, writes: The early printer's whims or calculations are responsible for the fragmentary character of all the printed hassagot on Alfasi or Razah [emphasis mine]. To the best of my knowledge, the first edition of Alfasi containing Rabad's glosses on Sefer ha-Alfas is that of Vienna 1805,55 and the first Alfasi edition containing Rabad's Katuv Sham on Razah is that of Pressburg 1836. Both these glosses achieved wide currency only when the editors of the great Rom Talmud published both these hassagot and those on R. Isaac of Fez, from the Tummat Yesharim, between 1881 and 1886. Thereafter, these hassagot became an integral part of the standard rabbinic library. What this means is that except for a few individuals (for example, R. David Sintzheim, who possessed a rare copy of a volume printed in Venice in 1622, the Tummat Yesharim), the doctrines contained in Rabad's hassagot on Razah were unknown until the beginning of the nineteenth century. Nor did the Lemberg edition of the Temim De'im (1812) change the situation much, as the most cursory acquaintance with the novellae or responsa of that century - whether of Lithuanian, Polish, Hungarian, or even Galician provenance - indicate.56 For printing alone does not suffice. Format must also be considered. Rabad's biting glosses on Razah's Sefer ha-Ma 'or on Alfasi were printed at the end of the Temim De'im, and one has to match them with the appropriate passages in the Sefer ha-Ma 'or. A few of those scholars who had acquired a copy of the Lemberg edition did this systematically; most did not. Only when Rabad's hassagot were printed in the Alfasi itself in the latter half of the nineteenth century did they become common coin of the rabbinic realm.57 It is not surprising, therefore, that numerous opinions expressed in those hassagot to which Twersky attributes widespread influence had no repercussions</page><page sequence="13">History of Halakhah - Methodological Issues 87 whatsoever. Not by accident were Rabad's trenchant remarks, for example, about the complex legal doctrine of multiple doubt (sefeq-sefeqa) in Katuv Sham without impact on the great literature on this subject.58 The merits of the Rom Talmud have made it deservedly ubiquitous; one almost naturally envisions the Talmud in this format. It is precisely for this reason, however, that one must guard against assuming that this edition has been in the hands of rabbinic scholars for many centuries. This observation about the consequences of the whims of "early printers" is found in a stray footnote, as are a number of Twersky's other bibliographical descriptions.59 They are a vivid example of what we noted at the outset; namely, that the mode and pattern of treatment - concentrated or fragmented, visibly and systematically located in the text or relegated unevenly to passing footnotes - often betokens something larger. They provide a measure of the author's awareness of the importance of the issue under discussion. In the case at hand it is the significance of bibliographical foundations, which in Rabad of Posqui?res are not what they should be. Later, rather than first, editions have been primarily used; well-known, indispensable, and easily available manuscripts have been ignored; and thus the object of scrutiny has as often as not been the mangled product of scribal or editorial whim, rather than Rabad's own words. The book further betokens an unawareness of just what a "first edition" is. From an antiquarian point of view, a first edition is the first printing of a book; but from a scholar's viewpoint a "first edition" is no more than a text printed directly from a manuscript. In the diaspora society of the Jews, nothing was more common than printing a work in Constantinople from one manuscript, in Livorno from a second, and in Amsterdam from yet a third. Needless to say, these manuscripts and the resulting printed editions could differ considerably. None of this, moreover, is esoteric. Publishers were not in the least bit bashful about announcing that their editions were printed directly from a manuscript. When such indications are given, the various texts naturally must be checked. A survey of previous editions followed by their collation is thus a sine qua non for halakhic history. There are, for example, three separate and textually different "first editions" of Teshuvot ha-Rosh, as well as a similar number of "first editions" of Rabad's hassagot on Alfasi.60 There are also, as we have already seen, three "first editions" of the Katuv Sham - Tummat Yesharim (1622), and those of Hasida (1934-37) and Bergmann (1957) - each published from a different manuscript and each with a different text. At times the differences are minor, at times major but complementary (as with the hassagot on Alfasi and the Katuv Sham), and at other times major and revelatory (as with Rabad's Commentary on Qinnim). There, Rabad's thought process can be observed, since the second and widely differing version of Qinnim reveals that figure of genius rethinking and reworking his commentary in response to contemporary strictures. Unfortunately, nowhere in Twersky's study do we find a systematic survey and collation of the several editions of any of Rabad's works.</page><page sequence="14">88 Haym Soloveitchik Indeed, no medieval work cited is provided with a bibliographical foundation. The treatment of the largest and most important Provencal halakhic composition of the twelfth century, Sefer ha- 'Ittur, is, as we shall later see, simply a vivid example of this incognizance, and of its far-reaching implication.61 Equally unnoticed has been the importance of both the places and the dates of publication and reprinting, which is so essential for establishing influence and so informative of diffusion and impact. Unasked throughout the study is the simple question: How frequently was a work reprinted? This pervasive lack of awareness is epitomized and encapsulated even in the bibliographical entries. The Temim De'im, for example, contains not only Rabad's responsa, but, as we have seen, also his Hilkhot Lulav, the hassagot on the Sefer ha-Ma 'or as found in the Rom Alfasi, and the bulk of the hassagot on Alfasi. This work is registered in the bibliography thus: "Temim De'im, Warsaw, 1897 (and many [sic] previous editions)."62 Had there been "many previous editions," Rabad's profound writings in the Temim De'im would have achieved the early influence they deserved. Unfortunately, there were, as we have seen, not many editions but only a few (indeed, only two), and they were very far between - Venice in 1622 and Lemberg in 1812. Unaware of this, Twersky ascribes influence to Rabad's now famous critiques of Sefer ha-Ma 'or and Alfasi on centuries that could scarcely have known of them. Last, but not least, the knowing, but in reality problematic, references to manuscripts often provide the reader with a sense of textual security to which he is not fully entitled. Intellectual biographers may address matters of the mind in any way they so choose, but cannot avoid first answering three basic questions: What did the author actually write, what is still available for analysis, and when did it become readily available so as to become influential? B. Historical Context Twersky's second goal as stated in his opening (p. 2) is, correctly enough, "to chronicle his [Rabad's] role as precisely as possible in the intellectual history of the Jews of southern France during the twelfth century and to chart his influence on subsequent generations." What does the achievement of such a goal entail? Accomplishment is the difference between what one finds and what one leaves. An intellectual biography must delineate the state of affairs at the time when the subject appeared on the scene, describe and document his contribution, and demonstrate his influence. Thus, no biography of a medieval Talmudist can be without frequent reference to the halakhic literature of the Middle Ages. Twersky's book is indeed massively documented, and there is scarcely a medieval halakhic work that is not used. Yet one is repeatedly struck by the almost total absence of the novellae of Nahmanides and his school. This is startling, for it is</page><page sequence="15">History of Halakhah - Methodological Issues 89 generally agreed that these works were for centuries one of the major, if not the major, conduits of Rabad's influence. A more general question then poses itself about Rabad of Posqui?res (or any similar work): Just how frequently are the major halakhic works of the Middle Ages actually cited in its copious notes and what does this degree of frequency indicate? A simple tabulation yields the following results: The Hiddushei ha-Ramban are cited nine times; those of Rashba, once; the Hiddushei ha-Ritba, twice; those of R. Nissim, not at all. The great clearing house of rishonic thought, the massive, multi-volume Shittah Mekubbetzet, to which talmudists and historians have constant recourse, is referred to at most four times. The responsa literature fares no differently. There are but two references to one of the seven volumes of the responsa of ?deret. The other six volumes are never cited. There are only four references to any of the five folio volumes of responsa of the Duran dynasty, which dominated the halakhic landscape for over a century.63 As for literature of twelfth-century Provence: The Sefer ha- 'Iitim is never cited, the text of the 'Eshkol is cited twice, and the 'Ittur five times. Thirteenth-century Provence fares better, with dozens of references to the 'Orhot Hayyim and forty-seven to Meiri. Upon closer look, however, even these figures prove misleading. No less significant a question than what sources are being cited is the concomitant one: What is being cited from them? The first query addresses the intellectual milieu within which the study operates, the second the very nature and substance of the study itself. Of this we shall have more to say later on. For the moment, an investigation of what is cited from Meiri, for example, shows that of the forty-seven citations, thirty-eight are of a literary or historical character, two of a general nature, and only seven refer to specific halakhic doctrines. Three of the six citations from the 'Ittur are for biographical purposes, and the same percentages hold true for the works of the Gerona school.64 What this means is that as richly set as Rabad is literarily, intellectually it exists in a halakhic vacuum. Without drawing upon the works of Rabad'? predecessors or those of his contemporaries, Twersky has no way of knowing whether a view expressed by Rabad is original; and without employing the writings of his successors, he is at a loss to determine whether it is influential. The 'Eshkol and the 'Ittur are simple cases at hand. Twersky writes: His (i.e., R. Abraham of Narbonne's) codificatory work called ha-"Eshkol was the subject of a heated scholarly controversy during the latter half of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century when it was printed for the first time (in two separate versions) [emphasis mine].65 No further reference is made to these two versions of the work of Rabad's father-in-law and teacher - a work with which we have every reason to suppose Rabad was familiar. The impression is that the differences between the two versions are minor and thus merit, at best, parenthetic mention.</page><page sequence="16">90 Haym Soloveitchik The differences, in fact, between the two texts are enormous, and any assessment of Rabad's place in history hinges quite literally upon their evaluation. This becomes apparent as soon as one moves from studying Rabad's life to studying his works. In his extensive discussion of Ba 'alei ha-Nefesh, Twersky emphasizes that this was a pioneering work: Moreover, Rabad had few precedents to guide him. A sampling of earlier collections of this material - four discourses in the She 'eltot, a terse, discursive section of the Halakot Gedolot, a few pages of the Eshkol - reveals at a glance the great advance made by the Ba'ale ha-Nefesh.66 Footnote 41, which documents this observation about the 'Eshkol, reads: Ha-'Eshkol, ed. Albeck, I, 3-7. Auerbach's edition has much more (I, 70-158), but still discursively arranged [emphasis mine]. We are dealing with a difference between 4 and 88 pages! Twersky minimizes the significance of the difference by stating that Auerbach's version "is discursively arranged." This is hardly the case,67 but this is not the essential point. The Tosafot and our much fragmented Mordecai are certainly discursive, yet no one would deny these works a massive influence on halakhah. The author devotes some very fine pages to showing that the doctrines of Rabad were incorporated, often anonymously, in later writings and that they shaped the contours of Hilkhot Niddah and Miqva 'ot.6% A reading of the massive sections of Auerbach's 'Eshkol reveals that many of Rabad's doctrines are already found there. How, then, can we know that it was Rabad's work that shaped halakhah and not that of his father-in-law, either independently or through the very agency of his son-in-law's work, the Ba'alei ha-Nefesh? Even if Rabad is cited by name, how often have the acronyms RA ABD (the Hebrew acronym of Rabad's father-in-law) and RABD (Rabad's own Hebrew acronym) been interchanged in halakhic writings? Few statements of Rabad's influence can go very far unless one addresses oneself to the question of the authenticity of Auerbach's "Eshkol. As with predecessors, so with contemporaries. The 'Ittur is the great storehouse of Provencal halakhic thought of the twelfth century, and without paying careful attention to it any reading of the period is difficult, if not impossible. Yet there is scarcely a single halakhic reference to the work in Twersky's study. Three of the six citations are for historical purposes, the fourth is drawn, as Twersky candidly informs us, from an article by Benedict, and the fifth and sixth references are to the Tur and Maggid Mishneh, who cite a doctrine of the 'Ittur but lack any references to the location of the doctrine in the 'Ittur itself.69 So oblivious is the author to the 'Ittur that, when studying a view that he believes was widespread in Provence and discovering in two sources that Rabbenu Tarn sent a responsum on the matter to "the sages of Marseille,"70 to which Rabad may have reacted, it does not occur to him to seek that responsum and its discussion in</page><page sequence="17">History of Halakhah - Methodological Issues 91 the works of Rabad's famous contemporary, R. Isaac of Marseille, Ba 'al ha- 'Ittur, where, in fact, it is readily found. All references to the 'Ittur are to the Lemberg edition of 1860. One can readily understand why someone using the Lemberg edition would be deeply frustrated by it. What is less comprehensible is why anyone would use the Lemberg edition to begin with. The editio princeps of much of the 'Ittur is that of Venice 1608; the best is, of course, the great three-volume edition of R. Meir Jonah (Wilno-Warsaw, 1874-85), which first "decoded" the 'Ittur and has been readily available since 1955 in a photo-offset edition.71 Without use of the multi-volume 'Ittur, Twersky's dating of Rabad's works is weakened, and he is led into error in assessing Rabad's originality and tracing the course of his thought. For example, he contends that the Katuv Sham contains glosses written after those on the Mishneh Torah:12 Another illustration contains no implicit cross reference from one set of hassagot to the other, but the logical progression of Rabad's thought supports our assumption. The critical annotation of Razah, which presents a new theory concerning a staple halakhic problem, must have been written after a parallel hassagah on the Mishneh Torah which repeats the regnant theory [emphasis mine]. Footnote 31, which documents the above assertion, reads: ... This view is maintained by the Tosafot, by Razah, and, as the Maggid Mishnah points out, is the view of Rashi and the Geonim. Now, in the hassagot on the Mishneh Torah, Rabad reproduces this view, which was the rampant, practically consensual scholastic tradition. But, in the hassagot on Razah, who also expressed this view, Rabad broaches an entirely new theory ... Now, if the hassagah on the Mishneh Torah followed the parallel note on the Sefer ha-Ma 'or and was the last time Rabad dealt with this question, he would certainly have incorporated in it his new theory, which was not only original but obviated many more questions than the conventional scholastic theory. The critical annotation on Razah which presents Rabad's new theory must have been written last and was the only occasion he had to formulate it. Again, the sequence of the hassagot seems clear [emphasis mine]. A glance at the 'Ittur would have informed Twersky that it is the annotation to Razah that represents "the rampant, practically consensual scholastic tradition" (ve-khen pirshu kol ha-mefarshim), whereas the view set forth in the Mishneh Torah gloss, identical with Razah's opinion, was a twelfth-century innovation (ve-yesh mi-hakhmei zemaneinu).13 Thus, the "logical progression of Rabad's thought" is exactly the reverse of what Twersky suggested, and "the sequence of the hassagot" is anything but clear. Time and again, as we shall presently see, doctrines attributed to Rabad's originality prove upon inspection of the 'Ittur to be common Provencal coin. Conversely, Twerksy's lengthy attempt - partially convincing, partially tenuous - to prove a common Provencal tradition74 could have been easily disposed of by a</page><page sequence="18">92 Haym Soloveitchik single footnote showing a dozen or two correlations between the doctrines of R. Isaac of Marseille, Ba 'al ha- 'Ittur, and Rabad. Rabad's influence is, of course, central to any assessment of his place in history, and Twersky addresses the issue in three ways. First, with a lengthy, scholarly list of chroniclers, talmudists, and modern historians who explicitly praise or cite Rabad; second, with a discussion of Rabad's link with what he calls the "critico-comparative" school of Talmudic studies;75 and, finally, with actual attempts to trace Rabad's influence on subsequent halakhic doctrines. Twersky's reading is wide and his lists quite long (pp. 51-56). The problem with lists is that they take a great deal of time to read and do not separate the important from the trivial. To cite Meiri (as a halakhic chronicler) alongside R. Abraham of Torrutiel, Rashba and R. Nissim (qua talmudists) alongside David ben Judah Messer Leon, and Zunz and Steinschneider alongside Bernard Bergmann does the reader no service. Furthermore, while I yield to few in my admiration for Zunz and Steinschneider, I do not believe anyone considers them appropriate judges of halakhic stature, and the same holds true for many, if not most, of the names on these lists. Drawing up such lengthy registers is a practice borrowed from introductions to critical editions, but it has little place in intellectual history. How many people would assess Descartes' or Hume's place in the history of philosophy on the basis of statements of praise or overt citation by later thinkers? Twersky then identifies Rabad with the "critico-comparative" movement and links him with the dialectical school of the Tosafists.76 To my thinking, this is problematic at best. Rabad did compare and attempt to resolve contradictions, especially in his commentary on Sifra. Any study of his oeuvre in its entirety will reveal, however, a brilliant commentarial mind, possessed of a vibrant awareness of parallel texts, but focused primarily on explicating the specific passage at hand. Rabad's oeuvre has little in common with the relentless page-by-page, line-by-line correlation of the Tosafists, with their systematic attempts at resolution by distinction, all of which constitutes the core of what Wolfson called the "critico-comparative" method. C. Halakhic Technique Twersky's third and major goal in his work is, as he states at the outset (p. 2), "to chart his [Rabad's] influence upon subsequent generations," and "the major emphasis" in the study, as he forcefully concludes, "must remain on Rabad's contribution to halakhic literature and methodology, for, though he was conversant with cognate areas of non-halakhic learning, he was first and foremost a Talmudist" Just as any study of Kant's contribution to philosophy requires a solid grasp of philosophy and its mode of reasoning, so there can be no biography of a major</page><page sequence="19">History of Halakhah - Methodological Issues 93 halakhic figure without a clear grasp of halakhic concepts and a firm control of halakhic technique. With this in mind, let us turn to Twersky's arguments for Rabad's enduring influence. Twersky, in the passage discussed above, is well aware that neither a tenuous link with the Tosafist method nor the stringing together of names of people both famous and little known who speak in praise of Rabad constitutes a serious claim to intellectual influence. Influence for a talmudist means the shaping of halakhic thought. Thus, Twersky immediately follows his string citation of those who praised Rabad with a three-page, massively documented passage, in which he presents more than a dozen classic doctrines of Rabad that achieved wide diffusion and had a major impact on halakhic thought.77 Since these doctrines putatively illustrate Rabad's just claim to fame, what we have is an axial argument. Offered as evidence is a sustained series of notes, a series, moreover, intentionally sustained by the author to prove this central argument for Rabad's pivotal impact. Meeting, as this passage does, the strict criteria of scrutiny set down at the outset of this essay, it is only proper that any study of Twersky's control of halakhic technique address itself to this central passage in Rabad. Indeed, given that this discussion is the most extensive attempt at halakhic analysis in the entire book, fairness alone dictates that any examination of halakhic technique begin with it. Only later should passages of lesser length and import be scrutinized to judge whether or not the results of the above analysis are indeed characteristic. Twersky writes: Rabad's influence in this respect is not only general - in the sense that the method reached advanced stages in his hands - but also particular: many of his theories and insights were endorsed and transmitted by subsequent generations of Talmudists. Many doctrines and concepts were incorporated root and branch into standard works of Jewish law; a preponderant amount in the realm of ritual, a considerable number in civil and criminal law, and an even number in the vast juridical expanses covered by the Shulhan 'Aruk as a whole. Persuasively, with analytic verve and skill, Rabad propounded new theories which were striking and many imperceptibly became common property of all Talmudists. Theories on the concept of indirect damage,108 power of attorney,109 washing of hands before the meal and after the meal,1,0 prohibition against deriving benefit or pleasure from implements used for idolatrous rites,n l partial or complete nullification of testimony because of various disqualifications,112 different components of prayer,113 nature of legal doubt,114 retraction of vows,115 majority rule in cases of terefah,116 patterns of menstrual uncleanness,117 nature of the sanctity of the land of Israel,118 liabilities concerning the kidnapping of slaves,119 impurity120 - these are but some of his original theories, resulting from his critico-conceptual method of study, which spread far and wide in rabbinic literature. In the footnotes Twersky documents each of these thirteen new and influential theories (nn. 108 to 120).78 Let us analyze each case in turn. Since this may prove to be a somewhat lengthy exercise, as well as technically trying one, we shall, upon</page><page sequence="20">94 Haym Soloveitchik concluding our analysis, return to our initial point of departure, sum up the results of our investigation, and see what conclusions need to be drawn from them. The less halakhically oriented reader thus may pass over the (intentionally indented and enumerated) analysis and move directly to the recapitulation and assessment of that which must undergird any study employing halakhic sources - the mastery of halakhic technique. 1. ("concept of indirect damage108") "n. 108. MT, Hobel-u-Mazik VII, 7, 11; Tosafot Baba Batra 22b; Nahmanides, Dina de-Garme (end of Hiddushim, Baba Batra)', Sefer ha Terumot LI, 6 ( " nxnn nrra pi) Hoshen ha-Mishpat 386 and Sifte Kohen ad loc." Because no fewer than three doctrines of Rabad are contained in the MT citation, it is difficult to know which doctrine or doctrines Twersky has in mind. Nor do the other references help clarify matters. Tosafot in Bava Batra 22b surveys the gamut of problems of indirect causation, as does the Dina de-Garmei of Nahmanides and Hoshen ha-Mishpat 386. The "Sifte Kohen ad loc." consists of more than nine closely printed folio columns divided into no fewer than twenty-eight subsections. Some greater specificity as to what the author has in mind would have been helpful. The first doctrine, that culpability for indirect damages occurs only if the tortfeasor came into direct contact with the damaged object, is hardly a "novel" doctrine of Rabad. It was not novel in Provence at the time, as Rabad's language itself indicates (ib ama tan pn) and the glosses of R. Isaac of Marseille on Alfasi confirm.79 It was also independently current in the schools north of the Loire. Many Tosafists subscribed to this view, first formulated by R. Isaac of Dampierre (as the Tosafot Bava Batra indicates), and it is with his name that the doctrine is generally associated. Nahmanides explicitly rejects this view in his Dina de-Garmei. R. Moses Isserles, in Hoshen ha-Mishpat 386:4, says "there are those that say," and Siftei Kohen ad loc. writes that "this is the opinion of many authorities." Indeed, in his far-ranging discussion of indirect causation, never once does Siftei Kohen refer to this doctrine as Rabad's. R. Elijah of Wilno, to whom Rabad's Maimonidean glosses were not unknown, quite naturally footnotes R. Moses Isserles' statement as being the opinion of R. Isaac of Dampierre. The second doctrine - ?TTH rrvi poo x*? - also is hardly "novel." Rashi was of the same opinion, as the Maggid Mishnah already noted, as was Rabad's contemporary R. Isaac of Marseille. Indeed, it is the Maimonidean position that needs explanation, as R. Jacob b. Asher noted already in Tur, Hoshen ha-Mishpat 386, and which the involved defenses made by Bah and Derishah amply demonstrate.80</page><page sequence="21">History of Halakhah - Methodological Issues 95 The third doctrine {Hobel u-Mazik VII, 11) is the suggested distinction between destroying a lien on one's own property and destroying a lien on the property of a third party. This is indeed a "novel" view of Rabad. It was, however, without influence. To the best of my knowledge, only two scholars - the encyclopedic Meiri and R. Nissim of Gerona - cited Rabad's view. Both, however, cite only to reject it. Nahmanides' classic definition of indirect causation implicitly rejects it, as do the remarks of Rashba and R. Joseph Ibn Habib (Gittin 42a). Not surprisingly, R. Jacob Ba'al Ha-Turim, R. Joseph Karo, and R. Moses Isserles uniformly rejected this opinion in their codes.81 Siftei Kohen, Hoshen ha-Mishpat 386:12, sympathetically discusses and clarifies Rabad's view (and this is, perhaps, what caught Twersky's eye), but concludes thus: rfriOTi '9 r'-im i'aa-iiinyi pi D'aaina nViffn 'si mmn 'an win nyi irra .n *\yo ry ]zro ^y*? run d"di n*D 'o roan '9 bmmn s"3i o^pois nwin The Sefer ha-Terumot citation is perplexing. If one takes WTi n^ya mzny as being identical with mpya 'tan rwy, this only emphasizes that Rabad's view is hardly novel. If one sees in that passage a doctrine of intent, its relevance escapes me. The fact that Rabad's father-in-law held to a different opinion does not yet prove that the view adumbrated by Rabad in the hassagot is uniquely his own. 2. ("Power of attorney ?&lt;?") "n. 109. TD 61, Hoshen ha-Mishpat 122-123; see Chapter II, pages 74ff." At page 75 we read: His (i.e., Rabad's) interpretation of the knotty text in Baba Kamma and his practical conclusion that power of attorney involves both of the above-mentioned aspects were adopted with minor variations by such Rishonim as Nahmanides and Rashbah and later by Joseph Karo (in the Shulkan 'Aruk) and Sabbatai Kohen (in the Sifte Kohen).35 Footnote 35 in the cited text reads: 35: Baba Kamma 70a, Shebu'ot 33b and commentaries ad loc; Hoshen ha-Mishpat 122-123; see MT Sheluhin III, 5. There is some truth to Twersky's presentation, though I would hardly call Nahmanides' and Aderet's variations minor. As to R. Joseph Karo's and R. Shabbatai Kohen's positions, Twersky's brief reference to Hoshen ha-Mishpat, sections 122 to 123, which covers eleven folio pages of great legal density, without any reference to which of R. Joseph Karo's twenty-four or R. Shabbatai Kohen's seventy-two subsections he has in mind, makes any precise assessment of his evaluation short of a minor</page><page sequence="22">96 Haym Soloveitchik essay practically impossible. For brevity's sake, I refer the reader to the relevant sections of N. Rakover's Ha-Shelihut ve-ha-Harsha'ah be-Mishpat ha-Ivri to see just how far from the mark Twersky's assessment is.82 (The MT reference is superfluous. It does not relate to the above statements, nor does it agree with the next [and concluding] sentence of the text at p. 75.83) 3. ("washing the hands before and after the meal110") "n. 110. TD 66-67, MT Berakot VI, 2; Orah Hayyim 158ff., 181; see Ch. II pages 76ff." Twersky is correct. 4. ("prohibition against deriving benefit or pleasure from implements used for idolatrous rites111") "n. 111. Hassagot, Pesahim, 6b, see Yoreh De'ah, 10 1; 142,4." The meaning of this note eludes me. From the last reference (Yoreh De'ah 142, 4) I assume that the first one should read Alfasi, Pesahim 6b, and that the issue under discussion is ntan wb nxan ybv. If the second reference is correct (Yoreh De'ah 10, 1), the last reference should read 142, 2. However, I fail to see any substantive relationship between Rabad's remarks at Alfasi, Pesahim 6b, and any of the above possible references in Yoreh De 'ah, not to mention its illustrating "a new theory" of Rabad becoming "common property of all Talmudists." 5. ("partial or complete nullification of testimony because of various disqualifications112") "n. 112. Sanh?drin 9b, Makkot 7a and Rosh ad loc. who quotes Rabad. Baba Batra 43a and Nahmanides ad loc.; MT 'Edut XII, 1. Since this is one ..." In a rare halakhic discursus, Twersky devotes two paragraphs to a doctrine of Rabad: "Since this is one of Rabad's most famous halakhic principles, it may be worthwhile to analyze it here." Rabad's doctrine is indeed very well known, but what Twersky sets forth is simply the reverse of what Rabad actually said. Indeed, his presentation borders on the paradoxical. He writes that a "relative or one technically disqualified from testifying" (pasul) is disqualified because "there is some question concerning his reliability and trustworthiness." By most accounts, Twersky is confusing trustworthiness (rmaxa ) with disqualification from testifying (nny Vios), which the Talmud (Bava Batra 159a) specifically</page><page sequence="23">History of Halakhah - Methodological Issues 97 distinguishes and which Maimonides, Tur, and Shulhan 'Arukh naturally reiterate.84 This distinction lies at the very heart of the rules of testimony. Moses would be disqualified from testifying about Aaron, but the testimony of a sworn enemy is acceptable. R. Akiva is irrevocably disqualified from giving testimony about his own cousin, but the testimony of one who has transgressed any of some 120 pentateuchal injunctions is acceptable. By all standards of credibility, the reverse should hold true. Moreover, is someone who transgresses a n pxtz? mb mpya or a nvyb pmn Kb more trustworthy than one who transgresses a simple ix*?? Yet the criterion for disqualification ismpta 12 EPS? ix1?, and rnp1?? may be present or absent for any one of a host of technical reasons.85 Furthermore, loss of trustworthiness requires repetition of the criminal act in order to establish a pattern; a single act committed in the distant past suffices to disqualify someone from serving as a witness.86 Let us, however, grant Twersky his assumption that a relative is disqualified because his testimony about his kin is unreliable. Can the court then have greater confidence in the reliability of one's account about oneself? Yet it is precisely such a distinction that Twersky attributes to Rabad: "This distinction is embedded in the divergent character of the disqualifying traits. In the first case (i.e., testimony about oneself) there are no reservations concerning the very truthfulness and reliability of the witness." In other words, a person is not reliable when speaking of his kin, but is reliable when speaking of his own skin. Rabad's famous distinction is just the opposite. More precisely, Rabad makes no statement about the grounds of disqualification, but rather about the different nature of the disqualification. What one says about oneself is legally so meaningless that it does not even rate as testimony; it is never, as it were, entered into the record. The statement of a relative (being more "distant") is viewed as testimony, albeit unacceptable testimony. 6. ("different components of prayer113") "n. 113.MT7??/i//a/iI, 10." The first section of this note is not Rabad's own novel insight, but one he shared with R. Ephraim and R. Zarahyah of Lunel. Nor does Rabad claim that they appropriated it from him (Katuv Sham, at Berakhot 21a): "^x m vb? 'nnan." I assume that Twersky is referring to the latter half of the gloss (nsn *ix nbx tan *ay w rnnx ). This is indeed a "novel" interpretation, but I am at a loss to see how it was influential, not to mention its "becoming common property of all Talmudists." Aside from R. Jonah of Gerona, who adopted this view,87 the Spanish school omitted all mention of it, as did R.</page><page sequence="24">98 Haym Soloveitchik Asher. Provencal scholars made no note of it, aside from Meiri, who brought it in among a host of other opinions. It does not figure in R. Jacob's extensive discussion in the Tur 'Orah Hayyim 107, and of all commentators on the Tur only Beit Yoseph reproduces it at the tail end of his discussion. It is similarly absent from the Shulhan 'Arukh and the standard commentaries on that classic code. 7. ("nature of legal doubt1 w") "n. 114. Pesahim 9b; Razah and Rabad, ad loc.; See MT Hamez u-Mazah II, 10 and commentators ad loc." From the reference to Hametz u-Matzah, I assume that Twersky is referring not to the half a dozen cases of doubt discussed at Pesahim 9b by Rabad and Razah, but rather to the specific case set forth in MT II, 10, which Twersky has explicated elsewhere in the book.88 If so, Rabad did not set forth any novel theory about "the nature of legal doubt," but, to the contrary, noted a distinctive feature of bediqat hametz that exempts it from the standard rules of legal doubt. First, let it be noted that Rabad's rationale was not novel in Provence at the time. R. Isaac of Marseille brings this aper?u and concludes isms pi onnaan ta .89 I personally doubt whether the Geonim and Ibn Giat90 formulated this rationale themselves (the argument has a twelfth-century ring to it), and believe that 'Ittur's words refer more to the doctrine itself than to its exposition. (So, too, it would appear from R. Hannanel, Pesahim 9b.) Be that as it may, the aper?u was at the time a common Provencal doctrine. 'Ittur then proceeds to cite the view advocated by Razah (iann "?aana epi). In brief, there were two prevalent views in Provence in the latter half of the twelfth century, and Rabad adopted each at various stages of his career. In his Maimonidean glosses, he advocates that of Razah; in his hassagot on Razah, he swings to the Geonic and Maimonidean view. Rabad's view was clearly not original; was his advocacy, however, at least influential? There is no evidence for this. Indeed, it is questionable whether his view was even known in Provence. The authors of Sefer ha-Hashlamah, Mikhtam, ha-Me'orot (ad loc.) reiterate only Razah's opinion. Not unexpectedly, Meiri cites the other view (it was, after all, endorsed by the Geonim, R. Hannanel, Rashi, and Maimonides), but he omits any reference to the rationale advanced by Rabad. There is no basis for the belief that Rabad was his source. Finally, the last of the Provencal scholars, R. Manoah of Narbonne, does defend the Maimonidean view, but, again, not on the basis of Rabad's reasoning; and R. Yeruham simply cites the Maimonidean view without comment.91</page><page sequence="25">History of Halakhah - Methodological Issues 99 Little has come down to us from the Spanish school on this topic, so we are in the dark concerning what knowledge Nahmanides and his school had of Rabad's view. The recently published Hiddushei R. David Bonfid does indeed cite Rabad's view, among numerous others,92 but to argue on this basis that when R. Aaron of Barcelona (a person noticeably uninfluenced by Rabad) formulated the same view93 he was necessarily drawing upon Rabad, not stating his own insight or restating a known Provencal view, would seem to go beyond the evidence. If Twersky has in mind the full range of Rabad's notes at Pesahim 9b, Rabad did indeed deal with "the nature of legal doubt." His views, however, are wholly without resonance. There is not, to the best of my knowledge, a single reference to them in any of the classic studies and compendia of legal doubt, such as Dinei Sefeq-Sefeqa of Siftei Kohen, Peri Megadim, Keren u-Pleti, and Havvot Da'at at Yoreh De'ah, 110. This is not surprising, since the Katuv Sham, as we have already noted, was generally unknown until the latter half of the nineteenth century.94 8. ("retraction of vows115") "n. 115. MT Shebu'ot VI, 12; see Kesef Mishneh ad loc." This note is perplexing. If one reads the Kesef Mishneh as suggested, one sees that it is Maimonides' position which is maverick and that Rabad simply expresses, perhaps independently, the mainstream halakhic view. A glance at the Haggahot Maimuniyot only reinforces this impression. Briefly stated: Tosafot (Ketubbot 63a), R. Isaac Bekhor-Shor, R. Moses of Coucy, R. Asher ben Yehiel, R. Mordecai ben Hillel, and the Haggahot Maimuniyot are all of this opinion.95 R. Moses Isserles himself cited from these sources as his authority in Yoreh De'ah 228, 13. Even in the Spanish school there is no evidence that Nahmanides arrived at this position because of Rabad's glosses, rather than from the writings of the Tosafists, or - equally possible - from the Yerushalmi, which he cites and which makes this interpretation inevitable.96 9. ("majority rule in cases of terefah116") "n. 116. TD 12, Yoreh De 'ah 37, 2, Bet Yosef on Tur (Off 3 ni?D Tixsa Tax-in)." The cross references are clear; but what an "abscess on the lung from which emerges a pendant lesion" has to do with "majority rule in cases of terefah" is not clear. This apparently is Twersky's way of translating xriFi7 *mn. Since the term refers to the kashrut of an animal with lung problems, rather than to any court procedure or communal discussion, I would</page><page sequence="26">100 Haym Soloveitchik suggest that "convergent symptoms" or "double defect" would be a more accurate rendition. Rabad did indeed rule as impermissible a iTl^n xdto njron ]a nxrrn; but the very language of Beit Yosef (uvi nira vwa? T2X"in)and the fact that the latter did not initially understand Rabad's view, indeed, rejected it, indicates that this view was for centuries far from well known and that behind its eventual influence lies a tale. Rabad's opinion was not formulated in his commentaries, but rather was rendered in a specific responsum. This responsum was wholly unknown in Spain, to commentators and codifiers alike. Not a trace of it is found in the hiddushim of Nahmanides, Rashba, Ritva, or R. Nissim, and it goes unmentioned in the Torat ha-Bayyit, Pisqei ha-Rosh, and Tur.91 Provence knew of it only very partially.98 It had somewhat wider currency in fifteenth-century North Africa,99 although only in works that were published centuries later. In the sixteenth century, R. David Ibn Yahya, author of the influential Hilkhot Terefot, was unaware of this view,100 as was the encyclopedic R. Joseph Karo, until he came across a cryptic passage (in a manuscript?).101 His first report in Yoreh De'ah, 37, bespeaks non-comprehension and rejection. By the time he was making his way through the thicket of section 39, he had the full text of the doctrine in front of him, duly registered it, and later returned to emend his previous objections in section 37. In the Sephardic world Rabad's doctrine remained exactly what it had been - a specific ruling on a specific case of the numerous terefot of the lung. In Ashkenaz, on the other hand, the doctrine had a long and independent history. R. Elazar of Worms formulated it independently in the late twelfth or early thirteenth century.102 R. Jacob Weil in the early fifteenth century gave it official sanction in his Hilkhot Bediqah, a widespread work of enormous influence. With the arrival of Beit Yosef m eastern Europe (in the 1560s), the doctrine became associated with Roqeah and R.Weil.103 In the seventeenth century, this limited ruling became generalized into, or gave sanction to, the doctrine of "double defect," and within a century and a half expanded almost exponentially in central and eastern Europe the range of terefot of the lung.104 As the doctrine often was disseminated under Rabad's name, it did in one sense "spread far and wide in rabbinic literature." But it should be noted that for close to four hundred years, Rabad's view was far more often than not unknown, and that Ashkenaz had had a similar doctrine for centuries and had been practicing it for some one hundred years before it learned that Rabad, too, was of this opinion. Moreover, the use made in Ashkenaz of this doctrine, close to half a millennium later, under Rabad's name, was entirely unlike anything Rabad had in mind, and tells us more about the mentality of Polish Jewry in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries than</page><page sequence="27">History of Halakhah - Methodological Issues 101 about the influence on the history of halakhah of the twelfth-century talmudist from Posqui?res. 10. ("patterns of menstrual uncleanliness117") "n. 117. BH, 38-39; see Niddah 63a, and Tosafot ad loc.; MT, Issure Bi'ah, VIII, 1; Yoreh De'ah, 189." The note is unclear. At BH (Ba'alei ha-Nefesh) 38-39 Rabad concludes his lengthy mxnonn -lyp with a summary often different types of menstrual cycles and the legal status of each. Yoreh De'ah 189 fills fifteen folio pages and is divided into thirty-four subsections, in which every possible permutation of the menstrual cycle is listed and legally classified. Judging by the other two references, it would seem that Twersky has in mind Rabad's interpretation of the Mishnah at 63a as referring exclusively to a case of xairr rnnon, which constitute a separate category, and not (as in Maimonides' interpretation) only in conjunction with o^an mnon. The other references would then read BH 35, Yoreh De'ah 189:19. If this is its intent, then it should be noted that it is Maimonides' view that is difficult and needs much squaring with the talmudic text, whereas Rabad simply expresses the mainstream, consensual view, as the remarks of the Maggid Mishnah (ad loc.) already indicate: nzrra onnm Trxiff D^iaan ta tax crpita mnoi *w ont?. Perhaps Twersky had in mind Rabad's system of classification, which was indeed novel in its time, as any perusal of Sefer ha-Terumah and Or Zaru 'a will evidence; but then a different set of references would be required.105 11. ("nature of the sanctity of the land of Israel* ] 8") "n. 118. MT Bet ha-Behirah VI, 14." Far being from influential, this doctrine was one of the most maverick doctrines ever expressed by Rabad. Indeed, Twersky himself writes elsewhere in the book: "Rabad's hassagot, of course, also contain interpretative vagaries and opinions which had absolutely no repercussions in halakic literature. For example,... Bet ha-Behirah VI, 14."106 12. ("liabilities concerning the kidnapping of slaves119") "n. 119. MT, Gezelah VIII, 14; IX, 1; See Sukkah 30a, Baba Batra 44a and Tosafot ad loc. Also MT, To 'en we-Nit'an V, 4; Baba Kamma 59b, Ketubot 51a and Tosafot ad loc." Once again, it is not clear to what Twersky is referring - the act of theft of slaves, the proprietary rights acquired by theft, or the act of restitution. The</page><page sequence="28">102 Haym Soloveitchik ambiguous and contradictory status of slaves ? which was partly real estate, partly mobilia ? was already pondered in the Talmud,107 and most talmudic commentators took a stand on it. Concerning the act of theft, Rabad's views were novel but not influential.108 Regarding proprietary rights C^p ffix*?), Rabad's position is identical with one stream of Tosafist thought, as the Tosafot (Bava Batra 44a) cited by Twersky indicates. This, however, is not the widespread view. In the matter of restitution, Rabad's position on aging slaves does not differ from that of Maimonides (Gezelah III, 4), or from the initial doctrine of Alfasi (at Bava Qamma 96b). Regarding slaves who have died, his view is indeed novel, but I have been unable to find any major halakhic figure who endorsed it. "Also MT To'en we-Nit'an V, 4." The status of slaves as mobilia in the matter of liens is a talmudic fact, and was explained by Rashbam in his Commentary on Bava Batra at 128a. This commentary had penetrated Provence a generation before Rabad,109 and Rashbam's remarks on slave liens are approvingly cited verbatim by R. Zerahyah of Lunel with Rabad's concurrence.,10 This interpretation obtained widespread currency in Spanish halakhic thought.1 ! 1 13. ("impurity120") "n. 120. MT, Turn'at Met VII, 4; XI: 1 (correct XII: 1); XII, 6; see Berakot 19b and Tosafot ad loc.; Sefer ha-Hashlamah on Berakot 11." I have been unable to trace any influence whatsoever of Rabad's doctrine. Sefer ha-Hashlamah, which Twersky cites, brings only the doctrine of ta n^y inna ]ra px n^y ntaa run px nxai?, hardly a novel doctrine of Rabad. A generation earlier, R. Jacob Tarn, in northern France, argued against it. A glance at S. Lieberman's Tosefet Rishonim at the location of the oft-cited Tosefta indicates just how widespread it was.112 Sefer ha Hashlamah omits, however, any reference to niTa vbw, as do Meiri, R. Maier ha-Me'ili, Rashba (both in his novellae and responsa), and R. Simeon b. Tzemah; Nahmanides, Rah, Ritba, R. Nissim of Gerona, R. Isaac of Carcause, Tur, Yoreh De'ah 371, and all commentators thereafter follow the Tosafist doctrine.113 The doctrine is similarly absent from the Provencal collections, i.e, 'Orhot Hayyim and Kol Bo.114 Let us return now to our initial point of departure. To best assess the author's control of halakhic technique, we selected the most extensive halakhic discussion in Rabad of Posqui?res. In conformance with the canons of scrutiny set down at the outset of this essay, we examined a sustained series of proofs - intentionally</page><page sequence="29">History of Halakhah - Methodological Issues 103 sustained by the author to prove a major, indeed indispensable, thesis of the book - that Rabad was an original and influential talmudist. The upshot of our study of these axial and heavily annotated pages is that the documentation for this central contention will simply not bear scrutiny nor withstand even a cursory examination. The thrust of this conclusion is not to question Rabad's far-reaching influence upon halakhic thought, which was massive indeed, but rather to suggest that most of the extensive evidence brought in support of this fundamental thesis - twelve of the thirteen successive doctrines advanced in the book - does not pass muster. Seven of these doctrines are not original to Rabad but are common in rabbinic thought. Four are original, but with little or no influence. One is so maverick that Twersky himself elsewhere terms it "an interpretative vagary ... which had absolutely no repercussions on halakhic literature." Only one of the cited doctrines is indeed both original and famous: the central distinction in disqualifications of witnesses (jrata xtctt). So famous is this doctrine that Twersky wisely decided to present it at length, to give the reader a taste of Rabad's critical acumen. What is expounded, however, is actually the reverse of what Rabad says. And so, instead of possessing that compelling, suasive force that reverberated for centuries among halakhists, the famed doctrine is rendered incomprehensible, bordering, indeed, on the absurd. On several other occasions Twersky returns to the issue of Rabad's impact and traces his influence on halakhah, not in the massive fashion of the passage cited above but in a brief (but nevertheless significant) manner. This provides us with an opportunity to see whether a similar picture emerges from scrutiny of other passages. Let us select, as a control case, the argument made for Rabad's impact on Hoshen ha-Mishpat (The Code of Civil Law), an impact central to any major claim to halakhic stature. Twersky writes:115 Rabad's influence on many sections of the Hoshen ha-Mishpat is considerable ... This influence is for the most part indirect, having been mediated or channeled by the Sefer ha-Terumot of R. Samuel b. Isaac ha-Sardi which directly dominates extensive sections of the Hoshen ha-Mishpat ... Consequently, views are frequently referred back to ha-Sardi, whereas further investigation actually projects the source back to Rabad.76 Footnote 76 reads: E.g., TD 50 and Hoshen ha-Mishpat 73, 12, and Sifte Kohen ad loe.; TD 54 and Hoshen ha-Mishpat, 81, 29; TD 55 and Hoshen ha-Mishpat 39, 3 (note Sifte Kohen) and 70, 1. Let us consider the three examples given: 1.'TD 50 and Hoshen ha-Mishpat 73, 12, and Sifte Kohen ad loc." This reference is perplexing. First, it is somewhat difficult to see how Siftei Kohen attests to Rabad's influence, given that the author seeks to clear up a misreading of</page><page sequence="30">104 Haym Soloveitchik Rabad's responsum (and of Nahmanides). Siftei Kohen discusses what Rabad didn't say, rather than what he did. Second, as to the legal fate of what Rabad said, if Twersky has in mind Rabad's position on redemption of possessory mortgages, the proper reference would be 74, 5 - which rules contrary to Rabad (though note 117, 2). Perhaps Twersky has in mind Rabad's views on the status of Gentile practices in cases where there is no applicable halakhic ruling, and the reference is to 73, 14 (gloss). It should then be noted that R. Joseph Karo in the Shulhan 'Arukh pointedly refrains from incorporating Rabad's ruling (which he cited in Beit Yosef), and R. Moses Isserles cites R. Mordecai ben Hillel, not Rabad, as the source of his gloss. The lengthy discussion by Siftei Kohen ad loc. graphically demonstrates to what extent Rabad's view is only part of a larger and far more complex picture. 2.4TD 54 and Hoshen ha-Mishpat 81, 29" Rabad was indeed the first to enunciate the doctrine that a witnessed statement by the creditor of receipt of payment suffices to establish nonliability, irrespective of whether the witnesses were casually or formally present. To what extent the ensconsing of this ruling in Jewish law is due to Rabad's being cited by the Sefer ha-Terumot is moot, since R. Meir of Rothenburg, R. Jonah, Rah, Ritba, and R. Joseph Ibn Habib all arrived independently at a similar view.1,6 3. 'TD 55 and Hoshen ha-Mishpat 39, 3 (note Sifte Kohen) and 70, 1" The doctrine that a claim of payment cannot be entered (without corroboration) in instances of a loan accompanied by qabbalat qinyan is hardly unique to Rabad. Indeed, its attribution to him is somewhat surprising. In TD, Rabad himself relies on R. Hai Gaon and cites the locus classicus of this doctrine in Alfasi Ketubbot. The Shulhan 'Arukh cites as its source both the Sefer ha-Terumot and Mordecai.111 Reading the Sefer ha-Terumot, as Twersky suggests in the text, one discovers that R. Hai Gaon, other anonymous geonim, Alfasi, R. Judah of Barcelona, and, lastly, Rabad were of this opinion. Indeed, so widespread was this doctrine that Maimonides, who cannot be suspected as having been influenced by Rabad, simply took it as axiomatic.118 The control case of Rabad's influence on Hoshen ha-Mishpat yields a picture no different than that yielded by the extensive, axial passage examined above dealing with Rabad's general impact upon halakhic thought. For all the above, however, one should bear in mind that occasionally a scholar's overview may be superior to his footing, his insight better than his grasp. Intimacy with the sources can, at times, overcome serious technical failings. Some assessment of Twersky's coup d'oeil and of his familiarity with the basic sources seems only appropriate. There is no dearth of material for valuation in Rabad of Posqui?res, nor could there be in any work of serious scope. Strewn throughout</page><page sequence="31">History of Halakhah - Methodological Issues 105 this large-scale biography are the inevitable claims and characterizations. And they are revelatory. To give just three examples: 1) Twersky writes about Rabad's role as commentator: "Ha-Meiri, who devised a system of literary sobriquets - each very allusive and revealing - for all authorities quoted in his Bet ha-Behirah deemed fit to describe Rabad as 'one of the greatest of commentators.' "i19It is one thing to say120 that even though Meiri's sobriquets are invariably meaningless, nevertheless, his bestowal upon Rabad of a sobriquet that clearly belongs to Rashi (gedolei ha-mefarshim) may well indicate something. It is an entirely different matter to state that the sobriquet "one of the greatest of commentators" has descriptive value, since Meiri devised a system of sobriquets, each and every one very allusive and revealing. While there are three or four fixed and probably appropriate sobriquets for several medieval talmudists in the Beit ha-Behirah, no one has yet figured out why Meiri could not call anyone by his own name, but rather devised for them some seventy to eighty shifting, meaningless sobriquets. As anyone who uses the Beit ha-Behirah knows, the same person can have four different sobriquets, and four different people the same sobriquet. Without checking other works one rarely knows to whom Meiri is referring, and almost never why he refers to him as he does. 2) Twersky advances a number of proofs to argue that medieval writers did not have the full text of the currently extant Temim De'im. The third one reads: 3. The author of the Kol Bo, who ordinarily names his sources with considerable precision, cites a certain legal opinion anonymously while it is explicitly propounded in Temim De1 im in Rabad's name [emphasis mine].121 With the exception of the writings of R. Yeruham of Provence (the printed text of which is terribly mangled), no medieval work is less reliable or more obscure concerning its sources than the Kol Bo. This is not surprising, since the Kol Bo is either a first draft of the 'Orhot Hayyim or an abridgment thereof. One rarely footnotes a first draft, and the purpose of a legal epitome is to give the substance of a ruling, not its origin or filiation. If one were to infer authorship or lines of filiation from attributions absent from the Kol Bo, I would venture to guess that one would have to rewrite sizable tracts of the history of halakhah in the Middle Ages. 3) After citing at length a long list of Provencal scholars whom Rabad heavily influenced, Twersky writes in his central section on Rabad's influence:122 In this respect Provence serves as a microcosm for all rabbinic literature. Scholars of Franco-Germany, Spain, North Africa, Italy, Palestine, Slavic countries - scholars from literally all corners of the Jewish pale of settlement - knew, studied, and esteemed Rabad. His name or teachings come to the fore in the Tosafot,123 in the works of R. Meir of Rothenburg, the Haggahot Maimuniyot, the Sens commentaries ... In fact, Rabad's name hardly ever appears in the Tosafot. His teachings had no influence whatsoever on their thought, and no one, to the best of my knowledge,</page><page sequence="32">106 Haym Soloveitchik has ever dreamt that they had. Five references (at most)124 in thousands of pages of discussion hardly constitute a presence, not to speak of a "coming to the fore." So odd is a reference to Rabad in Tosafot that R. Akiva Eger saw fit to jot down in his Gily?n ha-Shas the other occurrences in Tosafot of Rabad's name.125 The late date of R. Meir of Rothenberg and the Haggahot Maimuniyot and the very restricted scope of their use of Rabad is not the issue,126 nor is the problem of whether the Sens commentary on 'Eduyot is indeed that of Sens or became known as such only by virtue of being so titled by the Rom printers. Such questions here are minutiae. To speak of Rabad as appearing prominently in Tosafot, to equate in any way the impact of Rabad on Provencal and Spanish halakhic thought with his impact on Ashkenaz, is something that leaves not only the scholar but also the layman baffled. Though this is an essay in halakhic biography, it would be churlish in so extensive a review not to mention Twersky's superb concluding chapter "Philosophy and Kabbalah." Moreover, Twersky handles the material in this chapter differently from the others, and the comparison is illuminating. Rabad was one of the early kabbalists, in whose halakhic writings we find such phrases as "a holy spirit has appeared in our study hall," "as I have been shown from Heaven," and "so it has been revealed to us for 'God's secret [is disclosed] to those that fear him.'"127 Some historians have attached special weight to those words and have seen halakhic positions as originating in or validated by mystical experiences. Twersky traces the use of these terms from the tenth to the fourteenth century and conclusively demonstrates, from a wealth of citations, that these terms are the medieval equivalent of our "with God's help" (be'ezrat ha-Shem). Rabad was further characterized by some historians as an uncompromising opponent of secular knowledge, as befits an obscurantist critic of Maimonides. From a few random, indeed innocuous, remarks of Rabad, Twersky shows how exaggerated an inference this is. He then shows that Rabad's other writings evince a familiarity with many, if not most, of the philosophical or scientific works then available in Hebrew, such as Sefer ha-Ibbur and Higgayon ha-Nefesh of Abraham bar Hiyya, the Tikkun Midot ha-Nefesh of Gabirol, the Cuzari, Hovot ha-Levavot, and Emunot ve-De'ot. Twersky's wide reading stands him in good stead in firmly placing in their proper historical context both the problem of Rabad's attitude to secular knowledge and the relation of halakhah and kabbalah in his thought. Twersky does with these sources what one wishes he had done with the halakhic ones. Rabad's terse glosses on Mishneh Torah are integrated with his other writings and read in light of the remarks of his predecessors, contemporaries, and successors, with the result that Rabad's gnomic remarks yield their true meaning for the first time. The wide scope of the knowledge deployed and the finely nuanced, sensitive reading of texts make Twersky's chapter "Philosophy and Kabbalah" a permanent contribution to historiography.</page><page sequence="33">History of Halakhah - Methodological Issues 107 D. Scope and Character Clearly, one must approach Twersky's study of Rabad with limited expectations. For biographies of the central figure and of his disciples we may confidently rely on Twersky. Nor does he disappoint us. Just as the salient figure of Rabad has received from Twersky its first full delineation, similarly, many shadowy, minor figures of thirteenth-century Provence receive their first full treatment in a fine chapter on Rabad's disciples and followers. Since Rabad has not been located in this study in an intellectual continuum, Twersky's analysis of Rabad's oeuvre is perforce more literary than historical, static rather than dynamic. And as the author's halakhic technique is weak, it stresses characterization and classification far more than origin and impact, and form and genre over intellectual content. Viewing the glosses on Mishneh Torah as Rabad's supreme achievement,128 Twersky naturally gives little space to Rabad's talmudic commentaries. Rabad's commentary-codes, to which Twersky does attach importance, receive mixed treatment. In view of the considerable effort expended in successfully reconstructing the circumstances surrounding the composition of the Hilkhot Lulav, it is regrettable that the author did not pay any attention to the actual content of this work, which decisively influenced all subsequent writings on the subject of lulav.129 Less than two pages are devoted to Rabad's HibburHarsha'ot, and, as we have seen in our detailed halakhic analysis, they are not without serious problems.130 The same holds true for the one-page discussion of the influential code on netilat yadayim.131 There is little of substance on the Ba'alei ha-Nefesh specifically, which is not surprising, given Twersky's lack of awareness both of the considerably different extant printed versions and the internal contradictions in them.132 However, his discussion of the Ba'alei ha-Nefesh contains very important remarks about medieval codes in general. Indeed, Twersky writes some of his finest pages as he analyzes the danger of tracing influence by overt citation, for views expressed in influential codes of limited scope were often absorbed into larger works and the names of the original proponents often lost in the process. This fact - common enough in most legal systems - had, surprisingly, gone unnoticed in previous halakhic historiography and much needed to be said. And Twersky says it very well.133 He also breaks down the artificial dichotomy, erected by Hokhmat Yisrael, between codificatory and commentarial activity, and convincingly demonstrates that many halakhists engaged equally in both, viewing them as complementary rather than as competitive endeavors.134 Twersky's judiciousness, which shines in his classification of the Maimonidean glosses, is clearly manifested in his measured discussion and correction of these prevalent assumptions. So fine are these pages in the section on the Ba 'alei ha-Nefesh that one wishes he had given more attention to Rabad's other published works, to his commentaries on halakhic Midrashim and Mishnah. Unfortunately, they are not analyzed at all, not</page><page sequence="34">108 Haym Soloveitchik even described. The bulk of the section on the Sifra Commentary is devoted to discussing other commentaries on that work and to the Karaite challenge to the Oral Law.135 Twersky then devotes the remaining two pages to demonstrating, very convincingly, Rabad's exegetical skills in biblical interpretation.136 But what of Rabad's skills in talmudic interpretation? The Sifra is, after all, a halakhic midrash, and Rabad's massive commentary on it is the single largest work of his we possess. In sheer size and complexity it perhaps exceeds all his hassagot on Razah, Alfasi, and Maimonides combined. Some discussion of the halakhic aspects of Rabad's commentary, then, would seem appropriate. Not only is this an intrinsic need, but such a delineation is necessary to support some of Twersky's major contentions. Twersky, it will be recalled, contends that Rabad was one of the founders of the critico-comparative school; indeed, he views this as one of Rabad's major claims to fame.137 In the Sifra Commentary we have Rabad at his comparative best, aligning passages in this work with parallel and conflicting ones in the Talmud. His work here intersects as nowhere else with that of the Tosafists. How does his treatment compare with theirs? One is left with a deft description of the backdrop of the work rather than with any delineation or characterization of the work itself. Rabad's great commentaries on 'Eduyot and Qinnim fare no differently. The entire discussion encompasses five pages, half of which are devoted to a fine portrait of the difficulties that attended Mishnah commentaries in general.138 In these, and only these two tractates do we possess a case in which Maimonides and Rabad commented systematically on the same texts. If Maimonides is axial to a study of Rabad, as is generally posited, then the first order of the day would be to characterize, if only in a tentative and probative fashion, the different approaches and exegetical styles of these two thinkers as a prelude to understanding their more famous encounter - the hassagot on Mishneh Torah. In Mishneh Torah we possess only the points of intersection and clash, but in Qinnim and 'Eduyot, and only here, can we observe them simultaneously interpreting a running text. To the extent that the hassagot are central to Rabad's position in halakhah, the commentaries on 'Eduyot and Qinnim are the essential praeparatio for any study of the hassagot on Mishneh Torah. Other than the observation (which Rabad himself makes in his preface) that Rabad comments only on those passages of the Mishnah that were unexplained in the Talmud, whereas Maimonides comments on the entire text, no further characterization is forthcoming. Indeed, there is not a single reference in the entire book to a halakhic doctrine adumbrated by Rabad in these commentaries.139 We must, however, be grateful for Twersky's extensive treatment of Rabad's famous hassagot on the Mishneh Torah. Twersky's characterization of these hassagot is the product of what can only be described as a masterly literary analysis. Ever since the Maimonidean controversy, those who took sharp issue with the sage of Fustat often fell victim to the passions of his partisans. Beginning with the late medieval chroniclers, Rabad's glosses</page><page sequence="35">History of Halakhah - Methodological Issues 109 were harshly assessed, though far less harshly than his character and the motives imputed to him. The scholars of Wissenschaft des Judentums added fuel to the fire, often projecting onto Rabad their assessments of their own rabbinic contemporaries. In a literature racked by polemics and apologetics, Twersky's dispassionate assessment is a constant source of illumination. The views of Ibn Yahya, Sambary/Konforte, Just, Graetz, Weiss, Eppenstein, Ginsburg, and Tchernowitz are, each in turn, judiciously weighed and shown to be wanting. Step by step, the "encrusted layers of stereotypes" created by these chroniclers and scholars are skillfully removed. Calmly, carefully, with insight and caution, Twersky persuasively demonstrates the highly variegated nature of Rabad's glosses. At the same time, he looks beneath this heterogeneous surface for certain common denominators, categories broad enough to serve as units of classification, yet flexible enough that these multifaceted hassagot do not lose their individuality. Twersky distinguishes between "corroborative and explanatory glosses" and "critical glosses and animadversions." In an extensive, two-pronged analysis he scrutinizes each one. He shows in the first, finely nuanced section140 that Rabad often points out the source of a Maimonidean decision, explains an obtuse formulation, complements and rounds out Maimonides' formulations, notes scribal errors, and clarifies textual obscurities. Twersky convincingly demonstrates that while Rabad is indeed among the earliest of Maimonidean critics, he is also among the earliest of Maimonidean commentators. This aspect of his hassagot has generally gone unnoticed in halakhic historiography. After Twersky's extensive and sensitive presentation, it can go unnoticed no longer. Twersky then turns to the critical hassagot - the second, largest, and most famous component of Rabad's work.141 Without minimizing Rabad's occasional acerbity, Twersky notes that some glosses are quite mild, given the astonishing doctrines Maimonides sometimes advocates. It is occasionally Maimonides' view that is, as he puts it, "eccentric," and Rabad's glosses simply reflect the mainstream opinion.142 He also notes that the differing views of Maimonides and Rabad often reflect standard controversies, originating centuries before these protagonists and continuing long after them.143 In more than forty places Rabad neutrally registers the existence of a different view, often without identifying himself with either side.144 Occasionally his notes reflect his own long-held views;145 often his glosses reflect either Provencal doctrine146 or regnant Provencal practice.147 Twersky's taxonomy of these glosses is, quite simply, superb. By proving their diversity and variety, their corroborative and critical nature alike, the richness of the halakhic soil from which they spring, and both the longstanding and widespread constituency for which Rabad speaks, Twersky negates, indeed renders meaningless, the attempts, from Sambary to Graetz, from Ibn Yahya to Ginsburg and Tchernowitz, to portray Rabad as a critic out to spike the Maimonidean enterprise because of personal jealousy, opposition to codification, or ideological-philosophical differences. The stereotyped image of Rabad among</page><page sequence="36">110 Haym Soloveitchik chroniclers and modera scholars has been banished forever from the realm of Jewish historiography. This, needless to say, is a major and lasting ac complishment. This achievement, however, is attained on the terms of the chroniclers and scholars of Wissenschaft and in their categories, which, in turn, raises a problem as large as the one solved. Indeed, from the point of view of intellectual (as opposed to personal) biography, the question that now looms is far larger than the one resolved. One may obtain occasionally from Rabad some insight into and commentary on Maimonides' views - but one would not turn to him for that. As a Maimonidean commentator Rabad was far surpassed by the comprehensive works of Maggid Mishnah and Kesef Mishneh. Why have these glosses survived? Clearly because of the critical hassagot. Rabad, however, was portrayed at great length and in detail primarily as a spokesman of widely held views, whose words, generally, were common coin of wide tracts of the halakhic realm. If this is the case, why then are these glosses famous and what just claim can they make to greatness? Does Rabad's claim to immortality rest simply on his trenchant barbed style? Many hassagot are, indeed, classics of compression, but few would contend that they are the most suasive or the most comprehensive exposition of the doctrines they present. The entire thrust of the central chapter "Mishneh Torah Criticism" is to bring Rabad within the common fold. This decisively eliminates charges of personal motivation or captiousness. However, it puts Rabad's originality to serious, indeed, relentless question. After reading the central chapter on the hassagot in Rabad of Posqui?res, one is fully convinced that, acerbity aside, Rabad was a weighty and representative glossator. The question of wherein lies Rabad's genius and claim to fame obtains, however, an evermore insistent ring. The problem emerges because Rabad's hassagot on Mishneh Torah are treated in isolation from his other writings. Twersky does state that some of Rabad's hassagot reflect prior positions of his, and offers eight cases as evidence.148 He further cites several other places in the hassagot where Rabad refers to his other writings.149 The sum total of these correlations, both specified and unspecified, is twenty. In point of fact, the correlations run into the many hundreds.150 Indeed, if one studies those areas, as hilkhot lulav and shofar, where we possess a full exposition of Rabad's views in his other writings, the number of correlations is between seventy and eighty percent.151 Adducing these statistics would have swiftly dissolved - without much ado - a great deal of the "stereotyped image" of the hassagot as the product of a contrary or capricious critic, for Rabad was more often than not simply voicing a long-held position of his. Twersky, however, opts for a different route. He attempts to disprove charges of captiousness and the like by correctly insisting that Rabad's remarks be viewed in a wider framework. This insistence is correct, the framework invoked is questionable. The framework employed is not Rabad's own massive writings, to which the hassagot are often simply a natural, indeed inevitable, capstone, but rather a select number of</page><page sequence="37">History of Halakhah - Methodological Issues 111 classically controversial issues, regnant halakhic opinions of standard Provencal doctrines and practices.152 Massive biases and prejudices aside, the methodological error of the chroniclers and scholars of Wissenschaft was in treating the glosses in isolation. In Twersky's solution the glosses are still isolated - from Rabad himself, from everything else that this prolific titan wrote. Instead of Rabad's originality emerging ineluctably from a series of correlations, the reverse occurs. Originality is placed in doubt, and necessarily so, for as a member of a fold, wherein does he differ? What just claim to immortality has a mere spokesman? The only viable option in Twersky's approach would be to base Rabad's claim to fame on his great, if isolated, glosses on Zera'im and Taharah. This is a path not taken in Rabad of Posqui?res, and the total absence of any discussion of these glosses underscores the central weakness of the chapter "Sources." This chapter constitutes a wide-ranging list of all the works referred to by Rabad and how frequently they are cited. This list is often accompanied by a skillful thumbnail portrait of the works and of their standing in the halakhic hierarchy. When one speaks of Kant's or Marx's sources, one does not have in mind the books they read or even cited, but rather the sources of their thought, those works whose ideas they drew on and transformed. No doubt it is of interest that Rabad cited Midrash Tanhuma or Sefer Jossipon. Rabad's accomplishment would have been the same, however, with or without these works. The same does not hold true for the Yerushalmi. Twersky notes that the Yerushalmi is cited some one hundred and ten times in the hassagot.^ To cite a Yerushalmi now, certainly to cite it then, means to interpret it. It is Rabad's extraordinary achievements in exegesis of the Mishnah, Tosefta, and the Yerushalmi manifested in his hassagot on Zera 'im, Taharah, and also in the field of Kodashim that won him the awe of succeeding generations. Had we not known of his accomplishments in Sifra and Qinnim - as most scholars could not have known until the mid-nineteenth century - one would still sense in these glosses a sovereign and independent grasp of the entire talmudic corpus, a sovereignty clearly attained prior to his scrutiny of Maimonides' work, and one that the Yad simply activated. It may well be that Nahmanides and Rashba could have taken on Maimonides' oeuvre in its entirety. Fact it is that in close to a millennium Rabad was the only figure who actually did. He alone could bend the master's bow, and he showed that it could be bent quite differently. Indeed, Rabad engaged Maimonides most heavily in those areas where most feared to tread. Unfortunately, the chapter "Sources" simply lists and describes the sources. It does not treat what Rabad did with them or how he transformed so much of what he touched. At its best, it describes Rabad's attitude toward the Tosefta and Yerushalmi (which, in reality, differed little, if at all, from that of other rishonim). It never discusses Rabad's accomplishments in the understanding of these texts, which won for him a place among the mighty of the earth. And the material for such an assessment lies ready and waiting for use by the historian. Lieberman's multi-volume Tosefet Rishonim and Tosefta Ki-Peshuto (Zera 'im) proffers an abundance of richly contextualized and luminously explicated instances of Rabad's royal reach and</page><page sequence="38">112 Haym Soloveitchik commentarial genius.154 The one weighty claim to immortality that the hassagot, viewed in isolation, possess is never advanced, and a major dimension of Rabad's oeuvre and accomplishment is left unportrayed. The chapter "Sources" only manifests in a heightened and salient fashion one of the two underlying wants of the massive, central chapter "Mishneh Torah Criticism"; namely, that the substantive content of these famous glosses generally is left unattended. Well over three-quarters of the references to these famous glosses are for literary and historical purposes. They never touch on their halakhic content. Even this percentage of halakhic references is misleading. In fact, a very small corpus of halakhic topics is drawn upon. The numerous halakhic references are widely scattered. If, however, one notes and compares their contents, one quickly perceives that the footnotes repeatedly use the same issues and references.155 The second root problem of Twersky's treatment of Rabad's Maimonidean glosses is that, on the whole, they h?ve been classified not so much on the basis of an actual study of the talmudic sugyot themselves as on the information contained in the supercommentaries of the Yad. Such an approach has its merits, but from the point of view of the history of halakhah it is not without pitfalls. Most of Rabad's other works were unknown to the Kesef Mishneh and Lehem Mishneh, even, to an almost equal extent, to the Maggid Mishnah. They could and superbly did correlate Rabad's doctrines with those of Rashi, Alfasi, the Tosafists, and the school of Gerona. Of Rabad's role in the emergent Provencal halakhah, of his impact on the writings of Nahmanides and Rashba, they could have known little and would have cared even less. They were jurists seeking schools of opinions, not historians of ideas tracing originality and impact. Whether Rabad was a member of a school or the originator of the school is not a legal problem but a historical one. Juridically, even the originator remains simply a member, and often not the most important one. Often, Rabad indeed simply articulates a commonly held view. In such cases the question that needs be asked is: Was his advocacy influential? This entails a two-stepped assessment. First, where Rabad represents a mainstream view, does this view appear in subsequent halakhic literature under his name? Second, if it also appears under the name of another scholar, does Rabad's endorsement add weight to the position? A simple control test may be made, using several carefully selected legal topics: Do equally standard halakhic views, but ones not endorsed by Rabad, suffer in influence or have a diminished impact by virtue of Rabad's silence? These two tests of influence entail citing subsequent halakhic literature. How frequently are Rabad's hassagot on Mishneh Torah mentioned in Beit Yosef, Bah, Rama, Siftei Kohen, Turei Zahav, and the Magen Avrahaml And when cited, how much weight does Rabad's advocacy carry? Regrettably, references to these works are as rare in Rabad of Posqui?res as references to the novellae of Nahmanides and Rashba. The great codificatory literature of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries has shaped the contours of halakhah to this very day, and one hopes that Twersky</page><page sequence="39">History of Halakhah - Methodological Issues 113 will enrich the next edition of his study by taking this central corpus into account, thus illuminating not simply the fame but the actual impact and influence of the hassagot. E. Recapitulation Let us now return to the three questions we posed at the outset: To what extent is this book an accurate delineation of Rabad? To what degree has this standard work realized its own goals? Are there unbreakable canons of research and evidence in halakhic history or biography? 1) Twersky has once and for all banished from Jewish historiography the stereotyped portrayal of Rabad as the captious critic. Similarly, he has dispelled the notion of Rabad as a willful obscurantist opposed to secular knowledge or as a mystic who allowed his revelations to influence his legal thought. He has also provided us with a subtle and superbly nuanced literary taxonomy of the famed hassagot on Mishneh Torah. The artificial dichotomies, so dear to maskilim and so foreign to talmudic scholars, between codifiers and commentators or between halakhists who tend toward stringency and those who tend toward leniency have been consigned to the waste bin of halakhic historiography. These are major and lasting accomplishments. Rabad's personal biography has also been fully, indeed definitively, presented, but his intellectual oeuvre and accomplishment far less so. 2) The study evinces a lack of bibliographic spade work, indeed, of bibliographic awareness. Essential and readily available manuscripts were ignored, and the one or two cited scarcely used, even in places where the author was aware of the corrupt state of the text. Later, truncated printings rather than first editions were employed, and little or no comparison made of the widely divergent texts contained in the different printings. Rabad's massive, ramified, and ongoing reworking of his oeuvre, with all its repercussions, goes undetected, as does the simple fact that radically different versions of his works exist. Finally, little attention is given to the dates, places, and frequency of printings - so essential for any assessment of influence. Not surprisingly, widespread impact is attributed to ideas found in works that first achieved diffusion only at the end of the nineteenth century. "The major emphasis," declares Twersky at the outset of his study,156 "must remain on Rabad's contribution to halakhic literature and methodology, for though he was conversant with cognate areas of non-halakhic learning, he was first and foremost a Talmudist." Yet the intellectual substance of Rabad's oeuvre is scarcely treated in this study. More than three-quarters of the references to Rabad's hassagot on Mishneh Torah, the centerpiece of Twersky's study, are for literary and historical purposes and have no relation to their legal content. Consequently, the originality, not to mention impact, of these great glosses is perforce unmeasured and uncharted. And even this percentage of halakhic references is misleading. For, in</page><page sequence="40">114 Haym Soloveitchik reality, a very small number of halakhic topics is drawn upon, since the same doctrines and references are deployed and redeployed on numerous fronts. It is no exaggeration to say that regarding intellectual content, more than ninety-five percent of Rabad's doctrines in his hassagot on Mishneh Torah are never even referred to. Rabad's other works, such as his hassagot on Razah and Alfasi, Hilkhot Lulav, and the great commentaries on Sifra, Qinnim, and 'Eduyot are left untouched. Their background, as, for example, the Karaitic challenge to the Oral Law, is well treated,157 but the works themselves - both their literary structure and halakhic content - are never analyzed, not even in a tentative and probative fashion. Not only are these works never addressed per se, but their content is scarcely drawn upon in the study, in any form or manner, as some simple statistics illustrate. Of the forty-two citations from the great commentary on the Sifra, only four, at most, relate to a legal issue.158 Two of the sixteen references to Rabad's hassagot on Alfasi refer to their substantive talmudic doctrines.159 Finally, all of the twenty-two references to the great commentaries of Qinnim and 'Eduyot are devoid of any halakhic content or character.160 On the few occasions when Rabad's thought is addressed, the treatment is deeply and disturbingly problematic. 3) Having surveyed Rabad of Posqui?res, taking a close measure of both its strengths and weaknesses, we are now in a position to ask: What lessons have been learnt from this audit? What instruction may be taken from such an inquiry? Can some basic norms of research and evidence be suggested for halakhic history? Some rules do come to mind. Any halakhic biography (or history) must base itself on what the subject actually wrote, address what he thought, and place it in its historical context. There is no escape from bibliographical foundations; manuscripts and first editions should be used - if cited they must be used - and then compared. The subject of intellectual history must be ideas and its narrative that of the mind in action. Predecessors and contemporaries should figure prominently in any such study, providing both the intellectual milieu of the thinker and the yardsticks for assessing his distinctiveness. Finally, a sure control of halakhic technique is obviously needed, first to determine what the halakhist actually said, then to assess both its originality and subsequent influence.161 There is little that is new or noteworthy in this. The history of halakhah, however, is a very new field, and in new fields basic guidelines are often more observed in the breach. As the great legal historian Frederick Maitland wrote, when the history of the law was first developing: "There are things to be discovered, to be sure; but there are first habits to be formed." #** Or so it appears to this reviewer. And serious reviewing should always invite dialogue. Indeed, many rishonim viewed the vital enterprise of critical interaction as a "labor for the sake of Heaven (melekhet shamayim)" As Twersky repeatedly</page><page sequence="41">History of Halakhah - Methodological Issues 115 affirms, and never more persuasively than in his introduction to the new edition of Rabad of Posqui?res:162 These halakhists, critics and all, articulate a sturdy rationale outlining the importance, permissibility - indeed indispensability - of intellectual freedom and criticism. Various epigrams and slogans expressing this concept were to become current. Many rabbinic authors, Rabad included, speak of 'labour for the sake of heaven' (melekhet shamayim). Going a step further, we may call attention to the creative interaction ... between colleagues ... We discern a pattern of ongoing criticism concerning major themes and central problems in halakhah.... Hence, the persistent, open-ended discussion of key themes, axial problems or authoritative formulations ... If to a great extent, later, post-Maimonidean Hebrew philosophy is a sort of dialogue between philosophers - by virtue of quotations, discussions, endorsement, or refutation of classic views - rabbinic literature is even more intrinsically dialogic. This central facet of Jewish thought has never been said better.</page><page sequence="42">116 Haym Soloveitchik NOTES I would like to thank Dr. David Berger for reading the manuscript. (This essay, barring some minor revisions, was written in 1983.) Twersky employed the system of transliterat?on of the Jewish Encyclopedia (1906), whereas I have preferred the one currently most in use. Reading Dibre-ha-Ribot in one line and Divrei ha-Rivot in the next is disconcerting, but, I hope, not an insuperable obstacle to understanding. In his footnotes Twersky refers to Rabad's works by initials: TD (Temim De'im), BN (Ba'alei ha-Nefesh), and MT (Mishneh Torah). I have cited the footnotes as found. 1. I.

I emphasize "its own goals." I have argued elsewhere that Rabad's massive impact on medieval halakhah was as a talmudic commentator - "o'cnsan ^m," as Meiri calls him - and that most of his currently published work, including the hassagot on Mishneh Torah, were generally unknown until the sixteenth century. In his study, Twersky adopts the regnant view, which downplays Rabad's role as a talmudic commentator, in favor of his published works. Every work should be evaluated on its own premises. The question addressed here is: Granting its assumptions, to what extent does Rabad of Posqui?res meet its own goals? (My own view of Rabad's importance is found in "Rabad of Posqui?res: A Programmatic Essay," in Studies in the History of Jewish Society in the Middle Ages and in the Modern Period Presented to Professor Jacob Katz on his Seventy-Fifth Birthday (Jerusalem, 1980), 7-41. 3.

The alternative explanation found in our texts of the Ba'alei ha-Nefesh was not in the text of Nahmanides, but apparently was a later addition.

Personally, I prefer the printed version and would translate the phrase as "based on a certain passage." The contrast is not simply between authority and authority (for then the word oipa, found in both print and manuscript, would be out of place), but between differing interpretations of a talmudic passage by two talmudists of different worth. 48.

The interchange between nsio myo tt and myo tt (or variants thereof) is so common in manuscripts that, not surprisingly, the difference is not between the printed text and manuscripts, as Twersky presents it, but between the manuscripts themselves. (The folio references are: Adler 1179 fol. 56, MS 38477 [= R.514] fol. 46a.) 53. See p. 177 n. 74. (The correct references are MS 38477 fols. 8b-9a, 49b; Adler 1179 fol. 58.) This footnote, which constitutes the only discussion in the book of the manuscripts of the much mutilated hassagou is generally problematic, as the Ha-Mazkir reference, for example, illustrates. That entry (correct VIH, 1865, (46) [97], nn. 65,66) says only: "65. Glossen des Abr. ben David ?ber Maimonides. 66. Desgleichen." As this manuscript was not used by Urbach (ibid.) or Twersky, how can it document the statement in the text that "the manuscripts contain hassagot which are neither printed nor even mentioned by commentators"? Moreover, citing Perreau's article in Ha-Mazkir as a reference to the Parma collection, as Gross did in his important article of 1874 (above, n. 39), may sow confusion. Perreau* s report in Ha-Mazkir of the material not listed by De Rossi was a preliminary one, in which the numbers given to manuscripts differ from those that he assigned them in his catalogue later on (Firenze, 1880). It is by the latter, naturally, that they have been identified and referred to for over a century. The two above manuscripts of the hassagot are registered in Perreau's catalogue as nos. 57 and 58.</page><page sequence="45">History of Halakhah - Methodological Issues 119 This footnote also illustrates another problematic aspect of the book, which, fortunately, we need only touch on lightly; namely, the uneven use of secondary literature. The French sources are well utilized; the German ones far less so, especially those in Gothic type. As the literature of Wissenschaft on Rabad is small, this unevenness proves to be only a minor hindrance in Twersky's study. 54. Seep. 119 n. 10. 55. (1) Vienna Alfasi: I refer to the edition of Anton Schmid, not of J. Horoshentzkia of the same years (1804-1807). See below, n. 60. (2) Katuv Sham: I exempt from my account the Katuv Sham on Berakhot in the Metz Alfasi of 1770. It is found in several libraries, but has thus far escaped bibliographical attention. To the best of my knowledge, only one tractate was ever published, and this small (quarto) book was as unknown to eighteenth- and nineteenth-century talmudic scholars as it has been to twentieth-century bibliographers. 56. These hassagot are never referred to in the Nahlat David, the Hiddushei ha-Rim, or even in the Yeshu 'ot Ya-akov, the three-volume commentary on the Shulhan 'Arukh by R. Jacob Orenstein (d. 1835), who was the rabbi of Lemberg at the time of the printing of the Temim De 'im and one of the main signators of the haskamot to that work. The Temim De 'im was even beyond the royal reach of R. Akiva Eger (Haggahot R. Akiva Eger 'al Shulhan 'Arukh 1 [Berlin, 1862]; 2 [Thorn, 1869]). It is also not found in the multi-volume responsa of Hatam Sofer, those of R. Judah Asad {Yehuda Ya'aleh), the six-volume Sho'el u-Meishiv of R. Saul Nathanson of Lemberg (d. 1875), and the Be 'er Yitzhak and Ein Yitzhak of R. Isaac Elhanan Spektor of Kovno (d. 1896). 57. I have, for clarity's sake, compressed the process. The first Alfasi to combine both the hassagot on Alfasi and those on Razah was that of Warsaw (Argelbrand), 1859-61. The great Rom edition of 1881-86 gave these works wide currency, and within one year (1887) a new Warsaw (Munk) Alfasi, which obtained broad distribution, appeared. 58. At Pesahim 9b, see text below, pp. 97-98. 59. The point of this citation was methodological - the indispensability of bibliography for determining influence. As to the substance of Twersky's remarks, engendered by the now puzzling location of Rabad's introduction to his glosses on Alfasi, I can see no basis for any criticism of the printers, either "early" or late. The printer, or, more accurately, the editor of the Tummat Yesharim, R. Abraham Mortal, found a manuscript that lacked hassagot on Yevamot. It began, introduction and all, with Ketubbot, and he published what he found. He could not publish an introduction to glosses on a tractate he did not possess. The manuscript of the Sefer ha-Zekhut, which does contain Yevamot, has, understandably, only Nahmanides' introduction, for this is a manuscript of his defense of Alfasi, in which Rabad's words serve only as a foil for Nahmanides' rebuttal. R. Jacob of London, who published the Sefer ha-Zekhut (in Shiv'ah Einayyim) in the mid-eighteenth century, could not invent an introduction he did not have. He simply published what he had. The Rom editors, as usual, did their very best. They printed the full text of the hassagot as found in the Temim De 'im. Then, despite the fact that Sefer ha-Zekhut reproduces many of these hassagot almost verbatim, they nevertheless reprinted the entire text of the Sefer ha-Zekhut, in the event that there might be some minor textual differences between the passages in the Temim De'im and the citations in the Sefer ha-Zekhut. They did not, however, feel entitled to move the introduction found in Temim De'im at Ketubbot to the glosses on Yevamot taken from the Shiv'ah Einayyim. Where Rabad began his critique - at Ketubbot Yevamot - remains an open question, but not one engendered by "printers' whims or calculations." 60. Texts: Tummat Yesharim (Venice, 1622), sees. 238-240; Shiv'ah Einayyim (Livorno, 1745); Magen u-Mahseh in Alfasi (Vienna, Anton Schmid, 1805), II, end, see the introduction. (Its claim, however, seems dubious.) The Rom editors did their survey and collation with their usual thoroughness and modesty. In their printing, they fused the Tummat Yesharim with the Shiv'ah Einayyim, and on the back leaf of the title page of the Alfasi, they hinted that they knew of Schmid's text but did not deem it worthy of use. They write of Nahmanides' Sefer ha-Zekhut: vr\</page><page sequence="46">120 Hay m Soloveitchik nonoi ]aa ?V2 imaa'. The title nonai jaa is one given to Nahmanides' work by, and only by, Schmid's edition. 61. See below, pp. 90-92 and n. 71 ad loc. See the entry (p. 310) "Ha-Meiri, Menahem, Bet ha-Behirah on various tractates of the Talmud. Bet ha-Behirah on Nedarim, Nazir, and Sotah (Halberstadt, 1860) contains the very important introduction" (emphasis mine; see below, pp. 106-7, 112-13 and n. 139). Bibliographic entries are often viewed as trivia. Their technicalities are indeed a burden, and minor errors, especially those of proofreading, creep more easily into this section than into most others. The basic structure of the entries, however, often reveals the nature of a study. 62. Seep. 315. 63. E.g., Hiddushei Ramban, 54 n. 51; 57 n. 77; 58 n. 80; 64 n. 108; 215 n. 120; 222 n. 33; 234 n. 135; 235 n. 144; and 242 n. 8. Six of the nine references to Nahmanides* Hiddushim are for literary or historical purposes. Three are substantive, touching on two halakhic issues. Two refer to the same doctrine (58 n. 80; 64 n. 108), and are, to my thinking, in error; see text below, pp. 94-95 (to n. 108), and below, n. 114. The second halakhic doctrine is touched upon on p. 235 n. 144. Hiddushei Rashba: 54 n. 54. Hiddushei Ritba: 58 n. 79; 105 n. 43 (correct to Yoma 13a). Teshuvot Rashba: 54 n. 54 (correct 344, 669 to 342, 689); 114 n. 24 (correct 445 to 224). 64. 'Ittur. see below, n. 69.

The section in the 'Eshkol is not too differently arranged from the Ba'alei ha-Nefesh, as the section "headings" or openings indicate, e.g.:rrmtfaa vnmb bvrw n-3 pa""TO xrawa xnx an ana .a-V .aVmn noi rb .o^ro noi .n-*? .airr; noi ,na"?sn -rwa con noi ,?iian noi rmnom in iVw .yb ,&lt;nwnsn "ot =) nana oncao uvzi rraran xnawa xnx ai ana .&lt;n^?sai n"r?r -) ma xao n*rrm .vb .nmo on rrrb =&gt; .rb ?nrr nxra =&gt;.

See pp. 27 n. 37; 52 n. 30; 235 n. 137; 238 n. 156; 146; and 239. 70. See p. 153 n. 81. The location of the passage in the "Ittur is given on p. 235 n. 137 (see below, n. 129). 71. The bibliography (p. 310) lists the "Ittur thus: "Isaac b. Abba Mari of Marseille, Sefer ha-'Ittur, Lemberg, 1860 (New edition, New York, 1955 [!])." See above, n. 61. 72. See pp. 123-24. 73. See text below, pp. 97-98. 74. See pp. 237-39. 75. Twersky also cites Rabad's influence on Nahmanides, an influence I wholly agree with. Indeed, I would make it the central theme of any study of Rabad's influence, focusing on Nahmanides' Novellae, which shaped the course of Spanish halakhic thought for centuries (see above, n. 2). As for Rabad's impact on specific doctrines, see below, n. 114. 76. See pp. 62-64. On the same pages Twersky speaks of Rabad as one of the founders of the "critico-conceptual school." Sometimes the term is used synonymously with "critico-comparative"; other times not. If I read him correcdy, two separate claims are made, and "critico-conceptual" corresponds roughly to Begriffsjurisprudenz, and "critico-comparative'* to "dialectic.'* I have intentionally addressed the second claim only. The extent of Rabad's involvement with Begriffsjurisprudenz is a complex issue, involving, among others, the relationship between modern Lithuanian modes of halakhic thinking and those of the medieval period. It does not, in my opinion, lend itself to proof or disproof in a page or two. If Twersky views the two terms as synonymous, I am not sure what he has in mind, and my remarks in this paragraph are clearly beside the point. (My own position on Rabad's genius as a commentator has been presented in the study cited above, n. 2.)</page><page sequence="47">History of Halakhah - Methodological Issues 121 77. See pp. 64-66. 78. One reader has suggested that Twersky has two separate classes of doctrines in mind: original, but not necessarily influential; and influential, but not necessarily original. I do not think the passage sustains this interpretation. 79. Me'ah She'anm at Bava Qamma 26b. 80. Nn. 4 and 2 ad loc., respectively. 81. Hoshen ha-Mishpat 117:6; 386:2. 82. Jerusalem, 1972. 83.

He discusses Ta nxrm rrfrn xamo nyian at great length (Shehitot u-Bediqot (Constantinople, 1541, fols. 34b-35a), trying to project on it a major controversy of rishonim, but in point of fact he knows only of Roqeah. This doctrine is also absent from Reumah (Constantinople, 1566), though I doubt whether this bespeaks much. (See Kiryat Sefer 2 [1925-26]: 269.) All the collections of hilkhot terefot here cited are listed in the Sarei /ia-'A/e/(New York, 1959). The second edition has no additions that are relevant to our topic. 102. Roqeah, 381. 103.

Often in this study (in the passage under consideration, in five out of thirteen cases), the references are so broad that the burden of proof is passed on to the reader rather than assumed by the author. The first three examples that we have discussed graphically illustrate this. Unless one is willing to work through such complex subjects as causation in torts, agency and power of attorney, and the entire range of the laws of netilat yadayim, it is impossible to ascertain the accuracy of the claim, since it is not known just what claim is being made. Twersky neither clearly informs the reader which of Rabad's doctrines in these areas were so influential nor where their impact is located. Such a</page><page sequence="48">122 Haym Soloveitchik burden is gratuitous. Halakhah has its obscurities, but the lack of a system of precise notation is not one of them.

One may then speak of Rabad's doctrine as "influential," but in a sense different from the general use of the term. Nor would this suffice. For if one seeks to prove that Rabad has had a major impact on modern halakhic thought, one would then have to amass a string of similarly influential opinions, and also define what "modern halakhic thought" means and how impact and diffusion is there measured. A number of the above doctrines are employed by Twersky to demonstrate Rabad's influence on Nahmanides. Compare p. 58 nn. 80-82 with our remarks above, pp. 94, 95, and 96-97 (on nn. 108, 109, and 112). To n. 82 one might add that the views expressed by Nahmanides in his Bible Commentary are discussed at length in his Hiddushim, Bava Batra 20b. Any reading of the Hiddushim will evidence to what extent his views were shaped by Tosafist discussions, and how oblivious he was of Rabad's gloss. (In the final n. 83,1 assume that Twersky is not referring to the substantive issue of Bi 'at Miqdash II, 5, for Nahmanides, in both his Bible Commentary and Hassagot 'al Sefer ha-Mitzvot, endorses the Maimonidean view, but rather to the phrase in the gloss raa inffoaw b^ivi nys? nrnxV x"?x. But how does one know that the en passant, conjectural alternative of Nahmanides larrxi uy'Txa orna' Vaa ama m tptw tosxi was influenced by Rabad? 115. See p. 95. See the preceding note for the argument made for Rabad's influence on Nahmanides. The third passage is on pp. 93-94 nn. 70-74. The documentation there is more accurate, but methodologically problematic, as it does not distinguish between central and peripheral contributions. Nor does it discriminate between views unique to Rabad and those instances where Rabad is simply one of many independent advocates of this legal doctrine. Hence, its prevalence in halakhah proves little about Rabad's influence. 116. See Beit Yosef and Be'er ha-Golah, ad loc. R.

The exact pattern of diffusion of Rabad's doctrines in northern Europe, in both France and in Germany, is the subject of a detailed, unpublished study by Professor Y.

My own views as to the centrality of Rabad's commentarial labors I have expressed elsewhere (see above, n. 2.) My own position is in no way relevant. A book, as we stated at the outset, should be evaluated on the basis of its own assumptions. 129. See pp. 36-38; see above, p. 79, and below, n. 139.

See pp. 159-60. The "eccentricity" of a good number of the examples given (n. 12) is questionable, but the point is well taken. Rabad does gloss numerous classically difficult Maimonidean doctrines. 143. See pp. 160-61. 144. See pp. 151-52. Twersky enters this group under the rubric of "corroborative and explanatory" glosses. For expositional purposes I have registered it under "critical glosses and animadversions." The point is equally valid and relevant under either rubric. 145. See pp. 161-62. 146.

Ibid., p. 38. Indeed, the percentages run even higher if the exact extent of available parallel material and the nature of the Maimonidean doctrines that were glossed are considered. In Lulav, seven of the nine hassagot are found in Rabad's Hilkhot Lulav. Of the remaining two, one is occasioned by a problematic doctrine, which Maimonides himself subsequently retracted and ordered emended in his text {Lulav VII, 7; Kesef Mishneh, ad loc.). The Derashah 'al Rosh ha-Shanah does not contain any material related to the contents of the second chapter of Maimonides' Hilkhot Shofar. Of the five hassagot found in the remaining chapters, four of these positions are already articulated in Rabad's derashah. 152. This is further highlighted by the fact that every halakhic example spelt out in this chapter is one of classic controversy. Rabad is simply one spokesman among others, rather than an articulator of his own distinct views (the examples given: 170 n. 47; 136 n. 16; 141 n. 35; 142 n. 37; 152 n. 80; 153 n. 81; and 154 n. 84.) 153.

To take one example from a gloss already discussed - Hovel u-Maziq VII, 7: 58 n. 80; 64 n. 108; 152 n. 78; 153 n. 83; 173 n. 54; and 176 n. 65 (or see above, n. 114). 156. See p. 3. 157.

Four of these references are substantive and are all drawn from secondary sources. The first two (p. 86 n. 19; p. 238 n. 156), as Twersky candidly informs us, are drawn from an article by B. Z. Benedict. The latter two (p. 161 n. 15; p. 162 n. 16) are drawn from I. H. Weiss's notes (ad loc.) in his edition of that work. 159. See p. 40 n. 4; 41 n. 11; 43 n. 16; 71 n. 21; 75 n. 37; 119 nn. 10, 12, and 15; 120 n. 19; 162 n. 16; 173 n. 54; 201 n. 16; 230 n. 113; 231 n. 115; 250 n. 49; 263 n. 16. The two substantive citations (p. 162 n. 16; p. 173 n. 54) refer to the identical halakhic doctrine. (I have not listed p. 64 n. 105; 68 n. 3; 121 n. 22; 140 n. 29; 151 n. 76. These are not, as stated, hassagot on Alfasi, but on Razah.) 160. (1) "Eduyot: 70 n. 16; 73 n. 32; 81 nn. 19 and 21; 86 n. 21; 89 n. 45; 100 n. 18; 104 n. 40; 108 nn. 9 and 11; 109 n. 15; 110 n. 21; 291 n. 22. (2) Qinnim: 3 n. 8; 6 n. 28; 40 n. 1; 42 n. 15; 50 n. 4; 89 n. 45; 108 n. 13; 201; and 272 n. 46. 161. What these simple guidelines entail in any study of Rabad - irrespective of whether one views his claim to fame as gedolei ha-meforshim or as the Maimonidean critic par excellence - is obvious. All extant works of Rabad must be clearly identified, the best and most complete text of each determined and then systematically utilized. If several recensions of a work exist, they must be registered and compared, and the nature of the revisions assessed. As noted above, accomplishment is the difference between what a man finds and what he leaves. Only by placing Rabad*s oeuvre against those of his predecessors and teachers, the 'Eshkol and the 7mm, can the measure of his originality be taken. To separate out Rabad's achievements from the general advance of halakhic thought in the twelfth century, his interpretations and rulings must constantly be juxtaposed with those of his contemporaries, R. Isaac of Marseille, Ba 'al ha- 'Ittur, and especially R. Zerahyah of Lunel, Ba'al ha-Ma'or, Rabad*s fellow student and constant critic, with whom Rabad was engaged in a lifelong literary and intellectual controversy. Each commented, glossed, and criticized the other's work. The intellectual activities of these two are interwined, and one cannot be studied apart from the other. Finally, the works of Nahmanides and his school will figure prominently, as they constituted a major - if not the major - conduit of Rabad's influence on halakhah. Needless to say, the great works of codification of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, together with their classic supercommentaries, will loom large in any assessment of Rabad's impact on halakhah and his just claim to fame. 162. See pp. xx-xxiii. This point is reiterated and emphasized at length in Twersky's Introduction to Mishneh Torah (New Haven, 1980), 170-75, and again in his "Contribution of Italian Sages to Rabbinic Literature," Italia Judaica 1 (1981): 394-98.
