This psychobiological basis is manifested in cross-cultural similarities in shamans' visionary experience, soul journey, guardian spirit relations, healing practices, and self-transformation experiences such as death and rebirth. These universais reflect operations of basic brain structures, or innate modules, for processing specialized information about self, mind, others and nature. The cross-modal integration of these innate processing modules for knowledge about mind, social relations (selfothers), and the animal world provided a basis for metaphoric predications and analogical representations found in shamanism. These cross-modal integrations are manifested in: animism (self and mind attributed to nature); totemism (natural world categories attributed to social others); and the guardian spirit complex (natural world categories attributed to self and mind). These metaphoric cross-modal integrations of representations from innate modules of the brain produced fundamental forms of trope (metaphor) underlying analogical representation and provided a basis for cognitive evolution. Representational and psychointegrative aspects of shamanic practice made it an adaptive mechanism for healing. Shamanic ritual alterations of consciousness provide mechanisms for cognitive, personal and social integration. The psychobiological basis of shamanism creates structures that provide an ethnological analogy for cultural interpretation and reconstruction. 1 The Etic and Psychobiological Characteristics of Shamanism Cross-cultural assessments substantiate the etic status of the shaman (Winkelman 1984, 1986a, 1900, 1992; see Winkelman and White 1987 for data) and confirm as universais many of the characteristics attributed to shamans (e.g., Eliade 1964, Harner 1982, Halifax 1979, Hultkrantz 1973). Empirical cross- cultural research indicates the universality of shamans, charismatic political and religious leaders in hunter-gatherer (or slightly more complex agricultural or pastoral) societies where political integration and leadership is limited to the level of the local community. Shamans normally engaged in activities on behalf of the entire local community, most frequently healing and divination; however, they also (were thought to) engage in malevolent magical acts designed to harm others. Shamans use altered states of consciousness (ASC) as the basis for their training and professional services. Shamans are trained through a variety of ASC procedures (2). These may include: having had involuntary visions or experienced serious illness; and deliberately undertaking vision quests through a variety of agents and procedures including: hallucinogens, fasting and water deprivation, exposure to temperature extremes, extensive exercise such as prolonged dancing, various austerities, sleep deprivation, auditory stimuli (such as drumming and chanting), and social and sensory deprivation. These induction procedures produce ASC experiences generally labeled as involving death and rebirth, soul flight, journeys to the spirit world, and/or transformation into animals, but not possession. Typical of shaman ASC are imagetic or visionary experiences. They also have special relationships with and control of spirits, particularly animal spirits. A worldwide presence of shamanic practices in hunter-gatherer societies and their striking similarity cross-culturally indicates that shamanism must have derived from psychobiological potentials. Evidence that hunter-gatherer shamans derive from an adaptation to biologically based ASC potentials includes: the 63</page><page sequence="2">Journal of Ritual Studies 16 (2) 2002 worldwide similarity in shamans; shamans' use of a biologically based ASC which occurs spontaneously under a wide variety of circumstances; and the universal institutionalization of ASC in divination and healing (Winkelman 1986b, 1992, 2000). These universal ASC based healing practitioners have been labeled "shamanistic healers" in recognition of their original basis in shamanism (Winkelman 1990, 1992). The universality of shamanistic practices reflects an underlying biology that structures consciousness, social relations and healing. ASC are manifestations of one of the fundamental homeostatic dynamics of the human nervous system, a mode of consciousness (Winkelman 2000) known as transpersonal, mystical or transcendental consciousness; it is referred to here as "integrative consciousness." Its functions include healing through psychodynamic growth and social and psychological integration. The physiological conditions of ASC involve integrative processes across structural and functional units of the brain (Mandeli 1980, 1985; Winkelman 1986b, 1992, 1996, 1997b, 2000). This biologically based mode of consciousness involves production of a parasympathetic dominant state in the autonomic nervous system and interhemispheric synchronization in the frontal cortex by high voltage slow wave EEG activity that originates in the serotonergic circuits linking the brain stem and the hippocampal-septal area of the limbic system. This high-voltage slow-wave EEG activity derives from limbic discharges and imposes synchronous alpha and theta brain waves patterns on the frontal lobes. This results in: interhemispheric synchronization and coherence; brain stem-limbic integration; limbic-cortical integration; and integration across the neuraxis, producing a synthesis of emotion, thought and behavior. These integrative brain conditions are produced by many shamanistic activities (Winkelman 1986b, 1992, 1996), including drug and non-drug ASC induction conditions, temporal lobe syndromes (Mandeli 1980), hallucinogens (Mandeli 1985, Winkelman 1996) and hypnosis (McClenon 1994, 1997). This biological basis provides the foundation for specific adaptations of hunter-gatherer societies (shamans) and a universal distribution of shamanistic healers, magico-religious practitioners who use ASC (Winkelman 1986a&amp;b, 1992). These biologically based principles of perception and consciousness are also widely distributed in shamanic rock art (Whitley 1994a, b, c, 1998). 2 Neurognostic Structures: Innate Modules and Religion Universais of shamanism are manifestations of basic brain features and processes, or neurognostic (3) structures (Laughlin, McManus and d'Aquili 1992; cf. Winkelman 1997a), basic forms of perception and knowledge provided by the biological nature of the organism. The roles of brain structures in the origins of religious thought have been proposed by a number of anthropologists (e.g., Boyer 1992, Mithen 1996, Laughlin et al. 1992, Winkelman 2000). Proposals for a biological basis for religion are derived from theories (e.g., Fodor, Gardener (4)) that explain the evolution of the human mind in terms of the development of specific types of programs or brain modules, hard wired input systems that provide for automatic information processing. Children are bom with content rich intuitive knowledge modules that reflect prehistoric hunter-gatherer lifestyles in domains of behavior involving: physics (tool use), biology or natural history (animal perception), psychology (social relations and mind), and communication (language) (Mithen 1996). These constituted specialized skills for knowledge domains of: technical skills for manipulation of physical objects; exploiting knowledge of animals' behavior; complex social interaction involving internalization of others and "mind reading" of their intentions; and specialized communication systems. 64</page><page sequence="3">Journal of Ritual Studies 16 (2) 2002 Boyer, in The Naturalness of Religious Ideas, argues that religious notions are based upon counter- intuitive contradictions to innate modules. But Mithen (1996) points out religious ideas are normative rather than exceptions, and instead suggests that it was the integration of innate modules that produced religious ideas. I propose that the cross-modal integration of innate modules for recognizing social "others," "mind-reading" their intentions, and "natural histoiy knowledge" (animal behavior) provided the foundation for universais of shamanism- animism, totemism and guardian spirits. Cross-modular integration produces animism (mental applied to natural history domain), totemism (natural history applied to social domain), and guardian spirit relations (natural histoiy applied to self and mental domains). These activities constituted a fundamental evolution of the human capacity for symbolic representation, social bonding, psychointegration and healing. These functional roles of shamans are embodied in the psychobiological effects of ASC, animistic beliefs, visionaiy perceptions, soul flight, and death and rebirth experiences (Winkelman 2000). Shamanism's role in cognitive evolution involved the adaptive potentials derived from: the construction of self as exemplified in soul flight and the guardian spirit complex; the conceptualization of "others" as embodied in the spirit world (animism) and totemism; and the visionary state, a presentational mode of symbolic expression (Hunt 1995). This internal imagery provides symbolic information at the basis of shamanic journeying, diagnosis, and transformation of self. These shamanic activities are based in innate brain functions and neurognostic structures. Soul Flight: One shamanic neurognostic structure is known by a variety of terms- soul flight, soul journey, out-of-body experience, and astral projection. These refer to a universal, central and essential feature of shamanism-the experiences of traveling to or encountering entities from the spiritual or supernatural world. The psychobiological basis of these experiences related to the shamanic soul flight or journey is indicated by the cross-cultural distribution of experiences that share a common structure (i.e. the out-of-the-body experience, near death or clinical death experiences, and "astral projection" or out-of- the-body experiences) (Winkelman 2000). Their homologies suggest that the core shamanic experience- soul flight- is an innate psychophysiological structure, reflecting basic neurognostic processes of the organism and homologies across symbolic, somatic, and physiological systems (cf. Hunt 1995, Laughlin 1997). The visionaiy experience exemplified in soul flight is a natural phenomenon of the nervous system, resulting from disinhibition of the raphe cells, which regulate the visual cortex. However, the personal point of reference for these experiences is distinct from the ordinary visual experience. The point of reference for that experience is a "third person perspective" on a visual representation of one's own self and self awareness. Hunt (1995) characterizes this core of the shaman's flight as involving complex synesthesia based on the self awareness derived from "taking the role of the other towards one's self." This involves the manifestation of a self-referential capacity within visual or presentational symbolism. Death and Rebirth: Similar neurognostic structures are manifested in the phenomena of death and rebirth, a fundamental experience of shamanism reflecting processes of self transformation that occur under conditions of overwhelming stress (Walsh 1990). Central to shamans' development are illness experiences interpreted as involving personal death. The shaman's initiatoiy experiences involve crises interpreted as involving attacks by the spirits that produce illness and eventually death. This death is followed by the experience of a descent to the lower world and the destruction of the initiate's body, which is then reconstructed with the addition of powers derived from spirit allies. The death and rebirth experience reflects the fragmentation of the conscious ego which results from the intrusion of unassimilated neural structures and underlying conflicts (Laughlin et al. 1992). Dismemberment reflects a breakdown of the internal structures that is experienced in "autosymbolic images" of the disintegration of one's own psychological structures. 65</page><page sequence="4">Journal of Ritual Studies 16 (2) 2002 3 Evolution of Modern Human Cognition in Cross-Modal Integration The question of how the specialized brain modules were integrated in human evolution is problematic because artifacts evidencing extensive cross-modular integration are relatively recent (40-50,000 years before present [bp]), long after the emergence of anatomically modern humans (Mithen 1996). The integration of thinking from different modules found in religious practices dramatically expanded between 30,000 and 60,000 bp in the Middle/Upper Paleolithic transition. Some 40,000 years after the appearance of anatomically modern Homo sapiens sapiens, a fundamentally new mentality is widely manifested in the carving of many kinds of figures, the use of jewelry, and the dramatic evolution of art and culture. Mithen characterizes this cognitive fluidity as based upon forms of meta representation derived from the ability to integrate the brain's specialized modules. A key feature of this modern mind was the capability for production of art based on a visual representational and symbolic code through integrated functioning of different mental modules to produce and interpret visual symbols (5). These early artifacts are often referred to as art, but also functioned as didactic tools (6) (e.g., calendrical markers). The production of early art images combining animal and human reference depended upon the capability to integrate the mechanical skills, social intelligence and natural history intelligence, producing anthropomorphic and zoomorphic thinking- understanding animals and nature in terms of human capabilities, and human characteristics in terms of animal knowledge. Mithen points out that the capacity to cross domains, to develop concepts about concepts, is a normal condition of human thought, where representation of natural, social and physical environments involves integration of diverse domains of cognition. Hunter-gatherers think about the world in a highly integrated fashion, with an inter-penetration of natural and social world modules in a single integrated environment, and manifested in an ideology encompassing humans, animals, and plants in a living nature. The ability of the modern mind to integrate the different modules was through analogical thinking involving meta-representation, a process of the modules working together through representational redescription, a multiple representation of knowledge (Mithen 1996). The ability to map across domains is the foundation of human symbolic capacities (Hunt 1995). This analogical predication provides the basis for creative thought by either introducing new knowledge into domains, or by providing new ways of processing existing knowledge by integrating it within different cognitive domains. This meta- representation capability for recombination of knowledge and representation of knowledge across domains can be used to form representations of concepts and beliefs that the individual modules cannot form on their own. Mithen proposes that the integration of different modules was dramatically expanded by the transformation of the social language of early humans as language use about the non-social world began to infiltrate social discourse. The invasion of non-social information into social intelligence provided the basis for meta-representation (7) and an expansion for the "theory of mind module." Hie development of cognitive fluidity and greater recombination of thought was achieved by the application of social consciousness to the non-social world. Existing capabilities to reflect consciously upon information within the social domain as a basis for prediction of behavior of conspecifics could then be extended to other areas of knowledge that had previously operated within the cognitive unconsciousness. Mithen's proposed integration of the social language module into other domains of intelligence was preceded by the emergence of art and religious behavior tens of thousands of years prior to the cultural explosion around 40,000 bp. Artistic productions are not dependent upon language, or ideas expressed 66</page><page sequence="5">Journal of Ritual Studies 16 (2) 2002 through spoken language (cf., Humphrey 1998). Rather, art represents an imagetic presentational (Hunt 1995) analogical modality that can function in highly developed ways independent of language abilities. Indeed Mithen suggests that the first step in the evolution of cognitive fluidity involved the integration of social intelligence and natural history intelligence in early modern humans circa 100,000 bp. This would have provided the basis for animism, anthropomorphism, totemism and guardian spirit beliefs. The interpénétration of the different modules produces universais of religious thought: anthropomorphic thinking- attributing human mental and social characteristics to animals, including animism, applying mental models to spirits, animals and the unknown; totemism, applying natural history (animal species) models to the social domain; and the guardian spirit quest, applying animal and other natural history models to interpretation and differentiation of self. This suggests that the earliest art and religious artifacts and practices reflect the foundations of shamanism, which supported the production of integrative thought processes. This shamanic role in managing the integration of different modules is exemplified in shaman's skills in: natural history, being the master of the game animals; mind/self, exemplified in shifts in identity developed through animal familiars and guardian spirits; and social intelligence, being the leader of the group and mediator of intergroup relations. The shaman's activities involve processes existing prior to modern human cognition and language. Religious behavior and art were produced by integration across innate modules of the brain through the processes that already existed prior to modem language- mimesis and other forms of analogical thought. Mimesis and Cognition: The brain mechanisms and behaviors necessary for shamanic ritual are those described by Donald (1991) as a "mimetic controller," the foundation for a distinct form of cognition found in the episodic culture of hominids. Donald (1991,168-169) characterizes mimetic skill or mimesis as deriving from the ability to consciously produce intentional representations of the structure of events through their re-enactment. Mimesis usually incorporates mimicry and imitation to re-enact events or relationships, an invention or intentional representation. This form of human symbolic thinking that can operate independently of language is based in an innate generative module that produces uniquely human thought through mimesis, a form of analogy. This mimetic representational system is the basis of the first truly human culture according to Donald, and persisted as a fundamental communication and representational system in humans after the development of language. Donald suggests that the human mimetic cognitive capabilities of gesture, tool making, praxis, emotional expression, social intelligence, social roles and behavior represent a uniquely human but pre-linguistic level of cognitive development. Humans still use this mechanism for representational purposes which "form the expressive heart of human social interchange" and a superior form of representation for "modeling social roles, communicating emotions, and transmitting rudimentaiy skills" (Donald 1991:189, 198). The visuomotor domain, including facial expressions, gestures, postures and movements, provides the principal means through which mimesis is expressed. The mimetic expressions found in basic emotions are universal and constitute the most basic common aspects of human non-verbal communication. Mimesis is reflected in rhythmic abilities of drumming and dancing; a supramodal capability based on integration of visual and motor components (Donald 1991). Mimetic skills in generative, recursive intentional representations performed in group context, provided the basis for primitive group ritual. The presence of such group activities prior to the advent of the modem human cultural revolution circa 40,000 ypb indicates the prior presence of shamanism (cf. Winkelman 2002, forthcoming). 67</page><page sequence="6">Journal of Ritual Studies 16 (2) 2002 4 Metaphor and Analogical Thought in Religious Universais The construction of meaning is based upon non-analytical models, particularly analogue (8) processes which map relations between systems (Shore 1996). Analogical schematization occurs at a number of different cognitive levels, ranging from neural network behavior to complex structured macroprocesses. The fundamental role of shamanic thought in these foundational metaphoric processes is revealed in Friedrich's (1991) discussion of analogy and metaphor in the context of the broader concepts of tropes, where something represents something else. He characterizes five types of macrotropes (imagistic, modal, contiguity-based, formal, and analogical). Shamanic systems' universais are found in contiguity, modal and imagetic tropes that reflect underlying psychobiological structures and are central to the shamanic world view and practices. The body and its ability to act is the most fundamental analogue schema (Newton 1996, Hunt 1995, Laughlin 1997), manifesting analogic processes in mimesis, and exemplified in its metaphoric role in the shaman's soul journey or out-of-body experience. Contiguity tropes, principally those based upon the body and animals, are found throughout shamanic ritual and thought, exemplified in sympathetic magic, the out-of-body experience of soul flight, animal identity and transformation, and totemism. Modal tropes are concerned with expressions of mood, as well as their combination and interaction. Modal tropes function as deep organizing principles "rooted in a speaker's underlying emotions, affects, and feelings" (Friedrich 1991, 30-31). Modal tropes express the matrix of emotions that are at the basis of therapeutic action in shamanic ritual. The shaman's visionary experience exemplifies the use of imagery tropes. Noll (1985) has characterized "mental imagery cultivation," the deliberate development of the ability to induce enhanced mental imagery, as the central feature of shamanism, "which at its core is concerned with the techniques for inducing, maintaining and interpreting the experience of enhanced visual mental imagery" (1985, 445). The continuity with perception illustrates the point that imagery reflects levels of information processing involving "metaphoric predication" between domains of experience. These forms of information processing involve unconscious, non-volitional, affective, and psychophysiological levels (Noll 1985), enabling visual images to link the somatic and cognitive levels of the organism. This plays a central role in muscular control, with images driving the unconscious control centers of muscles and arousing the autonomic nervous system (Baars 1995). Uses of these different types of trope as forms of metaphoric predication are the foundations for a number of the universal aspects of religion and the foundations for the shamanic worldview and associated practices. This is illustrated in animism, totemism and spirit relations. Animism Animism, attributing mental qualities like those of humans to the unknown and natural phenomena, is exemplified in anthropomorphism, attributing human-like "mind" characteristics to gods, spirits, and nonhuman entities, particularly animals. Religion explains through anthropomorphizing, that is to say, offering the concept of human-like beings who provide the design and purpose to the observed phenomena of the universe. Spirits reflect specific human characterizations - identity, mind, intentions, and desires. The projection of human characteristics onto nature is a ubiquitous human practice found in all realms of life (Guthrie 1993, 1997). Guthrie suggests that the universal tendency for humans to conceive of other beings, events, and objects as being like themselves is based in an effort to make sure that we do not fail to respond to a human-like actor if necessary. An error in falsely attributing human characteristics is 68</page><page sequence="7">Journal of Ritual Studies 16 (2) 2002 less dangerous than failing to appropriately attribute characteristics of a human-like entity. Hence, humans attribute animistic anthropomorphic qualities to the unknown to assure addressing the most important contingencies, those with human-like capabilities of mind and intentionality. This basic concept of animism, the sense of other, also plays a fundamental role in the construction of consciousness. This is manifested in the use of the disembodied self as a model of the unknown other and concepts of self and agency (intentional actors). The sense of recognition of other, a felt presence, the sense of self in the unknown other, is a manifestation of the symbolic capabilities expressed in an attitude of openness towards the environment (Hunt 1995). Bird-David (1999) proposes an interpretation of animism from the perspectives of environmental and personhood theoiy which suggests it be seen as a relational epistemology. Bird-David suggests this relational mode is universal because perception requires that humans be situated in their world and environment, a form of relatedness. The animistic principles inherent in the concept of spirits are re-characterized as "super persons" who are constitutive of sharing relationships with the environment. This relationship is "critical to maintaining . . . identity because it is crucial to maintaining personhood" (1999, 73). The concepts and rituals used for maintaining these relationships with the environment, especially animal species, are also central to the maintenance of communal affairs and identity. Totemism- Animals in Social Representation Shamanic thought integrates other specialized modules with the natural history or intuitive biology module, which has specialized capacities for organizing knowledge about animals and recognizing "species essence." This ability to organize information about species essence provides a universal analogical system for creation and extension of meaning, based in classification schémas for the natural world (e.g., see Atran 1990). The metaphoric relationship between the social and natural history domains is found in totemism, in which humans and their groups are attributed characteristics derived from the natural world. Lévi-Strauss' (1962, 1967) analysis of totemism indicates that it involves human thought about its place in nature and a means of conceptualizing human differences and relations in terms of the models provided by the natural world.. Totemie thought involves analogical processes by which a homology is postulated between the differential features existing among species and the differences among human groups; as animal species differ, so do human groups. Differences among human groups are represented through the differences recognized among animals. This social and cognitive modeling with use of the animal world constitutes one of the most fundamental aspects of analogical thought, reflecting the metaphoric utilization of an innate module for natural history intelligence as a universal analogical system for creation, expression and extension of meaning. Spirits as Social Intelligence: Self, Other and Mind Another aspect of the natural history module in shamanistic activities involves the shaman incorporating animal spirits as part of identity and powers, often known as allies or guardian spirits. Typically, the animal has a personal spiritual relationship to an individual, an ally providing powers, strength, fortitude or good fortune. Guardian spirits play central psychosocial functions in empowering people. The guardian spirit quest was part of the transition to adulthood, a search for the charisma enabling the person to perform as a competent adult, guiding the individual in personal and social choices and examinations of the commitment to pursue a specific interests in life (Swanson 1973). This perspective illustrates the role of spirits not as external agents, but as aspects of one's self. 69</page><page sequence="8">Journal of Ritual Studies 16 (2) 2002 Spirits reflect one of the most important forms of self-representation embodied in shamanistic thought, that of the "sacred other" (Pandian 1997), derived from the intersection of the spiritual and social world. Pandian analyzes these religious phenomena in terms of cultural processes for identification of the cultural locus of the symbolic self. These systems serve a number of cognitive and social functions, including self models for the resolution of contradictions in broader systems of cultural meaning. These religious meaning systems include models for the representation, and hence development, of the self. These beliefs constitute the projective systems and norms for psychosocial relations which structure individual psychodynamics and collective patterns of behavior. Pandian characterizes the "shamanistic sacred self' as involving processes which provide protection from stress and anxiety. The phenomena of animism and the spiritual worlds of shamanism constitute models for self and society, and the management of emotions, attachments, explanations and other fundamentals of consciousness. These guardian spirits and "sacred others" constitute the basis for a social and relational epistemology as exemplified in two central aspects of social intelligence, one based upon social knowledge about conspecifics and the other based upon an ability to infer their mental states. This social intelligence of apes constitutes the most complex area of their natural activities. This specialized social intelligence has been referred to as Machiavellian, reflecting "cunning, deception and the construction of alliances and friendships pervasive in the life of many primates" (Mithen 1996, 81). This social intelligence reflects specific problems (9) group living creates for primates, facilitating group interaction by permitting a new level of mental processing based upon a "theory of mind." This enables an individual to predict others' behavior with an intuitive psychology for attribution of mental states to others. This theoiy of mind and "mind-reading" is based upon the organism's use of their own mind, as well as their feelings and behaviors in similar contexts, to model the minds of others and the behaviors they would likely produce. This ability to predict others' behavior entails social fore-thought and understanding, what Humphrey (1992) refers to as social intelligence. The ability to read others' minds constituted an essential basis for the maintenance of social cohesion and provided the basis for the transmission of other forms of knowledge. This constituted the basis for consciousness as "knowing with," knowledge shared with others. A fundamental role of shamanism in the manipulation of the social and the self modules is for producing alternate forms of self for social adaptation. The functional and adaptive benefits of such processes are illustrated by Waller (1996) and Scheff (1993). Waller suggests that "the sense of self' embedded within consciousness evolved to maintain problem-solving modules in an appropriate orientation to tasks and non-routine problems (10). Spirits and allies provide various command-control agents that can detect conflict and mediate decisions. These provide a basis for the development of ego and self, for mediation of social conflicts and balance among different instinctive agents. Spirit self structures mediate as higher order agents adjudicating a hierarchy of goals. Shamanistic healing developed traditions for constructing and manipulating a variety of selves for psychological and social integration. The extremely diverse forms of self and personal identity found cross-culturally within shamanistic systems illustrate this polysémie representation of human identity. Shamanistic practices involving animism, totemism, anthropomorphism and possession provide symbolic systems within which the self is constituted in interactional symbolic relationships with others. The Shamanic Integration of Consciousness. A natural result of the evolution of the human brain and its modular structures is the fragmentation of consciousness (Laughlin et al. 1992), reflecting both the increasing modularity of consciousness and the diversification of self. Shamanic traditions institutionalized procedures to overcome the biological diversification and conditioned fragmentation of consciousness and cognition through traditions using ASC to induce integrative processes. Shamanism 70</page><page sequence="9">Journal of Ritual Studies 16 (2) 2002 contributed to this integrative cognition through the systemic neurophysiological and psychophysiological effects of ASC which produce integrative brain states (Winkelman 1986b, 1992, 1996, 2000). These integrative potentials of shamanism were part of the rapid expansion of culture in modern Homo sapiens sapiens during the Middle/Upper Paleolithic transition. Shamanism played a central role in social integration through linkages among resource stress, community, and intercommunity alliances (Hayden 1987; Winkelman, 2002). Shamanistic rituals to contribute to human survival through intensification and enhancement of interpersonal bonding, within-group cohesion and interband alliances. The sense of unity and pan-human identity widely associated with ASC experiences contributed to development of strong emotional bonds between bands who shared shamanistic rituals. Such interband alliances were vital to survival in times of resource scarcity. 5 Mechanisms of Shamanic Healing Laughlin et al. (1992) suggest that shamanic healing practices involve two basic principles- a holistic imperative, a drive toward more integrated levels of consciousness; and shamanic projection- positively projecting a more advanced state of development into another person, based on the unconscious transference of control of the individual's intentional processes to a powerful individual. They suggest that shamanistic practices engaged this drive toward wholeness and more integrated levels of consciousness through use of external symbols of cultural psychodynamics to engage transformative process. Shamanic ASC entrain neurocognitive structures, provoking a restructuring of the self at levels below conceptual and operational thought, and producing psychodynamic transformation and growth and social integration. Siikala (1978) analyzes the shamanic seance as a dramatic process of self-transformation for the patient through reciprocal communication with the spirit world (cf. Dow [1986] and Kirmayer [1993] on symbolic healing). Role taking techniques create intrapsychic and psychosocial communication through symbolic representations in the spirit world, altering relationships between self and social world, and producing a psychological balance and integration at social, affective and physiological levels. Therapeutic bases for shamanistic healing also derive from psychobiological dynamics of ASC, the relaxation response and other physiological changes that activate serotonergic action, endogenous opioids, and the paleomammalian brain. Paleomammalian brain processes are manipulated in shamanistic rituals' effects upon emotions, attachments, and sense of self, eliciting social bonding and a sense of conviction. Brain patterns characteristic of ASC involve an activation of the limbic system and paleomammalian brain structures and processes, producing integrated discharges across the neuraxis and a parasympathetic dominant state, the relaxation response (Winkelman 1992, 2000). The relaxation response counteracts excessive activity of the sympathetic nervous system, and has preventive and therapeutic value in diseases characterized by excessive sympathetic nervous system activity and stress induced and exacerbated maladies (Benson 1974, Benson and Stark 1996). Therapeutic effects may also be achieved through the precipitous and stressful collapse into a parasympathetic dominant state, leading to erasure of previously conditioned responses, changes in beliefs, loss of memories, and increased suggestibility. Shamanistic ASC receive corroboration of their therapeutic effectiveness from laboratory and clinical studies on the effects and use of hallucinogens as therapeutic agents and clinical research on meditation's effectiveness as a therapeutic modality (see Winkelman 2000). Shamanistic activities manage relationships between physiological and mental levels of the organism, using ASC and other 71</page><page sequence="10">Journal of Ritual Studies 16 (2) 2002 procedures to alter the interrelation among brain systems and their functions. These involve direct interventions in the brain's neurotransmitter systems. Central to the effects of shamanic ASC are activations of the serotonergic neurotransmitter system, exemplified in the effects of psychointegrators (hallucinogens or psychedelics) (Winkelman 1996) and meditation (Walton and Levitsky 1994). Serotonin acts as a modulatory system across all levels of the brain and affects many other neurotransmitters. Central to serotonergic effects are the integration of emotional and motivational processes and the synthesis of information across the functional levels of the brain. These conditions provide a basis for shamanic healing processes. Some shamanic ASC mechanisms produced social bonding and healing through the direct stimulation of endogenous opiate production (e.g., pain, extensive activity; see Frecska and Kulscar 1989, Prince 1982, Winkelman 1997, 2000). Ceremonial opioid release is also precipitated by cultural symbols which have been cross-conditioned with physiological, emotional, and cognitive responses, eliciting the endocrine and immunological systems (Frecska and Kulcsar 1989). Endogenous opioids facilitate social attachment and bonding through opioid action upon psychological processes, promoting regression and enhancing bonding through reducing ego boundaries. The brain areas involved in affiliative interactions and social bonding are also the areas with the highest density of opioid receptors. Frecska and Kulcsar suggest these socially and ritually manipulated opioid mechanisms constitute a means of influencing core biological functions and producing psychobiological synchrony among group members. The opioids also stimulate the immune system, providing a basis for multiple mechanisms of healing. 6 Conclusions Shamanism and universais of religion are derived from the cross-modal analogic and psychophysiological integration of specialized brain modules and enhanced metaphoric representation through mimetic integration. Shamanism utilizes the modules that provide for perceptions of "others," their intentionalities ("mind reading"), and animal species essence. Shamanic conceptual systems are the products of cross- modal integration of these innate modules, producing new forms of representations through metaphor. This constituted the basis for a major evolution in human cognition and helps explain the evolution of the modern human thought tens of thousands of years after the emergence of anatomically modern humans. The psychobiological basis underlying the cross-cultural regularities in shamanic practices provided a universal primordial religion and an ethnological analogy for reconstruction and interpretation of pre- histórica! cultural processes. Shamanic psychophysiological integration provided a basis for healing processes. The shaman's practices provided an integration of the different aspects of self through ritually affecting biologically based operations of consciousness, producing integrative brain conditions. Shamanic ASC induce interhermispheric integration, frontal-limbic integration, brain stem-limbic-frontal integration, and integration across the neuraxis. These conditions have numerous adaptive consequences, including enhancement of representation, healing, stress reduction and information integration, especially in visionary experiences and visual imagery. Shamans operated on a number of specialized structures of consciousness, including the innate module domains: in language, being the holders of the first or ancient sacred languages; in natural history, being the master of the game animals and guiding hunting; in social intelligence, being the leader of the group; and in personal development, providing for individuation and integration of self and identity. 72</page><page sequence="11">Journal of Ritual Studies 16 (2) 2002 Endnotes 1 . I thank David Whitley and Stewart Guthrie for their suggestions for clarifying the ideas presented here. 2. These diverse processes induce similar changes in brain psychophysiology (Winkelman 1986b, 2000). 3. Neurognosis reflects a physiological perspective on knowledge capacities. "Neurognosi s consists of prepared pathways of neural connections specializing in sensory input, information storage, association and retrieval, and motor output, as well as systemic maintenance and many other functions" (Laughlin et al. 1992, 73). "[N]eurognosis canalizes the processes of perceptual discrimination, motor activity, and conceptual and symbolic differentiation and association [and] ... the type and complexity of cognition of which the individual or the species is capable" (Laughlin et al. 1992, 61). 4. See Fodor's The Modularity of the Mind and Gardener's Frames of Mind: the theory of multiple intelligences. Gardener postulates the following innate intelligences: bodily-kinesthetic, spatial, a personal intelligence for looking in at one's own mind, a module for understanding others, linguistic, musical, and logical-mathematical skills. 5. Visual symbols are central to the evolution of thought. Visual symbols have specific properties (e.g., execution of preconceived mental template, intentional communication, and meaning attribution) that existed among early humans, but were not used to produce art because these distinctive cognitive domains were not integrated (Mithen). The interpretation of animal marks (e.g., footprints) indicates the presence of cognitive processes similar to those by which modern humans interpret meaning from other humans' signals or marks; however, early humans did not leave evidence of using this capability for symbolic expression. 6. These early representations of animals illustrate the ability to integrate a high degree of technical expertise with a highly developed and intricate knowledge of the natural world, specifically animal anatomies. These artistic tools for thinking about the natural world provided important storage of information, particularly relevant to long term and seasonal variations in animal behavior and teaching and devising hunting plans (Mithen). 7. This transference of the original function of language for social relations to other domains reflects processes of metaphorical extension of the social world to discourse about physical objects. This introduction of non-social information into social intelligence through language provided selective advantages for those who could make use of this information (e.g., in enhanced tool making, hunting, mate competition, and care of offspring) and led to a rapid evolution of a general purpose language (Mithen). 8. Johnson-Laird (1983) proposed three basic innate human mental models used as mechanisms for representation: propositional models based upon analytical logic; and analogical representations manifested in images and mental models. The mental models represent structural analogues of the world, with images as perceptual correlates. 9. These social processes include a balance of competitive and cooperative relations, mate and food competition, spatial and sleeping locations within the group, and a wide range of alliance, playing, and grooming behaviors. This produces a need for cognitive skills for both cooperation and successful competition within one's social group. 10 Intelligent behavior depends upon combining serial analytical and the intuitive parallel processes. Agents may interact in serial, parallel and simultaneous relations. The ability to act and relate simultaneously provides a basis for intuitive solutions to problems and enhances intelligent behavior through contingent associations. Human interaction and inter-relationships are inherently ambiguous since meaning is contextually dependent, requiring an open system. Contingency provides the base for total association, moving from a closed to an open system. REFERENCES Atran, S. 1990 Cognitive Foundations of Natural History. New York: Cambridge University Press.
