Néanmoins , à partir de ce que l'on peut inférer des vases eux-mêmes, il est parfois possible de reconstruire une chaîne de décisions menant à la solution d'un problème spécifiquement esthétique , permettant ainsi de commencer à définir le rôle de chacun des différents participants (patrons, administrateurs des chantiers, dessinateurs/fondeurs. ..) àia manufacture de ces objets. En suivant ce parcours, on arrive à prendre le pouls de la créativité des artistes à l'époque Shang et à comprendre les intentions et l'imagination artistiques qui se manifestent dans les œuvres subsistantes de cette époque. Cet article illustre cette méthodologie par plusieurs exemples. Looking over the vast panorama of the visual arts in China, one is bound to register a profound asymmetry. On the one hand, one is faced with a minority of paintings, calligraphies, and some other objects attributed to historically known artistic personalities; on the other, there is a vast majority of images, artifacts, and monuments created by anonymous artisans. The same asymmetry is also very much in evidence in critical value judgments. Even though bronzes, jades, ceramics and other anonymous works have been eagerly collected, admired and treated as "art" in the West for more than a century, it is above all the paintings and calligraphy of famous artists that Western art historians have hailed as the real, supreme, creative achievements. This mirrors long-standing Chinese elite habits. As is well known, in premodern China, the literati scholar-officials largely defined their sense of self through their status as creative personalities, insisting that their œuvre stood in sharp contrast to the products of subaltern professional artisans and craftsmen (gong X). Paintings and calligraphies by literati, considered to be xinyin p - imprints of the heart or images of the mind - were admired and valued as projections of the creative mind and expressions of the quality of an individual character. The traditional, lineage-based hagiographie histories of Chinese art only mention identifiable artists and their works and thus - as Wen Fong has noted - render unattributed, anonymous works virtually invisible to art history.1 A centerpiece of literati aesthetics, this notion of an absolute contrast between works by individual artists and anonymous works has not only determined the traditional perception of the arts in China, but it has proven remarkably resilient and continues to exert its influence on the modern Western public's attitudes towards Chinese art. 1.

Cahiers d'Extrême-Asie 17 (2008) : 17-49</page><page sequence="2">18 Ladislav Kesner The aesthetic doctrine of the literati with its concept of painting and calligraphy as an imprint of the mind has definite affinities with the Western cult of artistic personality, which began to evolve during the early Renaissance, escalated during the post-Enlightenment period, and was finally shaped into our modernist ideal of an artist-genius who, unconstrained by tradition or conventions (and often in conflict with social norms) fulfills his unique vision. It is worth remembering that the Western understanding and appreciation of Chinese art rapidly increased during the first decades of the twentieth century, just as modern art and modernist artistic ideology were reaching their peak. It was only in the Euro-American culture of the twentieth century that many kinds of Chinese visual objects, detached from their original purposes and associations, came to be accepted as "art." Presented in exhibition after exhibition, bronzes, jades, Buddhist sculpture, and other cultural products have been enthusiastically appreciated as being manifestations of great art in China by Western viewers - who, ironically, have tended to be somewhat hesitant to grant a similarly elevated status to the so-called "minor arts" of the West.2 We shall leave aside, but not without having raised it, the hard question of whether this is a case where cultural distance has enabled a welcome breaking-up of problematic categorizations, or whether the Western openness to non-canonical art forms in a Chinese setting is in reality an unreflected remnant of nineteenth-century attitudes of superiority toward the exotic. Unsurprisingly, at any rate, under the lingering influence of traditional literati aesthetics, coupled with the widespread modernist cult of individuality and originality, as well as a postmodern cult of artistic celebrity, the Western public's notions of value and creativity in Chinese art continue to be rather uncritically associated with the personalities of famous identified artists, and the real significance of creative solutions and innovations in objects made in large series by anonymous persons is often undervalued or overlooked. This paradoxical state of affairs is perpetuated even in those current academic writings that ambitiously strive for new assessments of the visual arts in China. For instance, Wu Hung considers " the most important event in Chinese art history " to have been: the appearance of individual artists during the post- Han era who transformed public monumental art into their private idiom. Before this moment, what we call works of art, whether a bronze vessel or a stone shrine, served a direct function in religious and political life; their creation was generally mobilized by the desire to make religious and political concepts concrete. They were made by anonymous craftsmen through collective efforts, and major changes in subject matter and style were determined, first of all, by broad social and religious movements [...].3 2. Witness, as a typical statement of this kind, words of the director of a leading Western art museum in the introduction to a catalogue of one such exhibition: "Such bronzes display the incredible range of inventive genius of the ancient Chinese, who successfully combined art and industry to form one of the most accomplished and enduring works of art the world knows 1 (Philippe de Mon- tebello in Wen Fong (ed.), The Great Bronze Age of China [New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1980], ix). 3. Wu Hung, Monumentality in Early Chinese Art and Architecture (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1995), 14.</page><page sequence="3">Creative Personality and the Creative Act in the Anonymous Art of China 1 9 Works belonging to what Wu calls a "ritual art tradition" were created by "anonymous craftsmen whose individual creativity was generally subordinated to larger cultural conventions [..J"4 Such formulations give a new lease on life to the dogma of superiority of indi- vidual expression, embodied in the work of a named (preferably famous) creator, over the product of an anonymous artisan or workshop. Moreover, the assertion that in visual objects that were created for rituals or motivated by religious or other social functions, "major changes in subject matter and style were determined by broad social and religious movements," is quite misleading in its own right. Attrib- uting the work of art and its respective position within a series of related objects to impersonal ritual, religious, or social forces merely postpones the task of accounting for its creation in terms of human agency. The received view, according to which art objects in China, before the appearance of individual painter-calligraphers in the early Six Dynasties period, were products of their general ritual or social conditions, or of some supracollective mentality, is actually based on a limited and culturally determined concept of creativity and artistic inventiveness. It ignores the dynamics and inner mechanisms through which changes could be made within the earlier traditions, and gives up on the possibility of recognizing individual creative solu- tions reached by the participants in these traditions. What is needed, therefore, is a view of anonymous artistic traditions in China that is not compromised by the deeply-seated prejudice about the superiority of the "free" creative gesture of an identifiable artist; in other words, a concept that is not deformed by the expressionist aesthetic ideology of Chinese literati and Western modernism. Even where there was no concept of artistic personality and autographic style, the very real involve- ment of creative personality (or personalities) is inherent to the works of art and their often exceptional solutions to artistic problématiques.5 Over the past decades, connoisseurship and archaeological theory have developed methods for recognizing and defining individual makers of crafted objects, especially for evaluating those aspects of style that refer to the variability of individual produc- tion.6 Scholars of ancient art, as well as medievalists, sometimes assign anonymous works of art to specific workshops or even to unknown individual masters. Such analytical individuals, usually named after a characteristic stylistic feature recognizable in the corpus of the work attributed to them, have been proposed also in the art of ancient China. For instance, Robert Poor was able to single out a group of late Shang (Anyang-period 5£rB§) bronzes with important shared features and proposed that 4. Ibid., 27 9-80. 5. The distinction between the conceptions of artistic personality and the reality of personality in a work of art was underscored in a seminal paper by the Czech aesthetician Jan Mukařovský. See his "Personality in Art," in John Burbank and Peter Steiner (ed.), Structure, Sign and Func- tion: Selected Essays by Jan Mukařovský (Yale Russian and East European Studies 14, New Haven: Yale University Press, 1977 [originally published 1944]). 6.

However, rather than the act of pinpointing specific authorship, it is the very recognition of exceptional creative solutions that matters. Two interrelated questions stand out: How can such exceptional solutions be recognized and assessed in an anonymous work of art? And what can be gathered about the nature of intentionality and the creative act in anonymous art? Technological and Cognitive Processes: Prescriptive Process and the Modular- ity of Production Admittedly, such questions are not prompted by all anonymous works of art with equal force. An unassuming ding ritual vessel from Tomb GM2065 at Anyang (fig. 1), featuring the common decorative scheme of three taotie monster masks, is in every respect an "ordinary" bronze vessel, and it would be perceived above all as a product of the Anyang tradition of bronze casting, an outcome of a long technological, aesthetic, and cognitive evolution.8 Its shape can be ultimately traced (via pre-Anyang bronzes) to late Neolithic ceramic vessels, and its theriomorphic imagery has a resemblance (if not a direct reference) to structurally analogous motifs on the jade carvings of East Coast Neolitihic cultures. Metallurgie technology had been evolving over several centuries by the time this ding was made, and the relevant knowledge had been transmitted from one generation of casters to the next. Such a vessel can thus be legitimately seen as the cumulative product of the acquired knowledge, experience, and sensitivity of generations of artisans and their patrons. No matter how technologically sophisticated and aesthetically advanced in its own right, it remains as just one entity in a vast ensemble of very similar objects and does not seem to raise the issue of artistic creativity particularly strongly. With such an object, encased as it is within a dense replicatory series, it is exceedingly difficult to isolate moments of major creative events and specific innovations. These are much more amenable to analysis in the case of works that visibly depart from their position in a typological series by manifesting innovation or by constituting aesthetically, functionally, or technologically remarkable achievements. Considered as an index of its own making, a work of art points to two inter- related sets of events: the production nexus - that is, the sum of technological procedures and organizational principles characteristic of a given medium - and, to some degree, the specific decisions taken by concrete (known or unknown) individuals operating within a given production nexus, decisions that sometimes may lead to innovation. In the actual practice of image- and object-making, of course, the latter aspect is necessarily nested within the former, as even the most 7.

But analytically, these two aspects can be decoupled, as has indeed been done in several major scholarly works investigating the production processes of early Chinese works of art. Decades of research, and new archeological finds of remnants of foundries and workshops, have brought about a detailed understanding of bronze vessel casting, as well as of the manufacturing of pottery figures, lacquerware, and other types of objects. In the present brief treatment I shall focus on the production of ritual bronzes. The uncovering of the complexities of foundry production in ancient China opened ways for understanding the technological and organizational matrix underlying bronze casting. Ursula Franklin described section-mold casting as an instance of a normative or prescriptive process, which consists of a sequence of pre-ordered and</page><page sequence="6">22 Ladislav Kesner normalized procedures. Each of these units requires a special skill, thus encouraging professional specialization. Such a prescriptive process fosters standardization and predictability, which necessarily affects and channels innovation. Franklin notes that: The formalization of a prescriptive process has a profound influence on the direction of subsequent development and experimentation [...]. The feedback loop between trying and finding out is long and indirect, since changes in one of the unit processes will affect all other units in the production system.9 In particular, coordination and control were required in order to manage the enormous logistic challenges inherent in the production of bronze vessels. As explained by Lothar Ledderose in his important book Ten Thousand Things , many types of Chinese art objects, including bronzes, were assembled from pre- fabricated modules, the use of which enabled the production of large quantities of objects.10 Ledderose's analysis draws from various technologies related to specific media and their underlying organizational principles. His conception of modularity moreover makes some steps towards localizing the cognitive foundation of Chinese artistic technologies, seeing module-based production as an instance of Chinese cognitive style. "Indeed, the devising of module systems seems to conform to a distinctly Chinese pattern of though t" writes Ledderose.11 While the essentialism implied in such a formulation is troubling and perhaps the weakest part of an otherwise wonderfully illuminating book, Ledderose nevertheless points to an issue of major importance, namely whether (and if so, how) it is possible to penetrate beneath the character- ization of production processes at the level of the technological-social enterprise to the level of intentionality and thus to the cognitive foundations of creativity. Franklin's and Ledderose's conceptualizations of the processes through which anonymous works were created have immeasurably advanced our understanding of early Chinese art and technology. At the same time, however, precisely by drawing attention to the "anti- individualist" aspects of artistic endeavor, they may have in fact provided new ammunition to the attitudes contrasting anonymous arts with 9.

Lothar von Falkenhausen in his detailed review of the book rightly points out the difficulty or impossibility of defining the cultural specificity of Chinese art in terms of a mediation of artistic creativity through module use (Artibus Asiaey 60.2 [2000] , 342-44). Elsewhere, I have pointed to other problems implicit in this essentialist view (Ladislav Kesner, "Is the truly global art history possible?," in James Elkins (ed.), Is Art History Globali [London and New York: Routledge, 2007], 94-95.)</page><page sequence="7">Creative Personality and the Creative Act in the Anonymous Art of China 23 works by famous masters and subordinating individual creative acts to an overarching technological matrix. The nature of the factory production involved in the manu- facture of bronzes, funerary sculpture, lacquerware, and other anonymous objects, collides head-on with the widespread notion of "artistic freedom" and individual- ity as an essential prerequisite of exceptional creative acts and artistic quality. The issue at stake can be well illustrated by a passage from Anthony Barbieri-Low's recent excellent book on the social history of artisans in early China. Concluding his account of a famous lamp in the shape of a servant girl unearthed from Tomb 2 at Mancheng (Hebei) /^jfcjļgļ®, the tomb of Dou Wan the wife of the Han dynasty King of Zhongshan ťlLí Liu Sheng gijļļ§ (d. 113 BC), he writes: "Far from a unique masterpiece of artistic genius, the Changxin [-itfg] lamp was actually a mass- produced, decorative palace item based on modular design', adding that " such knowledge should not detract from our ultimate appreciation of the artifact but should enhance it."12 I suspect, however, that presenting such an object as a product of mass production based on modular design and made in a collective effort (which it undoubtedly was) will precisely detract most viewers from the need to recognize the scope and significance of the creative solutions that made this lamp (and its possibly numerous contemporary pendants) remarkable technological feats and aesthetic masterpieces. The problem can be formulated as follows: if a Changxin lamp - or a Shang bronze vessel, or any other specific work of anonymous art - can be seen as an index of the process of its making (in the sense of general production principles), then do these works also indicate the microscale of specific creative decisions through which they were made? And if so, how? Answering this question will first require a consideration of the kinds of creative endeavors involved. The Composite Nature of Intention and Creativity Taking ritual vessels of the early Bronze Age as an example, I would like to begin by briefly examining the composite nature of artistic intentionality involved in the production of anonymous works of art. It has been estimated that foundry operations in Anyang directly involved upwards of 100 individuals.13 In addition, extensive manpower was required for mining and smelting ores, transportation, fuel gathering, and other related operations. Among foundry workers, a consider- able professional stratification, corresponding likely to a social hierarchy, must have existed. Within a prescriptive process, some steps (such as the drawing of imagery into the mold, or designing the shape of the vessel) required a high degree of spe- 12.

David N. Keightley, "The Temple Artisans of Ancient China: Part One: The Kung And To-Kung of Shang," (unpublished mimeographed paper), 1970.</page><page sequence="8">24 Ladislav Kesner cialized knowledge and expertise, but such expertise does not include only those working directly in the foundry. A finished vessel embodies three aspects of creative undertaking: technological-aesthetic, organizational-logistical and something that for lack of a better term we might call semantic. In the genesis of a ritual bronze, those making the most aesthetically consequential decisions, e.g. modifying the structure of the vessel, or drawing an ornament into the mold, probably did not wield decisive control over the whole process of its casting. That is, the mental and physical acts that shaped a vessel and its imagery (and which would approximate our notion of the work of the "artist") were in all probability separated from the coordinating and supervising function of the foundry production. Indirect evidence for this is provided by the inscriptions on late Zhou and Han objects, which sug- gest that the role of the supervisor/production manager (shi S5) of a workshop was distinct from that of the artisan-craftsman (gong X).14 Passages in Kaogongji #X IB ("Notes on Examining Craftsmen"), a third century BC manual, also attest the fact that the work of casters and other professional craftsmen was coordinated by special bureaucrats in charge of production.15 From the point of view of achieving the desired result - supplying patrons with a requisite set of objects of adequate quality - the logistic-bureaucratic creativ- ity necessary for coordinating the flow of materials, workforce and other aspects of organization, was as important as the technological know-how and aesthetic sensibility discernible in the shapes of the vessels and in the expressive images adorning their surfaces. Furthermore, given the central significance of these objects in Shang society and the enormous economic resources their production required, it can be surmised that at least in the case of some vessels, or series of vessels, the entire process of their genesis included the creative contribution of a patron (either a member of an elite lineage in person, or some ritual specialist acting on his/her behalf) who personally visited the foundry and selected the specific variants of shapes and decorative motifs, or otherwise participated in specifying the structure, morphology, and stylistic rendering of a particular decorative scheme - in some cases perhaps even of an individual motif.16 14.

Chang Kwang-chih, Shang Civilization (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1980), 230-233. David Keightley has studied the duogong ^X ("many workers") identi- fied in oracle bone inscriptions, but he admits that there is no certain way to link them with the artisans who produced bronzes. It is unclear whether the term refers to artisans, supervisors or perhaps both. He also notes that no divination record about the royal handicraft industries has been found (David N. Keightley, art. cit.). 16. Since the issue of significance of the decor is not directly relevant to my purpose here, I will leave it aside. For views on this problem see Ladislav Kesner, "The Taotie Reconsidered: Meanings and Functions of Shang Theriomorphic Imagery " Artibus Asiae, 51.1/2 (1991), 29-53; and the contributions in Roderick Whitfield (ed.), The Problem of Meaning in Early Chinese Ritual Bronzes (Colloquies on Art and Archaeology in Asia, No. 15, London: Percival David Foundation of Chinese Art, 1993).</page><page sequence="9">Crea tive Personality and the Crea tive Act in the Anonymous Art of China 25 Thus three aspects of creative processes were involved in producing an excep- tional vessel: the contribution of the senior artisan/designer, that of the foundry coordinator/supervisor, and that of a patron. Each of these three roles could of course be fulfilled by either one or several persons. In the absence of any kind of documentary evidence, we can only speculate on the most interesting aspect, the nature of interaction between these parties. For instance, what was the medium of communication through which concepts were transmitted among them? Was some kind of graphic or written notation involved? Or was there merely an extensive and implicit visual comparison with the preceding products of the foundry? We have to leave such issues open, noting however, that in cases of major commissions (individual vessels and especially sets of vessels), the creative activity embodied in their production must have comprised, minimally, the following kinds of traffic in mental representations among designers, patrons, and, perhaps, supervisors: the formulation and subsequent refinement of the commission; the fixing, mentally and perhaps in graphic form, of the shapes and images corresponding to the commis- sion; and the translation of the resulting mental model into a set of demands for resources and labor organization, leading to the determination of a series of clearly defined steps for the production of each object. Such communication principally involved the three main players specified, but also, for each of them, a circle of collaborators and peers. A master artisan-designer, for instance, would have been acting in intense dialogue with other senior crafts- men working in the foundry and, perhaps, with colleagues at other foundries. Likewise, we can assume an exchange at the level of coordinators/supervisors, as well as among patrons (the king advised by his ritual specialists, a patron discussing his preferences with his/her peers, etc.). The artistic intentionality was thus spread over innumerable nodes in the production nexus, encompassing all those involved, with communication at a micro-scale within and among each of the three circles of patrons, designers, and supervisors often contributing towards the intentional decisions of these three principal players. In the case of products that can be termed "ordinary" - that is, originating as part of a more or less standardized assemblage - one naturally envisages a relatively small amount of such communication and the virtually exclusive involvement of the artisan without much specific interference from supervisors and patrons. It must be stressed that the notion advanced here of the joint agency of artisans and others acting within a production nexus is different from viewing anonymous art as a collective enterprise, because it helps to articulate the key players and their specific contributions. After all, the typical individual artist in both China and the West likewise painted, sculpted, or drew within a network of patrons, peers, and other players, who were in some way or other involved in his allegedly individual creation of "high art." Understanding at least the bare skeleton of the framework of intentionality involved in bronze casting leads to a useful perspective on the often-mentioned issue of artistic freedom. There is a long-standing tradition of emphasizing the lack of freedom of bronze artisans. Fifty years ago, Bernhard Karlgren wrote: " The late Yin art was not the product of free artistic creative power [ . .7-" Shang artisans, according to Karlgren, were " working in the straight-jacket of a system of rigid laws</page><page sequence="10">26 Ladislav Kesner Such views are echoed in more recent writings, for instance in Robert Thorp's claim that "The artisans who labored in the stifling heat of a foundry were not, in any meaningful sense, free to create or not to create as they chose."1* Criticizing Karlgren for recognizing only two antithetical possibilities of either an absolutely free artist or rigidly constrained technician, Alexander Soper argued for a middle ground, whereby the Shang artist " had some freedom of action and could choose as he saw fit, not haphazardly, but in deference to principles of aesthetic propriety"19 At the other extreme, to Max Loehr, the ritual bronzes were first and foremost products of artistic consciousness: [...] the apparent logic in the 'evolution' of the shapes indicates that within tradition - the workshop tradition of techniques and models - there existed the masters freedom to make changes on purely formal grounds, counseled by artistic intelligence alone, without interference from the outside.20 Perhaps not surprisingly, the newly understood complexities of bronze produc- tion process are also seen as severely limiting the scope of creative activity. Thus Lothar Ledderose suggests that: Implementing module systems also required enormous sacrifices.... Indeed, module systems are bound to curtail the personal freedom of the makers of objects, and the owners and users. Modular systems engender unbending restraints on society.21 And with respect to bronze casting specifically, Ledderose writes of "limited room for creativity open to a designer": Only in exceptional cases was an artisan asked to modify a traditional type. Normally he had to operate within a tight framework, and the means employed to fill a given com- partment became his major concern [...]. Even in filling compartments the freedom of the designer was constrained [...]. 22 To be sure, the nature of prescriptive and modular processes modified and partly channeled the means through which individual creativity could have been manifested. However, the notion of "freedom" (or the lack thereof) in this context is little more 17.

Let me explain. First, with regard to the realm of social relationships, we can take for granted that even the foundry masters and shi supervisors (much like other ritual specialists) were ultimately subject to the coercive power of the king or the highest elites.23 However, socio-political status does not in any way correlate with the ways in which an agent involved in creation of material objects goes about exercising his/ her competence. A comparison with an example of the prototypically "free" artistic subject in Chinese art, the literati painter, comes readily to mind. As new scholar- ship focused on the social milieu of literati artists has amply demonstrated,24 the social rules and economic obligations under which literati painters operated were no less stifling and, from the point of view of the creative solutions reached, often no less constraining than those faced by anonymous craftsmen working for a king or state-sponsored cult (Ledderose has pointed out that literati painting, as well, was highly modular).25 Moreover, it is being realized that the supreme authority of the Shang royal elite depended to a large extent on the communication with dead ancestors and on the iterative symbolic display of their power - activities in which bronze vessels played a crucial role. It would follow that the functioning and legitimacy of the political apparatus depended to a considerable extent on elite control over a highly skilled workforce that, by creating various symbolic forms, upheld the ritual practices sustaining its authority. Conceivably, thus, shi supervisors and senior artisans could acquire and maintain considerable power by accumulating, concentrating, and eventually monopolizing their highly specialized knowledge and their control over the processes and outcomes of artifact production.26 Second, the notion that the demands of patrons exert a negative influence and curtail the creative freedom of the image makers is only a modernist delusion to which many today still unwittingly subscribe. The fact that anonymous art was not a self-conscious realization of artistic personality, but instead was the result 23. Kwang-chih Chang (Shang Civilization , 233) interprets the remains of a ground house and rammed earth foundations found in one of the foundry sites at Anyang as a sign of the relatively high social status of bronze masters. An important recent study of the Anyang bronze workshops is Li Yung- ti, "The Anyang Bronze Foundries: Archaeological Remains, Casting Technology, and Production organization," Ph. d. dissertation (Harvard University), 2003.

Whitney Davis has presented an analogous model of the relationship of artists and elites in ancient Egypt. He explains how "the rational interests of artisan-specialists had to be seen to coincide with those of the aspiring elite" and concludes that invariance in form and production was the means by which an Egyptian craftsman maintained his status as a specialist.

For all we know, casters, at least in cases of some vessels of assemblages, might have responded to very specifically formulated commissions. But even though the patrons' demands and the regimentation of production may have been relatively strict - perhaps indeed severely constraining from the vantage point of a modernist conception of artistic work and authorship - it was ultimately always up to the designer to create an acceptable solution in the artistic medium of his/her expertise. Robert Bagley thus rightly notes that the Shang caster "saw possibilities , not limitations"21 Two Case Studies Returning to our earlier question of how creative solutions can be recognized in anonymous work of art, we shall now look at some specific examples. Let us begin with a bronze bu S (also transcribed as pou ) vessel in the National Gallery in Prague datable to the time of transition from the Erligang ZlH to the Anyang period (fig. 2). It neither belongs to one of the most frequently encountered vessel types, nor is it a truly exceptional piece of craftsmanship. To bronze enthusiasts and connoisseurs, it will nevertheless embody the supreme achievements of Shang bronze casting, while to the less experienced viewer it may well merely represent an archeological specimen that does not bespeak the presence of an exceptional artistic consciousness and therefore need not attract attention as being a great work of art. In order to isolate any significant creative acts embodied in such an object, we need to consider it in conjunction with its predecessors and successors in a typological lineage; in other words, we must view its creation as one event within a series of interrelated events. This particular bronze has several closely related counterparts: a bu in the Sackler Gallery of Art, Smithsonian Institution (V-380; fig. 3), another in the National Palace Museum in Taipei and at least three vessels excavated from documented tombs at Anyang, Tomb 188 at Xiaotun /Jvtï, Tomb WKGM1 at Wuguancun ÄÜfi (fig- 4), and Tomb 663 at Dasikongcun (fig. 5).28 All of them share an identical shape (with rounded shoulder) and proportions, similar dimensions (their height ranging between 16.9 and 18.5 cm) and, most importantly, the same arrangement of the decorative scheme, which consists of a geometric pat- 27.

This group of bu also has more distant relatives, such as a substantially larger bu with an analogous decoration scheme in the Senoku Hakkokan (Sumitomo collection) in Kyoto (fig. 6), but we shall not address them here.29 The six bu of this group differ in the details of their execution, e.g. with respect to the motifs on the belly and shoulder, and especially the geometric pattern adorn- ing the foot. On the Sackler, Wuguancun, and Taipei vessels, the foot carries a band of recumbent barbed C-shapes, which are either simply repeated or (in the case of the Taipei vessel) alternatively rendered in inverted positions. In the same position, the Prague and Dasikongcun bu display two versions of a very rare pat- tern consisting of a succession of rectangular enclosures with sunken parallel lines terminating in hooks and curls, a motif that is only documented in one or two other Shang bronzes. Detailed comparison further reveals minute idiosyncrasies in how this motif is executed on each of the two vessels - slight differences concerning the positions and execution of the hooks and coils protruding from their parallel 29.

Visibly more pronounced are differences on the bu excavated from Tomb 188 at Xiaotun, which is dated to the time before the Shang capital was moved to Anyang; its upper frieze is inhabited by a vaguely zoomorphic configuration, which appears more bird-like than dragon-like and seems to be evolutionary older than the more recognizable dragons on the remaining five bu.3i All these six bu are likely products of the same foundry. The Prague, Sackler, Taipei, Wuguancun and Dasikongcun bu were most probably cast almost simulta- neously. Although they are virtual clones of each other, the very subtle differences among them are nonetheless revealing, as they point to the range of individual variability within the œuvre of one caster (perhaps, indeed, there are two hands at work). If we accept the bu with bird-like design from M 188 as their immediate predecessor, then the Prague, Sackler, Dasikongcun and Wuguancun vessels are all replicas derived from this prototype.32 Alternatively, since it is impossible to assign their respective place within a given series with any certainty, all six bu can be considered to belong to one clearly defined group within a chain of replications of Shang bu vessels.33 The creative events embodied in this family of bu become fully visible as we backtrack and list the essential steps leading to it. For our purposes, it will be sufficient to mention just two instances of what appear to be the immediate precursors to our group. The first is represented by a bu of unknown provenance in the Musée Cernuschi in Paris (fig. 7), a large vessel of a distinctly archaic shape with a concave shoulder and a simple frieze of rectan- gular spirals on the foot.34 The broader of the two friezes on its belly carries coarse rectangular spirals within interlocked "T"s, nearly identical to that on our group of five vessels, except that here, the "TV do not appear to be as pronounced as on the six bu discussed earlier; they are insufficiently defined by comparison. The second precursor is exemplified by a bu from Lingbao SÄ (Henan &gt;öfS0 (fig- 8), which has several counterparts in museum collections. Compared to the Cernuschi buy the morphology of these vessels is modified. They have a more compact, round-bellied shape and their dimensions are virtually identical to the above-considered group 30. The third vessel is a ding in the Asian Art Museum, San Francisco, published by Max Loehr in Ritual Vessels of Bronze Age China , 58-59. Loehr cites only one other instance of this motif, on the foot of a yu^ vessel whose present location is unknown. 3 1 .

The only major difference is the decoration on the belly, which consists of a large Style III taotie .35 We may list the significant design steps embodied in our group of six bu as fol- lows. In the first place, the vessel shape became crisply defined and well-proportioned following the introduction of bu onto the repertoire of bronze vessels approximately half a century or so preceding our group of six. Second, a decision was made to alter the decoration scheme of the newly introduced bu type by replacing the Style III taotie seen in the main register of the very early examples with a geometric pattern as seen in our group of six. Further modifications involved the decoration motifs themselves: the invention of a pattern of interlocked "T"s, as well as the invention of several variations of dual motifs on the foot. Interlocked "T"s can be found almost exclusively on bu vessels, with some infrequent occurrences in pottery from the same period; and while, as we have just seen, an inchoate variant of this pattern is seen on at least one prior occasion, it may be correct to say that this particular motif was developed into its more mature manifestation on the very bu vessels of our group. The same holds true for the development of the geometric patterns on the foot. All of these are significant design steps that may be considered true inventions and novel creative solutions. The tangibility of such inventions stands out in comparison to "variations" (to use George Kubier s still useful conceptual scheme) within our group of six. Consider the difference between our group and related bu vessels on which the interlocked "T"s in the main register are replaced by a diamond-and-boss pattern, another motif that first appeared at the same time as the interlocked-"T"s motif.36 Unlike the introduction of either of these two motifs (which constitutes an act of manifest invention), their appearance in the main decorative registers of later bu vessels can be considered as mere variation, possibly as instances of modularity in Ledderose's sense. But even such variation is not the result of some mechanical deployment of a modular system, but a case of purposeful intention. Major creative solutions are naturally better recognized on exceptional pieces, and therefore it may be useful briefly to consider one more example: a group of early Anyang-period gong fifa (also transcribed as guang) vessels. Even when seen by itself, a gong in the Minneapolis Institute of Arts (ex-Pillsbury collection) imme- diately attracts attention as a masterpiece of Shang bronze casting (fig. 9). Yet it also represents an embodiment of radical innovation and exceptional inventiveness, which again stand out only in comparison with other pieces within the series of Shang gong. Among the limited number of extant vessels of this type, the Pillsbury 35. The vessel from Lingbao (Henan Sheng Bowuguan and Lingbao Xian Wenhuaguan "Henan Lingbao chutu yipi Shang dai qingtongqi" Lb±- "Brilli, Kaogu, 1979.1, 21), and several of its counterparts (bu in the San Francisco Asian Art Museum, Sackler bu and Klingenberg bu) feature minor differences in the dimensions and rendering of decorative motifs.

While one cannot rule out the possibility that there existed a preceding evolutionary stage of gong morphology that did not enter the archaeological record, it occupies a place near the very beginning of the evolution- ary sequence of gong. Since unlike some other types, gortg have no precedents in ceramics, the shape must have been invented from scratch. Besides its structure, the vessel demonstrates an exceptionally creative solution in its imagery. The taotie monster mask in the main decorative field projects with clarity and virulent power from the leiwen background. The elimination of the figure-ground ambiguity, which gave the theriomorphic images a new integrity and an intensely expressive character, was a major invention at the time of the origin of this gong. Similar images can be observed on a number of roughly contemporary bronzes, showing that the newly defined taotie was available as a potent image for casters to use on vessels of a variety of types.37 Also remarkable is the rendering of 37. Louisa Huber related the Pillsbury gong to a group of several other vessels bearing the same inscription and sharing a theriomorphic imagery of mosaic-like quality (Huber, "Some Anyang Royal Bronzes: Remarks on Shang Bronze Decor," in Kuwayama (ed.), The Great Bronze Age of China: A Symposium , 25-27). Bagley (Shang Ritual Bronzes in the Arthur M. Sackler Collec- tions , p. 24) writes that "only at this stage, when the motifs have taken firm shape against some</page><page sequence="20">36 Ladislav Kesner the other decorative motifs on this vessel, especially the superbly drawn dragons, whose shapes grace the profile of the upper rim of the vessel body, and which also appear on the left and right sides of the lid. A comparison of the Pillsbury gong with several other vessels of this type fea- turing a double-shaped zoomorphic lid demonstrates an extraordinary outburst of experimentation and creativity at this moment, which becomes apparent even in brief summary. We begin with a gong published in 1940 by Umehara (fig. 10), for all we know perhaps the oldest existing example of its kind, where a lid is already formed in the shape of the dragon, yet does not correspond to the imagery below, which is composed of a Style III taotie and geometric snake-like design.38 This genealogical line continues directly to the owl-and-tiger gong , with a specimen in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, as its earliest example (fig. II).39 The evolution can thus be traced from Umeharas gong first to the vessel in the Metro- politan Museum and further on to the stage represented by a gong in the Arthur M. Sackler Museum at Harvard University (ex-Winthrop collection; fig. 12)40 and a similar specimen excavated from the tomb of Fu Hao at Anyang (Yinxu Tomb 5: 779; fig. 13),41 and a few others, on which the owl and tiger have traded positions and the lid has been metamorphosed into fully sculpted tiger and owl heads that connect to the remainder of these animals depicted on the vessel bodies below.42 We can further compare this last rendering, as seen on the Winthrop and Fu Hao gong with a famous gong in the Freer Gallery of Art, Smithsonian Institution (fig. 14)43 in which the body of the vessel is transformed into an abstract rendering of a squatting fowl, with attached wings that may be alternately read as belonging to the fowl on the vessel body or to the owl on the lid, thus combining the three creatures - fowl, owl, and tiger - into a coherent sculptural unity, which, as the neutral ground, are we really justified in speaking of the taotie and dragon as images rather than pattern units or pattern repeats." In Max Loehr and the Study of Chinese Bronzes, p. 82-92, Bagley succinctly describes the process of invention of zoomorphic motifs. While he is undoubtedly right in emphasizing the key role of casters, I believe that the emergence of the full-fledged, expressive monster mask at the transitional/early Anyang period cannot be entirely explained as a result of the artistic experimentation in a given medium, but represents a conscious manipulation of the visual and expressive potential of the image desired by vessel patrons - that is an outcome of a more complex intentionality.

Somewhat extending Kublers concept (and keeping in mind the inescapable fact that the material evidence now preserved is incomplete in nature),45 1 would argue that all of them can be considered prime objects in their own right, with some of them (e.g., the Winthrop and Fu Haogowg) prompting a distinct series of replicas.46 Was there a direct and specific commission from the patrons for a new type of lidded vessel in a zoomorphic shape that corresponded to some change in ritual or religious practice? Or were the casters rather trying to meet a general demand for 44. Ibid. y 244. 45. Kubler writes that prime objects (like prime numbers) "likewise resist decomposition in being original entities . Their character as primes is not explained by their antecedents , and their order in history is enigmatic" ( The Shape of Time, 39). Perhaps only "the first gong ' (whether we think of it as a specific vessel or just an abstract entity) would meet such a definition. But other gong vessels discussed here evidently admit a decomposition into sets of events. 46. The Winthrop and Fu Hao vessel have several near-identical counterparts such as the gong in the Sumitomo collection {Sen oku Hakkokan , 25, no. 16).</page><page sequence="24">40 Ladislav Kesner a new, impressive, visually appealing vessel type with a solution of their own? Such questions, naturally, cannot be answered with any certainty today. Morphological changes between two objects within a given series - such as the trading of places between the bird and the tiger on the Metropolitan Museum gong and the Winthrop and Fu Hao gong previously discussed - can be recognized as intentional design events. However, the specific intention(s) that prompted such a decision almost certainly were far more complex than just the desire for a change in design. In the case of Shang bronzes, since we are left to infer intentions from only the vessels themselves, the details will remain opaque to any further scrutiny.47 The ultimate credit in each given case might go to one person only (a designer or, somewhat less likely, a patron), or it might be more evenly spread among other subjects act- ing within the production nexus. Any artistic solution reached might be the result of an individual's flash of genius - a major insight stemming from the desire to make the vessel visually more appealing - or it could be the result of an extensive exchange, involving successive steps of elaboration and reformulation of intentions in response to semantic, iconographie or ideological concerns. Individual Creative Act Versus Tradition From the observation of how creative solutions can be discerned in anonymous works of art, it is but a short step to the related problem of the dialectic relation- ship between an individual creative act and the force of historically grown tradition. Since this topic is quite complex, I shall limit myself to only two pertinent aspects, taking as my point of departure Max Loehrs view of the relationship between artistic individuality and tradition in pre- Song painting. Loehr neatly separates what he terms "extra-artistic" and stylistic aspects: Surely a matter of established tradition (without which, incidentally, there would be no possible appearance of individuality) are such features as material and technique, the iconography of religious art, conventional motifs and symbols, features, in short, which are wholly or chiefly extra-artistic ones. Style, by contrast, cannot be taken as an unquestionably collective, supra-individual aspect because, even in this early phase, it was always apt to be individually modified, representing as it were the datable outcome of a dialogue between an individual and the sum of tradition [...].48 Such a contrast, however, is neither accurate nor very helpful, particularly in the 47. The argument here partly relies on one's use of the term intention/intentionality, important but rather problematic category for art history. While purposefully eschewing theo- retical discussion here, my use of the term takes clues from Michael Baxandall's redefinition of intention primarily as the relationship between an object and its circumstances, as well as from Whitney Davis's critique of logocentric fallacy in traditional art historical ascribing of intention. See Baxandall, Patterns of Intention. On the Historiographie Explanation of Pictures (New Haven and London: Yale University press, 1985), esp. 41-42, and Davis, "The Deconstruction of Inten- tionally in Archaeology," Antiquity, 66 (1992), 334-47. 48.

Style, after all, does not refer only to the non-functional, aesthetic aspects of an object's morphology, nor is there anything in the bronze vessels that can be considered "extra artistic." In the case of bronze casting at least, there is, properly speaking, no neat division between the artistic (aesthetic) aspect of intentionality belonging solely to vessel designers on the one hand, and the non-artistic aspects originating exclusively with patrons and coordinators on the other. As we have observed, when bronze vessels are studied as part of a series, it is possible to infer the intentional design solutions, but not the actual inten- tions underlying them. But even in cases where we can suspect that the intention behind an observable material configuration primarily concerned the functional, iconographie, or semantic specifications formulated by a patron, there always had to be a corresponding solution for the participating designer, who must have found ways to translate that patron's demands into a concrete visual/plastic rendering. On the other hand, the aesthetic dimension was assuredly not a province of the design- ers only, as the concerns for purely perceptual effects and corresponding changes in style might have been formulated in very specific terms by patrons in the first place. In a very real sense, innovations in Shang bronzes (such as the case of gong type considered above) may have been hard-won solutions, negotiated against the momentum of established, agreed-upon, and time-tested precepts, prevailing taste, and engrained production routines. On the other hand, it might have been precisely the impulse of changes in ritual function or semantic meaning that catalyzed these momentous innovations to form. Such innovations might have been most obvious during times when entirely new formats and types of artifacts were introduced into the repertoire. They could manifest themselves in structural changes of vessels, the introduction of new decoration motifs, major alterations of decorative schemes, or the introduction of cultural references to style such as archaisms. Taken as a whole, early Bronze Age Chinese art is one example of a non- autographic artistic tradition, in which novel solutions are generally not easily rec- ognizable within a dense series of replicas allowing but minor variations. However, the dynamics of innovation during the centuries of the Shang dynasty were not static but fluctuating. The earlier phases (roughly from the Erlitou 2SS through the early Anyang period) exhibit comparatively more experimentation and vis- ible invention than the later. The creative solutions embodied in the bu and gong series discussed above, both from close to the beginning of the Anyang period, are examples of this. In the late Anyang period, such visibly manifest innovation seems rarer and less pronounced. The bronze art of that period - the Yinxu II-IV phases - manifests what is sometimes called the "High Anyang Style,"49 which is characterized by standardization of shapes, rigid compartmentalization of vessel 49. I follow here the periodization of Anyang finds into Yinxu I-IV phases (see Zheng Zhenxiang iKilf and Chen Zhida "Yinxu qingtongqi de fenqi yu niandai" ixWfüiiÉft in Yinxu qingtongqi , 31-38. For an attempt to discern several late Anyang styles see Huber, "Some Anyang Royal Bronzes," 33-37. She notes that after the period corresponding to the Wu Ding reign, the inventory of motifs becomes relatively conventional, standardized and regularized.</page><page sequence="26">42 Ladislav Kesner surfaces, and a conventionalization of décor that resulted in a certain muting of the expressive power of zoomorphic images, bespeaking a pervasive emphasis on regu- larity, predictability and order.50 Indeed, bronzes from this period are conspicuous for their impersonality and for the progressive disappearance of autographic traits; variations within a given set of parameters have definite precedence over wholesale innovation. What David Keightley wrote about Anyang bronzes generally only applies to this late phase (or style) of Anyang production. Comparing Shang bronzes with oracle-bone divinations, Keightley sees both as an expression of the Shang "scientific" ethos: " [...] as with the divination charges, the rigidly compartmentalized design of the bronze motifi permitted no personal inspiration ."51 Further on, he notes: The technology (of the piece-mold bronze casting process) did not encourage individual experiment or invention. The Shang designed their ritual bronzes, as they divined their world, by employing a limited series of formulas that they found aesthetically and meta- physically satisfying.52 It is of course tempting to seek correlates of such stylistic features with other traits of late Shang material culture and even to interpret them as expressions of the Shang Zeitgeist or mental universe,53 or of a production process. Looking at bronzes in this way presupposes the existence of such a style as a given, as some metaphysical entity. But in fact, a style never merely "happened" as a result or an expression of the Shang mentality, worldview, or modular production system. Rather, it must have been developed in countless purposeful steps. Once again the notion of the production nexus and its changing vectors of intention is helpful. What, then, happened to the Shang bronzes during the late Anyang phase? Briefly stated, one can envisage several things: 1) The patrons' preferences and demands, perhaps themselves reflecting larger social and cultural processes, tended, to a greater degree than before, to emphasize the values of standardization, predictability and regularity. 2) Changes in semantic and ideological aspects occurred, such as the attenuation of the semantic meaning of all bronze imagery. 50. Compare Robert Poor ("The Master of the 'Metropolis-Emblem Ku," 77): "There is surprisingly little variation in the design of ritual bronzes made during the Anyang phase of Shang dynastic art. Indeed ' there are very few Chinese bronze vessels made in this period that surprise us by anything other than their beauty or the skill of their manufacturing. So in the final analysis, it is the sense of an anonymous "period style " and not the eccentric notion of personal or individual style that characterizes their solemn impersonality. " 51. David N. Keightley, "The 'Science' of the Ancestors: Divination, Curing, and Bronze- Casting in Late Shang China," Asia Major, 14.2 (2001), 179. 52. Ibid., 180-81. 53. Robert L. Thorp's observation "The Shang style at Anyang is in every way an expression of the fundamental values of the elite, of their cultic needs and aspirations, of their mentality [...]. Shang vessels are expressions of a Shang society and culture" is typical of a whole plethora of similar views (Thorp, "The Archaeology of Style at Anyang," 65).</page><page sequence="27">Crea tive Personality and the Crea tive Act in the Anonymous Art of China 43 3) Patrons' intentions were communicated to casters in a stricter and more prescrip- tive manner than before. Such preferences would have had to be met by adjustments and solutions in perceptual properties, which gradually led to the development of a style preferring visual corollaries of order, predictability, and impersonality and thus to artistic actions that favored variations within an established set of parameters to experimentation and major innovations. 4) Another set of factors probably concerned changes in the production nexus in relation to style: the more extensive use of imagery treated as modular units would have corresponded to a newly emerging style with the above-mentioned character- istics, and, in some sort of feedback-loop, contributed to augment them in turn. Imagination The assertion of the superiority of the creativity of an individual artist over that of anonymous artisans, which this essay has tried to dispel, is often supported by appeals to the exceptional artistic imagination of famous artistic personalities. It may be appropriate, therefore, to conclude with some brief observations on the cognitive foundation of creative acts and on imagination in anonymous art.54 Among the most influential tenets of scholarly aesthetics in late imperial China was the celebration of the qualities of naturalness ( tianran tianzhen ^y¡0 and spontaneity ( ziran g$0 of a man's character and, consequently, of his creative efforts in painting or calligraphy.55 Such an ideal harks back to early Daoist texts, as evidenced most notably in several often quoted parables from the Zhuangzi ÍHS such as the story of prince Wenhui's cook Ding ( bao Ding JST), who was able to achieve heavenly naturalness in the butchering of an ox, or in the story of the woodcutter Qing (zi Qing ffi#), who was capable of manufacturing bell stands of heavenly excellence.56 The intimate connection between spontaneity, effortlessness, naturalness, and artistic excellence appears in the Lidai minghua ji MftínliiB (ninth century) and other early Chinese histories of painting in connection with painters classified as 54.

During the Song dynasty, the notion of naturalness and spontaneity, flowing from the unconscious was popularized and firmly embedded in the fabric of the emerging literati aesthetics in the poems of Su Shi Ûfô (1037-1101) and his followers. One of them was the poet and calligrapher Huang Tingjian SrSIÜS (1045-1105), who wrote: If the painter has incipient bamboo in his breast, then from trunk to branches it will flourish; if he has perfected bamboo in his breast, then brush and ink will fuse with things. It is like the ferryman's not having seen a boat and yet being able to manage it because of his readiness. Now, as for coming to enlightenment at the appropriate moment, so that brush and ink will achieve the same results as natural creation, how could it be sought elsewhere? The cook's cutting up of oxen and the woodworker Ch'ing's carving of a bell-stand went with their having clarity in themselves and a concentration of vital- ity like divinities, so closely united that nothing could come between; only then could they achieve excellence.57 Interestingly, the pertinence of the aspects of the creative process highlighted in Zhuangzi - total concentration, focusing attention and consciousness on a given activity, and the effortless flowing of psychic energy that results in the fusion of subject and object - has been underscored by contemporary psychology. These very same elements are central to the theory of flow proposed by the American psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. The term "flow" denotes the optimal state of inner experience and order in consciousness that occurs when a person is fully concentrated on the task at hand and his/her skills match his/her opportunity for action. Creative thinking and manual work are discussed by Csikszentmihalyi as typical examples of activities in which flow occurs.58 Obviously, flow can characterize the creative process of an artist working individually as much as that of a crafts- man who has fully mastered just one task within the sequence of operations of the production process such as bronze casting. The two anecdotes from Zhuangzi mention just this kind of situation occurring in connection with the activity of craftsmen - a cook and a woodcarver - who have perfected their respective skills. When such categories as naturalness and spontaneity are considered not as culturally loaded concepts, but as ingredients of flow-type activity, they are thus not exclusive prerequisites of the autographic expressivity of an individual genius, but equally underlie the work of individuals involved in a collective, tightly-organized and managed prescriptive process. The Chinese (proto-Taoist and literati) notion of an exceptional creative act that spontaneously originates in unconscious psychical sources likewise has some affinities with Western notions of artistic imagination and creativity. In the West, the romantic view of artists and thinkers established the folk-psychological concept of imagination as an inexplicable source (or even a synonym) of creativity. In aca- demic circles, "imagination" is a notoriously contested term that has suffered much 57.

Skipping detailed conceptual discussion, let us directly point out that for an art historian, imagina- tion has at least two analytically usefiil dimensions. The first refers to projective imagination, or a metaphoric seeing, rooted in the capacity of "seeing as" ("seeing in").59 The mechanism of "seeing as" plays a key role, not only in the perception of the works of art as such, but also in their creation; in fact, it accounts for the celebrated powers of the "artistic vision." The second, and for most contemporary philosophers, primary dimension of imagination refers to the propositional ability of the human mind to think about real and unreal possibilities and simulate them mentally. This enables humans to plan actions, and to envisage a course of action before implementing it.60 In the words of two leading scholars - a neuroscientist and a philosopher: Powerful imagination is not the ability to conjure up vivid mental images, but rather the ability to think of ingenious, unusual, detailed, hitherto undreamed-of possibilities. One uses imagination both in discovering and in creating, in thinking of solutions by way of imagining what would happen if [...] or how something might have occurred.61 This association of the imagination is very pertinent with regard to our topic; for every work of art is, among other things, and often in the first place, a solution to a problem, an outcome or material realization of a process of judging alternative solutions and thus of the mental simulation of certain processes; it is, in other words, the result of choices between various possibilities, scenarios or realizations.62 This holds true for almost every act of artistic creation, including cases of a solitary painter giving expression to his inner vision. In the process of ritual bronze casting, as in the production of other anonymous works of art, the importance of imagination thus conceived likewise cannot be overstated. In the same vein, contemporary neuropsy- chological research has proven that novel insights and creative solutions can arise in either of the two modes - spontaneous and deliberate - that are underlined by the distinct pattern of neurocognitive processing. In the latter mode, novel solutions or inventions are the result of carefully premeditated, methodical problem solving.63 59. In the present context (different from a philosophical discussion), it is not necessary to distinguish strictly between "seeing as" and "seeing in." This pair of concepts has generated a vast amount of literature. For a respectable account see Richard Wollheim, Art and Its Objects (2nd ed., New York: Cambridge University Press, 1980); idem, Painting as an Art (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1987), esp. 46-79; see also contributions in Rob van Gerwen (ed.), Richard Wollheim on the Art of Painting: Art as Representation and Expression (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001). 60.

Major inventions in shapes or motifs, or the genesis of unusual pieces (such as the famous pair of you ã vessels in the Musée Cernuschi and the Sen'oku Hakkokan, which are in the shape of a tiger holding a human being)64 presuppose from the very beginning an instance of imaginative seeing ("seeing as" or "seeing in") of the designer and/or patron: someone had to visualize the vessel as an animal in order for the gong type to be born.65 But the process of realizing such a vision - which probably involved a long series of com- munications translating the artisťs or artists' initial insights into agreed-upon design concepts and finally into a set of commands and specifications for the production process - depended entirely on the forwarding and testing of propositions. In short, it was an exercise of the casters' imaginations as sets of mental simulations. For another look into how both types of creative imagination inhere in the genesis of a work of art, let us consider as a final example two celebrated works of Chinese art: Xu Bing's ^}7jc (b. 1955) famous installation Tianshu (fig. 15)66 and the jade anthropomorphic shroud from the Han dynasty Tomb 1 at Mancheng, the tomb of the already mentioned Liu Sheng (fig. 16).67 They represent a radical polarity between, on the one hand, the work of a famous personality who embod- ies the dominant notion, in today's art world, of a self-conscious artist, and on the other, an anonymous work commissioned to serve a well-defined extra-artistic function. And yet, we can observe a definite parallel in the cognitive foundation of the creative acts through which these two works were materialized. Let us first note that their current status as exceptional works of art is due not only to their visual qualities, but also to the recognition of their (formal and semantic) ingenu- ity and inventiveness. They can be said to instantiate the exceptional creativity of those who conceived of them and produced them. In both cases, radical invention has its source in an initial creative insight. To produce the jade suit, someone (per- haps a ritual specialist) had the idea to combine pre-existing jade face covers and pectorals into a complete anthropomorphic shroud. This idea, of course, may well have occurred in direct response to a religious notion or a ritual need, but this in no way diminishes its significance. In Xu Bing's case, the artist had the subversive tion, 5 (1996), 381-93; Arne Dietrich, "The Cognitive Neuroscience of Creativity," Psychonomic Bulletin and Review, 11.6 (2004), 1011-26. 64. V.

Bagley, following Max Loehr, proposes the key role of the "imaginative process" in the development of Shang bronze designs, with casters projecting zoomorphic images into the inchoate motif of eyes (Bagley, Max Loehr and the Study of Chinese Bronzes, 85-92). Although I do not entirely agree with his description of the process, it would indeed have to utilize a projective imagination based on the mechanism of "seeing as/in." 66.

In both cases such departures from established precedent were but the first step in the entire creative act, or a chain of acts, that eventually produced the finished work of art. There necessarily followed an exercise of the imagina- tion - a deliberate mode of creative thinking. Neither of the works would have ever seen the light of day had not the artisans/artists possessed the ability to find solutions corresponding to their initial ideas, that is, to plan and simulate mentally not only the finished works as such, but also the succession of steps necessary to transform their incumbent ideas into material form.68 Finally, there was, in both cases, a stage of arduous manual labor through which the work came into being - the endlessly repeated manual movements necessary for cutting and polishing thousands of jade pieces and attaching them to one another with golden wire, and the equally monotonous carving of four thousand characters of movable printing type into pieces of pear wood, assembling them into printing blocks, printing large 68. In the cases of the Tianshu , these included the process of printing and binding the book according to the highest standards of traditional Chinese book production.</page><page sequence="33">Creative Personality and the Creative Act in the Anonymous Art of China 49 numbers of pages, and assembling them in their intended format of display - acts that were completely devoid of any spontaneous outbursts of creative energy, but were nevertheless essential for the creative ideas to be actualized.69 These brief remarks help us to underscore an important point. Current research strongly suggests that in the neurocognitive and psychological mechanisms of creativity there is no distinction in principle between the individual artist, who, fulfilling the ideal of literati or Western Modernist aesthetics, realizes his uniquely private vision in solitary pursuit, and the anonymous artist who acts within a pro- duction nexus wherein complex intentions are negotiated in complex processes of communication involving a large number of people, and where the artist's primary responsibility is to deliver a solution acceptable to his patrons. There are, to be sure, many intermediary stages between these two extremes. The work of an individual artist self-consciously aiming at creating a work of art as an indicator of his superior character, talent, or artistic consciousness does not, I repeat, depend on any sort of artistic imagination that would be qualitatively distinct from, let alone superior to, that of anonymous artisans. Works of anonymous art in China are thus emphati- cally not produced by impersonal traditions, mentalities, social conditions, religious movements, or production processes, but they are, very crucially, the outcome of exceptional creative acts of ineffably individual human minds whose imaginative capabilities were fully on a par with those of celebrated artistic personalities.

Interpreters of Xu Bings work have noted Xu Bings commitment to procedural, mechanical creation; e.g. Eugene Yuejin Wang, "Of Text and Texture: The Cultural Relevance of Xu Bing's Art," in Xu Bing: Language Lost (Boston: Massachusetts College of Art, 1995), 12-13.</page></plain_text>
