<plain_text><page sequence="1">COSMOS, COSMOGRAPH, AND THE INQUIRING POET: NEW ANSWERS TO THE "HEAVEN QUESTIONS"* STEPHEN FIELD "Tianwen" 5c ^9, or the "Heaven Questions,"1 is one of those baffling works that receives no small amount of attention from the scholarly community in China but is almost ignored in the West. It is true that pioneering European scholars like August Conrady tried with some success at the turn of the century to determine the poem's meaning,2 as did David Hawkes more recently. But it will come as a surprise to some readers that this is only the second study of "Tianwen" ever to appear in English.3 It was not until this century, with the important work of Wen * I would like to thank the Faculty Development Committee of Trinity University for a summer grant that supported research for this paper and the staff of the East Asiatic Library of the University of California at Berkeley for their assistance. I am especially grateful to John S. Major for taking time to conduct two meticulous readings of earlier drafts of this article. I also owe a debt of gratitude to Edward L. Shaughnessy for his editorial guidance and to two anonymous readers for their expert comments. A shortened version of this paper was read at a panel of the 44th Annual Meeting of the Association for Asian Studies in Washington, D.C., on April 4, 1992. I thank Sarah Allan, who chaired the panel "Cosmos and Cosmographic Model," and Tu Wei-Ming, who served as discussant. 1. "Tianwen" is in the Chuci SS, or Songs of Chu, and is traditionally attributed to Qu Yuan IB IS (c. 340-c. 278 B.C.), the Chu courtier. See Hong Xingzu M iffi, Chuci buzhu (Sibu beiyao ed.), 3.1-26. 2. Conrady traced the origin of "Tianwen" to the Rig-Veda in his "Indischer Einfluss in China in 4. Jahrhundert v. Chr.," Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlandischen Gesell schaft 60 (1906), 347-348. Hellmut Wilhelm disagreed, pointing out similar works of lit erature around the world, like the Edda poems of Iceland, for example, and suggested that we completely disregard Conrady's "proofs"; see his "Der T'ien Wen Frage," Monumenta Serica 10 (1945), 427. 3. The first was Yumiko Fukushima Blanford's "A Study of Chuci 'Tianwen'" (M.A. thesis; University of Washington, 1985), which is especially useful for its philological and structural analysis.

The main topic of study is the view of the cosmos as revealed in the astronomical sections of the "Heaven Questions." As a peripheral issue I will also address the problem of literary intent. The Question of Style Any analysis in a Western language of a poem as complex as "Tian wen" must first deal with the mode of translation. What tone should the poem maintain as it is translated from archaic Chinese into English? Although artistic value is not my major concern here, I do think that a source text in verse should be rendered into verse in the target language as a further attempt to preserve the original tone or attitude held by the poet. The mood of a text is inevitably tied to its authorial intent, so we need to have some idea regarding the origin of the poem. Let us begin by asking ourselves what it resembles. Does it conjure up images of the antecedent of all heavenly questioning in China, the turtle-shell and bone oracle?6 Or does it resemble philosophical musing, like the cryptic phrases of the Daodejingl Is the poem an emotional outburst, as its earli English translation is that of David Hawkes, in The Songs of the South: An Anthology of Ancient Chinese Poems by Qu Yuan and Other Poets (1959; rpt. London: Penguin, 1985). 4. "Tianwen shi tian" ^ |R] P 55, originally published in Qinghua xuebao 'M ¥ ¥ fS 9.4 (1936) and reprinted in Wen Yiduo quanji H — # ^ (Hong Kong: Nantong, n.d.), is a study of the first 22 verses of the poem. The complete study was published post humously from the author's unrevised notes as Tianwen shuzheng 55 Ptfl iSfi (Beijing: Sanlian, 1980). 5. Luo Ping in his commentary to his father Luo Mi's account of ancient history called Lushi S&amp;i (pub. 1170), was the first to claim that Qu Yuan did not write "Tianwen." See Lushi, "Houji" (Sibubeiyao ed.), 13A.7a. 6. Fujino Iwatomo f§ W SI £ speculates that "Tianwen" is a literary work com posed of invocations in the style of bone oracles (cited in Shi Shunii MMtt, "Jiuge Tianwen Erzhao de chengli beijing yu Chuci wenxue jingshen de tantao" 'K 5ft Ji FrJ — Wenshi congkan £ £ WflJ 31 [1969], 46). He bases his theory on a passage from the Lunheng fm %, "Bushi pian" h MS (Sibu beiyao ed.), 24.5a: "The vulgar believe in turtle-shell and milfoil divination, saying that the turtle shell diviner asks about heaven and that the milfoil diviner asks about earth." However, some scholars are of the opinion that Shang divination was actually not a matter of questioning (see the forum discussion in Early China 14). Even if we assume</page><page sequence="3">STEPHEN FIELD 85 est commentator claims?7 Or is it a scholarly investigation, conducted with a proto-scientific air? We need a way to probe the poem for its tone, which will then be a clue to the intellectual perspective of its author. Our first hint is the poem's genre, the wen fnj, or "query," a not uncommon thematic form in pre-Qin China.8 Although some slight similarities can occasionally be found in content, none of the other wen texts is remotely related to the structure of "Tianwen."9 Still, it is the interrogative portions of the text that lend first insight into the poet's attitude. That is how Wang Yi can claim that "[Qu Yuan] cried out to heaven" and "wrote down these questions on the walls in order to release pent-up resentment." On the other hand, the topical sections of "Tianwen" verses read like plot skeletons of ancient myth, lore, and legend. Whatever narrative that exists over the larger structure of the poem is evident in these topical currents, not in the questions. The first four quatrains of the poem, in particular, are already arranged in such a the "Tianwen" poet was aware of the bone oracle, we cannot be sure that he under stood it as questions. 7. Wang Yi's second century preface to the poem, "Tianwen zhangju" 5? fa] j|£ /u|, reads as follows: "Qu Yuan was banished and in his dejection wandered about the mountains and marshlands in great distress. As he passed by mound and over plain, he cried out to heaven and his deep sighs filled the skies. In the temples of the former Chu kings and in the shrines of the high officials he found murals depicting the spirits and deities of heaven and earth, mountains and water courses, in all their sublimity and strangeness, as well as sages and worthies of old, curious objects and activities. Weary of wandering about, he sat down to rest beneath the walls. Then, looking up at the murals, he wrote down these questions on the walls in order to release pent-up resentment and ease his mind. The people of Chu pitied Qu Yuan and recorded his various statements. That is why the text is out of order"; Chuci buzhu, 3.1a/b. 8. Several texts from this period contain essays with wen as a part of their titles, including the Mozi, Liezi, Heguanzi, Xunzi, and especially Guanzi which contains four different "question" chapters: "Huangong wen" 6 [J!], or "The Questions of Duke Huan"; "Xiaowen" /Jn PrI, or "Minor Queries"; "Zhuwen" Pr], or "Major Queries"; and finally, "Wen" Pr3, or simply, "Queries." W. Allyn Rickett considers this last chapter to be "remarkably reminiscent of the Tianwen chapter of the Chu ci"; Guanzi 2 vols. (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1985), vol. 1, 366. But he offers no proof for this assertion, and I see no resemblance beyond the actual format of questioning. Finally, the Mawangdui texts include the medical text, Shiwen "hPrI, or "Ten Queries"; see Mawangdui Han mu boshu J»3£iffL§i3i£ ^ 4 vols. (Beijing: Wenwu, 1985), vol. 4, 143-152. 9. The poem consists of 372 tetrasyllabic lines in 92 quatrains (in which even lines rhyme). In addition, two lines usually form a semantic unit (which I call a verse) with one introducing a topic and one raising a question. The poem can thus be numbered by lines, verses, or quatrains. In this essay I number verses and refer to lines as the "a" and "b" portions of a verse.</page><page sequence="4">86 THE INQUIRING POET manner that the topics and queries can be viewed separately.10 In my translation of these verses I will arrange the two in separate columns so that the poem's narrative flow can be more easily discerned, and the poet's attitude in regard to questions of cosmogony and cosmology can be better scrutinized. The Manifold Cosmos The first eight verses of the poem deal exclusively with the origin of the cosmos: THE HEAVEN In the beginning of old, All is yet formless, no up or down. Dark and light are a blur, The image is only a whir. Bright gets brighter, dark gets darker, The yin mingles with the yang— Then was the round pattern manifold. What an achievement that was! QUESTIONS (1) who was there to tell the tale? (2) what is the basis for study? (3) who can fathom it? (4) how was it perceived? (5) what brought this about? (6) what was basic? what transformed? (7) who devised and calibrated it? (8) who first fashioned it? iiAsafs^ Now it is easier to determine the outlook of the poem. Is it divinatory text or philosophical?11 Is it expressive or objective? This first topical narrative certainly rivals similar passages in the Zhuangzi and the Huai nanzi for metaphysical depth. And the litany of queries reads not like a complaint or a catechism but like a debater's list of rebuttals. So our first impression might be that the "Heaven Questions" in its initial stages is an attempt by the poet to subject a particular ontological stance to an 10. One analysis in German completely excises the questions in its initial translation of the text. See Eduard Erkes, "Zu Ch'ii Yiian's T'ien-wen," Monumenta Serica 6 (1941), 273-339. 11. According to Peng Yi the questions of "Tianwen" seek no guidance from any spirit; see "Chuci Tianwen yinyi ji youguan wenti shitan" ®iS3^|ilIISiiX.WSS mi II M, Wenshizhe xuebao i ^ IP IS 24 (1975), 56. On the contrary, the actions of anthropomorphic heaven are often called into question.</page><page sequence="5">STEPHEN FIELD 87 objective analysis. Such a materialist trend certainly existed in the late Warring States period. It might be useful to cite the work of some of those who perceived the world in such a manner. Although the trend originated before him, Zou Yan UP (305-240 B.C).12 is normally considered to be the great inno vator in the philosophy of cji Sima Qian S]II has the following to say about this obscure philosopher: He recorded the signs and omens, their rules and laws, drew con clusions from them and extended these back to the time when Heaven and Earth had not yet been formed, into the shrouded and obscure times that were impossible to investigate.13 Not only does the general conception of cosmogonic origin seem to be the same here, but Zou Yan's investigative zeal is also shared by the "Tianwen" poet. Although "the shrouded and obscure times" were "im possible to investigate," Zou Yan was capable of deducing its particulars from the general principles of yinyang and wuxing he presumably helped to develop. The first four "Heaven Questions" pertaining to the earliest state of formlessness demonstrate the same futility of investigation. The next two address the transformation of this formless state and attribute it to the interplay of yin and yang.ri Finally, the poet objectifies the material world in verses 7-8 (and in verse 9 he will begin to single out individual phenomena for closer scrutiny). Another passage for comparison opens chapter 3 of Huainanzi, "Tian wen xun" ^clSCf l|, or "Treatise on the Patterns of Heaven": When Heaven and earth were yet unformed, all was ascending and flying, diving and delving. Thus it was called the Grand Illumi nation.15 12. Zou Yan's exact dates are unknown. These approximations are from Qian Mu SSH,Xm/7 Qin zhuzi xinian (rpt.; Taipei: Dongda, 1986), 619. 13. Shiji jfe IB (Zhonghua shuju ed.), 74.2344. For the English translation, see John Knoblock, trans., Xunzi: A Translation and Study of the Complete Works (Stanford: Stan ford University Press, 1988), vol. 1, 65. 14. I can find no evidence in the poem of a knowledge of "five phases" cosmology. Thus we can confidently date the poem to the era preceding Zou Yan. However, numerous images of the liu qi 7\ M,, or "six ethers" (yin fi;, yang Wa,feng ® "wind," yu H "rain," hui Bf| "dark," ming K "light") can be found. 15. Huainanzi (Sibu beiyao ed.), 3.1a; translated by John Major in "Substance, Process, Phase: Wuxing in the Huainanzi," in Chinese Texts and Philosophical Contexts: Essays Dedicated to Angus C. Graham, ed. Henry Rosemont, Jr. (La Salle, IL: Open Court,</page><page sequence="6">THE INQUIRING POET As does "Tianwen," this passage also describes the first phase in a cos mogonic sequence. Both passages use the same expressions to character ize this state. Ping yi M H (*b'isng *gpk in archaic Chinese) means something like "full and flying about,"16 and in the Huainanzi is a meta phorical image of inchoate qi. The redoubling of the word in this pas sage could conceivably highlight the "aural" qualities of this state.17 But it is the "visual" component of ping yi (beating or fluttering wings) that is more likely to satisfy our conceptualizing minds. From the demands of the "Tianwen" narrative I interpret the literal image as descriptive of primal motion, especially a fleeting notion of such,18 and translate the term as "a whir." In addition, both passages employ the word zhao to describe this state. Whereas "Tianwen" describes a state when "bright ness" was only a vague notion, Huainanzi departs from the descriptive mode and valorizes the state of formlessness by naming it "grand." The poet continues. "Brightening" and "darkening" are gradual in tensifications across the passage of time, a phenomenon that marks the progression to another phase in the sequence —from opacity to lumi nance.19 Eventually, when dark and light are fully differentiated, their energies reach their respective limits and the transformation to a third phase commences —the mingling (san he Hh") of yin and yang?50 The 1991), 68. The Huainanzi also put great emphasis on "investigation" as the means to comprehensive knowledge. See Jeffrey A. Howard, "Concepts of Comprehensiveness and Historical Change in the Huai-nati-tzu," in Explorations in Early Chinese Cosmology, ed. Henry Rosemont, Jr. (Chico, CA.: Scholar7s Press, 1984), 119-131. 16. See Bernhard Karlgren, Grammata Serica Recensa (Stockholm: Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, 1957), 899d, 954d. 17. The very pronunciation of *b'isng *gisk also adds to the "visual" image. The first syllable's velar final becomes the second syllable's velar initial (ng becomes g), and these guttural consonants are sandwiched between the same rhyming diphthong (is-ng g-i3). To my mind these sounds imply a back-and-forth or gyrating motion (a decidedly pedestrian example is the sound of a washing machine agitator), much like the implied movement of a man's neck when he says "uh-huh" or "huh-uh." 18. In this sense, the term is similar to shu hu an image of the primal blob in Zhuangzi, which A.C. Graham translates as "Fast and Furious"; Chuang Tzu: The Inner Chapters (London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1981), 98. 19. The change prompts a very fundamental question from the poet: what caused the transformation? This would have been a popular question in philosophical de bates of the day. The philosopher Jiezi fit T", resident at the Jixia Academy IS ~F ;|3 sometime before the reign of King Min of Qi 2 (r. 300-284 B.C.), had summed up the principles of mystical idealism in the phrase, "Someone or something causes it" (huo shi lEffi). The Daoist Ji Zhen ^ jjt, who debated this topic with Jiezi, summed up the principles of natural materialism in the phrase, "No one or nothing makes it" (mo wei 3HS); see Benjamin I. Schwartz, The World of Thought in Ancient China (Harvard: Harvard University Press, 1985), 227. 20. In the early Zhou the character saw H, "three," was synonymous with can 4^,</page><page sequence="7">STEPHEN FIELD 89 poet's question seeks the distinction between the two phases —what is original? what is new? —and recognizes the process from one to the other as transformation (and not "creation"). The (new) third phase is form, in particular, huan ze US M'J, "round pattern," or simply, "round ness." The description of this "round shape" as "nine-tiered" is unique in the tradition of cosmogonic origin sequences in China. So is the manner in which the poet questions it. Both demand our closer scrutiny. A common rhetorical feature of the poem is the multiplying of dimen sions by the number nine, a device also employed in the macropoetic structuring of the Chuci anthology itself (e.g., "Jiuge" A iR, the "Nine Songs," which in reality is eleven separate pieces). Nine is the largest digit in the decimal system and can be derived arithmetically by "fold ing" (chong J|), or stacking layers of three, eventually arriving at the magic square of three rows of three.21 The literal quantity of nine separ ate units may be significant in particular lines or in particular poems, but it is the number's "magic" quality, representing perfection or com pletion, that is probably intended here. The expression jiuchong fi M in this context may be translated quite literally as "manifold" (i.e., "many folded" or "multifaceted"), but the implications of the image are much more complex. A round figure corresponding to the magic square of three may be possible to visualize (e.g., the "Luo Writing," see below), but concentric or interlocking circles or orbits are the natural assumption for people intimately familiar with the night sky.22 Concentric circles immediately conjure up images of bronze mirrors and divining boards, the latter of which will be discussed in great detail below. Some scholars even spec ulate that line 7 is the image of a hunyi SIM, or "armillary sphere." Wang Fuzhi (1619-1692) was the first to identify the image as an instrument of science, calling it a huntian zhi yibiao ifc, or which can mean "to join in or participate with as a threesome without losing identity as an individual" (I am indebted to an anonymous reader for this definition). He means "to unite" as a verb or "a mate" as a noun. 21. John Major believes the magic square of three was discovered "during the Warring States period, if not earlier"; "The Five Phases, Magic Squares, and Schematic Cosmography," in Explorations in Early Chinese Cosmology, 133-166. 22. One of the earliest occurrences of chong in a similar context is a line from "Lu ling" a •fr, a Qi ode in the Shijing. Line 3 reads: lu chong huan JS M 8S, "there go the hounds with their double rings"; Mao shi zhengyi =6 Kf IE Ss (Sibu beiyao ed.), 5-2.5a; James Legge, trans., The Chinese Classics, 5 vols. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1892), vol. 4, 158. Commentaries define the chong huan as a large collar ring with a smaller ring (presumably for the leash?) attached. Thus chong here means something like "linked."</page><page sequence="8">90 THE INQUIRING POET "spherical heaven meter."23 Jiang Liangfu Si 56 ^ later concurred, say ing that huan ze was "perhaps something like the armillary sphere or ce lestial globe of those days" 1$In the terminology of astronomical instruments, the word chong has a technical application, and refers to the "nesting" of armillae within the instru ment. Those who are familiar with Chinese carved ivory fretted balls within balls will have no problem perceiving the nine "layers" as nine concentric spheres, not unlike the cosmos of Ptolemy (c. A.D. 100-178).25 The traditional interpretation of the line is untenable for various rea sons. Most commentators understand huan zejiu chong as descriptive of a hierarchical heaven of nine layers, a shape something like a pyramid or stupa. But the word tian ^ "heaven" has yet to appear in the poem, so the expression just as likely pertains to the cosmos, the subject of the preceding six verses.26 "Roundness" can certainly pertain to more than just the hemisphere of the sky. For example, chapter 3 of the Liishi chuncjiu S R # fX includes a section called huandao H ill, or "The Cycle," which reads as follows: Thus one round of day and night is a cycle. The twenty-eight lodges of the moon, Horn back around to Carriage, is a cycle. The march of the four seasons, one force ascending and one force descending, always in contact, this is a cycle.27 The huan ze of "Tianwen" sounds much more like this huandao than some chongtian So why do scholars almost unanimously define the expression as "nine-tiered"? Since the Han dynasty, readers have conflated the image of huan zejiu chong with zeng cheng jiu chong tfMAl, "terraced walls of nine layers" (verse 41a), the "Tianwen" description of the mythical realm of Kunlun jSH. Located somewhere in the far west or northwest, 23. Wang Fuzhi, Chuci tongshi ® ffc S# (rpt. Beijing: Zhonghua, 1959), 47. 24.

The Greek astronomer's model of the universe postulated the earth at the center, followed by the spheres of the moon, Mercury, Venus, the sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, culminating with the outermost sphere of the fixed stars. 26. There is a similar but not quite parallel expression in verse 32: difangjiu ze ft "the square earth of nine regions." If the poet had meant to describe "heaven" in verse 7, he might have written tian huan jiu chong 5? 18 M, the round heaven of nine layers. 27. Lilshi chunqiu (Sibu beiyao ed.), 3.9b.</page><page sequence="9">STEPHEN FIELD 91 this range was imagined as shaped like a stepped pyramid. It was the abode of immortals and the residence of Xiwangmu H 3i M, Queen Mother of the West and dispenser of the elixir of immortality. Since it bears a certain resemblance to the "world mountain," especially the Buddhist Sumeru,28 it is thus easy to equate with heaven. Nevertheless, in "Tianwen" all discussion of Kunlun occurs in the section reserved for geography, the realm of earth, which doesn't begin for another twenty two verses. Another image contributing to the widespread misreading of jiuchong in "Tianwen" is the concept of chong lou M fiS, or "storied-building," which first appears in the "Fupian" K chapter of Xunzi.29 While a common motif in Han dynasty art, it could have represented Kunlun specifically as did the mountain-shaped incense burner, rather than an abstracted "tiered" heaven. In their earliest forms pagodas or stupas must have been attempts to get closer to heaven, rather than models of heaven itself. Eventually the path (up the mountain) or the pass (through the gates) was metonymically equated with the destination (heaven). If the cosmos is "manifold" and Kunlun is "nine-walled," then how does the "Tianwen" poet describe heaven? Verse 11 introduces the expression jiu tian A 55, or "nine (fields of) heaven";30 this is a fitting counterpart to "nine regions (of earth)." The resulting picture of the physical cosmos is not only complete, it is well balanced. The rotund cosmos is manifold. Three of these multiple folds are: a) a heaven of nine fields (above), b) an earth of nine regions (below), and c) (in between) a Kunlun with nine terraces. Now we come to questions 7 and 8, the first real test of our critical apparatus. In regard to the "round and manifold" cosmos, the poet asks the seemingly technical questions, "who devised and calibrated it?" and "who first fashioned it?" What is the tone of these questions? The choice 28. See Rolf A. Stein, The World in Miniature: Container Gardens and Dwellings in Far Eastern Religious Thought, trans.

While this may be one interpretation of the line, it certain ly does not have to be the only one. One later text that seems to corroborate such an interpretation is the Dazhuan A or "Great Treatise" of the Yijing, which contains the following passage: For comprehending the chaotic diversity of things and exploring what is hidden, for penetrating the depths and extending influence afar, thereby determining good fortune and misfortune on earth and consummating all efforts on earth, there is nothing greater than the oracle. Therefore: Heaven creates (sheng 4.) divine things; the holy sage takes them as models (ze M). Heaven and earth change and transform; the holy sage imitates them. In the heavens hang images that reveal good fortune and misfortune; the holy sage reproduces (xiang Mi) these. The Yellow River brought forth a map and the Luo River brought forth a writing; the holy men took these as models.32 In the Daodejing it is san H, "three," that sheng "gives birth to," wan wu MtyQ, the "myriad things."

All three texts attempt to explain forms of cosmic transformation, with the "Great Treatise" being the most detailed. Heaven's "creative" capacity is described as the production of such microcosmic models as yarrow stalks and turtle shells, the configurations of heavenly bodies, as well as the River Chart and Luo Writing (all tools of divination). But anthropomorphic Heaven does not "create" the cosmos. Heaven merely "creates" the "divine things," and it is the shengren 3? A, "sage," who ze 10, "models," the cosmos as he xiang "repro duces," those things. Although the "Tianwen" poet does not use the word xiang, as does Yang Xiong in his discussion of the armillary (see note 32), the poem does introduce the concept of ze. On the interpreta tion of this term may hinge the answer to the baffling questions that conclude the fourth quatrain of the "Heaven Questions." It so happens that the divine objects mentioned in the "Great Treatise" are all candi dates for the description huan ze, "round pattern," and jiuchong, "nine tiered." When the poet asks who it was that devised and calibrated the round and manifold cosmos, he might have meant the "sage" rather than anthropomorphic heaven.33 It was the sage (such as the legendary Fuxi ft fg) who observed the cracks of turtle-shells and the conjunc tions of the heavenly bodies, then recorded his impressions in hexa grammatic symbols and numerological charts. The sage's recognition of the patterns of the cosmos is not a creation. Those patterns are in continuous transformation as long as the sun continues to shine. The numerological arrays of river charts and the bagua A Sh "trigrams" of the Yijing are exact duplicates or "models" of those heavenly patterns. The "divine thing" and its model are identical.34 The Cosmograph Let us take a closer look at the three examples of shenwu or "divine thing," and evaluate their suitability as cosmic models. As for the Yijing, 33. In his detailed reading of an earlier version of this paper, John Major suggested that the sages referred to by the "Tianwen" poet may in fact have been the five "planetary gods": Tai Hao, Yan Di, Huang Di, Shao Hao, and Zhuan Xu. He notes that in chapter 3 of the Huainanzi, immediately following the cosmogonic passage quoted above, these five figures are depicted as holding carpenter's tools; see Major, "Sub stance, Process, Phase," 71. 34.

As Leibniz discovered, when the solid and broken lines of the 64 hexagrams are converted into binary digits they form a sixty-four unit dyadic sequence from 0 to 111111 that can be arranged in a circle.35 The two divine texts known as the hetu M fjf] and the luoshu flF are also appropriate models for the descriptive images of verse 7.36 Both of them are diagrams composed of nine digits, with those of the Luo Writing in the configuration of a magic square of nine cells.37 The Luo Writing may be considered "round" if it is visualized in the following manner (see Fig. 1). First, connect the opposing odd numbered digits to obtain the figure of a "cross." Then rotate this cross counterclockwise by forty-five degrees; the four subtending arcs form a swastika.38 The third divine object, the configuration of heavenly bodies, may prove to be the best "representation" yet. It is their movement of course that is visualized as "round" and "manifold," not the physical shape of individual bodies. That will be clear after we investigate an even more puzzling astronomical passage in the "Tianwen" (verse 79), which reads 35. The Song dynasty philosopher Shao Yong BP did just this, except that he inverted half of the circle to introduce alternation into the cycle. When half of the cycle is spent, the amplitude reverses. See Helmut Wilhelm, Change: Eight Lectures on the I Ching, rendered into English by Cary F. Baynes, Bollingen Series 62 (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1960), 79-91. 36. According to legend, when Yu the Great succeeded in controlling the waters of the Yellow and Luo Rivers, two fantastic animals emerged to present him with magic diagrams: the (Yellow) River Chart appeared on the flank of a dragon-horse, and the Luo (River) Writing (see Fig. 1) appeared on the back of a turtle. 37. These nine cells were called jiushi fl H, or "nine halls," in the earliest text to enumerate the digits of the Luo Writing, the Dadai liji WL i® IB; see Dadai liji jinzhu jinyi jz M 11 SB K IP, ed. Gao Ming @5 fjE (Taipei: Shangwu, 1981), 291-92. They were divisions of the ming tang, a "mystical temple-palace" where seasonal rites were supposedly conducted; see Needham, Science and Civilisation, vol. 3, 58. The same configuration of digits also appears on the circular dial on a divining board called taiyi jiugong or "Nine Halls of the Grand Monad" (dated 173 B.C.; discovered in a Western Han tomb in Anhui province, 1977); see Yan Dunjie it "Guanyu Xi Han chuqi de shipan he zhanpan" £ S8, Kaogu 1978.5, 334-37. 38. The opposite arms of the swastika may then be connected to form an "X". The numerical values of the endpoints of each arc differ by a factor of five (the digit that occupies the central "hall"), which is the subtrahend and addendum for opposing arcs. This double cross-hair appears on the dial of the taiyi jiugong and, perhaps not co incidentally, is equivalent to the 3000 B.C. Egyptian hieroglyph for "heaven."

If the "round pattern" of verse 7 is a description of heaven, then huan ze is possibly synonymous with tian shi. However, a close reading of the text will show that our poet probably had another shi in mind. The physical object known as a shi (now written M) is an instrument of divination. Ding Yan T § was the first to recognize tian shi as a term for a divination board; he has been followed in this by Wen Yiduo and Jiang Liangfu in this century.40 But none of them were able to penetrate the mystery of the accompanying lines. Hawkes speaks for both tradi tional and modern commentators when he admits that "it is extremely likely that they [verses 77-80] are the product of textual corruption, but the whole passage is so obscure that there seems no point in trying to emend them."41 He discounts the commentary of all three Chuci masters, but they in turn failed to consult their local geomancer whose compass would have revealed the secret of the lines. In July of 1977, versions of a shi pan ^ 3$ and the previously un known yuan pan H were discovered in a Western Han tomb in Anhui province.42 The former is a diviner's instrument consisting of a round 39.

Donald Harper translates shi as "cosmic board," while Joseph Needham employs "diviner's board." Christopher Cullen's rendering as "cosmic model" is even more appropriate, because the board is actually a mirror image of the ideal cosmos (the inscribed Dipper is reversed from its actual appearance in the night sky). In fact, I suspect that the face of the shi pan was constructed precisely to mirror the ideal cosmos that supposedly existed before the toppling of Mt. Buzhou ^ S by the demon Gong Gong ^ X (see below). This means that the connection between such divination instruments and bronze TLV mirrors may be even more immediate than has been previously considered. Perhaps the function of the reflective side of the bronze mirror is to reflect, or capture, or model, the heavenly bodies in the night sky. However, since the shi pan is also a means of measuring or fathoming the cosmos or universe, and its function as astronomical or astrological instrument is</page><page sequence="16">98 THE INQUIRING POET so obvious when compared to devices like the TLV mirrors which are apparently less functional, I prefer to translate shi as "cosmograph." The yuan -pan, on the other hand (Fig. 3), consists of a round disk on top divided into 365 du Hi, or degrees, each marked with a shallow hole. In the center of this disk is also inscribed a representation of Bei dou, although the handle has been straightened to resemble more closely a pointer. This "measuring" disk pivots upon a larger disk encircled by the 28 lunar lodges (accompanied by their span in degrees) in an approximation of their actual positions on the celestial equator. On this bottom plate two intersecting lines divide the lodges into four groups, traditionally known as the si xiang E9 or "four celestial palaces," namely: cang long Hr H, "Cerulean Dragon," in the east; zhu niao jft, "Vermilion Bird," in the south; bai hu E=3 fM, "White Tiger," in the west; and xuan wu 3C S, "Dark Warrior (tortoise)," in the north (see Fig. 4).43 Since this instrument represents only heaven, we might call it a "urano graph." However, some scholars have pointed out its suitability as an observational instrument,44 in which case it should be called a "urano scope." If the tian shi of verse 79 does indeed reflect the poet's knowledge of the authentic astrological "cosmograph" or astronomical "uranoscope," then this is probably the earliest verifiable reference in extant lit erature.45 The following discussion will assume the poet was indeed 43. The artist's rendition of the mythical animals is traditional and can be found reproduced in various modern sources, such as Wu Enpu SI, Zhouyi gudai Zhong guo de shijie tushi Hi H (Jilin: Jilin wenshi, 1988), 90-91. I have arranged the palaces in this illustration as they might appear on a circumpolar star chart, which is opposite from the arrangement of lunar lodges on the shi pan and yuan pan. The former reproduces the view of the hemisphere of heaven theoretically available to a person standing at the north pole looking up (the chart must be held above one's head to properly align the quadrants). The arrangement on the shi pan is the mirror image of this. That is why the Northern Dipper as inscribed on both instru ments is the reverse of the image as seen from earth. Another way to visualize the ar rangement that appears on the instruments is to assume the imaginary vantage point of an observer looking down upon the twenty-eight lodges from behind the pole star. This would supposedly be the view of Shang Di. Schuyler Cammann came to a similar conclusion in regard to the TLV pattern, which he thought represented the "Universe as though seen by a Heavenly eye looking down from the palace of the Supreme Emperor through the hole in the dome of the sky"; see his "The 'TLV' pattern on Cosmic Mirrors of the Han Dynasty," Journal of the American Oriental Society 68 (1948), 165, as quoted in Loewe, Ways to Paradise, 72. 44.

It describes the set of perpendicular lines that divides the ground board of the cosmograph into four smaller squares (like the character for "field" EB).

However, the absence of the word shi 5^ in the Mawangdui versions of the Daoist classic (replaced by mu ft, "to shep herd") leads one to suspect this cosmographical interpretation. The usual translation of the phrase is "to be a model to the world." One other candidate for the earliest reference to the cosmograph is the "Chu Silk Manuscript." Li Xueqin ^ ®J has interpreted a character in the manuscript as shi; see his "Lun Chu boshu zhong de tianxiang" U41 Hunan kaogujikan $8 1 (1982), 68-72.</page><page sequence="18">100 THE INQUIRING POET cross and literally tie the world together.46 In the heavens the zong is the imaginary jingxian SH (or ziwu quart ~FH), "meridian," and the heng is the chidao ^ 31, "celestial equator," these being the coordinate axes necessary for locating stars in the heavens. On the ground board the zong is the ziwu xian -f- or north-south axis and the heng is the maoyou xian J?|J M IS or east-west axis.47 In addition to these zongheng cross-hairs, there are two diagonals on the cosmograph that join the si wei E3 $£, "Four Nodes" (also called si yu H PB, "four corners") of the earth.48 Since these corners are uncovered by round heaven they are also known as the si men E3 PI or "four gates" of the universe49 The diagonals divide the outer edge of the square board into four celestial palaces, and are equivalent to the intersecting lines on the bottom plate of the uranoscope. What is the significance of the term zongheng in the context of the poetic line? Zong and heng define the movement inherent in such calen drical instruments (in which sense it is similar to the generation of the swastika from the Luo Writing.) The cross-hairs are a set of reference lines that allow the manipulator to determine a previous position of the stars or to estimate a future position. Ancient Chinese astronomers were fully aware that the quarterly (six-hour) diurnal rotation of the heavens was equivalent to the seasonal (tri-monthly) annual revolution. With a knowledge of what star was passing the meridian at sunset, a quick glance at the uranoscope could tell the diviner what star had culmi nated at noon or which one would be culminating at midnight. Or, knowing that a particular constellation had risen at sunset on the vernal equinox, the diviner would know what constellation was rising, culmi 46. Jiang Liangfu describes zongheng as yi jing yi wei — 8? — "(intersecting) lines of longitude and latitude"; see Chuci tonggu S # fi #C, 4 vols. (Jinan: Qilu, 1985), vol. 4,856. 47. On the heaven plate heng is represented by the line of sight passing through the second, fourth, fifth, and sixth stars of the inscribed Dipper. 48. John Major has shown that in astronomy's formative period the "square" earth was not a literal image but an imaginary plane formed by joining the four points on the ecliptic corresponding to the solstices and equinoxes. If this is indeed the case, then the Four Nodes are the "knots" that tie the solstitial and equinoctial colures to the ecliptic. See John S. Major, "Topography and Cosmology in Early Han Thought: Chapter Four of the Huai-nan-tzu," (Ph.D. diss.; Harvard University, 1973), 27. 49. In the northwest is the gate of heaven, symbolizing emergence; in the southwest is the gate of man, symbolizing life; in the southeast is the gate of earth, symbolizing return; and in the northeast is the gate of ghosts, symbolizing death. A trigram is affiliated with each of these gates: tjian $2, kun i$, xun PI, and gen S, reading counterclockwise from the northwest. I presume it is at these gates that the diviner perceives good fortune or misfortune as he manipulates the cosmograph.

Zongheng therefore signifies the turning of heaven, and is a "clock" of the universe.50 This is the closest the "Tianwen" poet comes to enumerating a cosmic law. Literally translated, line 79a would describe the rotation of the heaven disk on the earth plate of the cosmograph. Line 79b is deceptively simple. Yang i»§ is the light (opposed to the dark) half of the yin-yang dualism of late Warring States naturalism. Li 1 as a verb means "to leave."51 Yuan M is a grammatical particle indicating consequence. Si means "death." So the whole line may be rendered, "when the yang force departs death results." Two passages from the Huainanzi are more detailed: When the sun is at the summer solstice, the Dipper (points) south, exactly on the [north-south] diametral chord. The yang cji is at its maximum, and the yin qi begins to grow.52 At the summer solstice yin (begins to be) ascendant over yang. For this reason, the myriad creatures come to an end and die53 50. The circle of the lunar lodges on both the shi pan and the yuan pan are arranged in a counterclockwise direction, and their mechanical operation is actually opposite that of the clock. Whereas the hands of a clock move, the whole face of the cosmograph moves (past the cross hair of the north-south meridian). This is also the perceived motion of the heavens. If one observes the southern sky at the same time each night for several nights in succession, the lunar lodges in sight will appear to move toward the west or clockwise across the sky. The dial of the cosmograph as it is rotated clockwise on the earth plate corresponds to the arc made by the stars as they pass toward their setting in the west. The diviner orients the earth board of the cosmograph to the cardinal directions and matches the heaven plate with the sky. The dipper on the dial will then correspond to (the mirror image of) the constellation in the heavens. If the handle points upwards in the sky, then the dial points to the earthly branch wu or south. When the dipper in the sky is upside down (as if pouring out its contents) with the handle on the right, the dial will point to mao -5P or east. When it is right-side up, with the handle on the left, the dial will point to you M or west. Finally, when the end of the handle is nearest the northern horizon (pointing down), the dial will point to zi ~F or north. If the twenty-eight lodges of the heaven plate are matched with the twenty-eight lodges on the earth board, the dipper will point east on the dial. When the sky is configured in this manner at sunset (as if the dipper were pouring out its contents), it is spring, the season when the people beseech heaven for the enriching rains of the new year. 51.

If the first line presented an image of the heavens turning like a disk on the cosmograph, then the second line pertains to a particular quadrant of that sky (or that disk). In the legendary period of ancient China, on the summer solstice the Fire Star (Antares), da huo JziK, would have culminated at sunset.54 This star, the very essence of the yang force in the night sky, would have been near the meridian on the longest day of the year. A similar event is captured in one of the best known folk songs of the Shijing, "Seventh Month" ("Qiyue" -fa ; Mao 154), the first line of which reads: qiyue liu huo "In the seventh month the Fire descends."55 If we take the two passages from the Huainanzi into account, then the yang li in "Tianwen" might be seen as a metaphysical description of the specific astronomical event depicted as liu huo in "Seventh Month." In addition to the diminution of yang force, the verse might also be referring to the descent of the Fire Star across the southern sky. In verse 80 the subject appears to have changed: da niao he ming, fu yan sangjue ti a Great Bird is calling, crying out, or singing, and it has lost its body or its form. The question is why or how, and the answer to this question also resides in the heavens. The southern palace of the Vermilion Bird encompasses seven lodges, "Eastern Well" (Dong jing JR #), "Carriage Ghost" ('Yu gui H %,), "Willow" (Liu #P) or "Beak" (Zhou fl^), "Seven Stars" (Qi xing -fa JS.) or "Neck" (Jing W), "Spread" (Zhang 51) or "Crop" (Su «%), "Wing" (Yi M), and "Carriage" (Zhen #). As noted above, according to the ancient record Xin, the "Heart" of the Cerulean Dragon, would have culminated on the summer solstice. If one axis of the uranograph is set on this position, the perpendicular axis ninety degrees to the right (i.e., west) falls precisely on the lunar lodge, Zhang, the constellation that would be on the horizon as soon as the sky was dark enough to see the stars. If we project an image of the sky to approximate these criteria, the result is something like Fig. 5.56 Notice that the sun (shown on the dotted line of 54. The Shujing "Yaodian" % ^ says that in those days the Fire Star served to "fix the middle of the summer": iik IE{4&gt; jE; Shangshu zhengyi fnf H IE ii (Sibu beiyao ed.), 2.6a. Da huo is the central star of the constellation Xin /(j, or "Heart," of the Cerulean Dragon. 55. Liu "descending," along with xian M, "rising," zhong 4", "culminating," fu •K, "hiding," and ru A, "setting," are technical terms designating the position of a star in the sky. After a star culminates with the meridian, it descends until it finally gets so close to the sun that it begins to "hide" in the afterglow of sunset. Eventually the star will set with the sun, in which case it will not be seen. 56. I am indebted to Professor Donald W.

With these celestial obser vations in mind the "Tianwen" passage under analysis begins to make sense. It reads as follows: As the heavens turn, (79) [no question] yang ebbs and death ensues. The Great Bird cries, (80) why? and loses its body there. Now we know why the Great Bird cries. At the height of summer the head of the Vermilion Bird is immolated in the sun.

Dusk was the traditional time for astronomical observation.</page><page sequence="22">104 THE INQUIRING POET The "Great Treatise" states that Heaven chui xiang g "dangles images," that reveal good fortune and misfortune and that the sage xiang Hi, "reproduces" them. It is by means of the cosmograph that the sage determines the fortune of the moment. There is thus some likeli hood that the image of the great bird crying in line 80a is some kind of omen.57 A pictorial image like this would make an appropriate neighbor for the "White Tiger" on the "good-omen slab" of the Wu Liang Shrine.58 What is important to our analysis, however, is the apparent connection between the operation of the cosmograph and the meaning of verses 79-80. This connection increases the possibility that line 7a also refers to such astrological and astronomical instruments. If huan ze jiu chong refers not only to the manifold cosmos but also to the manifold cosmograph, then questions 7 and 8 make perfect sense. "Who devised and calibrated" the cosmographical methodology for "fathoming" and "perceiving" the cosmos? "Who first fashioned" the cosmographical model? The early Britons could have asked the same questions about Stonehenge. But we need not rely merely on the similarity of line 7a's huan ze and line 79a's tian shi to establish a connection between the poem and the model. Following the sequence of cosmic evolution that opens "Tian wen," each of the next fourteen verses then draws a picture of the structure of the heavens as perceived by the poet. Some of these pictures are not "observable" in the sky; they are abstracted from the movements of heavenly bodies, and these abstracted figures are discernible in the rings of the cosmograph. I translate the pertinent verses below. Verse 9 reads Gan wei yan xi, tian ji yan jia ^IS M SI 3*5 ® S JO- The obscure graph gan ^ means "wheel-hub cap," and in the Han period derived an extended meaning of "to turn around."59 Wei, we have already encountered as "node" or "knot." So line 9a may be literally translated, "the revolving cords, where are they tied?" Later conceptions of this cosmology likened the cords to the spars of an umbrella. The 57. For example, the gou zhi tyf£ %. "crying pheasant" in the "Gaozong rong ri" Hi 3? 0 chapter of the Shujing is considered to be a bad omen; Shangshu zhengyi (Sibu beiyao ed.), 10.5b (I am indebted to Edward Shaughnessy for this reference). Also, the judgment text of hexagram 62, Xiao guo 'h 3®, "Preponderance of the Small," contains the line "fei niao yi zhi yin" jfe Jil H, "The flying bird brings the message"; Zhouyi zhengyi, 6.10b; Wilhelm/Baynes, The Book of Changes, 240. 58.

The dou J|- radical in the graph may not be coincidental, since the Shuowen jiezi defines the character as li bing "dipper handle"; Xu Shen ff ft, Shuowen jiezi IS (rpt. Beijing: Zhonghua, 1963), 300.</page><page sequence="23">STEPHEN FIELD 105 cross-hairs on a cosmograph are a more appropriate counterpart. Tianji is the "cosmic axis" that passes through the north and south poles. On a cosmograph it would be the pivot that connects the heaven disk to the ground plate. The term jia (read as jia ^§), "to raise," is a direct reference to gaitian H "hemispherical-heaven," cosmology and asks how the umbrella- or tent-like heaven is propped up above the chessboard of the earth. Line 9b may thus be translated, "the heavenly pivot, where is it raised?" Verse 10 reads Ba zhu he dang, dong nan he kui AttM Ba zhu, "the eight pillars," are the eight sacred mountains that hold up the hemispherical heaven. So line 10a reads, "The eight pillars, where are they based?" The question of 10b asks, "In the southeast, why is there a gap?" The Liezi records the events of this verse in the following fashion: tresis mm B B mm When Gong Gong was fighting Zhuan Xu for the Empire, he knocked against Mount Buzhou in his rage, breaking one of the pillars of heaven, snapping one of the threads which support the earth. For this reason heaven leans North West, and the sun, moon and stars move in that direction; the earth does not fill the South East, so the rivers and the rainfloods find their home there.60 This myth in part explains the tilt in the earth's axis, or why in the northern hemisphere the stars appear to revolve around the pole star. It also indicates that the pillars of heaven and the threads (or cords) of earth are somehow connected, which explains why the "Tianwen" poet connected them in the narrative of his poem. Verse 11 reads Jiu tian zhiji, an fang an shu A 5c 5: $1:5:11. Thejiu tian, or "nine heavens,"61 of line 11a are celestial fields into which the twenty-eight lunar lodges (and the intervening spaces) are divided.62 A whole quatrain is dedicated to this concept, the poet asking how these 60.

Here is an instance where the number "nine" does retain numerical significance. Another instance is the jiu zhou Ail+I of line 36a, the "nine regions," first appearing in the "Yu gong" fS, Jf chapter of Shujing, the Book of Documents (see Major, "Five Phases," 137). "The nine fields of the sky represent a somewhat arbitrary attempt to give the earthly pattern a celestial counterpart," according to Hawkes (Songs of the South, 136-7). Thus each celestial field had its corresponding earthly region, and a celestial anomaly could then be said to portend events in a particular area of China. 62. The Lushi chunqiu locates jiuye A IF, or the "nine fields" of heaven, in the nine directions (four cardinal points, four corners, and the center), and names three (in one case four) lodges for each field; see Lushi chunqiu, 13.1a-lb; see also Huainanzi, 3.2b-3a.</page><page sequence="24">106 THE INQUIRING POET fields are connected. There is some speculation that the jiu tian were also derived from the cosmograph (another name for these partitions is the jiu gong or "nine palaces").63 The innermost band of some earth plates is marked with eight of the ten heavenly stems, and these positions correspond to the eight raised "bosses" on bronze TLV mirrors of Han and later periods (representing the eight pillars).64 If straight lines are drawn through opposing bosses across the board (forming the Chinese character for "well," jing #), then nine squares of equal pro portion will result. Eight boxes would correspond to the eight compass points and one to the center. Verse 11 may be translated, "Where lie the borders of the nine fields of heaven, and where do they connect?" Verse 12 reads Yu wei duo you, shei zhi qi shu which may be translated, "Numerous are their edges and angles, who knows how many?" As to the question of "angles," there is a plausible answer. From early times constellations have been represented in China graphically by connecting the stars together with lines.65 A ring-map of the xiu would thus consist of a circle of twenty-eight adjacent angular star configurations.66 When the "Tianwen" poet questions the number of "edges and angles" along the borders of the nine heavens, we must wonder if he has in mind a star chart whose fields are a maze of corners where different constellations intersect. Verse 13 reads Tian he suo ta, shi er yanfen ^-fBI£fri8' + —If In line 13a the character ta § (or ta ™) means "to touch, reach."67 Many com mentators insert an "earth" here and visualize heaven as "overlapping" or "adjoining" it.68 But the narrative demands instead that tian represent the various heavenly phenomena, which will then be enumerated one 63.

A painted motif on a neolithic pottery shard unearthed in Dahecun A M near Zhengzhou in Henan province, is composed of three or more round dots connected by straight and curved lines.

For example, line 13b introduces the con cept of shier + —, the "twelve." These are reference points, called chert M, on the ecliptic marking the twelve occurrences of a new moon (i.e., the xiu in which the sun sets when the sun and moon are in conjunc tion). On the cosmograph these twelve points are inscribed on two dif ferent tracks using the twelve cyclical characters known as the earthly branches. They appear on the heaven disk in the middle ring just inside the outer ring of the twenty-eight xiu. They also appear on the middle row of the square earth plate.69 Each chen sits above a particular xiu in the outer row or ring and designates the constellation in which the sun is lodging that month. Verse 13 may then be translated, "How do the heavens mesh? Where are the twelve divisions?" It is generally the case that the two halves of a verse are topically related, and often "answers are suggestively shown in the following question."70 Thus, the "mesh ing" of heavenly bodies determines the division of the twelve chen. But where exactly are these divisions? The next line suggests an answer. Verse 14 reads Ri yue an shu, lie xing an chen El :?c ® M 3? I^- The word shu, "attached to," when describing the relationship between sun and moon, refers to the phenomenon of moon phases. Thus 14a reads, "How does the sun bond with the moon?" If the new moon marks the beginning of a new partition of the ecliptic, then the full moon marks its midpoint. The xiu that is setting when the full moon is rising marks the median of a particular chen. Line 14b finally introduces the lie xing or "arrayed stars" (those whose patterns were observed and named by the sages). It reads, "How are the patterned stars arrayed?" These are none other than the twenty-eight xiu. One last pair of verses provides evidence that the author of "Tian wen" was familiar with a cosmograph or similar instrument. Verses 21 and 22 read as follows: What closes, then darkness? What opens, then brightness? Before the Horn rises, where hides the Heavenly Light? 69. This could explain why the earliest commentators perceived a heaven "joined" to earth in these lines. It is true that the earthly branches also represented compass points on the cosmograph (the line through zi 7' and wu 71 marked north and south). When the diviner placed the cosmograph with north at the bottom, then he could visualize the top half (the east-south-west plane) of the earth board as the horizon of his vantage point in space (with north at his back). The revolving heaven disk would then become an approximation of the arc of the twenty-eight xiu as they headed west across the southern sky. 70. Blanford, "A Study of Chuci 'Tianwen'/' 46.</page><page sequence="26">108 THE INQUIRING POET Verse 21 clearly refers to the rising and setting of the sun, while line 22a refers to the rising of the lunar lodge Jue M, "Horn," the leading constellation of the Cerulean Dragon. The question of line 22b asks the location of the setting sun when the Horn is about to rise. For those who knew the approximate night of the Horn's rise, the setting sun of the appropriate evening could first be sighted along the east-west cord of the cosmograph, and then the eastern terminus would indicate the point on the eastern horizon where the Horn would soon rise.71 Since there is hesitation by some scholars in accepting the cosmograph as an observational astronomical instrument, we might speculate instead that it was the uranograph which was used to first sight the rising Horn. Then the western terminus of the east-west cord would indicate the lunar lodge in which the sun was "hiding." The Inquiring Poet We can now return to the problem of the tone in which to read the lines of "Tianwen." We have seen how the poet initially expressed doubt in the ability to comprehend the origin of the cosmos (1-4). But when the world gained dimension, a methodology for its comprehen sion could be established and a model devised (5-8). Once rotund heav en made its debut the investigation of the structure of the cosmos was almost "empirical."72 In regard to various observable phenomena (either in the heavens or on the cosmograph), for example, where is it tied, where is it raised, where does it reach, etc. These questions focus our attention on key concepts in contemporary (fourth c. B.C.) astronomical lore. The poet is not simply engaging in a kind of philosophical musing. His questions are an intellectual response to a particular world view. That response is unabashedly materialistic. If the poem ended here we 71. I owe this observation to John Major, who dealt with the issue of the cor relations of the rising and setting sun with lunar lodges in his article, "Notes on the Nomenclature of Winds and Directions in the Early Han," T'oung Pao 65:1-3 (1979), 66-80. 72. Verses 15-16 may be questioning the velocity of the sun. The verses read as follows: Leave from sunny vale, at shrouded shore rest; How long is the journey from brightness to dark? Verse 15 describes a moving body that "leaves" from the east and "rests" in the west, so the question may be not one of distance (D) alone. Since a journey has a beginning and end, the factor of time (T) enters into the equation: D/T=V (velocity); see Luo Man M'®, "Zhanguo yuzhou benti dataolun yu Tianwen de chansheng" US ^ ^ ^XMm$l^.fflitiM£.,Wenxueyictian X * St M, 1988.1,45-53.</page><page sequence="27">STEPHEN FIELD 109 would be confident in identifying it as a record of proto-scientific inquiry. But as the poem progresses we are more likely to detect a mood of dissatisfaction in the way that questions are put, and the topics chosen for scrutiny often betray a certain polemical slant. That is because, beginning with verse 23, the subject abruptly changes from the material heavens to the politics of earth. Yet the investigation is no less objective. The legendary tale of the flood-quellers Gun M and Yu p| leads off this section of "Tianwen." Then verses 36-45 detail the topography of Yu's "nine regions," followed by verses 46-56 which detail other aspects of that geography, including fantastic flora and fauna.73 From verse 57 to the end of the poem (almost 70% of the text), the poet analyzes history, in particular the rise and fall of dynastic houses.74 We have seen how the material aspects of heaven are described at length. But then the poet turns his gaze to the world of man, a world apparently under the control of a willful deity.75 The conflict between these two views of the world informs the remainder of the text. Altogether then, the poem is a chronological sequence of events that outlined the evolution of the world from the undifferentiated cosmos to heavenly mandated rule. Each event was accompanied by a question that probably reflected the liberal parameters of the ongoing debate in intellectual centers of late Warring States China. The poet obviously knew more than what the standard texts record, and if the rest of the poem is scrutinized it will be evident that the poet was also questioning the sanitizing process undertaken by the official historians. Did our poet, like Zou Yan, also have a new concept of history to proclaim?76 Is 73. Verses 36-56 follow upon the record of the hydraulic engineering of Gun and Yu. Verse 57 returns to Yu, but focuses now on his domestic life and his political difficulties. The implication of the narrative is that the topographical and geographical wonders as enumerated in the poem were experienced by Yu in his travels about the nine realms as he brought the flood waters under control. Many of the strange sights mentioned in these verses are also mentioned in the Shanhaijing, which supposedly describes the travels of Yu. 74. According to Lin Geng this is the true focus of "Tianwen"; see the preface to his Tianwen lunjian [M3 H §§ (Beijing: Renmin wenxue, 1983). Lin believes that "Tianwen" is a shishi jfe W, "historical poem," or epic. The relation of Heaven to man in the form of the Heavenly Mandate occupied the center of this historical process and thus was especially susceptible to questioning by the poet. An apparent ambivalence in regard to the proper dispensation of this mandate is evident in verses 135-142. 75. The character Gun, the father of Yu, is pitiable in "Tianwen," not despicable as in contemporary texts. So in verses 26-27 the poet questions the deity's motivation in punishing him. 76. According to Shiji (74.2344), Zou Yan conducted a similar project:</page><page sequence="28">110 THE INQUIRING POET he questioning his world with the intention of correcting an improper world view? The poet was subjecting the material world of heaven and the legendary and historical world of man to rigorous analysis. In the process he strengthened the materialist world view and discredited the orthodox historical revisions that were obscuring the past. If the motion of the heavens is the only constant in the cosmos, then what is the basis for man's reliance on a so-called "mandate" of heaven? Is man really subject to the whims of a deity? This is the tone of the greater portion of the "Heaven Questions." Such a revolutionary ideology could not be stated directly, so the poet camouflaged his narrative in a litany of questions. Thanks to the pioneering work of Chinese and Western scholars in this century and the discovery of cosmological models in Han tomb sites, that code is finally beginning to be broken. From the time when the heavens and earth were separated down to the present, he stated in detail the revolutions and transmutations of the Five Powers; the rule of each having its appropriate character, omens and portents responded accordingly.</page></plain_text>
