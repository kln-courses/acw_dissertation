<plain_text><page sequence="1">99 Context and Chronology of the carved stone at Clonfmlough, County Offaly Elizabeth Shee Twohig The aims of this paper are firstly to present a more accurate drawing and complete description of the Clonfmlough stone than has hitherto been available, and, secondly, to re-assess the archaeological context of the carvings on the stone. Introduction One of the first publications on rock art and megalithic art in Ireland was a paper by James Graves, which included a description of the carvings on a boulder at Clonfmlough, Co Offaly, with an accompanying drawing by George V Du Noyer (Graves 1865). These carvings were recognised as being different from rock art such as that which had been described in a paper read to the Royal Irish Academy in 1860 by its then President, Charles Graves.1 Even now, as we shall see, nothing quite like the Clonfmlough carvings appears to have been recorded in Ireland or Britain. What differentiates them from other rock art is the presence of a distinctive motif, consisting of a straight line intersecting with an oval, like a Greek letter (p, and thus they have become known as phi figures. There are also many crosses, cupmarks and solution hollows on the stone. The carvings on the Clonfmlough stone thus contrast with the general form of rock art in Ireland, which is characterised mainly by cup and ring markings. Although it is now becoming clear that cup and ring type of rock art can vary from region to region with in Ireland, with each area having its own distinctive characteristics,2 nevertheless these carvings belong to one broad genre, which finds comparisons in northern Britain and in the Galician area of north-west Spain, as discussed for example by Mac White (1946) and most recently by Bradley (1997). Other groups of carvings in Ireland include passage tomb art, while a third form can now be identified, consisting of examples of incised carvings in a variety of locations (Shee Twohig, 2004). The aims of this paper are firstly to present a more accurate drawing and complete description of the Clonfmlough stone than has hitherto been available, and, secondly, to re-assess the archaeological context of the carvings on the stone. This re-consideration was prompted initial ly by some disquiet with, on the one hand, the tradition or convention of the carvings being assigned to the Bronze Age, for example in the Archaeological Inventory for County Offaly (O'Brien and Sweetman 1997, 17) whereas, on the other hand, they are generally omitted from discussions on Irish rock art. Furthermore, the stone has never been adequately recorded,3 and its current state of preservation is not very satisfactory as it is subject to weathering agencies and to wear and tear due to trampling by humans and probably by animals; this despite the fact Department of Archaeology, JRSAIVol. 132 (2002): 99-113 University College Cork.</page><page sequence="2">100 ELIZABETH SHEE TWOHIG S* Roads ?

Jackson (1967, 11) as a 'glacial erratic boulder of bedded limestone of the Carboniferous age lying within the glacio-fluvial gravels [of the Esker Riada complex]'. The carved face measures 3m x 2.45m and the stone is over 0.75m thick.5 The sur face of the stone is currently covered with lichens and mosses, and it is very weathered. The stone lies between 50m - 60m OD, on the southern slope of the western end of Esker Hill (Fig. 78).6 The carved face slopes down towards the southwest, and the view from the stone is very extensive, spanning from northeast round to the northwest.7 The view northwards is impeded by Esker Hill. The stone lies just east of Fin Lough, on whose southwestern shore a Late Bronze age crannog-type settlement (Fig. 78, site 1) has been excavated (Moloney 1993). The major monastic site of Clonmacnoise is situated c 3.5km west north west of the Clonfinlough stone.</page><page sequence="3">CONTEXT AND CHRONOLOGY OF THE CARVED STONE AT CLONFINLOUGH, COUNTY OFFALY 101 y&gt;^ V^IL ^-X. / &lt; \\ '-* **', f\c G?r rrf" 2&gt;.A I I -. /- ? i v ( v;. ^ ,?&gt;, rr ?t f\ Fig.79: Drawing of the carved stone at Clonfinlough, Co.

The final drawing was traced off from the draft, taking into account the textures and depths of the carvings as recorded on a series of photographs; it attempts to give an impression of the tex ture of the stone rather than just a recording of the motifs. The carvings were difficult to record</page><page sequence="4">102 ELIZABETH SHEE TWOHIG Fig. 80: Photograph (1957) of the carved stone at Clonfmlough, Co. Offaly. because the edges of the motifs are not clearly defined. Experimental rubbings were also made, using carbon paper wrapped around a sponge and rubbing onto drawing paper, but these were not utilizable due to the rough and irregular surface of the stone. The photograph (Fig. 80) reproduced here was taken in 1957 and comes from the archives of the Department of the Environment, Local Government and Heritage, National Monuments Section.8 In this photo graph, the carvings are naturally illuminated by low evening light, an effect which cannot now be achieved due to subsequent growth of the hedgerow to the west of the stone. As already noted, previous illustrations of this stone do not provide an adequate record: Du Noyer's drawing (in Graves 1865, figs 1 and 2) simplified the details of the carvings on the stone, especially the hollows and irregularities on its upper part. In addition, some of the motifs are mis aligned; for example, he depicted a number of motifs on the 'top right' corner of the stone at about 30? anticlockwise to their true position, and an extra cross is shown at the centre right of the stone. J.S. Jackson's illustration (1967, fig. 1) is primarily a diagram to demonstrate the argu ments he was making about the carvings. As a professional geologist, Jackson was principally concerned with discussing the carvings in relation to the geology of the stone and he himself noted that his illustration suffered from foreshortening and the effects of perspective</page><page sequence="5">CONTEXT AND CHRONOLOGY OF THE CARVED STONE AT CLONFINLOUGH, COUNTY OFFALY 103 because of being drawn from a photograph. The top of the figure in particular lacks detail, and the individual motifs are shown in stylised form with no attempt to represent their depth or width. In addition, as will be shown below, the distortion caused by working from an unrectified photo graph has implications for Jackson's hypothesis, which he does not appear to have considered. The designs I will first describe the designs as they appear on the stone, from the perspective of a viewer standing down slope of the stone, as it is traditionally represented; of course, this was not necessarily how it was originally viewed. The motifs extend over the whole of the main surface of the stone. They comprise of a range of crosses, some with the vertical line longer than the horizontal ('Latin' crosses) and some equi-armed crosses. One of the Latin crosses near the top of the stone has slightly expanded terminals, and unlike the other crosses, its long axis is more or less horizontal. The most distinctive motifs are the eleven so-called 'phi figures', all of which occur on the lower part of the stone. In these, an oval or D-shape is set more or less symmetrically on a longer, vertical, line, with the long axis of the oval at right angles to the line. In five of these fig ures the 'vertical' line stops short at the top of the oval, in the other six it continues both above and below the oval. In these phi' motifs the vertical line is generally clearly carved, and some what v-shaped in section, and the oval is usually carved less deeply, particularly just where the lower part of the oval joins the straight line. This feature is especially clear on the central carv ing at the bottom edge of the stone. In most of the phi motifs, the upper, horizontal section of the oval is somewhat flattened, while the lower part is curved, resulting in a D-shape. Several relatively small, and mostly shallow, cupmarks occur between the crosses and phi figures on the lower part of the stone. There are some deeper crosses on the upper part of the stone, together with a very large number of cupmarks and elongated hollows of varying depths. In early descriptions, some of these were interpreted as footprints, notably an example on the left of the centre of the stone. It seems more likely that this is an adventitious combination of hollows rather than a footprint representation. The initials DOD are carved on the bottom left of the stone, and EP (or ER) is cut near the right edge. These letters are obviously relatively recent, being shallow and unweathered, and neither is shown on Du Noyer's drawing, so they were probably carved after his visit to the site. The DOD initials are just visible on a photograph published in 1949 (Macalister 1949, Plate I). Natural or artificial? The Clonfmlough carvings differ from rock carvings generally, not only because of the phi motifs, but also in the fact that the carvings are on limestone, in contrast with the more wide spread use of sandstone. At the time of the first publication, Graves (1865, 361) had suggested that the cupmarks were '.. .perhaps the natural results of the lodgement of rain water, perhaps deepened...' and he reported that similar 'cup-like hollows' could be seen elsewhere in the neighbourhood; Du Noyer, who was working for the Geological Survey at that time (Coffey 1993) may have contributed to these observations. More recently, J. S. Jackson, also a profes sional geologist, examined the stone from a geological point of view, and argued that not only</page><page sequence="6">104 ELIZABETH SHEE TWOHIG were the cupmarks and related hollows created by natural weathering, but that the straight lines are also natural, 'though possibly retouched artificially' (Jackson 1967, 17). He accepted, how ever, that the circles or ovals forming the phi figures were 'palpably artificial' (ibid. 18). Some of the cupmarks and elongated hollows are rather flat bottomed, and Jackson argued that this feature results from the relatively acidic rainwater dissolving the outer surface of the limestone, but not penetrating the harder layer beneath. In more technical terms, quoting Jackson (ibid.), this is due to 'chemical solution effects' where 'the limestone of the outer bed or stratum is relatively pure, and therefore, readily soluble, whilst the underlying stratum is more argillaceous, or muddy, and, therefore, more resistant to chemical solution in carbonic and humic acids. This inevitably results in flat-bottomed depressions with markedly steep sides'. Jackson argued that the chemical solution effects are also shown by the 'distance of the bottom of the pit below the outer surface being remarkably uniform'. However, there is actually a con siderable range of depths, and some of the hollows are barely perceptible. It is true, however, that the deepest ones are flat bottomed and steep sided, in keeping with the argument for their being due to natural weathering down to the harder stratum. But they might well have been carved initially, possibly even to the harder layer; or an artificial cupmark might have deepened naturally as far as the hard layer. Some of the cupmarks have an asymmetrical cross-section, being deeper on the downward side of the cup; this may be the result of rainwater lodging in the cup and dissolving its interior differentially. It seems likely, therefore, that some of the cupmarks and hollows are natural, or have deepened through natural erosion, and this has long been accepted. Jackson also suggested a mostly natural origin for the lines on the stone. He argued that since these correspond so closely to the directions of the lines of the dip and strike joints they were probably caused by weathering, the joints being 'chemically attacked' by the calcium carbonate (or lime) in the rock and removing it in the form of calcium bicarbonate. Run-off water tends to be channelled along the dip joints, so that they develop into conspicuous longi tudinal grooves. Jackson presented (ibid. fig. 2), the orientations of a randomly selected sample of 18 figures, and argued that the range of the angles of the longitudinal and horizontal lines coincided so closely with the angle of the dip joints and strike joints respectively that these lines should be seen as natural result of chemical action discussed above. However, a number of lines do not fit the pattern. Another difficulty with this argument is that Jackson's plot of the direction of the lines is presumably based on his diagram of the stone (ibid. fig. 1), which he himself cautioned was heavily distorted, thus the direction of the lines are not accurately depicted. Selecting the lines to be plotted is also problematic. If we take all 42 long lines (i.e. those argued by Jackson to be dip joints) rather than just the 18 'randomly selected' by Jackson and plot them from my drawing (Fig. 79) of the stone, we find that 25 of these fall within a 25? arc, but over all they span an arc of 90?. While it seems likely that such lines could develop naturally along the joints of the stone, there seems no reason why they should have developed in so many cases as cross forms, with the lines intersecting more or less symmetrically. If this were really a natural phenomenon, the lines would surely have resulted in more irregular combinations, with, for example, a range of patterns such as: -| \-1 =j| =|=|= or otner combination of right angled lines, rather than the much more limited repertoire of +. The dominance of + motifs therefore</page><page sequence="7">CONTEXT AND CHRONOLOGY OF THE CARVED STONE AT CLONFINLOUGH, COUNTY OFFALY 105 suggests that this is not a natural development, though the carvers may have taken advantage of naturally occurring grooves in the stone. In fact, Jackson accepted that 'some or all of the orig inal solution modified grooves may have been retouched or deepened artificially, as may also the sides of certain solution pits, including the 'footprint" (ibid. 18). In summary, I believe that the ovals or Ds forming the phi motifs must clearly be accepted as artificial. It is possible, therefore, that this boulder may have had naturally occurring circular and elongated hollows, and possibly some longitudinal grooves, but that human agencies altered and supplemented these, with horizontal grooves more or less symmetrically arranged to form crosses, together with ovals to form phi motifs. The question of dating and the possibility of more than one phase of carving will be discussed below. History of Interpretation Graves recorded that the local name for this stone was the Fairy's Stone, or the Horseman's Stone, and that 'a legend.. .tells that a horseman gallops round it at certain times' (Graves 1865, 360). A local antiquarian told Graves that it was called Una more, but Graves says he was not given this name by the people of the area (ibid., 361). The initial interpretation for the phi motifs, by Graves, was as penannular brooches or ring brooches as he called them, though he also saw some as 'pommels of rudely marked daggers'. Graves regarded the elongated hollows as 'impressions of the human foot'. The carvings were largely ignored until the revival of interest in Irish rock art following the visit to Ireland in 1920 of the Abbe Breuil with Miles Burkitt, when they were shown a range of sites by R.A.S. Macalister.9 The phi motifs were seen as fitting into the increasingly anthro pomorphic interpretation of rock art and particularly passage tomb art (Shee Twohig 1998). The motifs were interpreted as figures with arms on hips or 'akimbo'. Breuil (1921, 76) recognised that the Clonfinlough carvings were very different from those of other sites in Ireland, and he compared the phi figures and the 'footprints' with Spanish petroglyphs. He thought there might be a certain affinity with cup and ring carvings but also (ibid. 78) argued for parallels with the simpler motifs of the series III Art Rupestre in Spain. In the same year Macalister published Breuil's notes, reporting that Breuil had immediately identified parallels for the Clonfinlough figures in Spanish Neolithic paintings and that the slab was 'undoubtedly akin to the Neolithic rock engravings and paintings of Spain, and is certainly Neolithic or early Aeneolithic' (Breuil and Macalister 1921, 6). Macalister also (1921, 224) developed the interpretation to a possible depiction of a battle between the 'loop-men' and the 'cross-men', and suggested that the cup marks ...may even indicate the number of severed heads!' A new element of interpretation appears in Macalister's book The Archaeology of Ireland, where he saw the carvings as show ing a battle or pre-battle scene, 'the medicine men having prepared for their occult purposes a picture of the consummation desired' (Macalister 1928, 96). In the second edition of the same book published in 1949, Macalister saw it as a sign-manual of an expedition from Spain ...in the Stone-Bronze Overlap.. .probably a hostile expedition, which sailed up the Shannon. The battle or post-battle idea is also put forward again, with the victors shown contemplating '...the battlefield, printed with the foot-marks of the flying foe, strewn with weapons cast away in their flight and with missile stones', or alternatively as a pre-battle carving '... being less to preserve</page><page sequence="8">106 ELIZABETH SHEE TWOHIG a record for posterity than to secure the victory by magic' (Macalister 1949, 52). In 1951, Estyn Evans, combining a review of the new edition of The Archaeology of Ireland with an obituary for Macalister, noted (Evans 1951, 4) that by then Macalister was writing 'without reserve' about the stone; Evans (ibid. 5-6) concluded the review by suggesting it would be kinder to remember Macalister's other achievements. Meanwhile, Breuil (1934, 291) had discussed the stone briefly in his Presidential Address to the Prehistoric Society of East Anglia, in which he classed it as 'unique of its kind in Ireland' and belonging to the group of oldest decorative art in Ireland (together with Rathkenny/ Tinure/Ballydorragh).10 He again compared it with open-air paintings and engravings of Spain and also with the engravings on the dolmens and rocks of Guerande, such as Meniscoul, in the Loire Inferieure. Mac White's (1946) ground-breaking review of rock art, divided Irish 'rock-scribings' into two groups: (1) with passage grave associations, and (2) Galician cup and ring carvings. He thought that the Clonfmlough carvings did not belong to either of the groups, but saw them as having '... affinities in the earlier group Galician carvings...' (ibid. 59 and footnote), though he did not give the reasons for this deduction. Discussion Any discussion of the Clonfmlough carvings must focus on the phi figures and the crosses, due to their apparent uniqueness in these islands. Although the earliest rock-art researchers in Ireland envisaged the carvings as belonging to the early Christian period, in recent times it has become common to assign them all to the Bronze Age or more recently Later Neolithic/Bronze Age. However, many carvings on outcrops or boulders do no fit the standard 'cup and ring' style. For example, van Hoek (1993) discussed examples of Christian carvings in County Donegal, and I have recently written about many incised carvings in Ireland (Shee Twohig 2004). In Britain too, examples of probable early Christian period carvings have been discussed by Laing (1996) and Petts (2002). In the context of the Clonfmlough figures, it is appropriate to look to western Iberia, follow ing Breuil's lead of eighty years ago, since the phi figures constitute a considerable element of the rock art repertoire there, and their dating has been the subject of recent research. Martinez Garcia (1995) has shown that there too, until recently, a prehistoric date tended to be assigned to all rock carvings. He has discussed the development of the discovery of carvings and paintings at the beginning of the twentieth century and their attribution by Breuil to a prehistoric context. While many are certainly Bronze Age, it is now evident that many in fact belong to the historic period and Martinez Garcia stresses the importance of looking at the carvings in their context. Costas Goberna and Pereira Garcia (1998) have identified a number of sites in Galicia where cross motifs overlie Bronze Age designs (ibid, figs 8, 37,38), and they show one example of a phi figure overlying concentric circles, at Pedra Moura, Coruxo, Vigo, Pontevedra (ibid. fig. 18). The phi figures are found also on a number of medieval buildings (mainly 13th- 14th century) in north west Spain (ibid. 149-151 and fig. 19). Some of these are certainly masons' marks, as can be seen on the medieval columns of the transepts of the cathedral at Santiago de Compostela, La Corufia (Fig. 81) and crosses appear also to have functioned as pilgrims' marks (ibid. 163).</page><page sequence="9">CONTEXT AND CHRONOLOGY OF THE CARVED STONE AT CLONFINLOUGH, COUNTY OFFALY 107 Fig. 81: Some motifs for comparison (various scales) a Masons' mark in transept of Cathedral at Santiago de Compostela, La Coruna. b Carvings in rear chamber of El Pozuelo cave, Zamora (after Alves 2002) c Carpenters' mark on roof timbers of Salisbury Cathedral (after Tatton Brown and Miles 2003). d Carving of labyrinth on stone from Lockstown Upper, Co. Wicklow (Hollywood) (after Raftery 1951) Bradley, however, has suggested that the Bronze Age Schematic Art style carvings at the cave of El Pedroso, Zamora may have been re-worked in a later period (Bradley 2000, 111-113; 2002, 115 and pers. comm.). He notes (ibid.) that Lara Alves has suggested that at this site the Copper Age or Early Bronze Age male figures with arms akimbo were selectively re-cut using a different tool, emphasising certain features of the original design, transforming the (prehistoric) anthropomorphs into drawings of the crucifixion. Bradley (ibid.) reports that, elsewhere, human figures were transformed into pictures of a communion chalice, and he raises the question of whether those who transformed the designs did so because they interpreted the older paintings or drawings in the light of medieval imagery. Alves contrasts the cupmarks of the outer part of the El Pedroso cave with the anthropomorphic carvings of the inner part, amongst which can be seen a carving very like the Clonfinlough phi (Fig. 81b), but with forking of the vertical line, as on the Santiago Masons' marks (Fig. 81a), and also crosses like those at Clonfinlough (Alves 2002, figs. 4.5 - 4.7). Another role suggested for these carvings in Galicia is as boundary marks</page><page sequence="10">108 ELIZABETH SHEE TWOHIG ('petroglifos de termino'), with many examples published in 1952 by Ferro Couselo (Costas Gobema and Novoa Alvarez 1993, 229-238). This Iberian evidence suggests the possibility that Clonfinlough carvings may belong to the historic period. The local context has to be considered, for as already noted, the stone lies only 3.5 km from Clonmacnoise. Graves (1865, 360) reported that '...close to this boulder, on the old boher which led to the Seven Churches of Clonmacnoise before the present road was formed, is a caim called Leacht-na-Marra, or the Monument of the Dead, where, to the present day, when a funeral approaches that famed burial ground, the coffin is laid down, and stones thrown on the caim.' This 'boher' [road] and the position of the caim are marked on a copy of the first edition of the Ordnance Survey (six inches=lmile) map for the area held in the Du Noyer papers in the collections of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland. The annotation on the map is initialled JG, and is almost certainly attributable to James Graves. The features relevant to this discussion are shown on Fig 1 here; the line A is annotated as 'ancient road (still paved in parts) along the edge of the esker' and nearer the western end, A is marked 'Paved togher, very large slabs like 'Pilgrims Road' between churches and nunnery at Clonmacnoise'. The caim (B on Fig. 78) is marked c. 250m north of the Clonfinlough stone.11 Traditionally the Pilgrims' Way is regarded as mnning east west about 2km north of the stone (e.g. in Harbison 1991, 116-117), so it is interesting to have discovered the line of this more southerly route towards Clonmacnoise from the east. The proximity of the Clonfinlough stone to one of the old routes to Clonmacnoise suggests that the carvings might relate to the activities of pilgrims or other users of the road in the his toric period. Manning (1998, 81-82) has identified Tomaltagh McDermot as the probable patron for the 15th century additions to the Cathedral at Clonmacnoise and notes also that McDermot and others made a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in 1445 (O'Donovan 1846, 211-212). Against this, however, it must be remembered that Graves stated that '...no Christian rite was ever performed at the Clonfinlough stone... [despite the fact that] ...in this neighbourhood Christian tradition is busy with almost every stone, boher and tougher...' (Graves 1865, 360). Liam Price suggested that the boulder, known as the Hollywood stone, from Lockstown, Co. Wicklow which is carved with a large labyrinth design (Fig. 8Id), was probably of Christian significance rather than belonging to the prehistoric period, and that it was related to the pilgrimage road to Glendalough (Price 1940, 260).12 Harbison and Lynam (2002, 36) also see this labyrinth as a Christian symbol. Labyrinths are known also in Spanish rock art, where some are seen as Late Bronze Age (Carrera Ramirez et al. 2002, 75) or later, and in one instance a labyrinth is overlain by crosses (Martinez Garcia 1995, fig. 8). Interestingly, the innermost part of the labyrinth is very similar to the phi motif. The phi motifs may be seen as a version of the cross motif, or as anthropomorphic figures. No such figures occur on any of the 700 slabs or parts of slabs recorded at Clonmacnoise, which are almost invariably more finely and carefully carved, with the exception of CLN00484 which is recorded as having a simple rather cmdely carved cross.13</page><page sequence="11">CONTEXT AND CHRONOLOGY OF THE CARVED STONE AT CLONFINLOUGH, COUNTY OFFALY 109 The possibility of two periods of carving for the Clonfmlough stone must also be consid ered. As already noted, most of the ovals of the phi figures have a straighter and deeper top line, while the lower line is shallower, particularly where it runs to the main vertical line. The lower part of the oval forming the phi may be an addition to an original Latin cross (which as already noted might be partially natural, or a development of natural lines on the stone). Alternatively, the horizontal part of the phi figures may have been deepened in a second phase of activity. Another possible parallel for the phi figures is to be found in one version of the Arabic form of the numeral for zero. These are recorded as appearing in England from the 13th century onwards (Hill 1915), replacing Roman numerals in certain situations. Hill reported their use in the form of dates on a variety of media such as manuscripts, stone or brass monuments and on bells. More recently, Tatton Brown and Miles (2003, 368) reported them being used by carpenters' working on the timbers cut in 1222 for the roof of Salisbury Cathedral (Fig. 81c). However, despite the similarity between some of these early versions of the Arabic numeral 0 and the phi figures, it seems difficult to explain why eleven Arabic 0s should have been deeply and apparently randomly carved on a boulder without any of the other numerals, unless we see the straight lines as representing the number 1. Summary and Conclusions In summary, therefore, we have seen firstly that it is not possible to dismiss the markings on this stone as largely natural; the ovals/Ds must be artificial and it is likely that the crosses are basically artificial also. In regard to the date of the carvings, a number of different scenarios for the Clonfmlough stone can be proposed: All the carvings were done in prehistoric times The crosses were carved in prehistoric times, and were transformed into/?/*/ figures (when?) by the addition of the lower part of oval/Ds, which as noted, are often shallower than the upper part of the oval/D Phi figures were carved first (in prehistory?), with the cross elements deepened in Christian rituals, perhaps by pilgrims en route to or from Clonmacnoise.14 All the carvings were done in the historic times as marks of Christian pilgrims, associated with the route to Clonmacnoise or to one of its boundaries. A less likely possibility is that the carvings represent the Arabic numerals of 0 and 1. To me, the evidence seems to point to a historic context for the carvings on the Clonfinlough stone, and its relationship to Clonmacnoise seems to be to be a cogent element of this read ing. No absolutely final solution seems possible at present; my aim has been to provide a more adequate record of this interesting stone and to expand the discussion.</page><page sequence="12">110 ELIZABETH SHEE TWOHIG BIBLIOGRAPHY ALVES, L.B., 2002 The architecture of the natural world: rock art in western Iberia.

UJA 56, 139-47 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS My thanks to the following for information and advice: Richard Bradley, Rosemary Cramp, Ann Lynch, Aidan MacDonald, Paul McMahon, Tomas O Carragain and Elizabeth Okasha. I am particularly grateful to Con Manning for drawing my attention to the map annotated by James Graves and for discussion of its annotations. My thanks also to Robin Turk for Fig. 78 and to Rhoda Cronin for drawing the final versions of Figs 79 and 81.1 am grateful to the pho tographic section of the National Monuments section of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for the use of the photograph (Fig. 80), to the Archaeological Services Unit, UCC for technical help, and to the Department of Archaeology, UCC for finan cial support. NOTES 1 The paper on rock art in County Kerry was read to the Royal Irish Academy on 13 February 1860 by Charles Graves, but was not published until much later, and then twice, in both C. Graves (1873) and J. Graves (1877). 2 One can see differences between the carvings in several regions, notably Donegal (Van Hoek 1987 and 1988); Carlow (Brindley and Kilfeather 1993); Louth/Monaghan (Nolan 1999); the Dingle (Long 2002) and Iveragh (Purcell 2002) peninsulas of County Kerry. 3 Problems with the illustrations that accompany both of the two previous principal discussions of the stone will be discussed below. 4 My thanks to Dr Ann Lynch, National Monuments Section, Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (formerly Duchas) for confirming this point. 5 It is firmly embedded in the ground and the exact thickness cannot be determined. 6 Nat.

Burkitt was a young archaeology lecturer at Cambridge and Macalister was Professor of Archaeology at University College Dublin. They visited sites throughout Ireland in April and May 1920, and wrote several papers individually and together about the carved sites they had visited. In their publications the place name is given as 'Cloonfinlough', which is still the local pronunciation. 10 For a recent discussion of these carvings see Shee Twohig (2004) 11 I am grateful to Mr Con Manning, current President of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, for drawing my attention to this map; Mr Manning will publish full details of the annotations on the map.</page><page sequence="15">CONTEXT AND CHRONOLOGY OF THE CARVED STONE AT CLONFINLOUGH, COUNTY OFFALY 113 12 Price argued against the prehistoric date proposed by earlier scholars such as Bremer, Macalister, Mahr and Breuil on the basis that the stone should be seen in its local context, and that labyrinths were certainly of the Christian period, though also known earlier. 13 An archive of photographs of the Clonmacnoise slabs is held in the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The location of this particular slab is not now known. 14 This may have been something similar to 'modern' pilgrimage activity, as part of the rounding rituals, where incised crosses are known to have been deepened, resulting in v-sectioned crosses which are markedly shallower at their terminals. See 6 Carragain (2003) for discussion of such crosses and of crosses carved on boulders as boundary markers. For incised markings see also Shee Twohig (2004)</page></plain_text>
