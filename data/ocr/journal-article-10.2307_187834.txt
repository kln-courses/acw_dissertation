DA COSTA Department of Philosophy University of Sdo Paulo STEVEN FRENCHt Department of Philosophy and Religion Southeast Missouri State University An introduction to the model-theoretic approach in the philosophy of science is given and it is argued that this program is further enhanced by the introduction of partial structures. It is then shown that this leads to a natural and intuitive account of both "iconic" and mathematical models and of the role of the former in science itself. 1. Introduction. What is a scientific theory? According to the so-called "Received View" of Camap, Hempel et al. (the name, sounding today perhaps a little dated, was originally coined by Putnam in 1960), a theory is an axiomatic calculus given a partial observational interpretation via a set of correspondence rules. The well-known deficiencies in this concep- tion were a contributing factor in the development of the "Weltan- schauungen" analyses of Toulmin, Hanson, Kuhn and others (see, for example, Suppe 1977) and led to a denigration of axiomatization in gen- eral as merely an elaborate display of technical ingenuity applied to no apparent purpose. Despite this latter opinion, axiomatization continues to be regarded by many as an important component in the philosophy of science, for its role in introducing clarity with respect to the basic concepts of a theory, its help in theory comparison, for the way it can open up a theory to po- tentially fruitful mathematical techniques and, yes, for its usefulness in resolving certain philosophical disputes (we are thinking here in particular of the well-known example of the failure to eliminate by definition the *Received July 1987; revised May 1988. tThe authors would like to acknowledge the help and support of the Institute for Ad- vanced Study of the University of Sao Paulo, the Centre of Logic, Epistemology and History of Science of the University of Campinas and, in the case of Steven French, the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, during the prep- aration and writing of this paper.

We could do no better at this point than to quote Sklar, who says, in a slightly different context, [T]he choice of formalization of a theory is replete with scientific and philosophical consequences.... Our characterization of terms as primitive or defined, and our characterization of consequences as definitional or postulational, are decisions that implicitly reveal our beliefs about the limits of observational testability of theories and about the ability of theories to outrun these limits in their content; our ideas about the meanings of theoretical terms, how they are fixed, and how they change; and our views about the place of the theory formalized both in the historical context of the theories which pre- ceded it and from which it evolved and in the assumed future science which, we anticipate, will perhaps evolve from it under pressure of new observations and new theorizing. Given that so much hinges upon the formalization we do choose, we should not be surprised to find that this choice is no trivial matter, but one that requires the full utilization of our best available scientific and philosophical methodology. If formalizing is to be more than mere "logicifying," it is theorizing, and demands, if it is to be done adequately, the full resources needed for theorizing in general. (Sklar 1977, pp. 271-272) It is clear, however, that such formalization cannot proceed merely linguistically or syntactically. That is, given that "theories are not col- lections of propositions or statements, but rather are extra-linguistic en- tities which may be described or characterized by a number of different linguistic formulations" (Suppe 1977, p. 221), some method other than the specification and elaboration of an axiomatic language must be sought for. This altemative method is provided by the semantic, or model-the- oretic, approach, first introduced by Suppes (1957, 1961, 1967, 1970) and Beth (1948, 1949, 1961) and further developed by Suppe (1967, 1972), van Fraassen (1970, 1972, 1980, 1985a, 1985b) and others (Wojcicki 1964; Przelewski 1969; Dalla Chiara and Toraldo di Francia 1973; for a general introduction see Suppe 1977, pp. 221-230). The essence of this approach is captured in the idea that a scientific theory can be considered in terms of a description of its set of models, regarded as the structures it makes available for modeling its domain (compare van Fraassen 1980, pp. 41-69). By 'models' is meant here mathematical models, in the sense of relational structures for which all</page><page sequence="3">250 NEWTON C. A. DA COSTA AND STEVEN FRENCH the sentences of the theory express true properties about the structure when the latter acts as an interpretation of the theory. This then allows us to apply the mathematical and logical techniques of formal model the- ory (compare Tarski 1935) to the analysis of scientific theories-one of the primary motivations for this approach (Suppes 1957, 1970). The model-theoretic view is therefore regarded as acquiring a certain plausibility from the fact that models are also extensively used in science itself (Suppes 1970). Thus, to pick out just one of many examples: In a nucleus . . . there are too few particles for a statistical treatment, and there is no overriding centre of force which would enable us to treat the forces between nucleons as small perturbations. For this rea- son, physicists have fallen back on the 'as if' methods of attack, also known here as the method of nuclear models. This method consists of looking around for a physical system, the 'model', with which we are familiar and which in some of its properties resembles a nucleus. The physics of the model are then investigated and it is hoped that any properties thus discovered will also be properties of the nucleus. . . . In this way the nucleus has been treated 'as if' it were a gas, a liquid drop, an atom and several other things. (Elton 1964, p. 104) However, the sense of 'model' here is apparently quite different; Suppe calls such models "iconic" since they function as "icons" of what they are modeling (Suppe 1977, p. 97; perhaps the most famous account of such models is that of Hesse (1963) but see also Achinstein (1968) and Redhead (1980), the latter in particular for a more recent discussion). Despite the intuitive plausibility given to the former sense by the latter, the interrelations between the two have yet to be fully explored. We shall return to this question below. Leaving such problems aside for the moment, we can say that, today, to axiomatize a theory is to apply semantic/model-theoretic methods. Perhaps the most famous such application is the axiomatization of clas- sical particle mechanics by Suppes and others (Suppes 1970; McKinsey, Sugar and Suppes 1953; da Costa and Chuaqui 1988, pp. 16-19), al- though suggestions of this method can also be found in von Neumann's formalization of quantum mechanics (von Neumann 1955; see Suppe 1977, p. 222; for further material on a model-theoretic approach to quantum mechanics see van Fraassen 1970, pp. 329-330 and 1985a). More re- cently, da Costa has suggested how Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can also be axiomatized in this way (da Costa 1987a, pp. 16-17) and van Fraassen (1985a) and Friedman (1983) have sought to apply such techniques in discussions of the foundations of spacetime theories (see also Malament 1977 and Hiskes 1986). Model-theoretic methods have also found a home in certain accounts of theory change and scientific</page><page sequence="4">THE MODEL-THEORETIC APPROACH 251 progress in general (Sneed 1981; Stegmuller 1970, 1976, 1979), where they correct the linguistic bias of the Weltanschauungen philosophers above. However, the recent growth of interest in these applications can per- haps be attributed in the main to their appearance in the renewed dis- cussions surrounding the realist-empiricist debate (Friedman 1983; van Fraassen 1980, 1985; Giere 1985). In a certain fundamental sense it can be said that this whole debate pivots on the problem of the relationship between scientific theories and the world, in general, and the notion of truth, in particular. Following the severe criticism of the (naive) corre- spondence view in this context (see Ellis 1985, pp. 67-74) the search has been on for an alternative, whether it be some forn of "pragmatism" (Ellis 1985; Bradie 1979) or "warranted assertibility" (Putnam 1981; Al- meder 1987) or Fine's "Natural Ontological Attitude" (Fine 1984) or the constructive empiricist's radical break between acceptance of a theory and belief in its truth (van Fraassen 1980, 1983, 1985a). The main purpose of the present paper is to draw attention to some recent work in the development of a "pragmatic" theory of truth (Mik- enberg, da Costa and Chuaqui 1988; da Costa 1986; da Costa 1987b; da Costa and Chuaqui forthcoming; da Costa and French 1989; French forth- coming a, forthcoming b). (The rationale for the name 'pragmatic truth', given to the theory by Mikenberg, et al. in their original paper, will shortly become obvious.) We argue that, through its introduction of partial struc- tures, our pragmatic theory of truth both extends and enhances the se- mantic approach in general. There are a number of points that should be noted here. The first, and perhaps the most important, concerns the motivation for this approach and its place in the realist-empiricist debate. Although the formal theory of Mikenberg et al. was originally motivated by certain considerations in the history of philosophy regarding the "pragmatic" philosophies of Peirce, James, etc., the primary intention of this paper is not exegetical. We believe that our view captures the spirit of at least some of Peirce's state- ments concerning truth in science but would claim that nevertheless it can be taken to stand on its own. As regards realism and empiricism one of us (French) has argued else- where (French forthcoming a and b) that the formalism of Mikenberg et al. can in fact serve both sides in the debate. We do not intend to repeat these arguments in full here since we are more concerned in this work with the introduction of partial structures in general and their application to scientific models in particular. Secondly, it is worth recalling that formal methods are not everything in science as some members of the structuralist school seem to think. The approach we are considering here is just one of many and others, the historical counterpart for example, can obviously shed further light on the</page><page sequence="5">252 NEWTON C. A. DA COSTA AND STEVEN FRENCH problems being dealt with. Axiomatization cannot resolve all our diffi- culties but it can at least make things clear and more tractable. That is, we are quite willing to adopt a "pluralistic" approach in these matters. Finally we should add that by necessity our exposition below is not completely mathematically rigorous. However, we hope to have hit the right note of sufficient rigor and intuitive "feel" for the notions discussed. 2. Mathematical Structures. In a certain strong sense it can be said that the axiomatic method defines the essence of mathematics (compare da Costa 1977), and with the work of the Bourbaki group it can further be claimed that this method reached perhaps its highest level of development (Bourbaki 1957, 1968). For Bourbaki, to axiomatize a mathematical the- ory was no more or less than to define a kind, or species, of structure in set-theoretic terns. However, although it seems clear enough to us today, the modem concept of "structure" had a difficult birth: It is therefore tempting to assert that the modem notion of "structure" was substantially in existence by 1900, but in fact another thirty years of preparation were required before it made its full-fledged appear- ance. Certainly, it is not difficult to recognize structures of the same species when they are of a sufficiently simple nature; with group structures, for example, this point was attained in the middle of the nineteenth century. But at the same period, Haenkel was still strug- gling, without complete success, to extract the general idea of a field and an extension field, which he managed to express only in the semi- metaphysical forn of a "principle of permanence" . . ., and which were definitively formulated only by Steinitz forty years later. It has been especially difficult to escape from the feeling that mathematical objects are "given" together with their structures, and it has taken many years of functional analysis to make modem mathematicians familiar with the idea that, for example, there are several "natural" topologies on the set of rational numbers, and several measures on the real line. With this dissociation the passage to the general defi- nition of structure . . . was finally achieved. (Bourbaki 1968, pp. 317-318) Unfortunately, however, the Bourbaki treatment of mathematical struc- tures is purely syntactic: a species of structure is regarded as constituting simply a fornal theory, construed as a collection of symbols subject to certain metamathematical rules. This makes the exposition excessively elaborate and awkward to handle (da Costa and Chuaqui 1988). For Suppes too, to axiomatize a theory is to define a kind of structure. But in what terms should such structures be defined? It clearly seems reasonable to do this via the language of set theory and thus Suppes de-</page><page sequence="6">THE MODEL-THEORETIC APPROACH 253 clares (his slogan): "To axiomatize a theory is to define a set-theoretical predicate" (Suppes 1957, p. 249; 1970, pp. 2-29). A set-theoretical pred- icate is simply a predicate that can be defined within set theory in a com- pletely fornal way. However, Suppes does not further specify this notion in such a way as to make it clear exactly how a theory can be adequately represented. Nevertheless, on the basis of Suppes' own examples, da Costa and Chua- qui (1988) have convincingly argued that these set-theoretical predicates can be identified with the Bourbaki species of structures. A scientific theory may thus be characterized by a set-theoretic predicate in such a way as to connect this approach with standard (mathematical) model the- ory. To give a simple example, let us consider the concept of a group. A group can be characterized as a structure of the form: WG = (0,0,*XI where A is a non-empty set, o is a binary operator on A, * a unary operator on A, and I an element of A, such that: 1. (x 0 y) 0 z = X 0 (y 0 z) 2. xoI = Io x = x 3. xox* = x* ox = I The corresponding predicate is then, P(x) &lt;3&gt; 3 A 3 B 3 C 3 D (x = (A,B,C,D) A A is a non-empty set A B is a binary operation on A A C is a unary operator on A A D is an element of A A V x V y V z((x,y,z) E A -- (xBy)Bz = xB(yBz) etc.)). This is, of course, a fairly simple example, but we can in fact repeat this procedure with any structure we like. As set theorists usually say, the language of set theory is a kind of universal language, and with it we can reproduce all extant mathematics (and practically all of our scientific thinking as well). This is why the semantic approach is so useful and therefore important, because if we axiomatize our theories in this manner then we have the whole of mathematics "at hand", as it were (Suppes 1970; compare also Redhead 1975, for an interesting discussion, in a different context, of the heuristic fruitfulness of mathematical "surplus structure" in the formalization of theories). So, to axiomatize is to define a set-theoretical predicate in the above manner, and the structures which satisfy this predicate are the models of the theory. That is, when a theory is fornalized in this way, the math-</page><page sequence="7">254 NEWTON C. A. DA COSTA AND STEVEN FRENCH ematical structures which satisfy the predicate are the models of this pred- icate, or the structures of this species of structure, P(x), or more sim- ply, P. In what follows we shall work with informal, intuitive set theory and will restrict ourselves to first-order structures only, of the form: A=(A,Ri,fj,ak) iEI jEj kE K where A is a non-empty set, Ri, i E I is a family of relations, each having a fixed rank ri, fj, j C J is a family of functions each also having a certain rank sj and ak, k E K is a family of distinguished individuals of A. To any structure of this type is associated a first-order language of the same similarity type. In the following section we shall be concerned with a generalized kind of structure of similar form, called "simple pragmatic structures". 3. Pragmatic Structures.' As we noted above, the recently reactivated realist-empiricist debate has brought to the fore once again the problem of the relationship between our theories and "the world". Given the ob- served frequency of theory change in the history of science, the most plausible attitude to adopt with regard to this relationship is obviously some kind of "fallibilist" one; that is, some view of truth other than that captured in the (naive) correspondence theory must be sought. This is also more in accordance with the views and beliefs of scientists them- selves. As Dorling (1972) has noted, it is (naive) philosophers, rather than actual scientists, who insist on asserting the "literal" that is, abso- lute, universal and unrestricted, truth of scientific theories (compare also Fine 1984). One, very well known, fallibilist position is that of Peirce, for example, who wrote: In order to ascertain the meaning of an intellectual conception one should consider what practical consequences might conceivably result by necessity from the truth of that conception; and the sum of these consequences will constitute the entire meaning of that conception. (Peirce 1965) Statements such as this provided the broad motivation for Mikenberg et al.'s theory of "pragmatic" truth (1986, p. 202) which holds that the "pragmatic" truth of an assertion depends on its practical effects or con- 'For further details see Mikenberg, da Costa, and Chuaqui (1986); da Costa (1986); da Costa and Chuaqui (forthcoming).</page><page sequence="8">THE MODEL-THEORETIC APPROACH 255 sequences, fornulated in terms of a set of basic propositions, the latter being accepted as true in the correspondence sense. However, as we have said, our intention here is not exegetical and the formalism of this theory, given below, should be considered on its own merits. We recall that, according to Tarski's formalization of the correspon- dence theory, a sentence is true or false only with regard to an interpre- tation in a given structure. This obviously suggests that, in like manner, a sentence can be "pragmatically" true or false only in connection with some kind of structure. Thus we begin with a given domain of knowledge A. (For an excellent, and very well known, discussion of the nature and role of "domains of knowledge" in science, see Shapere (1977). Although it would be inter- esting to consider in greater detail Shapere's conception in this context, in particular as regards what should be taken to be the elements of the domain, we should emphasize that the theory to be outlined below is not in any way intended to be a fornal analysis of this conception.) This domain can be modeled by a structure of the form: w = (AlA)iEI where A1 is the set of observable individuals of A, Ri, i E I is a family of partial relations2 defined on A1, where I is an appropriate index set. Since we do not know everything about A it seems plausible to demand that f be a partial structure; that is, the relevant properties and relations among the members of A1 are captured by a family of partial relations Ri, i E I which are "partial" in the sense that any relation Ri, i E I of arity ni is not necessarily defined for all ni-tuples of elements of Ai. This partial structure can then be enriched by the introduction of new individuals, representing so-called "unobservable" entities and new par- tial relations among the extended set of individuals so obtained. Denoting this new set of objects by A2 and the family of new relations by Rj, j E J, we suppose that Al nA2 0=, In J 0 and we put A =A1 U A2. Let SL be a language in which talk about $2 can be expressed; that is, SL and f have the same similarity type. Since some things, at least, are known about A, there exists a set P of distinguished sentences of SL which express what is directly known about Ai. These sentences are accepted as true or false in the correspondence sense, and may also be taken to in- clude certain general propositions which express those laws and theories 2Rigorously speaking, a partial relation defined on a set A, for example a binary relation R, can be introduced as follows: R is an ordered triple (R1,R2,R3), where R1, R2 and R3 are mutually disjoint sets such that R1 U R2 U R3 = A2; R1 is the set of ordered pairs which satisfy R, R2 is the set of ordered pairs which do not satisfy R, and R3 is the set of ordered pairs for which it is left open whether they satisfy R or not. When R3 is empty, R constitutes a normal binary relation and can be identified with R1.</page><page sequence="9">256 NEWTON C. A. DA COSTA AND STEVEN FRENCH referring to A which are already accepted as true. Thus we model A by a partial structure of the general form: S Aj,A2,Rj,RjXp) iEI jJJ the sets A1 and A2, the families of relations Ri, i E I and Rj, j E J and the set of sentences P, satisfying the above conditions. Such a structure is called a simple pragmatic structure and it performs an analogous role in the pragmatic theory of truth to that of the usual set-theoretic structures in Tarski's conception. If we put K = I U J then the above set-theoretic structure can be given the simpler forn: ' = (A,Rk,P)kE K which from now on we suppose to be assumed by simple pragmatic struc- tures. To simplify the exposition, functions and distinguished elements are not explicitly included in W. We now let 2 be a total structure, whose relations of arity n are defined for all n-tuples of elements of its universe and we suppose that SL is also interpreted in S. Then 2 is said to be A-normal if (da Costa and Chuaqui, forthcoming): i. the universe of 2 is A; ii. the relations of 2 extend the corresponding partial relations of W; iii. if c is an individual constant of _ then in both W and 2 c is interpreted by the same element; iv. if ot C P, then 2 I ox. We are now able to say that a sentence ot of 2 is pragmatically true in the simple pragmatic structure W according to 2, if W is a simple pragmatic structure in the above sense, 2 is a A-normal structure and (x is true in 2 in accordance with the Tarskian definition. In other words, we say that (x is pragmatically true in the structure W if there exists an A-normal 2 in which ot is true. If ot is not pragmatically true in the simple pragmatic structure W according to 2 then ot is said to be pragmatically false in W according to S. More intuitively, if ot is pragmatically true in W then all logical con- sequences of ot or of ot plus the true primary statements P should not be incompatible with any true primary statement. Thus ot is such that every- thing occurs in A as if it were true. This then immediately gives us a definition of when a theory T is "prag- matically" or "quasi-" true in a pragmatic structure W. If T is the set</page><page sequence="10">THE MODEL-THEORETIC APPROACH 257 of all (total) models of T then we say that T is "pragmatically" or "quasi-" true in W if and only if some structure of T is A-normal. In other words, a theory, characterized by a set of models, is regarded as prag- matically true in a simple pragmatic structure when some of its models are A-normal. Of course, once such a formalism is established, various interesting "spin-offs" can be generated. Thus it has been suggested elsewhere that this theory may provide a suitable theory of truth for van Fraassen's "constructive empiricism" (the full argument for this claim is given in French (forthcoming a)). The structure (A,Rk,P^kEK above can be taken to represent the latter's "em- pirical substructures", if P is restricted to observation statements only. These substructures are then regarded as embedded in structures of the form A, the individual elements A2 of which are considered to be merely "convenient fictions", having a pragmatic value only, in the context of explanation and prediction. Since ot being pragmatically true implies that everything occurs in A as if ot were true, then ot can be said to "save the appearances", and in precisely the sense that constructive empiricism wants. This then leads us to understand the "empirical adequacy" of a theory as its pragmatic truth and the traditional connection between acceptance and belief is then, at least partly, restored; we (pragmatically) accept a theory if we believe it to be pragmatically true. If the elements of A2 are not regarded as merely ideal, in some sense, then the above formalism may also be used as a base for a kind of realism, which can be called "pragmatic realism". The difference between this and constructive empiricism lies in one's attitude to the set A2 of course; as Salmon (1984, chapter 8) for example, has emphasized, the question as to how the appropriate attitude is licensed is perhaps the key problem of the whole realist-empiricist debate. Without going into all the details here, we can say that, at the very least, the theory of pragmatic truth provides some defense against those critics who attack realism in general because of the difficulties in formalizing what it means for a theory to be "approximately" true. There are, of course, further problems to be dealt with, such as the relationship between the pragmatic truth of a the- ory and its existence claims, but we shall not consider these here (see French forthcoming b). Given our comments above about the "approximate" truth of scientific theories and scientists' belief-attitudes towards them, it obviously makes sense to treat the belief in a proposition not as belief in its truth per se, but in its pragmatic truth. Identifying the degree of belief in the propo- sition with its subjective probability then leads to the "pragmatic prob- ability" interpretation of the probability calculus (da Costa 1986). This in turn can be used to form the basis of a new "logic" of induction which</page><page sequence="11">258 NEWTON C. A. DA COSTA AND STEVEN FRENCH nicely resolves such standard difficulties as what a priori probability should be assigned to universal hypotheses and the so-called "Hacking prob- lem", involving non-Bayesian changes in our degrees of belief (da Costa 1987b; da Costa and French 1989). Thus the whole edifice-pragmatic truth, pragmatic probability and a pragmatic logic of induction-has a pleasing consistency and intuitive plausibility. Returning to the model-theoretic approach in general, we are arguing here that given that theories are not, and should not be, considered as literally true, the semantic program should be adapted to admit partial structures of the above form. That is, since we are neither omniscient nor infallible, it is simply more plausible to model our domains of knowledge by structures of the form 2 above, rather than "complete" or fully spec- ified constructions. 4. Models and Models. We have already noted the distinction between mathematical and "iconic" models (it is interesting, given the motivation for the theory of pragmatic truth, that the idea of an "iconic" relation is apparently also due to Peirce; see Suppe 1977, p. 97). As is well known, both Nagel (1961) and Hesse (1963) effectively identified these two kinds and argued that the interpretation (partial perhaps) of a theory will be both a mathematical and an iconic model. Thus, to take perhaps the most well-known example, the billiard-ball model of kinetic gas theory is clearly an iconic model, since it offers an iconic representation of a system of gas atoms. Here the role of analogy comes in, since the iconic relation depends on some simlarity between certain aspects of the system and certain aspects of the model. Thus, in Hesse's terms, we have a positive analogy between the two where there exists a similarity, a negative anal- ogy where there is no similarity, and a neutral analogy where it is not known whether the system and model are similar. Simultaneously, the billiard-ball model is regarded as a mathematical model of kinetic theory in the sense that a semantic interpretation is given to the theory in terms of the billiard-ball system so that the theorems of the theory are true under this interpretation. The problem immediately arises, however, that on the realist view the mathematical model is in some sense supposed to say "how the world is", whereas the iconic model does not, in the usual discussions of these things (compare Suppe 1977, pp. 97-98). This is no problem at all for the empiricist, of course, who at best adopts an agnostic attitude towards the set of individuals introduced in the mathematical model and thus maintains the above identification, re- garding all theories as essentially iconic models of the phenomena (van Fraassen 1985b; see also the discussion in Perez Ransanz 1985 and Olive 1985).</page><page sequence="12">THE MODEL-THEORETIC APPROACH 259 What we would like to do here is to explore a little further the rela- tionship between these two kinds of models in the context of our dis- cussion of mathematical structures above. In so doing we hope to shed further light on such problems as the one just outlined. It is clear that models are extensively used in science, for heuristic purposes, to qualitatively "probe" a complicated theory and to test the- ories when a computation gap exists (Redhead 1980). But what is the sense of model that is being used here? In general terms, an iconic model can be characterized as a set of simplified and approximate assumptions about some system which attribute some inner structure to this system and which are proposed in the context of some more basic theory (Achin- stein 1968). The model may further exhibit an analogy between the sys- tem modeled and some other system, this other system being ". . . build- able, picturable, imaginable, or none of these" (Hesse 1963, p. 19). On the realist view, the difference between a theory and a model is then given in terms of the former being regarded as true, while the latter is believed to be false. However, this doesn't seem quite right. First of all, we have already argued for belief in the pragmatic, and not literal, truth of theories. Sec- ondly, how can a model be regarded as literally false and still function as a model? If the model is "parasitic" on the theory in the sense of being a model of the theoretical core then if the theory is "true", in whatever sense, the model should "pick up" some of this truth. That is, there must be something true about the model for it to work in the first place. Of course, the root of the difficulty is the same as that which afflicts naive realism: the indiscriminate use of the "absolute" or "literal" view of truth which ends up painting the picture in stark, black-and-white terms. Obviously, the model must be true in some respects and false in others. The question is, which respects? We recall that a theory is characterized by its class of (mathematical) models, regarded as the structures it makes available for modeling its domain. In our account such structures have the form: W = (A,Rk,P)kfEK the A, Rk, k E K and P being defined as in the foregoing. Given the description of iconic models above, it seems reasonable to treat them in the same way. Thus, let us associate with our theory an iconic model ': '=(A ,Rk,P%Eks-K So, for example, 2 might characterize the kinetic theory of gases and ' the billiard-ball model of this theory. A number of points can now be made about the relationship between W and '. The first is that we should obviously identify at least some of the Ps</page><page sequence="13">260 NEWTON C. A. DA COSTA AND STEVEN FRENCH with at least some of the P's. The theory itself models a given domain of knowledge and in order to function the iconic model "attached" to, or used in conjunction with, the theory must reflect or capture, at least in part, the observable aspects of this domain. It may be of course that the Ps are identified with only some of the P's and only some of the ob- servable domain of the theory is captured by the model. This will typi- cally happen when the model is being used as an approximation in order to make the calculation of certain quantities easier, etc. (see further com- ments below). The converse may also occur, especially if the model is "buildable" or "picturable" in Hesse's sense; thus the billiard-ball model will include certain observable aspects of the macroscopic domain that are not inherent to the domain of gas atom interactions. However, the degree to which the model functions in the way that we want it to will then depend on the extent to which we can ignore these "extra" observ- able aspects. Secondly, the set A will often, but not always, be different from the A's. In the common example we are using here, A will include, among other things, the gas atoms, whereas A' will include the billiard balls. This, then, reveals the difference between a theory and a model (in the iconic sense): a theory makes existence claims, the model does not. That is, with a theory the set of (unobservable) individuals are purported to exist, whereas in the model they are not, within the domain of knowledge concerned. Thus, gas atoms are considered to exist while billiard balls are not, within the domain of gas phenomena. Of course, we are working here within a realist interpretation; as we said above, an empiricist, in denying the ontological force of a theory's existence claims, is inclined to ignore the difference between theories and models in this sense. We said "but not always" above, because in many cases both the theory and the model will refer to the same set of individuals (the existence of such cases may be taken to give further support to the idea that theories and iconic models should be represented in the same way). These cases will typically arise when the model is being used as an approximation to the theory in order to facilitate calculation, etc. Redhead calls such models "impoverishment" models (Redhead 1980, p. 147), since they act as "im- poverished", but more tractable, versions of the theory. In this case, the difference between the two is given, not in terms of truth and falsity, as Redhead claims, but in terms of the Rk and the Rk, k C K, the latter, in this case, being an impoverished set of the former (some of the relations might be empty, for instance). This constitutes our third point, that when a model is being used for ease of calculation, the Rk will differ in certain respects from the Rk. Some of the properties and relations of the system being modeled might be ignored, for example, leading to a simpler set of equations to be solved.</page><page sequence="14">THE MODEL-THEORETIC APPROACH 261 In such cases the Rk will typically be sub-relations of the Rk. As we noted above, the use of a model to approximate the theory may also involve a difference between the sets of basic statements P and P'. Thus, in the treatment of transport phenomena in gases a number of simplifying as- sumptions are made-low, but not too low, density, volumeless atoms, negligible forces of interaction, etc. -before the resulting equations are " solved". One must always be careful with approximations, of course, since they may give radically different solutions from the original equations. In this case, the approximation will be said to be poor, bad, or even to have failed altogether, depending on the size of the discrepancy. We can ac- commodate this within our account by noting that care must be taken as regards which of the Rk are to be dropped, or ignored, to give the im- poverished set R'. This is obviously where the skill in making a good approximation comes in. The degree of approximation may then be mea- sured by the difference between the Rk and the R', k E K: R'k Rk (compare Redhead 1980, p. 151). It may be that an iconic model with a different set of individuals from the original theory is used to approximate the behavior of the system described by the theory. This is obviously so in the billiard-ball model of kinetic gas theory where the As, the Rks and, to a certain extent, the Ps are all different. The volume of the atoms/billiard balls and the forces between them might initially be ignored, for example, and inclusion of these factors (as in van der Waals equation) then gives a more accurate approximation. In such cases, it is not just that certain members of the Rk, k E K are not to be found in the R', k E K, but also vice versa since the A' will usually possess properties different from the A. Another ex- ample is the liquid drop model of the nucleus, where the system of nu- cleons is given an iconic representation in terms of liquid molecules. We shall return to this example below. This brings us on to our final point, which concerns analogy. Let us distinguish among the properties and relations in the family Rk, k E K, those which are intrinsic from those which are extrinsic. Intrinsic prop-</page><page sequence="15">262 NEWTON C. A. DA COSTA AND STEVEN FRENCH erties are those which are essential (semantically relevant, in Achinstein's terms; 1968, p. 24) for classifying the individuals as A's, whereas ex- trinsic ones are non-relevant, or accidental, properties. If A' is the same as A then ' must differ from 2 as regards the extrinsic members of R', k C K only. In this case, we say that ' displays an analogy (what Hesse calls a "material analogy") with A, which is expressed by the corre- spondence between the intrinsic, and certain of the extrinsic, members of Rk, k C K and R', k C K. How "close" the analogy is may be mea- sured, again, by the difference between the latter families of relations, although this time the difference will be in terms of extrinsic properties and relations only. Another sense of analogy arises when A and A' are different (Achin- stein 1968). In this case, some, but perhaps not all, of the intrinsic prop- erties in Rk, k C K and Rk, k C K will be different. However, the analogy is obtained if related objects in W and ' possess related properties; that is, if related members of A and A' possess related properties in the Rk, k E K and Rk, k C K. W and ' then exhibit a structural isomorphism. This is an extremely powerful form of analogy, which allows us to represent a system by a variety of models, visualizable or not, as long as this structural isomorphism obtains. As Redhead notes, "This is the source of the very important process of cross-fertilization which plays such a conspicuous role in the overall growth of theoretical physics" (Redhead 1980, p. 149). We conclude with a final example, the liquid drop model of the nucleus already mentioned. As is well known, the analogy between the atomic nucleus and a liquid drop was first suggested by Bohr and was subse- quently used to obtain the first mass formula for atomic nuclei (von Weizsaicker 1935). This analogy is based on two experimental facts. The first is that, with good accuracy, the radius of a nucleus is given by: r= roa1/3 where ro is called the nuclear unit radius and a is the mass number. This implies that the number of nucleons per unit volume (a/4/13 rTr3) is a con- stant and so the nucleon density is independent of the size of the structure, just like molecule density in a liquid drop. Secondly, the binding energy per nucleon is approximately constant over a wide range of nuclei. Similarly with a liquid drop, the latent heat is independent of the drop size. In the latter case this arises because of the short-range nature of the inter-molecular forces which "saturate", in the sense that once enough close neighbours have been bound the pres- ence or absence of more distant particles does not alter the binding of a given molecule. This implies that the total energy is proportional to the total number of particles in the system, since each particle makes a fixed</page><page sequence="16">THE MODEL-THEORETIC APPROACH 263 contribution to this energy. Pursuing the analogy then leads to the sug- gestion that the nuclear forces also saturate in this way, which is in ac- cordance with the above noted experimental result. Obviously what we have here is a clear case of structural isomorphism and corresponding analogy as just discussed, with the As being atomic nuclei, the A's as liquid molecules and the "related" properties among the Rk, k E K and Rk, k E K, being those concerned with nucleon/mo- lecular density and "saturation". Equally obvious is the fertility of such an analogy. There are, of course, many more things to discuss concerning models that we cannot consider here. Hopefully, however, we have shown how some of their more important aspects can be easily and uniformly ac- commodated within our account. 5. Conclusion. It is clear that the semantic or model-theoretic approach is a useful and powerful tool in the analysis of scientific theories. We have tried to argue here that its usefulness and power is further extended if we introduce partial structures into the formalism and that these capture in an intuitively direct way, the most important aspects of the relationship between these theories and the world. We should add that our formulation is only a first approximation to the problem-the "truth" is reached via successive approximations even in the philosophy of science. Granted this, however, we believe that our account at least partly coincides with similar considerations in the work of Suppes, van Fraassen, Friedman and others. Finally, we hope to have demonstrated how our discussion further il- luminates the nature and use of models in general and helps clarify the difference between iconic models and theories. There are, of course, other areas which are "ripe" for a model-theoretic analysis, such as the problem of theory unification, for example, but these we leave to future works.
