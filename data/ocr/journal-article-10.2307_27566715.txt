Plutarch's Gryllus is a parodie take on contemporary intellectual cul ture, offering a humorous portrait of elite perspectives regarding language and sophistic learning. The parodie effect stems from the figure of the talking pig, the dialogue's protagonist, whose name, Gryllus ("Grunter"), signifies ineptness in speech and characterizes him as a mocking figure through puns with the names of an Egyptian dance form and a parodie painting style?connections not observed in definitive interpretations of the dialogue. Ultimately, in its engagement with rhetorical performance and popular philosophical themes, the dialogue parodies reliance upon paideia as a form of empowerment. In the dialogue commonly known as Gryllus,Plutarch imagines Odysseus on the isle of Circe engaged in debate with a former companion, a victim of the witch's magic, now transformed into a pig. As might be expected from material deriving from the story of Odysseus, at the center of discussion is one's nostos: Odysseus wishes to bring his companions home, but Circe insists they are reluctant. She chooses the pig in ques tion, Gryllus as he comes to be called, as spokesperson for the group, who in turn proceeds to explain the group's preference for animal form over returning home, claiming in an elaborate speech that animals are superior for their natural capacity for virtue. As is regularly observed, the dialogue belongs to a long tradition of discourse in antiquity on the intel lectual and emotive capacities of animals. The issue of animal rationality was a philosophical dilemma that occupied many from Plato to Porphyry, inviting a variety of reflections on primitivism, the development of human society, vegetarianism and especially the role of language and reason in moral distinctions.1 Accordingly, modern discussion of the Gryllus, as with that of Plutarch's On the Cleverness of Animals and On Eating Meat, has often been shaped by concern for such issues as well.2 ^or a survey of testimonia and discussions, see Sorabji 1993; cf. Gera 2003. 2 For the dialogue's position within the wider tradition of moral and philosophical discourse, both ancient and modern, see references to recent work in Newmyer 1999,105, American Journal of Philology 129 (2008) 347-379 ? 2008 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">348 LUCAS HERCHENROEDER The Gryllus also appears to belong to a diverse tradition of dra matic performance, beginning with Old Comedy at least, that adapted stories of Odysseus. Yet, given the great emphasis on the philosophi cal tradition in interpretations of it, this connection has attracted little scholarly attention. As an attempt to broaden critical perspectives on the dialogue in this respect, this article addresses its place in the context of performance activities, examining its engagement with contemporary (likely elite) audiences through the figure of the talking pig and its function as a parodie take on elite perspectives on language, rhetoric, and philosophic learning. The dialogue is a critical reflection upon the institution of paideia, in other words, along with its excessive claims to intellectual and cultural authority. Crucial to this interpretation is the pig's name, Gryllus ("Grunter"), another feature of the dialogue that has not received adequate attention in scholarly discussion. While the name is a regular onomatopoetic for the pig, it is also a complex pun, playing upon both the name of an Egyptian dance, gryllos, faintly described as vulgar and coarse, and an obscure style of caricature painting, also called gryllos, distinctive for its representation of parodie, grotesque figures. In characterizing the dialogue's protagonist, the themes of grotesqueness, coarseness, and bodily deformity are aspects of a comic representation of paideia, especially its heavy emphasis on language and rhetoric as constituents of elite identity. Plutarch's Gryllus, then, is an irreverent take on the pedantic behavior of the pepaideumenoi, inviting reflection upon the value of philosophizing rhetoric and assertions of freedom in bids for intellectual and cultural authority. Given the highly politicized status of such assertions in Imperial Greece, this was perhaps ultimately an invitation to reflect upon the limitations of regarding paideia strictly as a means of empowerment, or worse, as a means of resistance, for elite Greeks seeking a counterpoint to political dependency in educational and cultural ideals. PARODY AND THE NAME OF GRYLLUS The Gryllus parodies elite behavior specifically in its representation of the Homeric scenario as a philosophical debate, recreating a rhetorical showpiece in the figure of the talking pig. As a preliminary matter, it is worth observing that to some extent the parodie effect of the dialogue n. 16; cf. more recently Billaut 2005 and Brechet 2005. For discussion of the dialogue's sources, see Bergua Cavero 1991, Indelli 1992 and 1996.</page><page sequence="3">PLUTARCH'S GRYLLUS 349 stems from its imitation of such displays among educated Greeks, for the resemblance to everyday performance activities must have reinforced the Gryllus' engagement with elite audiences as the targets for parodie mockery. One might even consider the Gryllus to represent a perfor mance piece of sorts. While this is not a standard line of interpretation with Plutarchan dialogues, or with philosophical dialogues in general, one should note, for instance, that the Gryllus appears to merge with famil iar traditions in the performance culture of antiquity. Representations of Odysseus were always popular in theatrical productions?the Circe episode and even the theme of reflection on life as an animal provided material for known plays3?and convivial performances of philosophical dialogues were becoming popular in Plutarch's time.4 Thematic links with comedy and heavy philosophical content perhaps place the Gryllus within the tradition of such performances.5 Above all, one is reminded that the reception of literature in antiquity regularly depended upon oral recita tion and performance before an audience, rather than silent reading in private.6 Studies of Lucian's dialogues have been influential in shaping 3 Phillips 1959; Sutton 1974. Plays often spoofed themes like the pursuit of food, sex, and wealth that were conventionally tied to the hero, as the Gryllus does. At least two plays by the title Circe are known (Anaxil. frr. 12-14 Kock; Ephipp. fr. 11 Kock). Anaxilas' Circe appears to have depicted Odysseus' companions reflecting upon their condition as pigs. It is not difficult to see how exposure to such plot types might have inspired certain aspects of the Gryllus. 4According to Plutarch's Table-talk (Mor. 711b-d), dramatic recitation of Platonic dialogues, performed by slaves, became a popular form of convivial entertainment at Rome, joining comedy, pantomime, and certain dances. Such performances seem to have been aimed at introducing intellectual content into an evening's conversation. These perfor mances eventually drew criticism from Stoics and were not immediately popular with the masses, indications of a restricted, likely elite audience. After all, philosophy was a regular pastime of the educationally privileged, a topic to which the Gryllus is overtly sensitive, as I hope to show in this article (below pp. 368-71). Supporting evidence for the Table-talk anecdote comes from a group of mosaics from a dining room in Mytilene (third century C.E.) depicting, among several scenes from Menander, a performance of Plato's Phaedo; see Charitonidis, et al. 1970, 33-36; cf. Handley 2002,170,172, n. 24. 5 It deserves mention that uncertainty over the Gryllus' Greek title offers an ad ditional clue. Most doubt that the title Etepi too xa ?Xoya X?ycu xpija?ai was tnat given the dialogue at its composition. Russell 1973,18-20, suggests that it was added later during the compilation of Plutarch's work. In fact, the Lamprias catalogue does not include this title, although it does show Etepi ?dxov aX?ytov, TroirrnKOc (#127) and Ei Xoyov ?xei l? (,wa (#135). Ziegler 1949,699, proposes that the former of these titles identifies the work known to us. Were this so, the epithet TtoinTiK?c;, whether attributed by a compiler or by Plutarch himself, would offer support to claims made in this article about its status as a dramatic piece. 6 Johnson 2000,615-24; on recitationes, see Valette-Cagnac 1997,111-69.</page><page sequence="4">350 LUCAS HERCHENROEDER understanding of this point in reference to Imperial Greek literature by identifying a clear and consistent dramatic technique in their composition.7 As recent work has shown, Plutarch was not only profoundly influenced by principles of dramatic composition in much of his work. His dialogues show similar concern for the needs of performance?a suggestion that they, including the Gryllus perhaps, were potentially meant for dramatic recitation, if not for performance with greater theatrical enhancement.8 Of course, while there can be no certainty as to whether the text of the Gryllus was intended as treatise or script, the distinction is not crucial, since the real issue is how Plutarch evokes the rhetorical performance activities of the elite in the figure of the learned pig. Gryllus' name is central to understanding the parodie effect of the dialogue. The name itself, FpuXXoc;, bears an important association with dance, which, if not a suggestion that a performance activity is envisioned in the Gryllus, has the effect of evoking the lewdness and vulgarity asso ciated with the dance in characterizing the pig-speaker. This requires some explanation. The name Tp?XXo? is ostensibly a variant of the noun yp?Xo?, which is itself an onomatopoetic representation of the sound produced by a pig ("grunter," hence "pig")- While Ip?Mo? was given as a regular masculine name, and Plutarch's choice of it may have exploited this humorous connection?i.e., the man-become-pig retains a proper human name that actually evokes his piggish state9?as a variation on the sound of the pig's grunting, the double-lambda spelling appears to have been unusual for Plutarch's time. In fact, it is only attested once before the Gryllus.10 It is not until the second century CE. that we find more 7 Bellinger 1928; Branham 1989,18. As with Platonic dialogues, those of Lucian feature regular shifts between interlocutors. Clear comprehension for both reader and audience at live readings required a system of textual signals (e.g., forms of direct address, references to direct speech) to cue these shifts. 8 Harrison 2005 cites numerous studies; cf. Zanetto 2000. In particular, Ure?a Bra cero 1996 has made use of methods applied to Lucianic texts (see n. 7 above) to identify performance cues in Plutarchan dialogues. 9 Attestations of the name Ip?XXoc may be found in Fraser and Matthews 1987-2005, s.v. While Chantraine (1999, s.v. yp?) observes that the name may have reflected words for pigs and grunting, this does not mean that Plutarch did not also find a connection with gryl los caricature painting, as I argue here. Plutarch's Gryllus draws upon an array of meanings for the pig's name, which complement, rather than exclude one another. 10 Manuscripts of Aristophanes' Acharnians have both ypvXXi^eiTe and YpuXi?e?xe for line 746, though the latter reading may be supported by comparison with Plut. 307 (ypuXi?ovrec;). After this the double-lambda spelling for a pig's grunting only appears in sources after Plutarch. Pollux (5.87) and Hesychius (y 946) have ypuXXo?. Yet neither is prior to the late second century CE., and the occurrence in Pollux is supported by neither the earliest nor</page><page sequence="5">PLUTARCH'S GRYLLUS 351 widespread indication of the word ypuXXoc; in reference to pigs. A passage from the lexicographer Phrynichus suggests that speakers adopted the double-lambda spelling erroneously. Phrynichus claims that ypuXiaii?c; and YpuAt(?) are proper Attic Greek for sounds produced by a pig ("grunt" and "to grunt," respectively).11 Seemingly related words with the double lambda spelling, he explains, do not refer to pigs but actually refer to a specific dance form performed in Egypt (ypuAAia|i?c; for the dance itself; YpuXXoc; for both the dance and the dancer performing it), while the verb YpvAAi? is totally improper. Phrynichus does not speculate on the source of this confusion, but on the basis of his description of the dance as "vulgar and unseemly," it seems clear that false associations between the dance form and pigs were responsible. Given the similar phonetic values of ypuAAoc; and yp?Xoc;, it is not difficult to see how misuse of the word might have become more regular.12 the majority of texts from that manuscript tradition, which have yptiXo?. Eustathius has ypi&gt;XXiG[K)c; (ad Od. k 395.18), but this is much later than Plutarch. 11 Phrynichus Praep. Soph, and Eclog., ed. Borries, 58-59. The lexicographer's claims have some support. Cognate forms of yp?Xo? appear in the Attic writers Aristophanes (Ach. 746; Plut. 307; see n. 10 above) and Aristotle (ypuXia^oc, HA 535M7), as well as the Atticizing Dio Chrysostom (ypuX?(?), Or. 1.1 A). Phrynichus' identification of the gryl /os-dancer is supported by text on P. Sorb. inv. 2381 (second century C.E.), which includes the word yp?XXoc in a list of performers for an Egyptian festival; Perpillou-Thomas 1989. For a full discussion of the meaning of yp?XXoc in antiquity, the definitive work is Binsfeld 1956; cf. Binsfeld 1962; Hammerstaedt 2000. For the etymology discussed here, see Latte 1955,190-92; Kjava 1999,24. 12The precise nature of the gry/Zos-dance is unclear from Phrynichus and has been widely interpreted. Phrynichus describes the dancing with the adverbs phortik?s and asch? mon?s (Eclog. 182). The former is typical in descriptions of artistic expressions that are coarse and vulgar (LSJ s.v. (popTiK?c; 1.2), and in reference to dance, the word appears to denote bodily gestures that are unrestrained, indecent, or inappropriate; so Hammerstaedt 2000,42. The word is used by Athenaeus of the dance of Hippocleides, who famously lost a bid for marriage to a princess of Sicyon for insulting the king with his outrageous moves (14.628d; cf. 14.631d, where the word is synonymous in the same author with phaulos, in contrast, as usual, with spoudaios). The connection with animal masquerades is probably erroneous (pro: Pfuhl 1923, 770; Beccatti 1960, s.v. grylloi; Bruneau 1962, 225-28; contra: Binsfeld 1962, 78; C?be 1966, 344, 362, n. 4; Chantraine 1999, s.v. yp?XXoc). While dances of this sort, including imitations of animals, are indeed known from the Egyptian tradition (Lexov? 1935, 25-28, 33-36), their relationship to Phrynichus' gryllos cannot be securely established. Such interpretations are based on false etymology and assume a connection with an ancient style of painting called gryllos as well (see pp. 353-59 below). While some scholars have argued that parodie paintings depicting animals exemplify this style, it is unlikely that animals were the exclusive focus of the gryllos painting style, and therefore, of the gryllos dance style as well. In any event, the resemblance of Plutarch's Gryllus to either the painting or dance forms emphatically does not depend upon his beastly status.</page><page sequence="6">352 LUCAS HERCHENROEDER In fact, there is no etymological relationship between yp?Xo? and yp?XXo?. The two are distinct words: the former, a substantive form of the verb ypuXi?co, derived itself from the noun yp? ("grunt"); the latter, a proper noun for a specific dance form of uncertain derivation (Chan traine 1999, s.v. yp?, yp?XXo?). By the second century CE. at the latest, the double-lambda spelling for the word ypuXoc; was adopted with some regularity. After all, Phrynichus saw the need for orthographic regulation. The difficulty is in understanding Plutarch's use of the word. On the one hand, while it is possible that the double-lambda spelling for ypvXoc; was current enough by Plutarch's time to make his use of it nothing unor dinary (i.e., the fact that it is not attested before the Gryllus is a coinci dence of our sources), as a writer with some concern for the particulars of Attic style, Plutarch was likely aware of the distinction Phrynichus identifies.13 His choice of the double-lambda spelling for the outrageous pig's name, then, will have played upon confusion with the dance form in this respect. On the other hand, there is a special significance in the interference Phrynichus observes between yp?XXo? and yp?Xo?, for while any conceptual link between the two was initially a result of confusion, interchangeability in usage affected the semantic value of each, causing strong distinction between them to erode with time. False etymological links of this sort were hardly unusual in Greek, especially for words of Egyptian provenance.14 It is this ambiguity, in which the name evokes two (initially) distinct categories of meaning, that characterizes Plutarch's protagonist-pig. In choosing the name Tp?XXo? for his pig, when the proper Attic word for a pig's grunting should be yp?Xo?, Plutarch has nuanced the figure of the pig to create a performer of sorts, playing upon the similarly (if sepa rately) coarse character of both the dance and the pig. This is essentially a pun, activated by the representation of a pig in a performance context. Attributes of the gry/Zos-dancer then come to characterize the pig in his The resemblance is due chiefly to his characteristic unseemliness and the parodie conflict between Odysseus and the pig. 13 Although Plutarch ought not to be compared with many of the strictest Atticizing writers, his writing does exhibit characteristic features of Atticism (e.g., periodic sentences, avoidance of hiatus, and other syntactical and morphological features); see Ziegler 1949, 932-35; Russell 1973,21-22. 14 One may compare so-called folk etymologies in Greek. Speakers occasionally imagined or fabricated etymological relationships between foreign and Greek words on the basis of similar phonetic values?e.g., the Egyptian shesep ankh ("living statue") re etymologized as sphinx ("throttler") in Greek; cf. Kingsley 1993. The gry(l)los pun that appears here in Plutarch reflects a similar mode of linguistic exchange.</page><page sequence="7">PLUTARCH'S GRYLLUS 353 efforts to out-argue Odysseus and are an important component in the dialogue's broad thematic repertory, which blends the various meanings and associations of the words grylos and gryllos. As if to call attention to the importance of the gryl(l)os pun, Plutarch gives the pig's name a prominent place in a key passage at the beginning of the dialogue. As Gryllus makes his appearance, Odysseus is at a loss for what to call him: "And how am I to address him, Circe? Who in the world is he?" Circe replies with a question: "What's that to do with the issue (logos)? Call him Gryllus, if you like" (986b).15 Her response is telling, for she explic itly makes an issue of the name by asking its significance to the logos (i.e., the issue at hand, the topic of conversation, the plot, or the subject under investigation). Her question about the name calls attention to its essential artificiality but playfully underscores its central significance. In fact, the gryl(l)os pun becomes a touchstone for more fully understanding the dialogue, for Plutarch has drawn upon a blend of independent, but complementary senses suggested by it. Gryllus is a figure of characteristic coarseness both as a pig and as a vulgar dancer.16 He is also a distinctively parodie figure, a dimension of his persona suggested by a connection with a certain style of caricature illustration (also called gryllos, but likely not related to the dance form), which has clear affinities with him in theme and characterization.17 Direct evidence for the gryllos painting style is scarce, amounting to only two textual references and an illustration on papyrus. The standard definition from LSJ is "comic figure, caricature" (s.v. yp?XXoc; 1.2), an inter pretation formed from identification of comparative evidence. Frescoes from Pompeii, for instance, have been thought to preserve something like the so-called grylloi. These depict humorous or ugly parodie figures 15 All translations of the Gryllus are those of Cherniss and Helmbold (Loeb ed.) with slight modification. All other translations in this article are the author's. 16 Perhaps the pig's name, as reference to a type of dance generally, also identifies him with certain mimetic animal dances in antiquity, e.g., the Thracian pig dance mentioned in Athenaeus (14.629d) or the Egyptian dance described in Lucian (Salt. 19). While the vulgar gry//as-dance is not to be identified with such dances (see n. 12 above), Plutarch may be evoking them in his representation of the pig as a parodie performer. 17 Scholars do not agree on whether or how much the gryllos painting and dance forms are related (see n. 12 above). Chantraine (1999, s.v. ypvXkoq) suggests that the term was probably first used of dancers and then adopted for the painting style, which gels with Pliny's anecdotal reference to the name's ascription to a genre of illustrations from an actual performer (see pp. 354-55 below). Certain bronze statuettes of dancing dwarves from Tunisia, known for their ridiculous smallness and deformity, exhibit properties of both; cf. Hammerstaedt 2000,29,46. The chief publication for these statues is Merlin 1910; cf. Maiuri 1933,138-39.</page><page sequence="8">354 LUCAS HERCHENROEDER characterized by small size and disproportionate bodies. The famous paintings from the House of Menander show figures with tiny limbs and enlarged heads, apparently engaged in parodies of familiar myths (e.g., Theseus and the Minotaur, Marsyas and Apollo).18 By assimilating mod els of epic heroism in this way, the figures in these paintings exemplify a basic feature of parodie expression in antiquity, for par?idia, essentially a literary form, consisted of incongruous and comic re-creations of liter ary models, especially epic.19 Mock-epic or mock-heroic paintings from Pompeii, then, are the visual counterparts of parodie poetry and offer a useful parallel for understanding both the grylloi attested in literary sources and the function of Plutarch's Gryllus as a parodie work. The word gryllos actually occurs twice in extant literary descriptions of graphic art. In these it appears to designate humorously ugly or base and lowly figures. According to Pliny the Elder, Antiphilus, an Egyptian artist of the fourth century B.C.E. painted comicae tabellae ("scenes from comedy"). Certain paintings introduced by him came to be known as grylli, deriving their name from a single paradigmatic figure, Gryllus, a character from comedy perhaps, whose physical appearance (or outfit) was distinctively ridiculous.20 Later, in Philodemus' Books on Rhetoric (first century B.C.E.), we find the verb gryllographein ("to draw/paint a 18Maiuri 1933, 128-39; cf. Binsfeld 1962, 77; C?be 1966, 362, n. 4; Ling 1991, 165-67. 19The term par?idia appears initially to have denoted "comic incongruity" in literary composition; Leli?vre 1954; Rose 1993,6-36, esp. 32. Citing ambivalence in the preftxpara-, Rose points out that par?idia designates both nearness and opposition, establishing an unbal anced or inappropriate relationship between literary subjects or between a subject and its setting. The interpretation of parody as a mock-epic poem derives from Aristotle's remarks on the parodist, Hegemon of Thasos (Poet. 2, 1448a). Such poetry preserves the meter, vocabulary, or subject matter of epic verse, but rewrites characters or plots that transgress generic norms, even substituting animals, as with Hegemon's Batrachomyomachia ("Battle of Frogs and Mice") and others; cf. Householder 1944,3; Maas 1949,1684-85. Par?idia later encompassed more than mock-epic. In the scholiasts to Aristophanes, for example, the verb par?ide? denotes other types of humorous literary allusion and rearrangement. 20 "He painted a character in humorous pictures in a laughable outfit (with a laughable appearance?) by the name Gryllus, from which that class of paintings, the grylli are named" ("iocosis [tabellis] nomine Gryllum deridiculi habitus pinxit, unde id genus picturae grylli vocantur," HN 35.114). Although the name Gryllus is an emendation of grytlum, grytulum, and egrillum in the various manuscripts, it is strongly suggested by the oldest manuscripts, which have unde . . . grylli vocantur at the end of the citation?the point of the passage is that the paintings took their name from the character. Besides, the root gryll- is firmly attested in Philodemus (Sudhaus vol. 2, p. 297), where it refers to a distinctive type of paint ing that is also discussed here. On understanding tabellis as an implication of iocosis, see Hammerstaedt 2000, 31. The association with drama may also be suggested by references in mime to a figure bearing the name Gryllus (Herod. 1.50; 10.2).</page><page sequence="9">PLUTARCH'S GRYLLUS 355 gryllos") contrasted with to kalous pinakas d?miourgein ("producing fair paintings") (Sudhaus vol. 2, p. 297), where in its opposition with the adjective kalos the prefix gryllo- appears to signify moral and social base ness as much as low aesthetic merit.21 Accordingly, grylloi will have been painted figures that were either characteristically comedie and marked by shoddy appearance, or merely ugly, lowly, and light-hearted in com parison with loftier subjects for painting. As a signifier of some negative aesthetic standard, the word gryllos clearly possessed a broad range of application. I hope to show that this standard was partly parodie in its expression from comparison with a third piece of evidence, an illustrated papyrus scrap. The papyrus, P.Oxy. 2331, dated by its initial editors to the third century CE., suggests a firmer connection between the grylloi and parody.22 Not only does the papyrus bear poetry and illustrations spoofing Heracles' victory over the Nemean lion, there also appears the word rPYAAQ in the first verse of the poem, an apparent reference to the illustrations. The papyrus is exceptional in this regard, for it gives direct evidence for the obscure art form in question. To be specific, the papyrus' surviving text?most of a column of text is missing on the left side?recounts an exchange between Heracles and an unnamed speaker who calls the hero out to describe his legendary accomplishments, promising to do the same in return. Heracles accepts. He then gives an account of his victory over the Nemean lion in a single couplet. The speaker replies in kind, describing in a second couplet how he has killed a chameleon, a ridiculous inversion of Heracles' achievement. Each of the three verse segments is followed by an illustration:23 21LSJ s.v. yp?XXoc; 1.2. The verb gry lio graphein potentially refers only to artwork of low technical merit, e.g., sketchy drawings or paintings; see Latte 1955,191; Hammerstaedt 2000, 34-36. However, given the moral and social signification of the adjective kalos, gryl lographein could denote representation of lowly figures, as opposed to loftier subjects like epic heroes, for example. In this case, physical appearance would be a likely signifier, whether in an outfit or by some deformity. The Gryllus-character described by Pliny seems to have been identified by some sort of vestment (Gryllum deridiculi habitus, HN 35.114), and the deformed figures of the Pompeian frescoes are similarly noteworthy for their appearance. At any rate, particulars of meaning of the verb gryllographein are not entirely clear, not even whether the verb refers absolutely to the representation of human(oid) figures at all. 22The original publication of the papyrus is Lobel and Roberts 1954; cf. Page 1957; Maas 1958. For a recent discussion of it in the context of related material, see Hammer staedt 2000,36-41. The following discussion is greatly indebted to these articles, particularly that of Maas. 23Text and emendations of POxy. 2331 follow Maas 1958; my translation follows suggestions of Page 1957.</page><page sequence="10">356 LUCAS HERCHENROEDER Column 2: Column 3: ...]0?vap[...] Tt?vTOTE Yp?XXtp 'E[y?] npioxov Neu?rj X?ovxa [...

Although the first line in column 2 is only partly legible, the word rPYAAO is unmistakable and presumably refers to the illustrations.24 In the next line, the speaker identifies himself as "a complete outcast who strove with him [i.e., Heracles] over the labors." This neatly introduces two important details: the notion of lowliness suggested by the word peri katharma and that of rivalry indicated by the verb erizo. However, given the speaker's self-proclaimed lowliness before the heroic Heracles, the rivalry is distinctively unmatched. It is a parodie take on heroic achieve ment, pairing two subjects that are fundamentally incommensurable. The disproportionate victories of the rivals, represented in verse and illustra tion, are the best indication of this: Heracles defeats the fearsome Nemean lion; the speaker, a lizard. There is a fantastic pun in the last surviving 24The line is incomplete but seems to have been continuous with text from the first column, now lost. Page 1957 suggests, "I tell the labors of Heracles, adorned with a cartoon (gryllos) for each occasion."</page><page sequence="11">PLUTARCH'S GRYLLUS 357 verse of the poem that maintains the comic incongruity at the verbal level. To Heracles' boast "I killed the lion" (leonta), the speaker offers his own: "taking the lion to the ground (cham[ai] leonta) I killed it," or rather, "taking hold of a chameleon (cham[ai]leonta) I killed it," a joke so subtly placed as to evade detection by the papyrus' earliest editors.25 Illustrations beneath the verses in column 3 maintain the parodie theme as well, depicting the exploits of Heracles and the speaker individually. While the forms of Heracles and the speaker are counterparts to one another in their similar faces and postures, they are conspicuously dif ferent in size. Heracles and the lion are twice the size of the speaker and the chameleon (fig. 1), and rightly so, for the latter's accomplishment and stature are not to be taken as equal to those of the mythical hero. The self-professed outcast is capable of heroism only in miniature.26 The appearance of the word gryllos in reference to the illustrations on the papyrus points us back to Pliny and Philodemus. If we accept that Pliny's Gryllus was a comedie figure, the word gryllos may come from a stage trickster figure playing opposite some epic hero. Heracles appeared in productions of this sort. Like Odysseus, he was a regular figure on the comic stage, appearing in scenes that spoofed his heroic stature (Padilla 1998). In any event, such trickster figures, like the speaker of POxy. 2331, were a regular part of the creative reception and reuse of epic and other loftier material.27 Plutarch's talking pig is just such a creation. Since the representation of grylloi was primarily visual, the ugliness and lowliness that characterized their appearance likely became typical of them (as did 25 The pun is noted by Maas 1958,173, who refers to the colors of the illustrations as evidence. In the third illustration the animal strangled by the speaker is the same color as the line representing the ground, green. The image of the Nemean lion in the second illustration is yellow. 26 Balanced language reinforces the mocking theme suggested by the poem's dramatic situation. The speaker uses similar phrasing in both his request for Heracles' story and in the offer of his own (col. 2,11. 7-9). The two couplets in col. 3, in which Heracles and the speaker describe their victories, are similarly balanced. Each opens with the extraordinary pronoun ey?, an unusual transliteration of the Latin ego (at col. 3,1.1 the writing is partly illegible, but the meter requires ey?). In recounting the disproportionate victories, Heracles takes the lion "with strong hands" (col. 3,1.2), while the speaker's lizard is "hard to handle" (col. 3,1. 3). Parodie humor, since its basis is formal as much as thematic, consists in the incommensurability of these achievements within the poetry's structural and syntactical balance. 27Another papyrus, PK?ln 179, may be compared here. It shows verses with faded illustrations (even the remarkable Latinized ey?), juxtaposing Heracles' victory over the Cretan bull/Minotaur and that of an unnamed character over a horned snail: Livrea 1982; Hammerstaedt 2000, 38.</page><page sequence="12">Fig. 1.

Such is the cast of Plutarch's Gryllus, a lowly brute rivaling the heroic speaker, Odysseus, in a sophistic contest. In matching the pig with Odysseus, the contest in Plutarch's Gryllus is typically parodie. Take once more the naming scene already discussed, in which Circe suggests the name Gryllus to Odysseus. The exchange, initiated by Odysseus' question "Who in the world is he?" (986b), plays upon Homeric scenes in which strangers meet for the first time.28 The joke is that the pig bears no name. Circe gives him one instead: Gryllus. While the name's trivial origin here is un-heroic?compare with the grand story of Odysseus' name in Odyssey 19?and is itself a mere onomato poetic label (like the word barbaros attributed to outsiders), the name also cues the entrance of the traditional figure of epic spoofing, whose appearance at this precise point is all the more crucial because the scene is already an epic recreation. As mentioned above, the naming sequence turns upon Circe's question regarding the connection between the pig's name and the logos. This signals the name's centrality not merely to the dialogue's plot, but to the discursive designs of its author as well. The choice of name rpuXXo? here (instead of TpuXoc;) highlights the importance of reading parody in the rhetorical contest to follow. The punning name is subtle to be sure. To some it was surely imperceptible, given Phrynichus' remarks about the general misuse of grylos and gryllos. It represented a learned joke that reinforced the basic absurdity of Gryllus' challenge to Odysseus. As such, it is not vital to understanding the parodie effect in the philosopher-pig's claims to virtue and freedom, for these are extrava gantly ridiculous in themselves. THE PHILOSOPHER-PIG SPEAKS While the Gryllus' parodie humor turns upon the ridiculous rhetorical contest between the archetypal speaker and talking pig, a crucial aspect of this is Gryllus' insistence on physis as a basis for argument. Apart from epic material, the dialogue parodies philosophy too, especially the concentration on physis and its counterpart, the theme of the Golden 28 Cf. the Homeric Circe's question to Odysseus: "Who are you and where are you from?" (Od. 10.325). Identity is an immediate concern in such scenes, and characters generally give their origins and lineage at length (e.g.,Telemachus to Nestor in Odyssey 3; Diomedes and Glaucus to one another in Iliad 6). Parody of such scenes actually goes back to the Homeric poems themselves (e.g., the name Outis taken by Odysseus in Odyssey 9).</page><page sequence="14">360 LUCAS HERCHENROEDER Age, that appear in much philosophical discourse. To step back a moment, let us return to the central premise of Gryllus' argument: animals are by nature more capable of virtuous lifestyles than humans are. At the start of his speech, Gryllus wins agreement for this premise with a clever anal ogy. He equates the souls of animals with the island of the Cyclopes, a place well known for its natural abundance: although it is not plowed or sown, it is "naturally (ten physin) so fertile and fecund that it produces spontaneously every kind of crop" (986f). Once Odysseus acknowledges the island's superiority, Gryllus continues: since a soul is better which "produces a harvest of virtue (autophye) as a spontaneous crop," that of animals must have "a greater natural capacity and perfection for the generation of arete, for without command or instruction, 'unsown and unplowed' as it were, it naturally (kata physin) brings forth and develops virtue" (987b). Here the reference to Odyssey 9 is one example of the dialogue's many parodie resonances of Homer.29 There is even a humor ous verbal echo in the concluding description "unsown and unplowed" (asporos kai an?rotos; cf. Od. 9.109: aspar?a kai an?rota).Yet the reference to the island of the Cyclopes evokes the popular philosophical theme of the Golden Age as well, characterized as it is by reflection on the virtues of living in harmony with physis or, for Cynic thinkers in particular, on the simple advantages of animals' lives.30 Moreover, Gryllus' concentra tion on the soul's capacity for arete stems from traditional philosophical discourse, as does much of the language he uses to develop this point (e.g., al?theia, eidolon, 986a; dialeg?, syni?mi, 986b). Couched in such terms, Gryllus' speech has the distinct tone of rhetorical posturing in philosophical debate. With physis as his starting point, Gryllus launches into an orderly demonstration of animals' moral superiority. His clever use of the Golden Age theme to elicit Odysseus' agreement with his central premise not only marks an engagement with popular philosophical topoi. It also marks his use of crafty methods of persuasion to push his point forward. In fact, Gryllus' speech to Odysseus shows many features of rhetorical refine 29The dialogue is full of Homeric resonances of this sort; see Fern?ndez Delgado 2000,173-74. 30 For the Golden Age in the Greek intellectual tradition, see Baldry 1952; Vidal Naquet 1978; Blundell 1986, chap. 6; Sorabji 1993, 160-61. Notions of animal superiority or preferences for a lifestyle modeled on animals are Cynic perspectives, often attributed by later writers to Diogenes of Sinope; cf. D.Chr., Or. 6.13-33, 10.16; D.L., Vit. 6.22. For the Cynic antecedents of Plutarch's Gryllus, including formal and ideological aspects, see Dierauer 1977,178-81; Bergua Cavero 1991.</page><page sequence="15">PLUTARCH'S GRYLLUS 361 ment, such as deliberate concern for taxis or narrative arrangement,31 manipulation of details in traditional exempla, and a general adherence to regularized principles of organization and expression.32 These aspects of Gryllus' speech have been thoroughly examined by scholars, and there is no need to repeat their findings in detail here. I only wish to point out that rhetorical aspects of the Gryllus have influenced scholarly impressions of the work as a whole (that it is an exercise in ?thopoiia, for example), when, to be more precise, they characterize Gryllus as an internal speaker?he is a typical sophist. Odysseus makes the observation himself: "You seem to me have been born an amazing sophist!" (988e-f).The pig soon owns up to this charge: "Since you are not unaware that I am a sophist, let me make use of some taxis for my speech" (989b). Plutarch has depicted his talking pig in the persona of a careful, textbook speaker. Yet Gryllus is a parodie representative of sophistry on the whole in this respect, for, as will be shown, contradictions in argumentation and expression within his speech weaken his claims.33 31 Division of Gryllus' speech on virtue into discreet categories of courage (987c-88f), temperance (988f-91d), and intelligence (991d-92e) not only follows standard concerns for organization but apparently follows a scheme of organization that was somewhat con ventional for discussion of (animal) virtue as well. Odysseus' use of the adverb ephex?s ("next in order") in prompting Gryllus to take up the second of his topics, animal temper ance, upon completion of his argument about courage, perhaps reveals the high degree of standardization in order of delivery for a speech of this sort (988f). 32 See Bergua Cavero 1991,18-19; Fern?ndez Delgado 2000,176-81. Above all, the speech resembles progymnasmata, preparatory rhetorical exercises geared partly towards developing techniques of self-characterization. On one hand, in reflecting on human and animal lifestyles, Gryllus' speech is also an example of synkrisis, an exercise in which the speaker makes a sustained comparison. Synkriseis often combine encomium and invective, employing a variety of standardized exempla as support for a given position; for exempla employed by Gryllus, see Indelli 1992. On the other hand, in formulating an argument from within the context of a Homeric scenario, the speech employs ?thopoiia, a rhetorical technique of expressive impersonation. Such types of rhetorical expression often recre ated Homeric characters and environment, making use of epic meter, language, and style (Fern?ndez Delgado 1994). 33 It is worth adding here that in his representation of the pig as a rhetorician, Plu tarch may have in mind an additional significance of the name Gryllus. Aristotle produced a treatise on rhetoric entitled Gryllus (named after Xenophon's son, who died heroically at Mantinea), one subject of which seems to have been the status of rhetorical ability as a natural gift, rather than as an art acquired from instruction (Quint. Inst. 2.17.13-15). In this respect, the treatise was possibly an attack on Isocratean sophistry and abuses of rhetorical techniques; Chroust 1973,29-42; Poster 1997. It is tempting to think that Plutarch was also referring to this treatise in choosing the name for his protagonist. Intertextuality with the Aristotelian Gryllus would complement the comical insistence of Plutarch's Gryllus upon</page><page sequence="16">362 LUCAS HERCHENROEDER While Gryllus' speech preserves philosophical themes and follows regularized rhetorical techniques, it is not to be taken as an entirely seri ous philosophical investigation on the part of its external author, that is, on the part of Plutarch. Gryllus is a humorous representation of such a speaker. This is perhaps evident in the fact that his position on animal intelligence is extreme even for Plutarch. Neither of Plutarch's other surviving works addressing the subject bears the assertion that animals are actually superior to humans in intellectual ability.34 This overstate ment reinforces the comic value of the dialogue's chief parodie situation, namely, that of the pig asserting himself against the epic hero. Moreover, Gryllus never clearly upstages his rival in rhetorical demonstration. Any headway he makes into his argument is repeatedly met with taunts from Odysseus that undercut his stature as a serious speaker. As he goes on at length about the courage animals exhibit, for instance, Odysseus interrupts, partly with a sarcastic concession to his claims and partly with a jab at his long-windedness: "Indeed, it is perfectly obvious from that that bravery is an innate characteristic of beasts, but outspokenness (parrh?sia) is actu ally contrary to nature in human beings!" (987f).35 Odysseus points out here that he has not had a chance to speak in the debate, insinuating that nature as the basis for animals' intellectual superiority (991d-92e). Perhaps the traditional debate over rhetoric's position as natural skill or learned art provided further material for the parodie scenario in Plutarch's Gryllus. 34 In the other two, On The Cleverness of Animals and On Eating Meat, animals are attributed comparable powers of perception, sensation, and judgment, but are not superior; see Newmyer 1996,16-17. 35Those familiar with the text of the Gryllus may find this reading unusual, since the lines in which this joke appears are attributed to Gryllus in many editions of the Moralia. Walter Lapini 1996,211-12, argues that Odysseus interrupts Gryllus in the passage in ques tion (987f: o?? of) uaXiGTci OfjXov oxi x? Gnp?a Ttp?? t? Oappe?v eu n?cpUKe to??. ?' ?vOpconoi? r\ Ttappnaia Kai Ttap? cp?oiv eaxtv- ?KStOev ?' ?v, &lt;?) ?eXriGT' 'O?uaaeti, u?Xiaxa Kcrrau?ooic;- ?v y?p to?? ?npioi? ktX). He attributes text between oi? and ?axiv to Odysseus, basing his claim on three key points: (1) repetition of the superlative u?Xiata would be awkward, since Gryllus would be employing it equally for two separate points (e.g., "Above all, it is clear from what has just been said ... and, my dear Odysseus, you will learn from the following above air); (2) the combination of u?Xtaxa and cb ?eXriGT' 'OOua?d) should signal a change of speakers, since at 992c, Gryllus says the same thing following an interruption from Odysseus and, in fact, forms of direct address in the Gryllus only appear when speakers begin to speak to one another (according to Ure?a Bracero 1996, combinations of vocatives and epithets in Plutarch's dialogues often serve to indicate a change of speaker in the manner of stage directions); and (3) the manuscript's parrh?sia, whi'h has led puzzled editors to propose various emendations, does not easily fit as part of Gryllus' argument about courage. The lines in question appear to be part of a sarcastic " eruption by Odysseus.</page><page sequence="17">PLUTARCH'S GRYLLUS 363 Gryllus' unrestrained, or even rambling speech exemplifies the behavior of animals alone, not of humans. In other words, Gryllus makes outra geous claims, a sneer on parrh?sia, traditional principle of open discourse in the philosophic as much as the democratic tradition, as just so much laborious prattling.36 Similarly, Odysseus' recognition of the pig's sophistic craft, mentioned just above, is not meant to flatter: "You seem to me to have been born an amazing sophist . . . who even now, speaking from swinishness, has taken up the issue with such youthful vigor (neanik?s)" (988e-f).The joke is appropriate to the subject under discussion, for having just heard Gryllus speak on courage, Odysseus uses the adverb neanik?s to characterize his cavalier assertions of superiority, but the adverb also implies youthful indiscretion (LSJ s.v. veaviKux; 1.3). The remark is meant to undercut Gryllus' legitimacy as a speaker?i.e., he is a brash sophist, not a genuine philosopher. Odysseus' taunts make speech and rhetorical practice themselves significant issues in the dialogue. In fact, they are the dialogue's main parodie material. After all, the protagonist-pig is not only gryllos, that ridiculous lowly figure rivaling an old-school hero at his own game. He is also "grunter" (grylos), a pun that suggests an inability to speak, or in this case, artlessness in speaking. Above all, Gryllus' representation as a parodie figure depends upon the inconsistency between his argumentative and actual positions, for the natural freedom he claims animals enjoy, it hardly need be said, jars with his state of captivity on Circe's isle. Insofar as he construes virtue as a state of radical freedom and moral deficiency as a form of enslave ment, Gryllus follows Cynic thinkers and others in adopting Golden-Age thematics to reject conventional lifestyle and society as a step towards moral improvement. His understanding that humans are more susceptible to influences that impede moral development forms a chief part of this 36 Cf. LSJ s.v. Ttapprja?a 2. So Lapini 1996 interprets the lines in question. He finds the remark "parrh?sia is not a natural thing for humans" to imply a dig at Gryllus: "la chi acchierite sia una virt? soprattuto animale." In the philosophical tradition, the principle of parrh?sia played important roles?whether for Epicurean thinkers as a basic component in learning environments, or for Cynic thinkers as a virtue of candor and bluntness of speech, no matter how offensive, in contexts where propriety advised restraint; see Momigliano 1941,156-57, with references; Kennedy 1999,33-34. Plutarch appears to be interfacing with one or both of these. If Lapini is right to attribute the lines in question to Odysseus (see n. 35 above), the reference to parrh?sia might be either of at least two things: a sarcastic reproach of Gryllus for obstructing open exchange in the debate or an observation of the outrageousness of his claims. I have chosen to foreground Lapini's interpretation in this article, but whatever the precise meaning of Odysseus' remarks here, they clearly denote his intention to undercut the seriousness of Gryllus' argument.</page><page sequence="18">364 LUCAS HERCHENROEDER rhetorical position, and we find that references to forced subjection are prominent in each of the speech's three sequences. Take Gryllus' discussion of courage. His assertion that animals have a greater natural capacity for courage is based upon the observation that in conflict animals show bravery as a genuine impulse, and not, for example, through fear of the disciplinary sanctions that coerce human soldiers (987c-d). In this respect, human courage is a matter of "slavish submission (douleuousan) to custom and censure," which is not courage at all but rather fear of punishment (988b-c). Humans are not brave, Gryllus says; they yield to societal expectations and institutions. In a key passage in this speech, Gryllus argues that true courage is about being free and that animals are superior to humans in this respect for their absolute refusal to yield to opponents (987d-e): It is [animals'] nature (physei) to flee subjection: with a stout heart they maintain an indomitable spirit to the very end. Nor are they conquered when physically overpowered; they never give up in their hearts even while perishing in the fray ... Beasts never beg or sue for pity or acknowledge defeat: lion is never slave to lion, or horse to horse through coward ice, as man is to man when without protest he accepts the name [i.e., "slavery"=douleia\ whose root is "cowardice" (tes deilias). And when men have subdued beasts by snares and tricks, such of them as are full-grown refuse food and endure the pangs of thirst until they induce and embrace death in place of slavery. For animals, courage rests in a natural resistance to captivity. By contrast, the institution of slavery, which implicitly defines human society here, is a mark of cowardice, since it stems from submission. A false etymo logical link between douleia and deilia strengthens the connection. It is noteworthy that Gryllus bases his argument on physis. By his reasoning, virtue (courage in this case specifically) stems from maintaining one's natural state of freedom. The theme of subjection also appears in the speeches on temperance and intelligence, although with a humorous variation in the latter. In the second section of his speech, Gryllus discusses temperance. He argues that humans' pursuit of physical or material pleasures is often excessive and that they are easily ruled by fixations upon sex, food, wealth, and other luxuries. His main point is that many of the objects of human desire go beyond natural necessity, which again underscores the role of physis in defining virtue (989b-c). According to Gryllus, while certain pleasures are appropriate because they are natural and essential to liv</page><page sequence="19">PLUTARCH'S GRYLLUS 365 ing (such as food and drink) or at least natural, if not essential (such as sex), humans pursue these in excess or pursue pleasures beyond these (such as wealth and luxury). Such pursuits bring commotion into the soul and cause moral turpitude. To illustrate his point, Gryllus offers a vivid figure, likening the soul to a city distressed by foreign encroachment and violent upheaval (989c-d): But there are desires of another kind, neither essential nor natural, that are imported in a deluge from without as result of your inane illusions and because you lack true culture. So great is their multitude that the natural desires are, every one of them, all but overwhelmed, as though an alien rabble were overpowering the native citizenry. But beasts have souls com pletely inaccessible (abatous) and closed to these adventitious passions and live their lives free from empty illusions as though they dwelt far from the sea. They fall short in the matter of delicate and luxurious living, but solidly protect their sobriety and the better regulation of their desires since those that dwell alongside them are neither numerous nor alien. The association of vice with foreign contact is a familiar one. In fact, the specific reference to the city's proximity to the sea here evokes passages in Plato and Aristotle that mention threats posed by contact with outsid ers.37 The passage is also a direct echo of a Platonic conceptualization of the soul (e.g., Phd. 66c), in which the influence of the passions is likened to enslavement. Gryllus uses a traditional philosophical metaphor to construe temperance as the ability to resist subordination to certain harm ful influences. While human souls are more susceptible to incursion and occupation by harmful passions, and hence less free, those of animals are "inaccessible" (abatous) to such, and hence freer by implication. As with courage, although in a figurative sense, animals are superior to humans in their ability to assert and maintain freedom. In the third section, Gryllus goes on to describe animals' superior intelligence. He lists examples of amazing feats that animals perform untaught, such as the medical treatments pigs, tortoises, and goats are able to administer to themselves (991e-f). There is no teacher for such skills, only physis (991f). Superior intelligence, then, is manifest in survival techniques as a matter of natural self-sufficiency. Once again, the basis of animal virtue is physis, which, Gryllus says, renders animal intelligence 37 PL, Lg. 704e-05c; Arist., Pol. 1327; both cited by Helmbold 1957, 513, n. c.</page><page sequence="20">366 LUCAS HERCHENROEDER so perfect that it requires no instruction from outside.38 Oddly, Gryllus emphasizes the point with the claim that natural intelligence is such that it allows animals to learn special tasks under instruction from humans (992a-b): The mental abilities of animals that men induce to accept instruction or training ... receive the lessons with an abundance of understanding even when they are contrary to their natural form (kai para physin tou s?matos). I pass over puppies that are trained as hunters, or colts schooled to keep time in their gait, or crows that are taught to talk, or dogs, to jump through revolving hoops. In the theatre horses and steers go through an exact rou tine in which they lie down or dance or hold a precarious pose or perform movements not at all easy even for men. Here the image is domestication. The various tasks to which humans have subjected animals are indices of their intelligence, even (especially?) when these tasks are "contrary to their natural form (kai para physin tou s?matos)," as Gryllus says. The point is remarkable for two reasons: first, for implicitly deemphasizing the crucial role o? physis in defining an animal's capacity for virtue; second, for explicitly connecting the theme of subjection to specific manifestations of virtue. There is an exceptional paradox here, for in Gryllus' discussions of courage and temperance, natural abilities (whether to avoid captivity or to resist enslavement by harmful desires) are grounds for moral superiority, whereas in his treat ment of intelligence, the animal is superior for developing abilities con trary to nature (para physin). While intelligence is initially an explicitly natural and untaught faculty, it also shows itself in the impressive feat of receiving instruction from human masters in the process of domesti cation. This is a key detail. As grunting-pig-turned-sophist and parodie rival to the epic wordsmith, Gryllus brings his rhetorical masterpiece to an emphatic non sequitur: exaltation of the animal's indomitable spirit comes back to domestication. While this contradiction is the dialogue's main joke, other references to the subordination of animals imply Gryllus' own domesticity as well. In fact, he ends up not too unlike captives of the Homeric Circe: pigs kept in pens or lions and wolves likened to domestic dogs greeting their masters (Od. 10.212-9). Looking back to the beginning of Gryllus' speech, we find 38"It is just because of the health and completeness of [an animal's] native virtue (tes kata physin aretes) that it is indifferent to the contributions to its intelligence supplied by the knowledge of others" (992a).</page><page sequence="21">PLUTARCH'S GRYLLUS 367 the theme of domestication anticipated in a key passage. In his speech on courage, Gryllus says that young animals become vulnerable in captivity, since their natural abilities of resistance are worn down by drugging (kata pharmattontes) and magical doses (meiligmata) (987e). The language of magic in this description alludes to Gryllus himself, whom we might recall has been transformed by Circe's spells. Of course, the meiligmata named here evoke magical powers generally, but the verb katapharmatt? recalls the Homeric Circe, who ispolypharmakos (Od. 10.276), mixing drugs into the food for her visitors so that they "completely forget their homeland" (Od. 10.236). The same theme of transformation is implicit in Gryllus' references to young animals in captivity, for the pharmaka that wear down their spirit of resistance are the same that transformed Gryllus?that is, the state of young animals in captivity is the same as Gryllus' own.39 In addition, there is an important figurative aspect. Gryllus uses the word exemer?sis ("taming") to describe the process of breaking young animals in captivity (987e). The word denotes bringing natural things (e.g., wild animals, the earth itself) to submission, of reclaiming them from nature, and is not unusual here in this respect. In a less intensive form (hemer? sis), the word denotes the process of civilization and cultural refinement for the uncivilized, and in the Platonic tradition in particular, it refers to the taming effects of philosophical learning: a figurative transition from brutishness to docility under the influence o? paideia.40 Plutarch appears to exploit this sense of the word in his description of the learned pig. In what is perhaps the ultimate absurdity of Gryllus' rhetorical position, his use of the word hemer?sis actually implies not merely his domesticity, but his pretensions as cultivated speaker as well. He is Circe's own pet sophist, so to speak, answering to her beck and call.41 39 Looking back, Plutarch makes clear connections between Gryllus' form and Circe's magic. At an earlier point in the dialogue, Gryllus alludes to the danger of transformation by Circe's pharmaka. He criticizes Odysseus' reluctance to submit to Circe's powers and continue life as a beast: "Just as children dread the doctor's doses (pharmaka) and run from lessons ... you have shied away from the change from one shape to another" (986d). Odysseus too expresses a fear of transformation by Circe's magic, mentioning explicitly the kuke?n that appears in Homer (985e). 40E.g., Pit. 289b-c, Rep. 416e; cf. LSJ s.v. rjuep?co I.4.a, which refers to the word's direct connection with paideia (e.g., PL, Lg. 935a: imo Ttai?eia? r|uep(?)0n). 41 At the opening of the dialogue, Gryllus responds to Circe's summons to debate Odysseus. When she takes leave of Odysseus and Gryllus, her remark, "I'll retire now to avoid any suggestion that he is arguing against his own convictions to curry favor with me" (986b), suggests she retains influence over the animals.</page><page sequence="22">368 LUCAS HERCHENROEDER ANIMALS AND THE EDUCATED: LANGUAGE, LEARNING, AND ELITE CULTURE IN IMPERIAL GREECE Open and implicit references to subjection and the domestic status of Circe's animals constitute a running joke that undercuts Gryllus' claims of freedom and virtue. From the irony of his rhetorical position and his significantly unusual name, I have suggested that Gryllus' claims about animal intelligence do not constitute a serious philosophical position. Notably, Helmbold (1957, 489) seems to have caught the joke when he referred to the dialogue as a "little jeu d'esprit," but the Gryllus is more than an entertaining vignette. Concentration upon conventional philo sophical themes like the Golden Age, animal rationality, and sophistry suggests a strong interest in contemporary intellectual activity. Since the dialogue parodies rhetorical performance, it remains to ask whether there are further implications for the social and political setting of such performances, considering especially the emphasis on freedom in its main joke. The Homeric setting need not discourage us from seeking resonances with the contemporary world. In fact, the Gryllus is the only one of Plutarch's surviving works composed exclusively of mythological material. The rest exhibit a range of contemporary interests, public and private, and the Gryllus is perhaps no different. I wish to suggest that the theme of domestication is an allegorical focus for the contemporary world, a means of examining the intellectual ideals of elite society, but also, by extension, of questioning the function of paideia as a response to restricted agency. This claim is more attractive in light of trends in the literary activi ties of Greek writers affected by or made witness to Roman hegemony. As many have shown, practices of literary archaism and linguistic purism were important forms of self-assertion for Greek authors and represented to them a means of reconnecting with the political and cultural achieve ments of days past as compensation for restrictions on political author ity.42 Pursuits of this sort were a way of expressing cultural autonomy; yet they were the products of a specialized education and remained rather exceptional in Greek society overall.43 The Gryllus is Plutarch's way of 42 See Bowie 1970,203-9; Swain 1996,137-50; Whitmarsh 2001,47-56; Desideri 2002, 222-24; for Plutarch in particular, see Vasunia 2003, 375-87. 43 Whereas archaizing writers suppressed aspects of cultural memory that evoked political dependence (e.g., Bowie 1970), cities themselves often advertised their ties with the Romans. Numerous inscriptions honoring Roman officials and patrons, or local citizens for bestowing or procuring privileges from Rome, show the importance for Greeks of</page><page sequence="23">PLUTARCH'S GRYLLUS 369 questioning this aspect of elite intellectual life. As an oblique meditation on educational ideals as a source of authority and empowerment, the Gryllus considers the absurdity of sophistic posturing amidst conditions of dependency. It is a humorous portrait not merely of sophistry, but of extravagant affirmations of liberation. Ultimately, I hope to show that the deep irony in Gryllus' performance is an expression of Plutarch's critical perspective on modes of identification through rhetoric and linguistics adopted within elite culture. As an affirmation of liberation, we find in the Gryllus only the generic objection to human society at large that is familiar from the philo sophical schools. As mentioned, Gryllus' speech is a typical expression of the Golden-Age theme. Whether Cynic, anti-Stoic, anti-Epicurean, or other, such expressions offered a conventional form of response to the political and social inadequacies one perceived in the world. For Pierre Vidal-Naquet (1978, 134), the Golden Age was "a slogan" for the dis satisfied and disaffected of certain philosophical and religious orders. In the Cynic perspective, one might reject civilization and its institutions in the hope of returning to primitive states that offered liberation from the corruption of conventional living??XeuOepia x\ ?tti Kp?vou, following one popular phrase attributed to the Cynic founder, Diogenes of Sinope. The Golden Age was an idealized vision of escape in this respect, offering a kind of nostalgic diversion for the socially and politically disaffected.44 Gryllus' speech, delivered on behalf of any of the animals reluctant to return with Odysseus, gives expression to this philosophical trend. His firm refusal to return to human form (985e) and admiration for the fertility and purity of the Cyclopes' island (986f) imply just such an aversion to human society. Of course Gryllus' position is foolish, given his place as bewitched captive. He is an absurd portrait of philosophical abstraction and detachment. Plutarch's use of the pig in this way follows longstanding pref erences in philosophical discourse for using depictions of animals to support critical examinations of human lifestyle and society. These go reflecting upon relationships with Rome in expressions of collective identity; e.g., Robert and Robert 1989; Reynolds 1982, docs. 2, 3, 6-8; and Jones 2001. ^Hercher 1965,32, cited by Vidal-Naquet 1978,135. For testimonia and discussion of Cynic primitivism and rejection of society, see Sorabji 1993,158-61; cf. Gera 2003,60, with n. 138. The feat of transcending political and social crises was an ordinary focus for many philosophical sects. Stoicism: Shaw 1985; Roller 2001. Orphic and Pythagorean thinkers: D?tienne 1972. Philostratus' Life of Apollonius of Tyana typifies such conflict perceived between philosophy and Roman authority; see Eisner 1997.</page><page sequence="24">370 LUCAS HERCHENROEDER back to Plato's Republic perhaps, where the "city of pigs" illustrates the priority of moral development to bodily comfort (369a-72d). For later writers, animals with superior intelligence and the ability to speak served as satiric foils for deficiencies in human behavior.45 The philosophizing rooster of Lucian's Gallus, for example, often compared with Plutarch's Gryllus, claims to be Pythagoras reincarnate, come back to instruct a cob bler on the moral advantages of poverty.46 Elsewhere, scientific writers, such as Galen and Aelian, reflected upon animal rationality, apparently as participants in a debate over its precise degree of difference from human intelligence, as well as over definitions of speech as an index of reason and moral status. For these writers, contemplation of animal intel ligence was a way of working out philosophical questions.47 The Gryllus would neatly fit this set were it not for the absurdity of its protagonist's claims of freedom. For Plutarch, the issue is actually the philosophical topos itself. Gryllus does not overcome his swinishness, and Plutarch is having a laugh at familiar preferences for the beast as a mouthpiece for moralizing sentiments. In another work Plutarch openly condemns this convention, criticizing Herodotus for expressing his own sentiments through Scythians, Persians, or Egyptians, as Aesop does with animals (De malign. 87Id). The Gryllus is a sustained formulation of the same criticism, a dismissal of stock expressions of Golden-Age isolationism as intellectual brutishness, so to speak. Anthropomorphic representations of animals were also important for thinking about a range of social and political issues. Autocratic author ity is a common topic for the Aesopic fables of Phaedrus, for example (see Henderson 2001, esp. chap. 8).To these one may add the well-known boy-become-donkey stories, exemplified by Apuleius' Golden Ass and the pseudo-Lucianic Ass. In recent work on these stories, scholars have demonstrated the function of animal representation as commentary on human brutality and social organization, and they have especially noted the sensitivity of these works to forms of oppression, such as slavery or even abusive Roman power.48 Clearly, a niche had developed by Plutarch's 45Anderson 1993, 185-88. See also Romm 1992, 76-77: the legendary Anacharsis served a similar function in literary reflections on Greek society and lifestyle; e.g., Lucian, Anacharsis; Plutarch, Dinner of the Seven Sages with Schmidt 1999, 66,150-54. 46 Dio Chrysostom adopts a similar viewpoint, taking the position that animals' libera tion from materiality allowed them greater contentment (Or. 6.13-34,10.16). 47For testimonia and discussion, see Sorabji 1993, esp. 80-86. 48 Greek and Latin Ass-stories: Mason 1994; human brutality in Apuleius: Shumate 1996,105-28; slavery: Bradley 2000; Roman authority: Hall 1995; Finkelpearl 2007.</page><page sequence="25">PLUTARCH'S GRYLLUS 371 time for thinking about human society and adjoining political questions through animal figures. The Gryllus belongs here too, for despite its focus upon human lifestyle from a moral-philosophical perspective, there appears to be a strong social and political orientation that was typical of contemporary fables and stories. The Gryllus derives this social and political orientation from its engagement with elite education. While on the surface the parodie contest focuses on Odysseus as a traditional epic figure, as a paradigmatic speaker the hero represents the institutions of speech and rhetoric too. Gryllus' reliance upon rhetorical techniques to make such unrealistic assertions is laughable?he is a parody of the pepaideumenos and, ultimately, of the institution oipaideia at large. Given the often politicized status oipaideia as a mechanism of cultural and social identification among elite Greeks, the Gryllus questions its function as such. The dialogue is a parody of paideia as a means of assertion and empowerment. The precise way the dialogue engages paideia is evident in its manipulation of traditional connections between language and ethnog raphy. As a parodie figure, Gryllus is marked by his physical appearance. He is less than human; his name and animal form signify disfigurement. Gryllus is taxonomically closer to barbarian than learned Greek in this sense. The pattern gels partly with schematic representations of marginal groups from ethnographic literature, which associate cultural or moral inferiority with bodily irregularity or even beastliness (e.g., Romm 1992, chap. 2). Gryllus' pretensions as a learned speaker are laughable because they invert this pattern. Like Lucian's philosopher-cock or the animals of Aesopic fables, the lowly pig makes a laughable watchdog for human folly. Yet as "the Grunter," Gryllus is an artless and inarticulate speaker, reinforcing associations between beastliness or primitive isolation and linguistic deficiency. Of course Gryllus speaks, but he cannot speak authoritatively: he cannot maintain control of his argument, given its inconsistency with reality. He is a variation on the traditional barbaros in this respect. Plutarch has adapted the familiar function of language as a cultural and moral signifier to expand his parodie persona. The point has greater significance in the context of the first two centuries CE. in which such heavy emphasis came to be placed upon language as a source of legitimacy. Here it is helpful to remember that traditional conceptualizations of Greek and barbarian were remote even for Plutarch and must have changed with time. After all, the basic determinant of the Greek-barbarian antithesis, language, was a medium of limited fixity. Given both its con tinuous evolution as a living system of communicative practices and the</page><page sequence="26">372 LUCAS HERCHENROEDER multilingual context of the Roman empire, language was a criterion of differentiation in ever more novel ways.49 Categories of Greek and barbar ian soon become outmoded in their traditional forms. By Plutarch's time, language ceased merely to separate Greek from non-Greek. Standards of linguistic purity, and especially Atticizing oral and written expression among many literary Greeks, allowed distinction among all Greek speak ers by signifying educational and social advantage. As a result, claiming privileged forms of Greek identity meant meeting certain standards of education in elite circles. Greek-ness was performance-based in this respect and ever more dependent upon collective notions of membership (Whitmarsh 2001,22-24, 90-129). Language is a crucial issue in the Gryllus. For one, Gryllus is him self an Atticizing speaker. A cursory look at the language of his speech shows repeated use of Attic forms.50 The dialogue spoofs indulgent lin guistic purism as much as detachment in sophistic technique.51 In using the talking beast as a parodie figure, Plutarch assimilates the lofty and learned speech of the pepaideumenoi to the animal's voice. He thereby condemns the pedantic habits of the elite, showing an old preference for language as a basis for exclusion and denigration. In representing 49 As is well known, Greek pronunciation, grammar, and syntax had all undergone considerable change after the classical period, perhaps coming far along in the process of transition to Koine; see Gignac 1970; Swain 1996, 30-31; Horrocks 1997, 79-86. Certain among the educated soon restored and canonized a pure Greek language on the model of the Attic dialect, thereby creating a basis for construing social and political status from distinction in literary composition and public speaking. As the Greek of the literary elite became increasingly more distinct from ordinary speech, Atticism emerged as a badge of intellectual and social prestige, supplementing other forms of exclusion from elite society; Swain 1996,17-43; Schmitz 1997,133-35, 232-34. 50 Examples are Gryllus' use of the optative mood (987f), the deictic iota (992c), and abstract nomin?is with the neuter definite article (986c, 987c), as well as his almost exclusive preferences for -tt- over -oo- (20 or 21 instances, depending upon manuscript reading) and -pp- for -pa- (13 instances) in appropriate words; on Atticism, see Horrocks 1997. Interest ingly, Gryllus does use the non-Attic spellings occasionally: Oapao? (988c), ?aXaaan? (989c, 990d), veoaao?c; (992c). In all but one case, these words occur closely with Attic variants of the same spelling: 0apaoc follows ?appo?vtec and GappaX?o? by nine and two lines, respec tively; GaX?aanc; precedes Ttepirribc; by one line (989c only); and veoaao?c follows veorro?c by five lines. A possible explanation is that Plutarch intended the inconsistency in Gryllus' use of Attic forms to call attention to the artificiality of such practices in general, making it yet another mark of the pig's affectations as a learned speaker. 51 Elsewhere, excessive use of Attic forms is the target of open criticism from Plutarch. He finds that the pursuit of linguistic ornamentation in the popular Attic style distracts from the goal of producing speeches of philosophical substance, leaving the schools full of so much pedantic display (terthreia) and chattering banter (st?mylia), he says (De aud. 42d-e).</page><page sequence="27">PLUTARCH'S GRYLLUS 373 the sophist as an animal, Plutarch parodies elite claims to authority that lack real substance. He casts the sophist in the likeness of the inarticulate or speechless animal, the alogon, to use the appropriate Greek word, a paradox that is greatest in the dual sense of logos as both the faculty of speech and rational organization in thought and expression.52 The sug gestive absurdity of the Gryllus, then, is as much that the philosophical charlatan possess logos as that the animal does. The clearest image of this is the pig speaking fluent Greek?proper Attic Greek, no less?to assert his freedom, yet remaining a captive. This is the real spectacle, for Gryllus remains a beast. His preference for sophistic figures and the vestments of educational prestige fail to liberate him. The attempts at philosophical enquiry, the generic tags of freedom and intimacy with nature?all are affectations. Gryllus' failure to free animals from domestication, even rhetorically, calls into question the value of all this posturing. In adapting chauvinistic sentiments surrounding language in the Greek tradition, the Gryllus offers a special form of social critique. For Plutarch, language-based conceptualizations of the beast, primitivism, or barbarism provide a means of criticizing the superficialities in the intellec tual tradition?impressionistic notions of liberation, in this case?and the vanity of moralizing and dogmatic conclusions in philosophical debate. In this sense, the Gryllus is a sort of challenge from Plutarch to the least rig orous of the learned; primitivism and barbarism become tags for those of the pepaideumenoi whose membership is a messy charade. As the mascot for this group, if you will, the pig remains a figure of proverbial stupidity, "Boeotian swine," as the derisive saying goes, but he is also the familiar outsider speaking in inarticulate sounds.53 Notably the pig preserves in his name a very basic mechanism of cultural or ethnic identification in the Greek tradition: gry(l)los, like barbaros, is a mere onomatopoetic label, a mark of exclusion on the basis of speech. The persona projected by Gryllus is simply the pepaideumenos in grotesque, whose speech is 52Interestingly, while potentially inauthentic (see n. 5 above), the dialogue's Greek title, Ilepi To? Ta ?Xoya X?ycu xprjcrOai, neatly captures this paradox. 53This was surely familiar to Plutarch and it is difficult not to see this detail as a delib erate choice by him, aimed at bringing local audiences closer to the action of the dialogue. On the long tradition of the pig as a term of abuse for Boeotians (probably of Athenian origin), see Roller 1990. Despite Helmbold's understanding of the dialogue's humorous side, he misses this connection entirely, suggesting instead that Plutarch was unaware of, or chose not to indulge in this old joke (1957, 490, n. a). Pigs occupied an important place in post-classical imagination in this respect; see Stallybrass and White 1986,44-49.</page><page sequence="28">374 LUCAS HERCHENROEDER so much noisome grunting.54 Misshapen and coarse, Gryllus' sophistry is a brutalization of educational refinement, a ridiculous caricature of detachment and rhetorical abstraction. A final note: if the Gryllus criticizes idealistic expressions of self determination, it warns implicitly against intellectual detachment as a potential result, since such notions are never a substitute for actual freedom. In this respect, the Homeric setting of the dialogue, imagined as it is in myth, is especially appropriate, for the Romans must remain absent. This environment is as distant and removed from contemporary affairs as are antique literary forms and philosophizing rhetoric. So if the connection to Plutarch's contemporary world is strained, that is precisely the point. Limiting one's engagement with society through a preference for abstraction and dogmatic figures or for archaizing rhetorical practices can become an escapist fantasy. We should remember, after all, that the dramatic conflict of the Gryllus originates in the pig's reluctance to return home to the Greeks, and perhaps this is the Homeric resonance Plutarch means to exploit most: Circe's magic induces forgetfulness of one's homeland. Such is the potential detachment of the pepaideumenoi, as Plutarch appears to imagine it. It is an important implication of the Gryllus, then, that as the recipients of certain vestments of elite culture, the learned risk alienation?that is, at some point of extravagance paideia becomes merely an introspective fantasy.55 University of Southern California at Los Angeles e-mail: herchenr@usc.edu BIBLIOGRAPHY Anderson, Graham. 1993.
