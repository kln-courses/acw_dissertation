Driberg Supplement to the "Journal of the Royal African Society,' January I936 Vol. XXXV, No. CXXXVIII 8 AA 35</page><page sequence="2">3 THE SECULAR ASPECT OF ANCESTOR- WORSHIP IN AFRICA J. H. DRIBERG WE have unconsciously done the Africans both less and more than justice-less, because by our assumptions concern- ing his religious philosophy we have contrived to make him so illogical as, despite his views on reincarnation, to invest his ancestors with those attributes of divinity reserved by us for gods; and more, because we have attributed to him the virtue of a religious sensitivity greater even than he really has. It is true that the African is extremely and practically religious, but it is truer still that he is supremely and practically social. And what we have often mistaken for a religious attitude is nothing more than a projection of his social be- haviour. It is this attitude, particularly in relation to his ancestors, which requires our consideration if we are even remotely to understand the African point of view, and it is specifically this attitude which I propose to examine now. I shall have to be more precise in my attempt at unravelling the tangle than the African would naturally be, as he accepts generally what I shall have to demonstrate in its particulars: but I am prepared to submit that ample evidence is available in African cultures in support of my interpretation of the system which we call ancestor-worship. Disregarding for the moment minor classifications and tribal variations in points of detail, I have no hesitation in affirming that the religious beliefs and philosophy of the African are fixed primarily on the concept of a universal Power or Energy, which informs and is the cause of all life, and secondarily on a number of deifications which, as we shall see, develop in two separate and distinct ways. The universal Power, to which I refer, is a concept world-wide in its occur- rence, and appears under a number of names both in Africa and elsewhere, the best known of which (as it has received most literary expression) is mana. This spiritual force consists</page><page sequence="3">4 of an abstract Power or nattral potency, formless as tie ether, all-pervasive anll (definitely never regarded anthropo- morpliically. It lias been likened in its manifestations to electricity (thollgh perhlaps radilum would provide a better analogy), and like electricity it can be partially harnessed to the service of man by processes whichl we may rightly call religiolls. Being far more antllropomorphic in our religious ideas than tlhe African, we have singularly failed to appreciate this concept and time after time the tribal term used to designate it has been translated " God," and that " God " in contrast with lesser deifications and with ancestors has been arrogated to the position of a " High God," a supreme Creator and organiser of the world, comparable to the Hebraic or Christian conception. As from that point of view and interpreted in that way this Power-principle is apparently functionless, because ours is not the way in which Africans expect it to work, it has frequently been labelled otiose. It would be as reasonable to complain that the Derby is otiose because there is no cricket on Epsom downs,.or the Academy because there is no art. In point of fact the " High God" idea does not exist in Africa: the African has his abstract Power-concept, and it most certainly is not otiose. We shall have occasion to note a few of its relations to human activities as we proceed, but having stated my position without, I trust, any equivoca- tion I must leave this concept-I repeat, a belief in an abstract spiritual Power-in order to pass on to the subject-matter of my paper. Let us pause for a moment over the deifications to which I have referred. In them we find that religious expression of the African which is secondary only to the intensity of their belief in the Power-concept. The subject calls for detailed analysis and exegesis, but as "ancestor-worship" and not African religion is under discussion I am only concerned at present to clear the ground and shall confine myself to an explanation as dogmatic, I fear, as it is necessarily brief. I may be allowed to add, perlhaps, that I am prepared to sustain</page><page sequence="4">5 my interpretation on tlh evidence both of mythology andl of cultural facts. 'I'lc deifications are of two kinds. 'The first is concerned witli natural phenomena andl tIiose cnvironllenltal features wllicli are of principal importance to tlhe cc(lonlnic life of the community. Thus we may find a river, tlie sun, the rain, earthquakes, a pestilence, sacralise(d (a b)etter word in this context than deified). But tllougli these pllcnomelna may be regarded in the nature of divinities-tlle selection naturally varying with individual cultures-the regard is not really comparable to our traditional attitude towards gods. Reverence there may be, as for something profoulndly im- portant, significant or even mysterious, but it is not reverence for an anthropomorphic concept. The river is still a river to be utilised: the sun and rain are still sun and rain. They are of religious importance only because they enshrine those manifestations of the Power-principle which are most signifi- cant to the community. Power is most profoundly immanent in them and therefore they are worshipped and offered sacri- fice; not because they are themselves divinity, but because of the divine essence which informs them. This class of deifications, therefore, consists rather of identifications or manifestations of Power, one in all its many aspects, than of locally individualised gods. Nevertheless gods, in the stricter sense of our terminology, do exist, but only as a by-product of the ancestral system. The process by which these rare transmutations take place will be explained more fully later, and it is sufficient for our immediate purpose to note that there are ancestors who have become anthropomorphic gods, who co-exist with the deifica- tions of natural phenomena and who by a confused mental process may sometimes, as with Musisi of the Baganda, an ancestor now identified with earthquakes, be transferred from the human to the non-human sphere and thus carry an illusion of anthropomorphism into the more spiritual atmosphere of natural phenomena. It should be observed, however, that while in a sense these gods have personal functions they also in part owe their validity to their inspiration by the Power- A2</page><page sequence="5">6 principle, and that prayers are as often as not addressed to them, not in propria persona, but as intermediaries between man and the absolute Power-a function of intercession which brings them more into line with the saints of Christian hagi- ology rather than with pantheistically independent deities. Having considered what, in my view, constitutes the bare bones of African religion, we are now in a position to approach his ancestral system with unprejudiced minds. We cannot do so, however, so long as we persist in using a terminology of religious values and applying it to what I hope to shew is in fact a purely secular attitude. " Worship," " sacrifice," " offerings," " prayer," " shrine," and even, though to a slightly different degree, "soul" are all words with a specialised significance in English and their application to the ancestral system of the Africans is both a linguistic and a cultural offence. It may be difficult, or even impossible, to find adequate substitutes which will convey the real meaning of the words used by Africans in this context, but at least we may enter a caveat against the careless abuse of vocabulary to which we are unconsciously prone. For no African "prays " to his dead grandfather any more than he "prays " to his living father. In both cases the words employed are the same: he asks as of right, or he beseeches, or he expostulates with, or he reprimands, or (as the Eastern Ewe word epode puts it) he gives an ad( ss to, his ancestors, as he would to the elders sitting in conclave: but he never uses in this context the words for "prayer " and "worship" which are strictly reserved for his religious dealings with the Absolute Power and the divinities. The Latin word pietas probably best describes the attitude of Africans to their dead ancestors, as to their living elders.' What we with so little justification call a " shrine " is not a place of sanctity to the Africans, except in the case of those few ancestors who are transmuted into divinities, in which case a specific term of reference is always applied. Otherwise 1 We may see that there is really no distinction between the living elder and the dead ancestor from the impartial use by the ovaHerero, for example, of the term mukuru for them both.</page><page sequence="6">7 the everyday word is used for whatever the so-called " shrine " consists: the word for " house," if it is a miniature hut built to hold the deceased's personality, for a " log " if the object selected was the log on which the dead man habitually sat in the village compound, or for a " tree " if it was the tree under whose shade he preferred to rest during the heat of the day, and so forth. The idea behind the whole business is nothing sacred, but a social recognition of the fact that the dead man has acquired a new status and that, though physically he is separated from the rest of his community, he is still one with it, participating in its councils and sharing in all its successes or misfortunes: though he has moved on, his personality still remains and is most accessible at those spots which in his life he chiefly affected or in a house especially constructed for its reception. Our erroneous attribution of sanctity to these places-and how erroneous it is may be readily inferred from the obviously secular behaviour of Africans in or con- cerning them-was doubtless assisted by our misinterpretation of the gifts or presentations made to the dead at them, which we conceived to be in the nature of religious sacrifices. What they really are we shall shortly see, but they definitely are not sacrifices. There is a general consensus of evidence, moreover, so general that there can be no possibility of mistake, that these alleged " shrines " are tended for a couple of generations at the most, after which they are allowed to fall into disrepair and are completely neglected. I offer no comment on this for the moment beyond drawing attention to a practice which will be found to be highly significant and suggestive. The word " soul" presents another kind of difficulty. It has been loosely used of a number of different concepts, to none of which is it completely applicable. The difficulty is enhanced by the fact that in Africa every individual has at least two, and often many more, " souls," each of them facets of the one concept conveyed by our word plus some element which we are accustomed to differentiate. Each of these " souls " has a separate function, though where they do not all co-exist their functions do not necessarily lapse but are</page><page sequence="7">8 met in combination. Native t erminology is specific aend to the point in referring to tlhe different " souls," but we have confused the issues by combining then all in an inclusive phraseology, speaking of " soul," " dream-soul," "shadow- soul," " external-soul," " bush-soul," and so forth. I shall use "soul" only of the vital principle which, according to African belief, permeates both animates and inanimates. It is a derivative or emanation from the absolute Power, a spark of which enters the woman's body at coition and, giving life to the embryo, continues to provide the motive force to the newly-born individual. It is necessary to recollect that the absolute Power, as conceived by the African, is limitless as well as formless. Like radium it gives out energy indefinitely without diminishing its own extent or potency, and each spark is capable no less of infinite sub-division 'without loss of potency. But vague and elusive as the Power may be, we have to reconcile ourselves to certain contradictions which appear to be inevitable in all systems of religious philosophy. That spark of Power which is incorporated in an individual is nevertheless still part of the collectivity of Power: it is an emanation from it, but always an integral part of it: it is apart and yet not divided. This ambiguous character of the vital principle has its importance, but of more immediate importance to us is the contradiction contained in the belief that, although Power is one and indivisible, yet each tribe has its own reservoir of Power, different in character from that of all other tribes, upon which it draws to vitalise its members: each clan within the tribe has its own reservoir within the tribal reservoir, and each family its own within the clan reservoir. It would be absurd to attempt a reconciliation between these contradictory principles, and I only state them now in order that we may appreciate at a later point the group character which on this showing must necessarily adhere to the individual soul. Reserving then the term "soul " for this vital principle which is an emanation from one of the reservoirs of Power, I must briefly allude to those components of the individual</page><page sequence="8">9 whieh have hitherto been given a " soul " name by us. Not all of thein are germane to our inquiry, and I need only refer to what is generally termed the "shadow-soul" and the "dream-soul." The former has a direct bearing on the problem, and its importance may be gauged by the fact that even Africans sometimes confuse it with the soul. It is never identified with the soul, however, but up to a point its associa- tion is so intimate that there is bound to be a certain amount of overlapping. I think that the term which best describes the " shadow-soul" is Personality, and that is the term which I shall continue to use. On an analysis of its activities the " dream-soul" is a concept which most nearly corresponds in our language to the Sub-conscious, and it is not surprising, therefore, seeing how embryonic is our own study of the sub- conscious, that there is some confusion in African minds between these two concepts, and that some tribes, such as the Dinka, do not differentiate in their terminology between Personality and the Sub-conscious. Nevertheless for all practical purposes we are justified in assuming from our evidence that the individual is composed of body, soul, per- sonality and the sub-conscious, and it is the interaction of these, particularly of the first three, which we must study if we wish to arrive at a correct evaluation of the ancestral system. Age is perhaps the most important criterion of classification to be found in African societies. Even where the formal institution of age-grades is absent, society is stratified into a number of sub-divisions dependent on age, each with its appropriate status, obligations and privileges; and where the institution is present, the importance of age is still more deeply emphasised. Each progression in status, which at puberty is accompanied by distinctive physical changes, is introduced by a set of ceremonies and rites of transition, which enable the individual to take up his new status, and in their essential characteristics these rites of transition have a general simi- larity at every change of status. Our sharp distinction between life and death is not a valid one to the African, who</page><page sequence="9">IO sees in death only a change of status involving the body in a mutation far greater than, but comparable to, the mutation at puberty and the lesser mutations of middle and old age. The clan consists of the living and the dead on a complete parity, and the social organisation of the living community continues to operate beyond the grave. The elder who dies and is accorded the appropriate mortuary ceremonies, which are rites of transition granting him admission to his new status, assumes a status senior to the living elders, but all within the framework of a single organisation. When his son dies he is automatically moved up into still another and higher status in order to make room for the younger generation. Having reached a situation which now includes two genera- tions after death, we may pause to consider the implications of this social system and to offer a few observations of more general application. Any analysis of funerary rites will confirm the view that they are primarily rites of transition. The importance of these rites to the African is therefore obvious, as without them the dead man cannot take up his proper status, but they are no more and no less important than any of the other rites of transition. Just as a youth who has not been through the puberty school has no place in his community, so a dead man is without a status so long as his funerary rites have not been correctly performed. One consequence of this is that funerary rites act as a powerful legal sanction, since on the execution of a man sentenced to death for one of the public offences he is not accorded the customary funeral, with the result that not only has the living part of the community protected itself from a repetition of the offence, but the offender is also excommunicated for ever from the life of the tribe, and so the dead share in the immunity of the living. It is important to observe that anti-social elements in the community can be completely eliminated in this way, as the attitude towards death is thus seen to stress the social rather than the religious orientation of the system. It is immaterial whether the community is politically</page><page sequence="10">II organised on monarchical or on democratic principles, as we find this classification by age to be the important feature in every tribe and type of African society. Every status lias its own obligations to the community and the community never rewards the individual unless he discharges his obligations. All benefits are dependent on duty: there is, and there must always be, a constant reciprocity between giving and receiving. A living elder assists the community with his advice and experience, and in return, whenever an animal is killed or a feast is prepared, a specific portion of the animal or of the feast is reserved for him and offered to him ceremonially as a public tribute. But the chain of status is closely interlinked, and the tribute does not stop at the living elder: some of it must be passed on by the representative of the living group to the generation most recently dead, and it, though beyond the grave, will pass on its share to the next senior generation. These are the so-called "sacrifices" that the dead receive: they are identical with and part of the tribute received and transmitted by the living elders, and they are offered to the dead in recognition of their advice to the living (for that inter-communication is possible is not doubted by the African) and of their intercession with the divinities and the absolute Power. This matter of intercession, it may be remarked, does not necessarily imply that the dead have more divinity in them, but it follows the normal rule of precedence, which prescribes that for any religious act the head of the family is the officiating priest of the living, though his prayers or requests reach the Power, not directly, but through the ancestral lines of communication. Anyone familiar with the working of government departments will appreciate the fact that it is a procedure strictly analogous to the minuting and forwarding of correspondence addressed by a junior official to the head of the department. Similarly it is impossible to short-circuit a prayer, which has to have the co-operation of both the living and the dead in order that it may reach its official destination. We have seen that the discharge of obligations and the</page><page sequence="11">12 receiving of benefits are correlatives. This should help us to understand why apparently the dead function in the social scheme only for two generations after death. Beyond that time, and in certain circumstances even earlier than that, they receive no tribute, and the sites associated with their personalities are permitted to fall into disrepair. They become, as the Chagga put it, " the forgotten ones," who are of no further use to the community in their ancestral capacity. Those who build cairns over their dead, like the Didinga, cease to add the stones of filial piety beyond the second generation.1 There can, of course, be no absolute precision, as there must obviously be variations in the rate at which succeeding generations are born, though owing to the preponderating group character of status and promotion in African society there is a smaller degree of variation than there would be with us.2 Marriage and birth are fairly evenly spaced out in accordance with the social practice of the community. I should wish it to be understood, however, that the difficulties of exposition in a language alien to the concept before us demands a degree of precision, which is not entirely warranted. One example of the difficulty will make this clearer, and as it will make the subsequent discussion easier to follow, I interpolate it at this point. The commonest system of family nomenclature is to give a son the name of his grandfather or of one of his grandfather's contemporaries, and we may express this in its simplest form by a diagram (diagram I), the horizontal line dividing the dead from their living descendants. These letters indicate 1 We may note, too, that in many communities, when a village moves its site, an object is taken to the new village from the grave of a recently deceased ancestor, in order to maintain fellowship and continuity with the dead. The object, which may be, as among the Lotuko-speaking Lango of the Sudan, a stone from the circle surrounding the grave, is not accorded other than a social regard at its new home and is in no way venerated. 2 The father and the grandfather (and their generations) are the two important people affecting the status of the individual during life, and it is a symmetrical reproduction of living conditions which, in addition to other considerations, gives the two generations after death their remarkable significance.</page><page sequence="12">I3 individuals in a family line of descent, each name being re- (i) (2) (3) (4) Ai AI Ai Bi BI BI BI A2 A2 A2 A2 A2 B2 B2 B2 B2 A3 (Ai) peated in alternate generations, excluding for the sake of simplicity nominal variations which may be introduced by the substitution of a contemporary's name, but which do not affect the issue. The situation is complicated by the fact that the individual cannot be considered apart from his group of contemporaries; but while this is a complication in so far as it increases the difficulty of explanation, it nevertheless shews us why the variations in the individual duration of life do not matter very much, as ultimately it is upon the whole generation of coevals that the social structure depends. Death is so little a barrier that the members of one group or generation still form a united body, even though some are dead and others are living, and they habitually behave as a single entity, and not till the .final living representative of the generation has died is the generation, as such, promoted to an ancestral status, and not till then do the succeeding generations move up in the scale of living status. (This possibly explains why some African tribes, who are as humane and filial as we are, accelerate the demise of their old men, finding that a few survivors of a virtually past generation are inconvenient for practical purposes.) This, to us, ambiguous situation may be expressed as in diagram 2. Let us assume now that all of A2 generation are dead, and we find the scheme illustrated in diagram 3. BI and A2 are the two generations most recently aggregated to the ancestors, and they continue to participate in the active life and work of the community. What is the reason for the neglect of AI by the living, and why does that group recede into cultural insignificance ? The reason, I suggest, may be found in the principle that all benefits must be reciprocal and imply an</page><page sequence="13">I4 obligation to be fulfilled: in the absense of such an obligation, or where circumstances arise which make its observance impossible, the defaulter has no further claims on society. Ai's father was B, whose soul has been reincarnated in B2- an assumption which I shall shortly discuss-and consequently the AI group has no longer a generation above it to which it can pass on the tributes transmitted from B2 through A2 and BI. It has assumed a new function and looks to the future for its social integration, where formerly it was operative because it derived its social coherence from its past. As one by one the members of the A2 group pass the barrier of death, so members of the AI group suffer their final dissolution. Death robs the individual of his body, but this last transition (often signalised by exhumation and a secondary burial) resolves the link which has hitherto bound soul, personality, and sub-conscious together. The soul returns to that reservoir of Power, of which it was originally an emanation: the joint personality and sub-conscious, now given a new designation passes as a ghost to that Elysium which is implicit or expressed in all African teleologies. There the ghosts of all the tribal dead continue in perpetuity, living in a shadow world which is a simulacrum of this world through which they have passed, accompanied by their ghostly possessions and livestock, in exactly that social status which they occupied at the time of their dissolution. No one, good or bad, peasant or ruler, can fail to reappear in this Elysium which is the ultimate tally of all past members of the tribe. Though in certain areas the belief in reincarnation appears to have faded, notably among the Bantu of South Africa, we may reasonably hold that it was formerly universal, and that the modern tendency toward scepticism is a direct outcome of our influence in the direction of an individualistic economy, with which the old concept of a group-reservoir of souls would be at variance. The persistence of the old method of naming by alternate generations within the family may be taken as evidence of this, and a belief in reincarnation is the logical background to a social theory which links up the ancestors</page><page sequence="14">I5 with the living in so intimate a chain of causality. They are interested in the welfare and prosperity of their living des- cendants, just because they will one day reinherit what they have transmitted. Even where reincarnation is no longer an integral part of the system, however, its absense does not seem to have greatly affected the retention of the ancestors within the social structure of the tribe, and the only difference is that on dissolution the soul reverts, not to a limited reservoir of Power, but to the full stream of the Absolute, while at the same time there is always a heightened emphasis on the shadow-world of Elysium. The idea, moreover, that souls are emanations of the Power-principle in general, and not of a group entity within it, is not a revolutionary concept. Not only is it generally recognised that the original souls would have had no local filiation; but consistent with the theory of reincarnation Africans have always held that not all individuals are reincarnations of ancestors-which from the point of view of their social organisation is of primary importance only in the case of eldest sons, who are the transmitters of both spiritual and material inheritance-but that many derive their souls direct from the great Power as new emanations, which will subsequently be incorporated on their death into the tribal reservoir. The Ewe, for example, whose acceptance of reincarnation is implicit in their saying that "when a person comes again into the world he will always find changes," also provide us with evidence that reincarnation is not the only possibility, in a cynical proverb which affirms that " Were I an incarnated one, I should not have come back to this place." At any rate the possibility of direct inspiration by the Absolute, as contrasted with the theory of a reincarnation of souls, allows for the facts of an increasing population which would be otherwise unintelligible, even if we admit that souls, like radium, are capable of infinite subdivision without losing either content or efficacy. While we are not primarily concerned here with reincarna- tion, yet the nature of the soul must obviously have some reaction on the social organisation in which it plays so impor-</page><page sequence="15">i6 tant a part. To say that it is an emanation of the Power- principle is not enough. The sub-division of Power, which is conceived of as infinite, into group entities is clearly a reflection of the group-character of the tribal institutions, and the theory of soul-inheritance, which is what reincarnation amounts to, together with the possibility of the substitution of a con- temporary's soul, is no more than a translation in terms of metaphysics of the classificatory system common to all African societies. A soul conceived in these terms must predispose the individual towards the subordination of self to the common interests of the group, but this does not account for the fact that even African society with all its basis of collectivism allows for individual self-expression. It is very much the age-long conflict between determination and free-will. The solution which I offer of this particular problem is not so susceptible of proof as what has gone before, but I tentatively suggest that, despite its group character as being part of a common stock, the reincarnated soul always carries with it certain individual traits which it has acquired by intimate contact with the personalities of its earlier possessors. It is generally held by Africans that physical characteristics are transmitted from generation to generation by natural biological processes, but I have no knowledge that psychical or mental characteristics are so regarded. These are commonly referred to the soul of the ancestor who happens to be reincarnated, and if, as I premise, the soul is distinct from the personality, then we have to look to their theory of contagion for an explanation. It is hardly necessary to dilate on this, as it is an axiom of anthropology, which is well illustrated by the principles of sympathetic magic, that the personality of an individual indelibly affects every part and possession of that individual, so that the soul, a unit in the group entity though it be, must necessarily also come under its influence. This may be too much of a rationalisation, but I cannot help thinking that it is along some such lines as these that an African philosopher would explain the inheritance of psychical traits and would account for the persistence of individual</page><page sequence="16">I7 personality despite subordination to a group, which the inheritance of a group-soul implies. I have based the foregoing remarks on a system of rein- carnation which closes the cycle every fifth generation, as shewn in diagram 4 where AI is reincarnated in A3. I have done so because this is the commonest system in Africa, particularly in patrilineal societies, and the fact that in the greater number of tribes a man's grandparents and grand- children are referred to by a single kinship term clearly implies a social recognition of this spiritual phenomenon. Neverthe- less we have sufficient direct evidence to prove that there is a second system which admits of reincarnation into alternate generations, and this is corroborated by the fact that the most widely established usage makes family names recur in alternate generations. True, such a system makes the name recur in the fifth generation as well, but that could have been achieved without making the name alternate, which suggests that repetition in the third generation has more than a fortuitous significance. The prevalence of this system therefore indicates that reincarnation in the third generation, as a theory of life, preceded reincarnation in the fifth, and in fact we know that in many tribes, though they are few as compared with those who accept reincarnation in the fifth generation, reincarnation in alternate generations is the accepted belief. While this is true of a few patrilineal societies, it is pre-eminently true where matrilineal institutions are in force, and I venture to suggest that the two systems of reincarnation are directly correlated with two types of matrilineal marriage. (Those who assume the priority of matrilineal over patrilineal in- stitutions may find in this an argument in support of their thesis, but such a consideration is not relevant to the present issue.) Rattray has shewn conclusively, I think, wherein the real importance of cross-cousin marriage lies. It ensures the complete spiritual reincarnation of the clan soul, which the previous marriage had partially taken from the clan, within a member of the group. The enjoined marriage of the father's 9 AA 35</page><page sequence="17">i8 sister's daughter alone makes this possible in the third genera- tion. Put in its simplest form, this may be expressed in the following diagram, the relevant matrilineal clans being repre- sented by their animal totems: Elephant Zebra Giraffe I I I I I I I I (Sociologically, elephant: (Sociologically, zebra; biologically, half elephant, biologically, half giraffe, half zebra.) half zebra.) (Sociologically, zebra; biologically, + i= I zebra.) I am not sure that we find in Africa the five-clan system opera- ting with all the precision that we find it among the Kachins of Burma, but the evidence assuredly suggests that there was a time when it did, and it would be a natural development from the three-clan system in any growing community. Under such a system, whether precisely followed or not, the enjoined marriage of the mother's brother's daughter results in the re- incarnation of a complete clan soul in the fifth generation, and justifies that system in the same way as the other form of cross- cousin marriage is justified by the Ashanti. Thus we find once more that the spiritual beliefs of Africans are reflexes of, and bound up with, the general social organisation of the community. Only two points remain for consideration. The first of these concerns the deifications to which I have already referred. Certain men have always achieved a distinction during life which gives them more than a local prestige. They may be leaders in war, innovators or inventors, successful rainmakers, people who by their exceptional genius or by their ability to make the most of a providential opportunity have made themselves indispensable to the community at large. During</page><page sequence="18">I9 their life such people are consulted by others than their clan fellows, as the inventor of a new activity, whether material or psychical, is always appealed to for help in making that new activity a success. His reputation widens with his years; and after his death, during the two generations of active ancestorhood, he is still approached for advice, not only by his own clan, but through the clan or family head by the whole tribe, and he is in a good way to becoming a culture hero. It becomes at once clear that this individual is now of tribal, and not merely of clan, importance. The whole com- munity depends on him for the successful maintenance of whatever activity it was that he started, and obviously, if he were reincarnated, the tribe would lose the inspiration which they found in him. He cannot therefore be reincarnated, as he has acquired a tribal character. He is therefore by his function in the community set apart from the main line of family reincarnation, and after the second generation remains isolated as a culture-hero, often served by a priesthood which starting as a family cult widens into a religious organisation comprehending the whole tribe.1 A mythology gathers round I.

The dotted lines indicate the course of petitions during Okulo's lifetime and after his death. All petitions from outsiders (A, B, C) are addre-sed through the living head of his family. For two generations he is an ancestor but as A, B, C, etc., are now interested in him as much as his own family, his reincarnation would rob the wider community of what has by now become a cultural necessity. As a culture hero he is removed from the succession and sacralised in a position outside, admitting direct petitions from the whole tribe through the priesthood which, starting as a family cult, eventually becomes associated with him. him, and he gradually collects the attributes of a divinity, approaching nearer to our concept of a god than anything else that we find in Africa. But it should be clearly under- stood that he is a god precisely because he can no longer be an ancestor, and these occasional deifications by emphasising a new social function also serve to remind us that the normal attitude towards ancestors is strictly social rather than religious.1 We may conclude with the observation that, though every human being (like all other animates and inanimates) continues after death to lead a shadow-existence in the eternal Elysium, not all human beings can become ancestors in the technical sense. Neither those who died prematurely, nor those who have been outlawed or executed by the community, can be reincarnated as distinct personalities. Wizards and other malefactors who are executed receive especial treatment after death in order to excommunicate them from the ancestral part of the community as well. They do not receive the usual rites of burial, and as these are rites of transition they are not therefore qualified to take up the status of ancestor beyond the grave. A child has no personality and, should it die at a tender age, its soul still endowed with the personality 1 It stands to reason that these " gods " are necessarily associated with societies which are on the high road to political centralisation, and their emergence often serves to unify those societies which were heretofore but loosely linked together.</page><page sequence="20">21 of its ancestor would be immediately available for rebirth.' In the same way no adult who dies before the appropriate age could cross the threshold of an ancestol, as he would not be qualified by his living status to associate with the generation of his elders beyond the grave. Their shadow-souls proceed to Elysium, but the vital souls of all these unqualified or disqualified individuals pass back to the clan reservoir to await another opportunity of reincarnation, emphasising once more the fact that social organisation and status and not religious conviction determine the character of the regard paid to ancestors.2 1 In many cases, indeed, though not universally, it is assumed that the same soul is incarnate in the next child, and much the same idea prevails even in the case of an adult who dies prematurely. Thus among the Lango, who follow the alternate system of naming, a posthumous son receives the name, not of his grandfather, but of his father. His father, having died prematurely before his son's birth, was not yet eligible for a higher status and is obviously to them reincarnated in his offspring in order to enable him to fulfil the quota of years and to reach ancestral status. 2 Since elaborating these views on African beliefs regarding ancestors, I find that a similar point of view has been independently formulated by the Rev. T. Cullen Young in " The Communal Bond in Bantu Africa " (The International Review of Missions, January 1933), and in " Ancestor Worship or Ancestor Partnership " (The Church Overseas, July I933).</page></plain_text>
