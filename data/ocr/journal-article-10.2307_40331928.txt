<plain_text><page sequence="1">Inscribed Landscapes: Marking and Making Place Edited by Bruno David and Mered- ith Wilson. Hawai'i: University of Hawai'i Press. 2002. Pp. viii + 303. Price: US$55 (cloth). This volume of wide ranging studies represents the successful diffusion of a core set of concepts regard- ing places and landscape as categories of social anthropological and archaeological analysis over the last decade or so. These concepts are centered on experience, through which, in the words of Wilson and David in their Introduction 'social and personal expressions of place marking signal a cultural pres- ence and give the land social significance' (p.l). The contributing authors are all interested in the processes of inscription whereby places are marked, processes that depend on human engagement with the land- scape (p.3). They tend to deal with landscape as this engagement of people with place, and 'in this sense landscapes are meaningfully, socially constructed places involving bodily and cognitive experience' (p.6). In addition, 'people, places, and things are con- stantly engaged in a process of inscribing place' (p.8). This book is one of a number that have been recently released that are exploring the lived notion of 'landscape' e.g., Stewart and Strathern Landscape, Memory and History: Anthropological Perspectives, London and Sterling VA: Pluto Press, 2003. Of the eighteen chapters in Inscribed Landscape that follow the editors' Introduction, five deal with rock-art, with a major focus on Aboriginal Australia (Part One); five discuss monuments, including prehistoric or his- toric monuments from England, France, Malta, the Aztec area, and the American South- West (Part Two); while Part Three is an exploratory collection of stud- ies on historical and contemporary forms of inscrip- tion expressed in various ways: how Italian migrants in Australia anchor their subjectivities by building 152</page><page sequence="2">Reviews homes (Pulvirenti); political conflicts over Federation Square in Melbourne, Australia (Carter); the phenom- enon of Cultural Villages that represent national iden- tity in South-East Asia and the Pacific, with a case study from Sarawak (Yea); and the work of inscribing places in Foi songs from Lake Kutubu, Papua New Guinea (Weiner). One theme that runs through the volume is inscription as a form of resistance against power, or alternatively inscriptions made by the powerful them- selves. Ballard examines performances of violence by Indonesian authorities at the Freeport Mine in Irian Jaya (West Papua), using photographs of insignia of the Indonesian military painted on a boulder and rep- resentations of Indonesian Independence Day on gateways. His topic is the resistance of the local Amungme people to such symbols, rooted in their insistence on a primordial link between themselves and their landscape (p. 23). A parallel theme runs through the Australian rock-art studies, as David and Wilson point out in their chapter on Wardaman coun- try in Northern Australia. They strikingly show how 'preexisting conventions of polychrome painting, striping, anthropomorphism, and juxtapositioning of specific motifs were combined to produce complex images of gigantic proportions' (p.49) as a way of visually dominating the landscape and reasserting its relationship to the people through the Dreaming. McNiven and Russell's chapter (pp.27-41) makes the same point. Aboriginals of the Central Highlands of Queensland 'elaborated their burial crypts to create highly visual, spiritually charged markers on the landscape to reinforce their control of the land in the eyes of the European invaders' (p.35). The pervasive idea of the Dreamtime unites the various Australian Aboriginal studies. Langton's chapter (pp.25 3-269) gives an eloquent exposition of this theme. The basic point, perhaps, is that the idea of the Dreaming is not simply 'metaphysical' but consists of notions of sub- stance, since the substance of the ancestors survives in places and is communicated to and absorbed by their descendants. 'Deceased ancestors are conceived of as spiritual presences in particular places express- ing a resonating "spiritual" trace of the once-living persons' (p. 266). Significant parallels with New Guinea on this point can be found in Stewart and Strathern Remaking the World: Myth, Mining and Rit- ual Change among the Duna of Papua New Guinea, Washington D.C. and London: Smithsonian Institu- tion Press, 2002. Langton also discusses the multiple sensory bases on which memory is constructed, included performative acts of 'singing out' to the ancestors in a particular country, and the use of the bodily smell of the Elders as markers of identification for the spirits. This perspective facilitates interpreta- tions of magical practices, such as the magic for catching fish (p.263). 'Singing out' here as a theme itself resonates with Weiner's illustrations of how place-names form a framework in Foi songs of sad- ness, with their stress on the contrast between fluid movements and its arrest. And the idea of multiple sensory inputs fits with Paul Rainbird's chapter (pp.93- 103) on the putative sounds made in the envi- ronment by rock artists in the production of petro- glyphs such as the famous 'cup marks' he instances from Yorkshire (also found in Scotland). Cupules also appear in the petroglyphs of Hawai'i discussed by Lee (e.g. p.85). Lee notes a parallel with Aus- tralia: petroglyphs were often, it seems, carved as means of gaining spiritual power in places seen as special (p.81). An aim of achieving or communicat- ing with power, seen as a part of 'religion', links many of the studies together (e.g., Darnell's chapter on Egyptian roads notes the religious significance of many sites, pp. 11 2- 114). Rosenfeld and Ta√ßon also touch on this theme, as does Scarre (e.g., pp.72, 130, 166). Yea's chapter analyses a phenomenon found widely: the contemporary shaping of ideas of heritage by governments as a part of the promotion of tourism. The Sarawak Cultural Village presents a romanticized tableau of cultures and customs puta- tively making up the Sarawak nation. Yea points out that while the Ministry of Culture and Tourism appears to encourage cultural diversity at the 'folk' level, these same 'folk', such as the Iban, are con- stantly being pressed to change their ways and embrace 'development' while their ancestral forests are logged by commercial companies (p.247). No simple inscriptions here: instead, there is conflict, contradiction, and opposition between globalizing forces and local senses of identity that emerges stark- ly out of the Iban landscape. Space does not allow us to discuss all of these chapters in detail. Suffice it to say that this volume contains much of interest and insight and falls into line well with other contemporary works on place, landscape, and identity. Andrew Strathern and Pamela J.
