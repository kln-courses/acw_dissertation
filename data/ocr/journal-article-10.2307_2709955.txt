<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Polytheism of William James Amos Funkenstein The Problem Except for William James (and perhaps Nietzsche), no other modem Westem philosopher that I know of dared to defend a patently polytheistic creed; and needless to say, no such defense would be conceivable within the medieval horizon either. The dismissal of polytheism from serious philosophical negotia- tion was not confined to the monotheistic traditions: the secular anthropologies of the nineteenth century, while perhaps abstaining from calling polytheism a downright error or depravity of the human mind, still saw it as a lower stage in the progress of religious expression.' James, then, was certainly aware of the danger of sounding strange if not ridiculous; and so I am inclined to take him by his word for the same reason for which I tend to trust the self-attribution of those authors ofthe eighteenth century who, for the first time, called themselves atheists.2 But even to those who are inclined to think that James may have spoken tongue in cheek, his position still deserves more attention than the almost utter silence with which it was greeted in his time and in ours. I wish to thank my friend and colleague Hanina Ben-Menachem, David Hartman (in whose institute the paper was first read and discussed), Hannah Ginsborg, and Daniel Warren (UC Berkeley), and the readers of the article for this Joumal for very useful comments.

To his contrast between Hume and Voltaire one may add that the latter stands in a long tradition of Christian and Jewish thinkers who likewise assumed, after an original monotheism, a process of degeneration; cf. my Theology and the Scientific Imagination from the Middle Ages to the Seventeenth Century (Princeton, 1986), 234-36. 2 Even of the seventeenth century, it was still true that atheism was a term reserved for others with offensive opinions: "Car c'est la mauvaise coustume des ignorants d'appeler Athees tous ceux qui ne se vendent pas a tous prejuges, et quand on aime la veritable liberte, on n'est pas republiquain pour cela...."

Second, I want to compare it to seemingly kindred voices in the history of modem thought (Montaigne, Hume) in order to highlight its uniqueness. Third, I shall compare it to the classical Epicurean challenge against the then dominant philosophical trend towards the monotheization and de-anthropomorphization ofthe religious imagery. Finally, armed with these comparisons, I hope to clarify the structure and motives of James's theory (if a theory it is). Polytheism and Pluralism In The Varieties of Religious Experience the polytheistic option is first mentioned within a discussion over the nature of evil. While the "healthy minded view" tends to minimize evil, the "sick soul" will see in it "an essential part of our being and the key to the interpretation of our life."3 James's subsequent remarks may be better understood if we assume that, while he may have sympathized more with the healthy mind, his temper was closer to the other. Anyway, he continues and says that the view of evil as an essence is incompatible with theism, which "has shown reluctance to let God be anything less than All-in-All." As against this strict, or dogmatic, theism stands "popular or practical theism, which latter has ever been more or less frankly pluralistic, not to say polytheistic, and shown itself perfectly well satisfied with a universe composed of many original principles,"4 principles which, even if subject to (one) God, are nonetheless distinct and autonomous. If evil is one of these "original principles," God "is not necessarily responsible" for its existence; "he would only be responsible if it were not finally overcome." Put differently, evil has forever been and still is an autarch element; only in the future will it cease to be. The pluralism of which James is speaking, and it seems to me with approval, is something like the Manichaean theology. Of this kind of pluralism James says that it is incompatible with either monism or pantheism and that it is "the only obvious escape from paradox." In this way he grafted the optimism of the "healthy mind" vis 'a vis evil upon the inclination of the "sick soul" to hypostatize it, and he came up with a complex notion of "meliorism"-an optimism born out of a pluralistic stance. Evil is but an "independent portion that had no rational or absolute right to live with the rest, and which we might conceivably hope to see got rid of at last." Upon such considerations lies the "chance" of salvation-Pascal's wager, as it were, objectivized.5 I James, The Varieties of Religious Experience, in The Works of William James, eds. Frederik H. Burkhard, Fredson Bowes, and Ignas K. Skrupskelis (Cambridge, Mass., 1985), 112. James made a habit of dichotomous typologies, e.g., the tough-and tender- minded (Pragmatism, ed. Fredson Bowes and Ignas Skrupskelis [Cambridge, Mass. 1975], 13). 4 Varieties, 1 12. 5 See also, Varieties, 413-14 (postscript).

The chapter on Philosophy commences with the question, "Is the sense of divine presence a sense of anything objectively true?"6 James finally answers with an emphatic yes, but in the meantime he demolishes the images of God forged by "dogmatic theology" which vainly attributes to God both metaphysical and moral attributes. James deconstructs the former-unity, perfection, infinity, and omnipotence-in the name of Peirce's pragmatical principle: they have no "cash value," no meaning in life nor a hold in the religious experiences discussed in the preceding chapters. As to God's "moral" attributes, they do indeed have a meaning for life; yet "it stands with them ill as with the arguments for his existence." They likewise have no backing or grounding in the actual religious experiences described throughout the Gifford lectures. Evidently, James distinguishes between "having meaning in life" and "having a backing in experience." In their personal experiences of the world, human beings always found "reason for doubting that a good God can have framed it."7 For all that, philosophy's task is not only negative or critical, though it must first rid itself of vacuous formulations. An empirical philosophy of religion, a veritable "science of religions"8 is possible inasmuch as it chooses to examine such hypotheses that have a "cash value" in the actual religious experience. In what does this real religious experience, the experience of the divine, consist? All said and done, it is the experience "which individuals have of an intercourse between themselves and higher powers with which they feel themselves to be related,"9 a "communion" with a spiritual object. This "communion" expresses itself best neither in sacrifice nor in rite but in prayer, which is always a testimony that a "spiritual energy, which otherwise would slumber, does become active."'0 The channel for this "communion"-the actual meeting-place between the experiencing subject and the real-spiritual domain that is the object of his experience--is the "subconscious part of our existence" that each of us has. Put differently, what, asks James, is that "more" which is above the self and which the self comes into a "union" with through its subconscious realm? Let me then propose, as a hypothesis, that whatever it may be on its farther side, the "more" with which in religious experience we feel one's life as if these hypotheses were true.

Starting thus with a recognized psychological fact as our basis, we seem to preserve a contact with "science" which the ordinary theologian lacks. 11 The intrusion into everyday consciousness of this subconscious content is a "power" which is indeed "a higher power," subjective and objective, internal and external, at one and the same time. The subliminal consciousness is a "mediating term" and a mediating domain between the subject and the religious object in that it partakes in both: Disregarding then our beliefs, and confining ourselves to what is common and generic, we have the fact that the conscious person is continuous with a wider self through which saving experience comes, as positive content of religious experience which ... is literally and objectively true as far as it goes.12 Divinity, then, is a real presence because its effects-mediated by the subconsciousness-are real. The divine realm is thus an "extension of our personality." This "pragmatic" view of religion, says James in an expression reminiscent of Paul, is "the body and soul" of religion.13 A key role in the construction of this theory is held by the notion of the "extension" of the self: it bridges between the self and the god(s) through the individual subconsciousness. The notion is a familiar one in the history of philosophical discussions about religion; ever since Xenophanes, erroneous religious images were criticized for being a mere projection, or transference, of ourselves upon the transcendent. Xenophanes employed it to deconstruct mythological anthropomorphizations. "Homer and Hesiod have attributed to the gods everything that is a shame and reproach among men (aVOp(ORcOlOaV voVi&amp;xcc' NJ6yo; E' ativ), stealing and committing adultery and deceiving each other.... But mortals consider that the gods are born, and that they have clothes and speech and bodies like their own."14 If oxen, horses, or lions were " Ibid., 403.

Unlike the almost contemporary invective of the so-called Deuteroisaia against idolatry-the worship of "wood and stone"15-Xenophanes' criticism is philosophical in that it not only names and ridicules an error but uncovers its origin in the universal inclination to imagine the gods in our image. This thought, once formulated, strikes us as immediately evident and was therefore of an everlast- ing impact. It persisted through the Christian critique of polytheism down to the secular critique of religion as such.'6 Projection (or transference) by way of "objectivization" (Verdinglichung) was also the source of human "alienation" (Entfremdung) in Feuerbach's and Marx's critique of all religion,'7 or the source of religious images according to Freud.18 Time and again, James polemicized '5 Is. 40:18-25; 44:8-21. U. Kaufman, Toledot ha'emuna hayisre'elit (Jerusalem, 1976), VIII, 84-87, has argued that, like all other biblical authors, the Deuteroisaia was not really acquainted with "pagan beliefs"; for our purposes it matters little whether or not this is true. 16 It seems that the Christian polemical literature preferred, on the whole, the Euhemeristic account of the origins of the gods, perhaps because the critique of Xeno- phanes was so radical that it could easily turn also against the biblical imagery; but at times it combined the Euhemeristic theory with the Xenophanian, e.g. Tertullian, Apologeticum 10, 3 ("istos deos vestros homines fuisse"); 11, 1; 11, 10-14 ("Atquin, si illos homines fuisse non potestis negare, etiam istae notae accedunt, quae nec deos postea factos credi permittunt etc."); Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum, ed. H. Hoppe (Vienna, 1939). Cf. P.

Sessions (Princeton, 1972), 11-36. As to the anthropomorphic expressions in the Bible, Jewish and Christian authors explained them as instances of divine accommodation to the capacity of humans to perceive revelations; on the fortunes of this idea see my Heilsplan und natiirliche Entwicklung (Munich, 1965), 17ff., 51-67; Theology and the Scientific Imagination, 202-71; Stephen D. Benin, "The Cunning of God and Divine Accommodation," JHI, 45 (1984), 179-91. The idea of accommodation func- tioned almost as the inverse of the idea of projection-as a projection of the divine upon the human perception; as, e.g., in Nicolaus Cusanus, De visione Dei, 6, Werke, ed. Paul Wilpert (Berlin, 1967), I, 300: "Sic si leo faciem tibi attribueret, non nisi Leoninam indicaret, et bos bovinam: et aquila aquilinam. 0 domine quam admirabilis est facies tua quam si invenis concipere vellet: invenem fingeret, et vir virilem, et senex senilem." 17 Ludwig Feuerbach, Das Wesen des Christentums, Gesammelte Werke, ed.

Wie der Mensch sich Gegenstand, so ist ihm Gott Gegenstand; wie er denkt, wie er gesinnt ist, so ist Gott." In this sense God, much as human feeling, is both identical and different from the self.

In his theory the critical function ofthe notion of projection turns into a constructive one. Indeed, the divine is an "extension" of the self, but precisely in this lies its reality and vitality. My interpretation finds some corroboration in the "Postscript" to the Varieties. There James says further that one need not imagine that divine domain, the realm of a "higher force" of which he spoke earlier, as necessarily one in number. Dogmatic theology was mistaken in its pursuit of unity at any price. This ideal power with which we feel ourselves in connection, the "God" of ordinary men is, both by ordinary men and by philosophers, endowed with certain of those metaphysical attributes which in the lecture on philosophy I treated with such disrespect. He is assumed as a matter of course to be "one and only" and to be "infinite"; and the notion of many finite gods is one which hardly anyone thinks it worth while to consider.20 And James assumes a genuinely philosophical posture by asking, why not? What is wrong with a multiplicity of gods? After all, the empirical religious experience-that "fact" spoken of earlier-does not in itself favor any abstract speculation concerning the magnitude, number, or measure of unity of that transpersonal domain to which we have access through our "subconscious- ness." If anything, the religious subject experiences it as a larger power which is friendly to him andto his ideals. All that the facts require is that the power should be both other and larger than our conscious selves. Anything larger will do, ... It need not be infinite, it need not be solitary. It might conceivably even be only a larger and more godlike self, of which the present self would be but the mutilated expression, and the universe might conceivably be a collection of such selves, of different degrees of exclusiveness, with no absolute unity realized in it at all. Thus would a sort of polytheism return upon us.2' Here, says James, he does not intend to defend this polytheistic perspective, he only raises it as a possibility; it is clear, though, that his heart is with it, with a Leibnizian monadology of sorts without a monad-in-chief. The empirical grounding of such a polytheism consists precisely in that its divinity is an '9 James, Varieties, 13 (existential judgment and Werturteil). 20 James, Varieties, 412-13. 21 Ibid.

In their name James discarded the presup- position of divine omnipotence and unity. In his essay on Pragmatism we find other, more cognitive considerations leading to the same view. To assume an omniscient being amounts to assuming the absolute intelligibility of the universe, a universe amenable to a rational interpretation from the vantage point of one supreme hypothetical consciousness. "Experience," however, urges us to doubt the existence of one such vantage-point that could comprehend the whole universe, and to acquiesce to a plurality of perspectives which are neither complete nor mutually inclusive and perhaps even at odds with each other. The intelligibility and coherence of the universe can never be manifest from one point of view.23 Here, too, James defends a polytheism "which, by the way, has always been the real religion of common people, and is so still today."24 Some questions must remain unanswered. Did James only favor different divinities for different selves, or was he also inclined to admit a plurality of gods for each person? We possess only scattered hints, and it will not do to say that there is no reason why James should have stopped with a weaker version of polytheism.25 The stronger version certainly does notfollow from the weaker, just as his polytheistic stand in general-in whatever sense-does not follow from his pluralistic position in other domains. Neither accordance nor affinity but only his own admission was sufficient reason to call him a polytheist. Antecedents I went to great length in my exposition of James's pronouncements concerning polytheism because I wished to avert a fruitless polemics as to whether James could have been a polytheist or was so in fact. I rather want to 22 Cf also James, Varieties, 104-5. Against James's theory one might argue that he tends to confuse (a) the source of religious experience (or its cause) with its effects and (b) the intentional object with the intentional act of that experience. James may have countered that precisely this ambiguity lies in the religious experience itself. 23 James, Pragmatism, ed. Bowers, Ch. IV. 24 James, Varieties, 413. James also discusses Polytheism briefly in A Pluralistic Universe, The Works of William James, 140. 25 The weaker construction would accord with the exalted claims James makes for the "extended self' to the point of grounding upon it our hopes for afterlife. The stronger sense of polytheism may find some faint corroboration in the answer he gave to a questionnaire in 1904: "God, to me, is not the only spiritual reality to believe in. Religion means primarily a universe of spiritual relations surrounding the earthly practical ones, not merely relations of 'value,' but agencies and their activities." Henry James (ed.), The Letters of William James (2 vols.; Boston, 1920), II, 213. I owe this reference to Professor Josef Horowitz, Tel-Aviv University. A somewhat similar theoretical distinction was first drawn by Schelling ("simultaneous" as against "'successive" polytheism).</page><page sequence="8">106 Amos Funkenstein shift the discussion once again to the problem of motives. From James's own formulations we elicited some intrinsic-systematic reasons for his raising, as an interpretative possibility, a seemingly defunct exhibit-piece from the museum of past religions; a position which, as he said himself, defies the general consensus of today. Perhaps his stand will gain some more profile when compared to some possible antecedents. Where, in the history of modem philosophy, can we find a comparable stand? Perhaps we could compare him to the modem critics of "natural religion" from Montaigne to Hume. That every soul is "naturally Christian" (anima naturaliter christiana)26 has been widely assumed since antiquity. The soul, it has been said time and again, has an innate knowledge of its maker and savior. The reports of missionaries of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are sprinkled with discoveries of signs of a natural monotheism among savages, and also vestiges of Christian symbols and creeds: stories of creation and deluge, cross-symbols, beliefs in an all-powerful deity, and much more.27 Montaigne turned all such testimonies on their head. His "Apology for Raymund Sebond," far from defending the latter's natural theology, attacks its very premises: man, by no means superior to beasts either emotionally or intellectually, needs a superior source of guidance even in daily, mundane negotiations. As to the various "savage customs and beliefs" (des moeurs et creances sauvages) which seem to foreshadow Christianity, they are not an indication of natural propensity towards the truth but, precisely because they are so out of context with the cultures in which they occur, must have been implanted in them, so to say artificially, by God who wanted them to testify to the "dignity and divinity" of our religion. It is an ethnographic proof of sorts for the veracity of Christianity precisely because natural religion explains nothing.28 Hume resumed this line of argumentation: even the idea of God does not evolve of necessity in all cultures.29 James is not at all the heir of this line of attack. True, he also denies that monotheism-to say nothing of more concrete tenets of the christian dogma- are natural. But his reasons are different from those of either Montaigne or Hume. James wrote in the aftermath of the revolution in the philosophy of religion, a revolution induced, or at least most clearly articulated, by Schleiermacher. Until then, the content of a religion seemed to be encapsulated in its objects of faith or worship; thereafter, the religious experience of the believer, however characterized, seemed ever more essential, and "no intellec- tual, dialectical dissection or justification of such intuition" seemed "possible, 26 Tertullian, Apol. 17, 120; see also C.

He even believed that, based on a description of religious experiences, one could construct reasonable empirical hypotheses concerning the transcendent domain. A closer parallel to James's provocative defense of polytheism can be found in various pronouncements ofFriedrich Nietzsche throughout his literary career. Atheist that he was, Nietzsche declared the death of God and the gods alike; but he also repeated, almost as a prayer or incantation, the formula, "Is it not indeed divinity in that there are gods, but no God?"' I Both points of view are complementary rather than contradictory, as a lengthy argument in the "La Gaya Scienza" proves. It is entitled "the utmost advantage [gr6j3ter Nutzen] of polytheism": That the individual should set his own ideal and, out of it, derive his law, his joys and rights-this was deemed until now as the most terrible of all human aberrations and as blasphemy as such; indeed the few who dared it needed to themselves an apology, and it usually sounded: "not me! not me! but rather a God through me!" This wonderful art and ability, to create gods-polytheism--was the place where this drive could unload itself.... To be the enemy of this drive towards an own ideal: this was, in those times, the law of every morality. Only one norm existed-the human being-and every nation believed to have only one, ultimate norm. But above and outside oneself, in a far distant world above, one was permitted to envision a plurality of norms.... The invention of the gods, of heroes and superhuman beings of all sorts... was a priceless exercise for the justification of egotism [Selbstsucht] and self-sovereignty [Selbsttherrlichkeit] of the individual. The free- dom granted to one god against all others was eventually granted to oneself against the laws and customs of the neighbor. Monotheism, by contrast,-this rigid consequence of the doctrine of a normal human being, namely the belief in a normal god, besides whom only false fake- gods exist-was the greatest danger of humankind hitherto....

Both the gods and God are projections: the former of an individual self, free at least to plant the embodiment of individual norms in its imagination of the transcen- dent; the latter of a collective, herded self of "normal human Being." Nietzsche sees polytheism as the beginning of the emancipation of the former from the latter, an emancipation from fear and guilt. Projection plays, then, a positive role rather than being just a source of error. The gods, however they may exist, are a useful bridge between man and superman. The point of convergence between James and Nietzsche in this matter is also the source of their divergence. For both of them, the criterion of truth- including the truth of religion-was its "value for life." But the life James has in mind is everyman's, and no life seems to him of so much greater value than another. He would have abhorred the sacrifice of man for superman, in the name of which Nietzsche attacked Christian morals. James was not the enemy of Christianity, only of theology. Yet both of them extolled the virtues of plural- ism. How well was James acquainted with Nietzsche? He mentions him only occasionally and must have read some of his better-known treatises (such as the Gay Science), but we have no direct evidence that he was particularly alerted by the passage just quoted. Let it, then, stay as a reasonable surmise that he did. Whether or not this is the case, their similarities (noted on other counts before)33 are significant, and they have an older antecedent to both in the theology of Epicurus and the Epicureans. Greek theologies since Xenophanes tended more and more to deanthropomorphize religion, to emphasize the unity and abstrac- tion of the deity. Xenophanes himself, whose criticism of tendencies to project upon the deity human features we mentioned earlier, also extolled the notion of one deity that is all mind (voi3). From him through Aristotle's unmoved mover and highest good to Plotinus's "one" (6o iv), the main road of Greek philosophy of religion led to an ever more rarefied notion of divinity. Such was the "natural" (philosophical) theology which Poseidonius, and Varro after him, distinguished from the "civil" and from the "vulgar" mythology.34 The average intellectual of later antiquity knew that religion is one in the variety of rites; his "natural theology" was more often than not monistic of sorts. Only in the Middle Ages did the myth emerge that Christianity and Judaism were the only monotheistic islands in antiquity, surrounded by an ocean of polytheistic 32 Diefrohliche Wissenschaft, Werke, II, 134-35 (my translation). 33 Herman Noack, Die Philosophie Westeuropas (Darmstadt, 1965), 73. 34 Augustinus, De civitate Dei 6, 5.

The Babylonian Talmud tells of a certain Zenon, a heathen philosopher, who said to Rabbi Akiba: "you and I know that idolatry has no substance to it"; only Rashi in the eleventh century, who could not imagine a pagan monotheist any more, added in his commentary, "and this Zenon was a Jew."937 Now, it is precisely this dominant monotheizing, de-anthropomorphizing trend in ancient philosophy that the Epicureans dared to challenge. Time and again, Epicurus and his disciples defended the deep philosophical truth in imagining the gods as many and as human-shaped.38 Epicurus's gods are humanoid because the gods appear to us so in dreams and visions: it is the guarantee for the existence, all the more so since the human shape is the noblest and most beautiful of all possible forms of life. In other words Epicurus and the Epicureans inverted, as James did later, the Xenophonian insight that we imagine the gods as an extension, or projection, of ourselves and our society and turned it from a critical into a constructive tool: not as means by which to invalidate our image of the divinity, but on the contrary as proof for its validity. Precisely because we envision or dream the gods as we do, they exist in the way we see them. The very same empirical principle is at work here as in the Epicurean conviction that the heavenly bodies are no bigger than they seem to us-despite all that mathematicians may have said about their enormous sizes.39 Concerning the body of the gods, the Epicurean doctrine is vaguer than in regard to their shape (gop pi). While the latter (such may have been their logic) is attested empirically, the former can only be reasonably surmised. But how? Perhaps, as Lucretius seems to teach, it is not a solid body but a shape formed from the stream of many atoms in a given way, comparable to shapes and colors we discern in a waterfall.40 Other Epicureans assumed that the gods were made of actual atoms as we are, except of a much subtler material. At any rate, the material substratum of the gods, however imagined, predestines them to exist 35 The popular Ludus de Antichristo, ed. R. Enseling (Ditzingen, 1968), v. 1-6, renders the putative pagan point of view thus: "Deorum immortalitas/ est omnibus colenda/ eorum et pluralitas/ ubique metuenda./ Stulti sunt et vere fatui/ qui deum unum dicunt...." 36 Augustinus, De civ. Dei 10, 9ff (Porphyrius). 37 Bab. Talmud, Avoda Zara 55a and Rashi ad loc. The differences between the pagan and Christian-Jewish deity, whether one or many gods, were still enormous; cf. my Theology and the Scientific Imagination, 124-26. 38 The sources are now available in A.

There the gods lead an autarchic, happy life, an example for us to emulate and admire, though incapable of intervening in that which happens within the many worlds. Indeed, the main goal of Epicurus was to emancipate humanity from the fear of divine intervention, a fear which is the source of so much evil (tantum religio potuit suadere malorum).41 Epicurus's anthropomorphism and his emancipatory aims went hand in hand. Emancipatory in a very similar sense was also James's ethical and religious philosophy-irrespective of the question, which I at least cannot answer, how much, if at all, James drew his inspiration from the ancient atomists. Let us re- turn once more to the motif of the "extension" or "projection" of the self. Both for Epicurus and for James (and Nietzsche) it serves as an empirical datum which permits us to delineate the borderlines of the plausible, concrete contents of religious beliefs, in contrast to far-fetched dogmatic or metaphysical specu- lations. The very circumstance that man creates his god(s) in his image is the sole guarantee for the objectivity of the divine. This being the case, it behooves different tempers to objectivize different gods. The examination of religious experience thus contributes to tolerance towards different, even incompatible images of the religious reality.42 Not very different was James's position concerning free will in "The Will to Believe": the constitutive act of free will -andthe proof for its existence-is the decision to believe in free will.43 Experts tell us that James thus solved a severe psychological crisis which afflicted him in his youth." As yet we have not mentioned another, closer source of certified influence: I mean the psychological speculations of Gustav Theodor Fechner. Much that characterizes James's language we find here also, such as the reference to "energies" and their channeling, the belief in a higher power that already now invades the self subliminally, the identification of this power with God, and the sense of the divine as a sublimated self. James himself even remarked, "Fechner, with his distinct earth-soul functioning as our guardian angel, seems to me clearly polytheistic; but the word 'polytheism' usually gives offense, so perhaps it is better not to use it."45 It seems fairly evident that while sympathiz- ing with many of Fechner's speculations, including his views on afterlife as a further stage in the life of the self,46 James also felt that they are too determinate, 4' Lucretius, De rer. nat. 1. 101. 42 James, Varieties, 437: "So a 'god of battle' must be allowed to be the god of one kind of person, a god of peace and heaven and home, the god for another." How similar yet different is Nietzsche's advocacy of polytheism in the name of individualism! Nietzsche's individual is the one who challenges society and its conventions. 43 See the excellent discussion of G. Bird, William James (London, 1986), 147-53. 4 Myers, James, 47. 45 William James, A Pluralistic Universe, (Cambridge, Mass., 1977), 140, quoted in Myers, James, 474. 46 Cf. in particular C. T.

They also lack that element which makes James's "polytheism" into a theory-an indication of a reasonable mechanism to explain the self s "extension" through the subconsciousness. Did James's defense of polytheism leave any traces in modem thought? The circumstance that hardly any author mentions it would suggest that it was utterly forgotten. Recently, Odo Marquard raised some controversy in Germany with an article on "The Praise of Polytheism."47 It is, if I understood it correctly, much more a defense of mythology perceived as the irreducible plurality of myths than it is a defense of any religious position. Many of James's arguments in favor of pluralism as such were taken over by Marquard, but neither is James ever mentioned nor is the core of his theory, the role of the mechanism of projection, identified. It is this mechanism, the ways of the self in projecting itself, that was one of James's most interesting (albeit hardly recognized) contributions to the philosophy of religion; at any rate, it is the aspect that I tried to illuminate in this essay. That we make our God or gods in our image is an old argument; that the argument has sometimes been used to discredit our religious imagery, while at other times to prove their validity, is less known. The way in which James, too, inverted the critical function of that argument into a constructive one places him in one line with Lucretius, Nicolaus of Cusa, and Nietzsche. Other aspects of his religious ideas-notably his soteriology-I treated only inasmuch as they bear on my theme. Now that I take leave of it, I want nevertheless to do so with the quotation from Robert Stevenson in which James saw the embodiment of his melioristic doctrine of salvation-and of his own temper: "Total failure is our lot; our business is to continue to fail in good spirits."48 University of California, Berkeley, and Tel-Aviv University. tradition (Schelling, Hegel), was also well incorporated into the thought of Emerson, e.g., Essays and Lectures, ed. Joel Porle (New York, 1983), 385-400. As to the "Earth Soul," Swedenborg seems to have been a source of inspiration. 47 Odo Marquard, "Lob der Polytheismus" in Abschied vom Prinzipiellen (Stuttgart, 1981), 91-116. Much more interesting, though somewhat removed from our topic, are the subtle remarks of Franz Rosenzweig on the vital necessity of anthropomorphic expression for a genuine monotheistic experience, in: Kleinete Schriften (Berlin, 1937), 526-33, it is a direct challenge to the whole Xenophanic tradition of "projection" and to its inversion.
