<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE 'BODY-MIND PROBLEM' IN PHILOSOPHY, PSYCHOLOGY AND MEDICINE' C. A. MACE THERE is a story about a distinguished mathematician who had been invited to deliver a course of advanced lectures to other high- powered students of mathematics on a subject about which he was known to have some original ideas. The course, however, got off to a slow start. He devoted three lectures to discussing whether a certain proposition P was or was not self evident. The proposition P was essential to the argument he wanted to develop. Happily, he was able to announce at the opening of his fourth lecture that he had decided that P was self evident. There was an audible sigh of relief. It was now known, on the highest authority, that P was self evident. From that the argument proceeded briskly and with irresistible logic to the lecturer's surprising and devastating conclusions. The story may be apocryphal, but it came back to my mind when I was wondering how to introduce my theme for the fourth Manson Lecture.2 There is a real-life story in the history of philosophy which con- cerns the self evidence of a certain proposition P. In the latter half of the seventeenth century a philosopher, by name Rene Descartes, thought it self evident that there could be such a thing as an immaterial unextended substance. At about the same time another philosopher, Thomas Hobbes, thought it self evident that such a concept was self-contradictory. On votes, Descartes won. He got the Catholic vote. He got the Protestant vote. And such was his luck he got the vote of the natural scientists. He won partly on merit because he was able to develop in some detail a specious account of the nature of 'the Mind'-the immaterial non-extended substance. He won on merit because he was able to suggest some ingenious scientific hypotheses (e.g. con- cerning reflex action and other modes of response to stimulation). But he got the scientific vote because the sort of dualism he defended, however much it bedevilled the subsequent history of psychology, made possible the division of scientific responsibilities in a way which gave all the really difficult problems to Philosophy (which included the 'philosophy of Mind') and left only the easy problems to the 'natural sciences'. 'The Manson Lecture, given at the Royal Institute of Philosophy, Oct. 15,1965. 2Professor John Wisdom has reminded me that the germ of truth in this storr lies in an authentic anecdote about a lecture delivered by the great G. H. Hardy. 153</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPHY The history of thought in part conforms to the theory of a 'Dia- lectical Progression'-the enunciation of a Thesis and its refutation, the enunciation of an Antithesis and its refutation, followed by the discovery of a synthesis which eliminates the errors of Thesis and Antithesis and combines the merits of both. The classical theory of the Dialectical Progression has features in common with the theory that scientific progress comes about in accordance with a long-term application of the principles of the 'Hypothetico-deductive Method'. Scientists are presented with a problem. Some one 'thinks up', hypothetically, a possible solution. From this hypothesis verifiable or refutable consequences are deduced, and the hypothesis is confirmed or refuted. Then some one 'thinks up' another hypothesis, and so on, the process being repeated until an hypothesis is found which like the 'synthesis' in the dialectical progression eliminates all the faults and combines all the advantages of the possible hypotheses. History, however, does not work quite like that. It is not a meta- physical nor a simple logical progression. Large hypotheses are very rarely refuted outright. What more often happens is that a theory encounters difficulties. These difficulties pile up and people get exasperated by them, or they just get tired of the hypothesis and become disposed to try another line of thought. What is of chief interest is the transition from one hypothesis to another. Often it is a swing of the pendulum phenomenon-a switch from one extreme hypothesis to another equally extreme, as in the dialectical pro- gression. Sometimes it is just a matter of historical accident-the appearance of a new man with fresh ideas. It is in part the operation of what that distinguished historian of science, Professor Edwin Boring, likes to call the Zeitgeist, essentially a psychological pheno- menon, a challenge to social psychologists and those concerned with what today is called the 'sociology of thought'. So it is at least, I suggest, with the history of 'the Body-Mind Problem'. This history is in part dialectical progression, in part a hypothetico-deductive sequence, in part Zeitgeist and in part sheer accident. In what follows I shall be in the main concerned with the later phases of this story and with some aspects of the story during the period beginning with the first Manson lecture. But even within this part of the story I shall begin in the middle-at about the time of the second Manson Lecture, a convenient point from which to look both backwards and forwards. The second Manson Lecture was delivered in 1948. In 1949 Ryle's Concept of Mind was published, and in the same year the BBC arranged a series of talks on The Physical Basis of Mind sub- sequently published (in 1950) in a small book under this title. This little book may be too soon forgotten by reason of the circumstances 154</page><page sequence="3">THE 'BODY-MIND PROBLEM IN PHILOSOPHY, PSYCHOLOGY AND MEDICINE of its publication. It is notable for several reasons. It is notable for the distinction of its contributors-a galaxy of high-powered natural scientists and high-powered philosophers. It is notable in the present contextfirst as an historic example of failure in communica- tion, and second, for a suggestion thrown out almost casually by Professor (now Lord) Adrian concerning the direction in which we might look for a solution of the classical Body-Mind problem. The failure of communication was both a failure of the men of science to explain to the philosophers (Ryle and Ayer) the nature of the problem as they saw it, and a failure on the part of these philosophers to explain the alternatives they saw to the Cartesian- type dualism to which the natural scientists were more or less explicitly or more or less implicitly committed. Some three years later at a conference in San Francisco on 'Control of the Mind', Wilder Penfield, one of the contributors to the BBC Symposium, was still expressing his complete bewilderment by the strange doctrines of Ryle and Ayer. To find a source of this failure of communication and to see the need for a review of the boundaries of natural science we have to go back to the moment of triumph of Descartes over Hobbes. The natural scientists gave their vote to Descartes because it happened to suit their book. As I have said, it gave 'Science' the easy problems and pushed the more difficult problems on to philosophy. Here let me not be misunderstood. Physics is a very difficult subject. Few philo- sophers can follow, much less advance, an argument in mathematical physics. But physics is a quite straightforward subject for those who are gifted with mathematical ability and have been trained in making observations. There are accepted principles in accordance with which problems are solved. Physics has its methodology. Philosophy has no 'methodology'. There are no established rules in philosophy the observance of which will guarantee the correct solution of a philosophical problem. Descartes enticed his disciples both in science and philosophy into making a pact rather like that entered into by two American visitors who wanted to see as many as possible of the English cathedrals in a limited time. One of the tourists suggested to the other: 'You go round the outside while I look at the inside'. The pact which Descartes suggested arose from his identification of the distinction between matter and mind with the distinction between 'primary' and 'secondary' properties. The properties of material substance are extension, with motion and other measurable characters ; those of mental substance are consciousness which is resolved into qualitative 'states' of the soul. As set out most clearly in the treatise on the 'Passions', these qualitative states are divided into (i) those that belong to the soul but are 'referred to' things 155</page><page sequence="4">PHILOSOPHY outside the body, (ii) those that belong to the soul but are referred to the body, and (iii) those that both belong to the soul and are referred to the soul. This odd doctrine was uncritically swallowed by the sciences concerned with material things and led naturally to the 'philosophy of science' known as Physicalism. The 'analysis of mind' led also to an alternative philosophy of science in 'Pheno- menalism'. The steps of this transition are well known-from the Cartesian states of mind to Locke's 'new way of ideas', so to Berkeley's idealism, and through Hume eventually to Mill's account of a material thing as a permanent possibility of sensation. From Brentano's distinction between 'act' and 'content', by way of Stout, the step is taken to Moore's Refutation of Idealism and to Russell's 'Neutral Monism' which latter offers both a philosophy of science and a sort of philosophy of mind. At the time of Russell Brain's Manson Lecture-the first Manson Lecture-Phenomenalism in the form of the 'sense datum' theory was a dominating influence in Philosophy. Here Brain, in a way, anticipates Adrian's question of an extension of the 'boundaries' of science, exploring some possible answers to the question whether a sense datum theory provides the possibility of an extension of the boundaries of science. 'There would seem to be', he says, 'at least three possible explana- tions of the relationship between sense data and the nervous system. (1) A sense datum is a neural event ... qualitatively unlike the physical stimulus which initiates it. (2) A sense datum is a psychical event unlike the neural stimulus which initiates it and thus doubly removed from the original physical stimulus. (3) A sense datum is a neural event which is conducted from the surface of the body to the surface of the brain, but which carries with it some characteristics of the physical stimulus which excited it. There is a fourth alternative-that the relationship is inconceivable by the human mind.'1 Can any of these alternative accounts of the matter supply the needed enlargement of the boundaries of science? It would now, I think, be fairly generally agreed that they cannot.2 This brave attempt to explore every possibility may help us to understand why sense datum theories have gone out of fashion. This is another example of the way in which a theory, without being formally refuted, just gets abandoned. The sense datum concept has been so extended and varied that the term is now base coin. There is so little in common between the uses of the term by Russell, Moore, Broad and Price, for example, and still less between these uses and 'Philosophy, Vol. XXI, No. 79. July 1946. 2Lord Brain, in later writings, would himself now seem to agree with this. 156</page><page sequence="5">THE 'BODY-MIND PROBLEM IN PHILOSOPHY, PSYCHOLOGY AND MEDICINE that of Russell Brain that the term cannot be used at all without long and tedious explanations. To use Ryle's expression, it is a matter of 'categories'. It is not enough just to look attentively at a visual sense datum or to listen attentively to an auditory sense datum. A judgment has to be made about the sort of thing it is and to what 'category' it belongs; and to ask, for example, whether a sense datum is a 'thing' in any of the ordinary uses of the word 'thing'. We have to decide whether a visual sense datum can or cannot be described as something which could, in principle, travel up an optic nerve or something which could, in principle, emerge as a wafer-thin pheno- menon on the surface of the visual area of the cortex, and whether an auditory sense datum is the sort of thing which could travel up an auditory nerve or emerge as a squeak or a buzz in the auditory area of the cortex. It is all too easy to dismiss theories as patently non- sensical, metaphysical or otherwise preposterous. But it is, I suggest, part of the business of a philosopher to consider all possible theories, patiently and objectively, however absurd they may at first appear to be. Throughout the quite extraordinary sequence of philosophical theories, from Descartes to the present time, there has been merci- fully preserved a firm grip on 'Common Sense'. Respect for common sense has been maintained by the 'British Empiricists'. It was re- affirmed in G. E. Moore's manifesto A Defence of Common Sense in 1925. Moore's manifesto is, perhaps, now a little dated, chiefly by reason of its negative objectives-the refutation of certain philo- sophical views still very influential at Oxford, Cambridge and else- where. But in its positive content it was, and remains, the most powerful and pervasive influence in recent and contempgrary philosophy-not least so by reason of its development in the teaching of Wittgenstein and of the so-called 'Linguistic' school.' There are passages in the Defence of Common Sense which fore- shadow later trends of thought concerning the 'Body-Mind Problem'. There are passages in which Moore uses the word 'mental' which need expansion. He doubted the occurrence of 'mental events' but affirmed as a part of common sense knowledge that human beings have 'experiences'. At no point, however, did he affirm that he knew with certainty that there are human minds. Later he contributed in the Commonplace Book and elsewhere to the analysis of psychological statements, but he does not seem ever to have developed any complete 'philosophy of mind' nor to have committed himself to any of the 1'So called' because the description can be misleading. Even 'linguistic' philo- sophers agree that words are significant in their meanings and uses for, among other things, helping us to understand the world in which we live. 157</page><page sequence="6">PHILOSOPHY more extreme forms of 'reductionism' which were to appeal to many of his followers. It would seem that there is an extension of 'common sense philosophy' which includes 'common sense science'-an extension which could be illustrated both by statements from the Manson Lectures and from the symposium on The Physical Basis of Mind. Each of us knows in a common sense way that most human bodies have bodily organs, arms, legs, eyes and ears and nerves. We know that these organs condition some of our 'experiences' and many of the things we do. But to extend this set of statements of common sense science is to embark on one of the most slippery of all philo- sophical slopes. The participants in the discussion on The Physical Basis of Mind embarked on just such a slope. An attempt was made to give an intelligible account of what happens when a human being sees a star, a rainbow, or a flash of lightning or when he hears a clap of thunder or smells the perfume of a rose. There was general agreement about the beginning of the story. In the case of seeing a star or a flash of lightning the story begins with the origination of electromagnetic oscillations in a physical source, being transmitted through an external medium impinging upon a sense organ and being transmitted through an internal transmissive medium and proceeding to some area in the cerebral cortex. A similar account is given of hearing a clap of thunder and of smelling a rose. All, including the most cantankerous of philosophers, agree about this part of the story, though the philosophers have reservations and would often like to retell the story in their own way. Given this provisional agreement, the scien- tists ask: What happens next? This is an intelligible question which should be given an intelligible answer. Here the trouble arises. The scientists expect psychologists or philosophers to write the next chapter, or at least to end the story. They expect the philosophers to tell them how what happens in the cortex 'produces' the perception of a star or the smell of a rose. Now here they have to be disappointed. Viscount Samuel frankly concludes: 'That, it seems, is where we are now at a standstill. Until science and philosophy can help us to move on . . . we cannot hope that the universe will, for us, be rationalised.' Ayer disappoints the scientist in another way. 'Once we are freed', he says, 'from the Cartesian fallacy of regarding minds as immaterial substances I do not think that the discovery of causal connections between what we choose to describe respectively as mental and physical occurrences implies anything by which we need to be per- plexed.' In short, there is no problem. Ryle takes a rather similar line. He notes that some of the scientists 158</page><page sequence="7">THE 'BODY-MIND PROBLEMS IN PHILOSOPHY, PSYCHOLOGY AND MEDICINE have wittingly or unwittingly subscribed to the Cartesian pact, and he seems to assume that all that is needed is to disabuse them of this error. Ryle's jokes about the 'ghost in the machine' have signally contributed to the needed operation of laughing Cartesian dualism out of court; but in retrospect it is possible to wonder whether he has not let his victims down too lightly. After all, ghost theories, though faulty science, were scientific theories, intelligible theories. They fell into the quite reputable system of physical atomism. A ghost was thought of as a material thing composed of the 'finest' of atoms which could occupy the interstices between the larger and 'coarser' atoms of the ordinary body. The 'ethereal' duplicate of the body could move out of the body, have exciting adventures and on returning to the ordinary body report its adventures as descriptions of dreams. It could survive the ordinary body and produce the phenomena of 'hauntings'. The theory had the neat advantage that it explained why ghosts appear in period costume-because their clothes also had a complement of ethereal particles. This was faulty science no doubt but it was science. The theory was developed in an amusing way by Hobbes who suggested that God and the angels were 'spirits' -in the sense in which methylated spirit in an evaporated state is a spirit-but composed of atoms so fine as not to affect the human senses and so not to be subjects for empirical research-a view which would seem to adumbrate later 'verification' theories of the nature of scientific knowledge. In contrast the 'mind' as described by Descartes is not at all like a 'ghost'. Descartes's theory is not just a mistaken scientific theory. It is an unintelligible theory. It does not give an intelligible account of the way in which movement of animal spirits 'produce' states of the soul, or of the way in which states of the soul can affect movements of the body. Even if we get rid of the Cartesian dualism in the ways in which Ayer and Ryle would help us to get rid of this unintellig- ible theory we are still not out of the wood. We still have the unin- telligible dualism of 'primary' and 'secondary' properties, and dualism of a world described on the one hand in terms of physicalism, and the world as described in terms of 'neutral' phenomenalistic data, with both in undefined relation to the world as described by 'common sense' including much of ordinary science. The 'Body-Mind' problem is not the only problem, not the basic problem. There remains the question of how the natural scientists' story about the physical and neural antecedents of seeing a star or smelling a rose ties up with the story of the man who records the seeing of a star or the smelling of a rose. Ayer's account of the matter may perplex the natural scientists not merely because he wants them to change their assumptions about mind but also because 159</page><page sequence="8">PHILOSOPHY he wants them to take a view of causal explanation very different from that to which they are accustomed. He recapitulates the account which is given by the physiologist about the physical and neural antecedents of perception and the story of the person who reports his perceptions. 'It seems to me', he then says, 'that when it is asserted that the two events in question-the mental and the physical-are causally connected . . . all that is meant, or at least all that properly can be meant, is that these two sets of observations are correlated....' This neo-Humean type of theory of causal explanation in terms of observed correlations is not what the scientists are looking for. They expect 'correlations' to be made intelligible. That 'bare' correlations need not be intelligible is illustrated by the stock example of the economist who discovered a significant correlation over a period between marriages in the Church of England and the importation of bananas. This sort of case does not and need not worry Ayer. He would say that any sensible economist would look for other corre- lations-those between records of imports of bananas and marriages in other churches and those between marriages and the import of things other than bananas. He might well find correlations between these facts and changes in national economic policy which would provide an 'intelligible' explanation of marriage rates and import rates. But suppose no further correlations are found which make the connections intelligible, what should we say? In this simple case we might say simply, 'Well, that's very odd, but I suppose further correlations may yet be found which will make the connection intelligible'. Or should we say, more radically, 'We must accept the fact that in Nature there are just stark correlations which can never be made intelligible, indeed correlations which we can see in principle could never be made intelligible. The correlations between observa- tions of electrical phenomena in the brain and observations of colours and tastes and smell look as if they are just such ultimate stark unintelligible correlations.' Now if this latter is the view that Ayer is taking he would seem in effect to be saying what the scientists and Lord Samuel are saying when they suggest that the relations between brain processes and sensation are 'inconceivable by the human mind', that the connection cannot be rationalised. Or, to put the matter the other way round: what more are these scientists and philosophers saying when they say that the relation between a and b is 'inconceivable by the human mind', that this relation 'cannot be rationalised', that it is 'a far cry' to pass from a report on a to a report on b, what more are they saying than Ayer is saying when he says (if this is what he is saying) that 160</page><page sequence="9">THE 'BODY-MIND PROBLEM IN PHILOSOPHY, PSYCHOLOGY AND MEDICINE the relation between a and b is just one of stark unintelligible corre- lation? The talk of 'far cries' is more picturesque than Ayer's language, the talk about 'inconceivability' and the 'impossibility of rationalisation', etc., is misleading in various ways. The way Ayer puts it has a certain elegant simplicity-if he is saying what I under- stand him to be saying. If he is to be faulted at all it is at most for a certain lack of human sympathy with the perplexity actually experienced by his fellow students of philosophy of what is for every- one an exasperating problem. The position now seems to be: (1) We agree, provisionally at least, that the Cartesian dualism does not provide the basis for an intelligible account of how certain physico-neural processes are accompanied or followed by 'perceptual experiences'. (2) We agree, provisionally, that we must accept the possibility of ultimate stark unintelligible correlations. Where do we go from here? We clearly cannot leave the matter just like that. We could do worse than explore Lord Adrian's suggestion that the problem may be solved 'by some enlargement of the boundaries of natural science, by the progress of psychology for instance'. On this possibility the first comment to be made is that before looking for enlargement of the boundaries of the natural science by advances in psychology or elsewhere steps might be taken to remove the restrictions imposed upon the natural sciences by the Cartesian Pact. Time was when 'Science' meant just 'knowledge', all knowledge, knowledge which might be only more or less certain and knowledge of Nature as a whole, and of all the phenomena that Nature displays. The Cartesian Pact confined 'Science' in ways which came to be canonised by the rigid formulae of 'physicalistic' and 'verificationist' principles. In point of fact tacit breaches of the pact have already been made by those natural sciences which have maintained their ties with a philosophy of common sense. The humbler sciences, such as Botany, have been concerned not only with the sizes and shapes of their objects of study but also with their colour, their tastes and smells. So too, indeed, has physics in concerning itself with the visible spectrum and with audible sounds. There have been tacit breaches of the pact by studies of the laws of colour mixture and by studies of the chemistry of smells. The time is ripe, perhaps, for the natural sciences to denounce the pact and all the surreptitious breaches of the pact, and to accept honest responsibility for the whole of empirical know- ledge. Where in this does Psychology come in? We have no grounds for expecting any new spectacular break-through in, say, psycho- pharmacology, in neuropsychiatry, or in further revelations of the workings of the unconscious mind. Nor is much more to be expected 161</page><page sequence="10">PHILOSOPHY from the conversion of psychologists to some or other form of Behaviourism. Behaviourists have merely capitulated to the physicalistic camp of the Cartesian Pact. A guess might be made that the most important contributions to the enlargement of the boundaries of natural science will prove to have been made by psychologists least influenced by Behaviourism, e.g. those who have studied by the methods of the natural sciences the ways in which things appear. Perhaps the next step to be taken is for the natural sciences to accept responsibility for explaining not only how things are and why they are as they are but also for explaining why things appear as they do. Although, as an accident of history, the appearance of things have been studied by psychologists there is nothing very psycho- logical about these studies, certainly nothing that requires reference to the 'mind'. The principles of perspective, for example, though studied first by painters, constitute a small compact body of scientific propositions. No one would say that the laws of perspective are laws of mind or require the operation of a mind. They require only a physical body equipped with an optical system. So it is with variations in the ways in which things appear according to the physical context (as in the well-known Miller Lyer illusion). So too with the conditions of the perception of motion (the phi-phenomena). So too with the per- ception of thinghood, persistence and causality. Simple natural science concepts only are required for the description and explanation of many qualitative variations in appearance-the jaundiced view, the hallucinatory pink rats and elephants and similar disturbances of vision. None of these facts require the existence of a mind. All are largely explained in terms of empirical facts regarding colour mixture and vision through an optical system. The general principle I am suggesting for the expansion of the boundaries of the natural sciences is that of pursuing a piecemeal but progressive assimilation of psychological concepts into the natural sciences, a process which may transform the natural sciences as much as it transforms psychology. The most spectacular phase in this process of assimilation may be in the absorption into the natural sciences of the common sense concepts of 'person' and 'experience'. Perhaps the most signal step in denouncing the Cartesian Pact was taken not by the Behaviourists but by that eminent 'middle of the road' psychologist Robert S. Woodworth when he suggested that Psychology needs only one noun--'person' or 'organism'. His point was, I take it, not merely that we do not need the multiplicity of nouns such as the 'will' the 'imagination' and other faculty words, but also that we need only the one noun required for organisms 162</page><page sequence="11">THE 'BODY-MIND PROBLEM IN PHILOSOPHY, PSYCHOLOGY AND MEDICINE which act and have experiences. Oddly, we still lack that one noun. To describe a man as an organism is an understatement, and to describe a rat as a person seems anthropomorphic, but we can see what Woodworth meant. A person is not just a Body or just a Mind or a combination of a Body with a Mind. A person acts and has experiences. As the concept of person has lost its dualistic implications so has the concept of an experience. An experience is a psychosomatic phenomenon. In the full-blooded sense of the term a bad channel crossing is a genuine experience; one who has suchanexperiencenot only feels sick; he is sick. Merely to dream, however vividly, of a bad channel crossing is in comparison an anaemic experience, but even a dream is a psychosomatic phenomenon. So it is with the experiences described as wishes, emotions and mescalin-induced visions. J. L. Austin compares emotion with mumps. This might seem to be a 'reductionist' de-bagging sort of comparison but it contains a serious point. 'It is fair to say that "being angry" is in many respects like having mumps. It is a description of a whole pattern of events, including occasion, symptoms, feeling, manifesta- tions and possibly other factors besides. It is as silly to ask "what really is anger like itself?" as to attempt to fine down any disease to one chosen item." I would put this point (I have indeed put it elsewhere2) by saying that an emotion has no 'essence'. To say that the essence of so and so is so and so is generally no more than to express a personal interest in one component in a total pattern. To regard generally the person and his experiences psycho- somatically is perhaps the broadest general principle to apply in the attempt to replace the Cartesian dualism by an integrated and expanded system of natural science. But that is not to say that all the problems can be settled by a simple 'get together' between natural scientists and psychologists. The current philosophies of science even without the Cartesian dualism have still a Body-Mindproblem- the psychosomatic problem-to which philosophers may continue to administer their advisory, therapeutic and corrective services. No Manson Lecture would be complete without an expression of appreciation by the lecturer for the honour conferred by the invita- tion to deliver this lecture, nor for some lecturers without an apology for his shortcomings. I have left my apologies to the end so that all may see for themselves how much there is for which I should apologise. It may be that my chief shortcoming has been the failure sufficiently to cover the subject of 'The Body-Mind Problem' in I 'Other Minds', Philosophical Papers, p.77. 2 Emotion and the Concept of Passivity', Proc. Arist. Soc., Vol. LXII. 163</page><page sequence="12">PHILOSOPHY Medicine. In part extenuation my only plea must be that, in fact, in all that I have said, the requirements of the professionofmedicine, and especially the requirements of those who practise as 'family doctors' or 'general practitioners', have been uppermost in my mind. The 'family' doctor is increasingly called upon for the services of counselling and guidance of the kind traditionally provided by the parish priest or minister of religion. He serves his 'parishioners' from before birth to beyond the grave-before birth in pre-natal care, beyond the grave in watching the psychosomatic reactions of, as well as comforting, the bereaved. All this notwithstanding the other mounting pressures on his time. The medical practitioner has suffered with others from the baneful effects of what I have called the 'Cartesian Pact'. He has suffered from a system of education in which the study of deviations from normality and mental health are pursued in one Faculty while the normal healthy person is studied in another Faculty. It is not enough just to disabuse the man of medicine of the errors of the Cartesian dualism. He asks for a 'philosophy' as well as for instruction in all the natural sciences which can help him to implement the Hippocratic Oath, by which he is committed not only to the prolongation of life but also to relieving pain and anxiety, and generally to the enhancement of the quality of life. I have suggested, though I have had insufficient time to develop the suggestion, that Cartesian concepts might be replaced by 'Psychosomatic' concepts in which the person is thought of as a being-a single being-which has both bodily and 'mental' (or psychological) attributes and whose 'experiences' are psychosomatic phenomena which are caused by psychosomatic antecedents and which in turn have psychosomatic consequences. The principles of medical education are today under scrutiny and review. May they always be so. Is it too much to hope that through the sustained pressure of successive Manson Lectures medical education will enhance communications between pioneers in philosophy, psychology and the older natural sciences, and between these and the general practitioners upon whose breadth of interest and understanding the implementation of the Hippocratic Oath so vitally depends? 164</page></plain_text>
