Bucur Duquesne University; Department of 7heology, Pittsburgh, PA 15282, USA Abstract This article contributes to research on Clement of Alexandria's pneumatology by revis iting and expanding upon Christian Oeyen's oft-neglected study Eine fiihchristliche Engelpneumatologie bei Klemens von Alexandrien, published in 1966. It argues, first, that a study of Clement's Pneumatology cannot ignore the surviving portions of Clem ent's Hypotyposes (especially the Excerpta ex Theodoto, Eclogae Propheticae, and Adum brationes), because these appear to have included treatises "On Prophecy" and "On the Soul." Secondly, it reaffirms Oeyen's thesis that Clement of Alexandria's Pneumatology is best understood within the framework of early Jewish and Christian speculation on the "first created" angelic spirits (npotioKxnOtot). The article advances the discussion by providing a context for Clement's "angelomorphic Pneumatology": this phenome non is part of a larger theological articulation, occurring in tandem with Spirit Chris tology and a marked binitarian orientation.

Bucur / Vigiliae Christianae 61 (2007) 381-413 little to contribute to the subject. It is quite telling, for instance, that Jules Lebreton's fundamental study on Clement's "theology of the Trinity" dis cusses the Father and the Son, but has absolutely nothing to say about the Spirit. According to Iheodor Zahn and Georg Kretschmar, Clement's all-encompassing Logos-theology completely overshadowed his notion of the Holy Spirit. In W H. C. Frend's terms, "there would appear to be little real place for Him in his [Clement's] system."2 More recently, Henning Ziebritzki passed the following verdict: Klemens hat explizit den Heiligen Geist weder in seiner individuellen Substanz begriffen, noch seinen metaphysischen Status auch nur ansatzweise bestimmt. Damit fehlen aber auch die entscheidenden Voraussetzungen, die es erlauben wiirden, im klementinischen Verstandnis des Heiligen Geistes den Ansatz zum Begriff einer dritten gottlichen Hypostase zu sehen.3 It appears that some important elements are being overlooked in research about Clement's Pneumatology. According to his own statements, Clement set out to explain "what the Holy Spirit is" in his treatises "On Prophecy" and "On the Soul."4 Since these works were most likely part of the Hypotyposes,5 it makes good sense to approach Clement's understanding of the Holy Geist und der Mensch: Studien zur fr?hchristlichen Pneumatologie (M?nchen 1972) 13, n. 10. Aside from Frangoulis' pioneering, but very limited study, I know of a single work dedicated entirely to Clement's Pneumatology: Luis Ladaria, El Esp?ritu en Clemente Alejan drino: estudio teol?gico antropol?gico (Madrid 1980).

It is in these works more than anywhere else that one is likely to learn about Clement's Pneumatology. Another reason for considering these works as a privileged entry-point into Clement's theology becomes apparent when one considers the place held by the Hypotyposes in the overall architecture of the Alexandrian mas ter's works. It is generally admitted that Clement understood his teaching and writing to proceed according to principles of intellectual and spiritual formation.6 Pierre Nautin has demonstrated that within the program of Clementine works the Hypotyposes represented Clement's physics and epop tics.7 We are dealing, therefore, with the highest exposition of Christian doctrine, offered only after the student had gone through preliminary mat ters. To quote Mehat, " [b] ref, si la gnose est essentiellement du domaine de la &lt;&lt; physique &gt;&gt;, les Hypotyposes devaient en regorger. . .".' Finally, searching for Clement's doctrine of the Spirit through the lens of late fourth century Pneumatology limits our ability to capture impor tant elements. Given the fluidity of second-century views on the Spirit, one must adopt a wider perspective, taking into consideration the frequent intersection and overlap between Pneumatology, Christology and angelol ogy, labeled in scholarship as "Spirit Christology," "angelomorphic Chris tology," or "angelomorphic Pneumatology." I will discuss this point in some detail further down. I am indebted here to one of the most thorough and creative studies in the field, Christian Oeyen's Eine firihchristliche Engelpneumatologie bei Kle mens von Alexandrien. This small but extremely dense work is a slightly revised reprint of a two-part article published in 1965, which is in turn a revision of an excerpt from Oeyen's 1961 dissertation under Antonio Orbe.9 Habent sua fata libelli: Oeyen's study, which was based largely on 6) See in this respect the excellent presentation and abundant references to secondary lit erature in Judith Kovacs, "Divine Pedagogy and the Gnostic Teacher According to Clement of Alexandria,"/ECS 9 (2001) 3-25. 7) Nautin, "La fin des Stromates et les Hypotyposes de Cl?ment d'Alexandrie," VigChr 30 (1976) 268-302.

It is necessary at this point to clarify the expression "the other Clement," which I have used in both this and an earlier study.10 This is simply a rhetorical term, by which I designate what is usually left out in most scholarly treatments of Clement: the Adum brationes, the Eclogae Propheticae, and, to a lesser degree, the Excerpta ex Theodoto. Serious consideration of these oft-neglected remnants of the Hypotyposes, in which the echo of doctrines and practices of an earlier gen eration of Jewish Christian teachers is especially clear,'1 is an absolute requirement for a proper understanding of Clement and (perhaps espe cially) his views on the Holy Spirit. In the following pages, I shall reaffirm Oeyen's thesis that Clement's Pneumatology is best understood within the framework of Jewish Chris tian speculation on the "first created" angelic spirits (npCco'tKt1t0ct). On the other hand, I shall advance the discussion by attempting to provide a context for Clement's Engelpneumatologie. This phenomenon (which, I argue, would be better termed "angelomorphic Pneumatology") is ade quately understood only in conjunction with Clement's Spirit Christology and overall binitarian orientation.12 article had appeared in IKZ 55 (1965) 102-120; 56 (1966) 27-47, as a revision of Oeyen's Las potencias de Dios en los dos primeros siglos cristianos, I: Acerca de la Pneumatologia de Clemente Alejandrino (Buenos Aires 1963). 10) Bogdan G.

H) On the presence of Jewish and "Jewish Christian" traditions in these works by Clement, see Jean Dani?lou, "Les traditions secr?tes des Ap?tres," Er]b 31 (1962) 199-215. Through out this essay, the term "Jewish Christian" will be taken in the sense described by Dani?lou in his classic The Theology of Jewish Christianity (London 1964). As long as the narrative of an early and radical parting of the ways between "Christianity" and "Judaism" remains normative, despite its documented inability to explain a great deal of evidence from the first four centuries, the term "Jewish Christianity" remains useful as a description of "Christianity" itself. For more recent treatments of this problem, see the essays collected in The Ways that Never Parted (ed. A. H. Becker, A. Y. Reed; TSAJ 95; T?bingen 2003); Daniel Boyar?n, Borderlines: The Partition offudaeo-Christianity (Philadelphia, Pa. 2004). 12) The Greek text is that of the GCS critical edition (O. St?hlin, L.

Binitarian Monotheism in Clement of Alexandria "Clement's theology was really binitarian"; although "he mentions the Spirit as the agent of Faith in the believer, there would appear to be little real place for Him in his system." 13 This blunt statement by W H. C. Frend calls for some refinement. According to Osborn, even though "the centre of Clement's understanding of God is the reciprocity of father and son," which is similar "to the Platonic simple and complex unity," Clement "sees the reciprocity of father and son proliferated in spirit."14 In other words, Clement's starting-point is a "binitarian" structure, or, in Osborn's language, the "reciprocity of Father and Son." 15 This divine reciprocity is made to "overflow" or "proliferate," so as to account for divine economy, and especially God's spiritual presence in the believers.'6 Osborn highlights the second element, and states, on its basis, that Clement has a " worthy theology of the Holy Spirit" (I will return to this topic in a later section of this paper). Yet, if due consideration is given to the first element, the divine reciprocity of Father and Spirit, which Osborn himself regards as the "cen ter" of Clementine theology, the conclusion can also be different. Clem ent's theological intention is certainly Trinitarian, and can be documented by his use of Trinitarian formulae. Ihe corresponding theological account, however, has not reached the concept of a triadic Father-Son-Spirit "reciprocity." Clement's thought remains determined in large measure by a binitarian framework.17 13) Frend, Martyrdom and Persecution in the Early Church: A Study of a Conflict from the Maccabees to Donatus (Garden City, N.Y. 1967) 264. 14) Osborn, Clement, 107; 117; 128; 150. 15) The term "binitarian" points to a bifurcation of the divinity (as opposed to "unitarian"), while preserving a monotheistic worldview ("binitarian monotheism," as opposed to "dual ism"). The Jewish traditions investigated by Alan Segal (Two Powers In Heaven: Early Rab binic Reports About Christianity and Gnosticism [Leiden 1977]) are examples of binitarianism; one may find such "binitarian" elements echoed in the religious philosophies of Philo and Numenius. Binitarianism is not dualism: "neither the apocalyptic, mystical, nor Christian ized Judaism affirmed two separate deities. They understood themselves to be monotheis tic... Only radical gnosticism posited two different and opposing deities" (Segal, "Dualism in Judaism, Christianity and Gnosticism: A Definitive Issue," in his The Other Judaisms of Late Antiquity [Atlanta, Ga 1987] 13). 16) Osborn, Clement, 150. The Father-Son reciprocity "overflows to the salvation of the world"; this proliferation is "from father and son to spirit and then to the ultimate union of believers in God" (Osborn, Clement, 141; 152). 17) According to Osborn (Clement, 150), Clement's Trinitarian theology is "well-grounded in the Johannine account of the reciprocity of father with spirit and son with spirit</page><page sequence="6">386 B. G. Bucur / Vigiliae Christianae 61 (2007) 381-413 How do we recognize whether a monotheistic text is unitarian, binitar ian, or trinitarian? I find it helpful to apply a principle developed by Larry Hurtado, which can be reduced to the following formula: that which is considered "God" is necessarily the object of worship; and that which is the object of worship is considered "God."'8 It is noteworthy, in this light, that Clement seems reluctant to include the Spirit as a recipient of worship. In the closing chapter of the Instructor (Paed. 3:12:101) invokes God as DiP xxxi tip, ?'V O`R(ixi, Kupte; praise, glory, and worship are given "to the only Father and Son, the Son and Father, the Son-Instructor and Teacher-, together with the Holy Spirit."'9 It may be true that in Clement's thought the Father-Son reciprocity "proliferates from father and son to spirit and then to the ultimate union of believers in God."20 The reference to the Holy Spirit in this text seems nevertheless like a pious afterthought.2' Clement sometimes presents the Father alone receiving praise through the Son and the Holy Spirit.22 More significant are the instances in which Clement suggests a subordination of the Holy Spirit to both the Father and the Son. For instance, in the following passage he quite significantly calls only the Father and the Son "God": "they know not what a 'treasure (John 14:15-20; 16:7-15)," and uses whatever it finds helpful in Middle Platonism (e.g., Ep. 2, 312E). These "building blocks," however, are quite problematic. Ziebritzki (Heiliger Geist und Weltseele) has demonstrated that the Platonic tradition could not contribute in the articulation of the pneumatology of Clement and Origen. With respect to Clement's use of Ep 2 in Strom. 5:14:89, as a proof text for the Trinity, Ziebritzki (Heiliger Geist und Weltseele, 126) observes that Clement "dem Heiligen Geist... keine besondere Rolle zuweist," even while to the Son he ascribes John 1:3 ("by whom all things are made"), and the Father he implies to be the one who made all things through the Logos. As for the Johannine sayings about the "other Paraclete," scholars widely agree, despite the variety of interpretations being proposed, that the blurred relation verging on identity between the exalted Christ and the Holy Spirit as the two paracletes, poses major exegetical and theological problems. I will discuss Clement's views in a separate section of this study. 18) Hurtado, At the Origins of Christian Worship (Grand Rapids, Mich. 1999), and Lord fesus Christ: Devotion tofesus in Earliest Christianity (Grand Rapids, Mich. 2003) esp. 11-53. 19) xco uovco Tiaxpi Kai u?co, d?co Kai rcaip?, 7tai?aycoycp Kai ?i?aoKatap u?co, g?v Kai ico ?y?cp 7tv?iL)uaTi (Paed. 3:12:101). 20) Osborn, Clement, 152. 21) As noted by Ziebritzki, Geist und Weltseele, 124. 22) "To whom [to the Father], by (5ia) His Son Jesus Christ, the Lord of the living and dead, and by (?ia) the Holy Spirit, be glory, honor, power, eternal majesty, both now etc" (Quis Dives 42:20).</page><page sequence="7">B.

On the way to a mature Trinitarian theology, a certain binitarian orientation, coexist ing with Trinitarian formulae, is often noticeable among Christian authors.24 But Clement also illustrates another phenomenon characteristic of early Christian thought, namely the combination of a binitarianism with "Spirit Christology."25 2. Spirit Christology in Clement of Alexandria26 Clement illustrates a widespread phenomenon in early Christian thought, namely the lack of distinction between "Logos" and "Spirit."27 WXhenever he 23) Quis Dives 34:1.

These distinctions are made by Ladaria (El Esp?ritu, 47) and Manlio Simonetti ("Note," 202-203). I find them unnecessary for the present investigation, especially since the problems involved in the procedure are quite evident to Simonetti himself ("Note," 209): these distinctions did not present themselves as such to patristic authors, so that even in cases that appear certain to the modern scholar, there remains a doubt with respect to the precise meaning that patristic authors ascribe to the term Ttveouo;. 27) See Stead, Philosophy in Christian Antiquity, ch. 13: "Logos and Spirit" (148-159).</page><page sequence="8">388 B. G. Bucur / Vigiliae Christianae 61 (2007) 381-413 offers his own theological reflection (as opposed to simply passing on tradi tional formulae of faith), Clement feels free to use "Logos" and "Pneuma" as synonyms, by shifting between them repeatedly and without much explanation.28 In Strom. 5:6, Clement ascribes the divine acts of creation, preservation, and revelation to the "Name," "Son," "Savior," or "Logos." Nevertheless, the latter's role in organizing the cosmos and in prophetic revelation is documented with a quote from 1 Cor 12:11 ("the self-same Holy Spirit works in all"). Moreover, this verse is soon afterwards reworked in a Chris tological key: "God the Savior works ... it is the same Logos which proph esies, and judges, and discriminates all things." There seems to be a perfect parallel between the reference to the Spirit and the reference to the Logos: both are introduced as inspired, prophetic ideas ("the apostles were at once prophets and righteous"; "the oracle exhibits the prophecy which by the Word cries and preaches ... since it is the same Word which prophesies."); both use V?p7y@o; both designate "what is one," and at the same time becomes "what is many." It seems that Clement operates a translation sui generis of Cor 12:11 into his own theological idiom: the "Spirit" men tioned by the Apostle is identified as the Logos. In Excerpta 24:2, a text directed against the dualist views of the Valen tinians, Clement affirms the perfect identity (i.e., an identity of oviicta and &amp;vxgt;) between the Paraclete who is at work (?V?p7CV) in the Church, and the Paraclete who was active (?vrpyiVP Tvti) in the prophets. Implicit here is the identification of this Paraclete with the Logos, because (a) Clem ent had previously affirmed that it was the Logos who worked in the prophets (?Vrpyfa, Excepta 19:2); (b) the adverb "proximately" (cpo6%xC;), 28) Paed. 1:6:43: "the Lord Jesus, the Word of God, that is, the Spirit made flesh." Com menting on the fourth commandment of the Decalogue, Clement explains: "The seventh day, therefore, is proclaimed a rest... preparing for the Primal Day, our true rest; which, in truth, is the first creation of light, in which all things are viewed and possessed_For the light of truth, a light true, casting no shadow, is the Spirit of God indivisibly divided to all_By following Him, therefore, through our whole life, we become impassible; and this is to rest" (Strom. 6:16:138). "Day" and "true Light" are quite transparently referring to Christ (cf. John 1:4-8; 8:56), as becomes clear immediately afterwards, when the text speaks about following Christ. However, the latter's identity is, in this passage, "Spirit of God." Clement is obviously drawing on an archaic Christology designating the pr?existent Christ as TTveujia interchangeably with ?oyo?. See the article by Simonetti, quoted above; Wolf son, Philosophy, 177-256; Cantalamessa, L'omelia in S. Pascha, 181-183. This seems to be a widespread phenomenon, present in Syria-Palestine, Asia Minor, Alexandria, Carthage, and Rome, in authors speaking Latin, Greek and Syriac.</page><page sequence="9">B. G. Bucur / Vigiliae Christianae 61 (2007) 381-413 389 qualifying the action of the Paraclete, functions as a technical term in Clement's description of how the Logos transforms the perfect souls towards godlikeness.29 The same exegetical procedure occurs in Excerpta 17, where Clement discusses the work of the 6"vx.ul; in the world. Here and elsewhere in Clement, 6ivxagt; is a Christological term.30 The Biblical proof texts, how ever, are, once again, references to itvei7ta: John 4:24 ("God is Spirit") and John 3:8 ("He blows wherever He wills"). Clement ends Strom. 4:26:172 with the following words: "I shall pray the Spirit of Christ to wing me (rxi,u4gv TO nv?rai7i toi3 Xputoii ncp&amp;)Gai gt?) to my Jerusalem." A very similar invocation occurs in the hymn to Christ (Paed. 3:12:101): Christ is called upon as the "wing (X?tpOv) of unwandering birds" and "heavenly wing (nT?pO6v o'pV6vtov) of the all-holy flock." The evident parallelism between the invocations in Strom. 4:26:172 and Paed 3:12:101 suggests that "Spirit of Christ" is simply Christ in his function of heavenly guide. At least three determining factors can be pointed out. First, similarly to earlier writers, Clement deploys an all-encompassing theory of the Logos, and thereby inevitably claims for the Logos certain areas of activity tradi tionally associated with the Holy Spirit, namely the inspiration of Scrip ture and the charismatic empowerment of the believer.31 Second, Clement follows the Philonic model of "translating" Scriptural terms and images into philosophical concepts, and "explains" the Biblical nvtv,ua in light of the philosophical "Logos." Finally, the term 6vvaugt; seems to facilitate this tendency, insofar as Clement uses it alternatively for the Logos and the Spirit.32 To sum up: Clement refers often to the "Holy Spirit," but he also uses lvei,4ux to designate the second hypostasis. Similarly to what one finds in 29) Excerpta 27:3; 27:6.1 will discuss the use of 7ipOG?xco? in the section dedicated to Clem ent's cosmology. 30) Strom. 7:2:7, 9; Excerpta 4:2; 12:3.

Ladaria (El Esp?ritu, 25) notes that the Spirits "efficient causality" in the phenomenon of inspiration is equally applied to the Logos or Kyrios, especially in the Instructor, but he does not believe that these coincidences amount to an identification of the Word with the Spirit. 32) Frangoulis (Der Begriff, 16) also makes a brief note to this effect: "[es] findet sich bei Clemens auch eine enge Verbindung von Pneuma und Sohn in dem ?bergeordneten Begriff des Ouvajiic."</page><page sequence="10">390 B. G. Bucur / Vigiliae Christianae 61 (2007) 381-413 other early Christian writers, the distinction between the Logos and the Holy Spirit is blurred.33 But how does Clement himself relate Logos and Spirit? He is clearly not advocating an ontological identification. In a text from the Instructor he states that "the Spirit is the power of the Word." And the blood of the Lord is twofold. For there is the blood of His flesh, by which we are redeemed from corruption; and the spiritual, that by which we are anointed. And to drink the blood of Jesus is to become partaker of the Lord's immortality; for the Spirit is the power of the Word (kiau; &amp;? toi X6'y TO ivxa), as blood is of flesh.34 As Ladaria has rightly observed, the Spirit here is "the power, the dynamic character of the Logos."35 To better understand the relation between Xo6yo; and tvti3j.ux, it will be useful to resort to Clement's own remarkably clear and detailed explanations: the dynamic aspect of the Logos manifests itself in the work of angelic spirits. 3. Angelomorphic Pneumatology in Clement of Alexandria Before moving on to the crucial texts in the Excerpta, Eclogae and Adum brationes,36 two additional elements must complete our underrstanding of Clement's theological framework: a hierarchical cosmology, and a complex articulation between divine unity and the multiplicity of the cosmos. I will show that these two elements provide the basis for a specific theory of prophetic inspiration, which is best accounted for by Oeyen's thesis of "Engelpneumatologie" in Clement of Alexandria. 33) E.g., Justin, Apol. 1:33:6: "It is wrong, therefore, to understand 'the Spirit and the power of God' [in Luke 1:35] as anything else than the Word, who is also the first-born of God, as the foresaid prophet Moses declared; and it was this which, when it came upon the virgin and overshadowed her, caused her to conceive." The same view is repeated in Apol. 1:46:5 and 1:66:2. 34) /W2:2:19-20 (ANF, modified). 35) Ladaria, El Esp?ritu, 50, 266. 36) Oeyen drew most of his textual evidence from the Excerpta, the Adumbrationes and the Eclogae Propheticae. Ladaria (El Esp?ritu, 256) concedes that certain passages in which the Spirit is "personified" as angelic "powers" can be taken as examples (muestras) of "angel Pneumatology," but argues that these are only "a brief appendix" to the vast pool of other passages relevant for Clement's Pneumatology. In other words, the passages from the Excerpta, Adumbrationes and Eclogae Propheticae should be treated as a secondary witness.

Clement on Divine Unity and the Cosmic Multiplicity Unity and Multiplicity in the Logos Strom. 4:25:156, "the decisive passage for the doctrine of the trinity in Clement,"37 speaks of the utterly transcendent God and the Logos as his agent. The difference between Father and Son is very similar to Numenius' distinction between the first and the second god: God cannot be the object of any epistemology (OCVwOt&amp;6&amp;tKtio; OVK i6ttV Ent?16XoVtK65), while the exact opposite is true of the Son (o(pta t ?6X1 Ka iA iatiYij.; &amp;ir6&amp;i41v ?%?1). This difference on the epistemological level corresponds to a different relation to the cosmos, where it is the Son who founds multiplicity: The Son is neither simply one thing as one thing ('?V d0; '?V), nor many things as parts (nokkXa i; g pf), but one thing as all things (X5 m6vtct '?V).38 In this statement, Clement surveys the following theoretical possibilities: (a.) absolute unity, in no way connected to multiplicity ('?V 6C ; ?V); (b.) absolute multiplicity, in no way connected to unity (toXX&amp;a 60; g?pll); (c.) unity qua multiplicity (d; i6v'ra ?EV). Clement embraces the third option as the most appropriate account of the Son's activity: the Son founds the multiplicity of creation, but this multiplicity, being founded by the same one principle can be eventually reduced to Logos. It is in this sense that "the Word is called the Alpha and the Omega, of whom alone the end becomes beginning, and ends again at the original beginning."39 All of this seems fairly clear in light of the philosophical tradition,40 which Clement received both directly and indirectly, via Philo.41 But what are we to make of the following affirmation: 37) Osborn, Clement, 151. 38) Strom. 4:25:156. 39) Sm? . 4:25:157. 40) "According to Posidonius and Philo, the cosmos was governed by a system of powers, which took the place of the forms of Plato and the immanent logos of the earlier Stoics" (Osborn, Clement, 152); cf. Osborn, The Philosophy of Clement of Alexandria (Cambridge 1957) 41: Clement "explained the existence and nature of things by 'powers' just as Plato had done by 'forms' and the earlier Stoics had done by immanent reason or divine fire." Salvatore R. C. Lilla (Clement of Alexandria: A Study in Christian Platonism and Gnosticism [London 1971] 205) thinks that Clement may have come across speculations about unity and diversity in Neopythagorean interpretations of the Parmenides. 41) Lilla (Clement, 204) notes that "Clement found already formed in Philo the doctrine of the Logos as the totality of powers which are identical with the ideas." For relevant passages in Philo, see Lilla, Clement, 205.</page><page sequence="12">392 B. G. Bucur / Vigiliae Christianae 61 (2007) 381-413 all the powers of the spirit, taken together as one thing, find their perfection in the same, that is, in the Son... He [the Son] is the circle of all powers rolled and united into one.42 The simple equation of the "powers" with the Platonic ideas does not account for the complexity of this text. Both Lilla and Osborn suggest in passing that the Biblical doctrine of angelic powers may also have influenced Clement.43 Following Oeyen, one can say confidently that Clement is fus ing the Logos-speculation with an established teaching on the "powers of the spirit" that originated in Jewish or Jewish Christian speculation about angelic "powers."44 It is significant in this respect that Clement immedi ately quotes the Book of Revelation: "the Word is called the Alpha and the Omega...." (Rev 1:8; also 21:6; 22:13). What he has in mind is surely the throne-visions of Revelation, depicting the seven spirits or angels in atten dance before the throne (Rev 1:4; 8:2).45 Following Oeyen, I submit that "powers of the Spirit" alludes here to the seven spirits in Revelation, and that Clement subjects traditional Jewish Christian material to the spiritualizing interpretation and the Logos theology inherited from Philo. It seems clear, in light of this overlapping of 42) rc?oai ?? ai 8\)va|i?i? tov Tiveuiiaxo? cruM,r|?8r|v jx?v ev ti rcp?cyua yevojievai cruvT??,oucnv e?? to auto, x?v m?v... k?kXoc y?p ? a?x?c rcaocov tcov 8i)v?u?cov ei? ?v e?^ouji?vcov Kai ?vouji?vcov (Strom. 4:25:156). 43) Lilla, Clement, 204, n. 3: "Clement may have believed in the identity between angels, the ideas, and the powers of God"; Osborn, Clement, 152: "A still stronger influence on Clement was the concept of the manifold powers of the spirit in the Old Testament and especially in Paul (1 Cor 12)." 44) It is noteworthy that this time Clement moves from ?,oyo? to rcve?ua, that is, he intro duces 7W?\)ua into the philosophical speculation on the Logos. 45) The majority position in patristic and scholarly interpretation of these passages is to connect the seven spirits/ eyes/ lamps of the Lord in Revelation with the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit (Isa 11:2 LXX, Prov 8:12-16). A second opinion argues that the seven spirits are the seven angels of the presence (Tob 12:15; 1 En 90:20-21). This position is defended by Joseph Michl (Die Engelvorstellungen in der Apokalypse des hl. fohannes [Munich 1937]), and David E. Aune (Revelation [Dallas, Tx. 1997] 33-35) with an impressive arsenal of primary and secondary literature. Among the patristic voices, it is quite significant that Cassiodorus' commentary on Revelation echoes the theology of the Adumbrationes: the blessing "from the seven spirits" (Rev 1:4) is said to come from the seven archangels men tioned in Tob 12:15, and the seven spirits before the divine throne in Rev 4:1 are equated with the same seven angels of God (Complexiones 2). This is hardly surprising, since it was the same Cassiodorus who commissioned the Latin translation from Clement's Hypotyposes, the Adumbrationes (see Cassiodorus' report in his Institutions 1:8:4).</page><page sequence="13">B. G. Bucur / Vigiliae Christianae 61 (2007) 381-413 393 doctrinal frameworks, that "powers" do hold an important place in Clem ent's account of reality.46 In the following section I propose additional evi dence for this assertion. Unity and Multiplicity in the Spirit In Strom. 5:6, Clement provides an allegorical interpretation of the Old Testament Temple and its furnishings, an enterprise in which he is by no means unique, since Barnabas before him, and Origen and Cyril of Alex andria afterwards, are engaged in the very same project. In the following I confine myself to the menorah, the cherubim, and the twelve stones. Clement's exegesis follows a recognizable pattern. He introduces the object of interpretation, offers a first level of explanation, then a second one. The first level of explanation is astrological: the lamp signifies "the motions of the seven planets that perform their revolutions towards the south," the cherubim signify the two bears, or the two hemispheres, and the twelve wings and twelve stones describe for us the circle of the zodiac.47 Clement then offers a second level of interpretation, directly related to Christ: the lamp conveys a "symbol of Christ," the twelve stones are dis cussed in reference to the Lord, the Word, the Holy Spirit, etc. The "eighth region" mentioned in the interpretation of the cherubim refers to the place above the seven heavens, and we can assume that this is where he would picture the enthroned Christ. The interpretations of the lamp, the cheru bim, and the stones are very similar, in that they all deal with the relation between unity and multiplicity. In the symbolic description of the lamp, Christ represents "what is one," while "the seven eyes of the Lord" and "the seven spirits" stand for "what is many." In the description of the cherubim, "the eighth region," "the world of thought," and "God," represent "what is 46) David T. Runia ("Clement of Alexandria and the Philonic Doctrine of the Divine Power[s]," VigChr 58 [2004] 256-276) holds that "Clement transfers the full weight of the cosmic powers onto Christ the Logos," so that "the role of these powers in Clement's thought is very limited" (268-269). 47) This interpretation is not Clement's own creation, and his allusion to "some" others who interpret the cherubim as images of the zodiac may be extrapolated to the other two ele ments. Philo has a very similar interpretation of the cherubim (Cherubim VIL21-24). For a comprehensive survey of Clement's debt to Philo in his exegesis of the Temple, the vest ments and the high priest, see Annewies van den Hoek, Clement of Alexandria and His Use of Philo in the Stromateis: an Early Christian Reshaping of a Jewish Model (Leiden-New York 1988)116-147.</page><page sequence="14">394 B. G. Bucur / Vigiliae Christianae 61 (2007) 381-413 one," while the zodiac, the time, and the world of sense represent "what is many."48 Finally, in the interpretation of the stones, "the one and the self same Holy Spirit," "the Lord," "the Savior," "the Word" stand for "what is one," while "the whole world," and "all things" represent "what is many." The cosmological scheme at work here seems to consist of "the invisible God" (who is only alluded to, because he is beyond the dialectic of one/ many), the Son/Word/Savior as principle of all things, and the multiplicity of things. One may wonder what place this account leaves for the Holy Spirit. As has become clear from the discussion of Strom. 5:6 in the section on Spirit Christology, Clement does not neglect or avoid speaking about the Holy Spirit in this fragment. On the contrary, he even chooses to intro duce a tvri4to reference (1 Cor 12:1 1: "the self-same Holy Spirit works in all") as proof text for his otherwise purely Christological discussion. As I have shown, in the interpretation of the twelve stones, tvei3icc designates the Word. On the other hand, in the interpretation of the lamp, "spirits" refers to the seven spirits, the eyes of the Lord. These are presumably the seven "first-born princes of the angels (oi npwt67ovoi y77yXwv &amp;pxovtc;) who have the greatest power."49 What is the relation between the nvcii4go as Logos, and the first created angelic nvE o6ata? The following passage may offer an answer: The golden lamp conveys another enigma as a symbol of Christ... in his casting light, "at sundry times and diverse manners," on those who believe in Him and hope and see by means of the ministry of theprotoctists (&amp;tx S'ci; t&amp;v 7TpcooC'cTwKT60V txaKovoc;). And they say that the seven eyes of the Lord are the seven spirits rest ing on the rod that springs from the root of Jesse.50 Clement draws here on a series of Biblical passages (Isa 11:1-2; Zech 4:2, 10; Rev 1:4; Rev 5:6; Rev 8:2) that might have already been combined by earlier tradition.51 Isaiah's seven gifts of the Holy Spirit are Zechariahs 48) To indicate "what is many" in the case of the cherubim, I had to introduce elements from the first level of interpretation, because the interpretation switches from the cherubim to the ark, and the idea of multiplicity remains to be conveyed by the twelve wings. 49) Strom. 6:16:142-143. 50) Strom. 5:6:35.

G. Bucur / Vigiliae Christianae 61 (2007) 381-413 395 seven spirits (eyes of the Lord), understood as the seven "first born" angels, the protoctists. Consistent with the Christological framework in which he places the Old Testament prophecies and theophanies throughout his writ ings, Clement sees the seven angelic spirits as exercising a certain 8&amp;ocKovUa by which the Logos is imparted to the world, and in this sense being sub ordinated to the Logos.52 The cosmological aspect of this activity consists in the move from unity to multiplicity, by which the Logos establishes "what is many" in creation: the one "Spirit" (the Logos) relates to "seven spirits" in the same way that Logos relates to the "powers" in Strom. 4:25:156. Equally important is the theognoseological aspect of the discussion. The Logos, who intrinsically possesses the perfect vision of God, passes this vision on to creation by the ministry of the protoctists (Strom. 5:6:35). Clement seems to suppose the sequence Father-Son-protoctists. Confirmation of this idea, and a fairly detailed description of the multi layered cosmos, is provided by the Excerpta. 3.2. Clement's "Celestial Hierarchy" The title of this section is deliberately anachronistic, borrowing from the vocabulary of the much later Ps-Dionysius Areopagites. Even if the term "hierarchy" was coined by this anonymous late fifth century author, whose writings mark the confluence of Christian theology and late Neoplatonism, it is perfectly legitimate to use it in a discussion of a second-century Chris tian author who makes heavy use of Middle Platonism. Obviously, I do not use "hierarchy" for the relation between Father and Son. As Osborn has noted, Clement's view of the Father-Son relation, derived from the Fourth Gospel, and expressed with the help of Middle Platonic duality between God and Intellect, is different from the later Plotinian "hierarchy" in which the One utterly transcends Mind.53 "Hierarchy" and "hierarchi cal" are instead appropriate designations for the multi-storied cosmos characteristic of apocalyptic writings such as the Ascension of Isaiah, 2 Enoch or the Epistula Apostolorum. In the case of Ps.-Dionysius, the 52) It is noteworthy that the brief quotation from Heb 1:1 ("at sundry times and diverse manners") is also subtly molded into an explicitly Christological affirmation: the one speak ing "at sundry times and diverse manners" to the fathers is, originally, "God"; Clement, however, speaks about Christ casting his light "at sundry times and diverse manners." 53) Osborn, Clement, 107, 115, 117, 118, 122, 131.</page><page sequence="16">396 B. G. Bucur / Vigiliae Christianae 61 (2007) 381-413 hierarchy is not one among other features of his worldview: the hierarchy is the world.54 For Clement, Christ has turned the world into an ocean of blessings.... Ihe whole of the new creation is a saving activity. Every part does something to carry the world forward and to lift it higher. It is saving and being saved. Its hierarchy expands the Platonic world of forms. It is powerful as the energeia of God. The world culminates in the ever-present word whose light penetrates everywhere and casts no shadow.55 Aside from the use of "hierarchy," Osborn's beautiful description is unmis takably "Dionysian." It was, after all, the Ps-Areopagite that defined the hierarchy as "a sacred order, and knowledge, and activity (FV?pyrxa)" (Celes tial Hierarchy 3:1, 164 D)! Generally speaking, however, the similarity between the Clementine and Dionysian "hierarchies" is only seldom dis cussed in modern scholarship.56 This is quite different from what one finds in the sixth-century scholiast of the Corpus Dionysiacum, John of Scythop olis, who tries to bring into harmony the Dionysian and the Clementine angelic hierarchies.57 It should be noted, finally, that the centrality of the hierarchically ordered universe and its denizens was an important "archaiz ing" feature of the Ps.-Dionysian work, subordinated to one of the likely goals of this "New Testament pseudepigraphon"-namely the subversion 54) Cf.

Bucur / Vigiliae Christianae 61 (2007) 381-413 397 of similar apocalyptic imagery (and associated doctrines) among compet ing groups in Christianity.58 I now return to Clement of Alexandria's "celestial hierarchy." In Excerpta 10, 11, and 27 and Eclogae 56-57, Clement presents it as a theological tradition inherited from the "elders."59 Having at its pinnacle the Logos, the spiritual universe features, in descending order, the seven protoctists, the archangels, and the angels.60 The orienting principle (apvn) of the hierarchy is the "Face of God"-a theme whose prominence in the apocalyptic literature of Second Temple Judaism was only amplified with the emergence of Christianity.61 For 58) The argument is made by Golitzin, "Dionysius Areopagita: A Christian Mysticism?," ProEcclesia 12 (2003) 161-212, esp. 178. 59) The fact that Clement's strictly hierarchical universe goes back to earlier tradition has been demonstrated by older research: Paul Collomp, "Une source de Cl?ment d'Alexandrie et des Hom?lies Pseudo-Cl?mentines," RPh 37 (1913) 19-46; Wilhelm Bousset, J?disch christlicher Schulbetrieb in Alexandria und Rom: Literarische Untersuchungen zu Philo und Clemens von Alexandria, Justin und Iren?us (G?ttingen 1915). Despite the pertinent cri tique of some of Bousset's conclusions (Johannes Munck, Untersuchungen ?ber Klemens von Alexandria [Stuttgart 1933] 127-204), the thesis of a Jewish and Jewish-Christian literary source behind Clement remains solidly established: Kretschmar, Trinit?tstheologie, 68, n. 3; Dani?lou, "Les traditions secr?tes des Ap?tres," 214; Roncaglia, "Pant?ne et le Didascal?e d'Alexandrie: du jud?o-christianisme au christianisme hell?nistique," in A Tribute to Arthur V??bus: Studies inEarly Christian Literature and its Environment, Primarily in the Syrian East (ed. R. H. Fischer; Chicago 1977) 211-233; Osborn, Clement, 102. 60) Since God is neither an accident (cxuu?e?riKOc), nor described by anything accidental (Strom. 5:12:81), he is beyond the hierarchy, and should not be counted as the first of five hierarchical levels (pace Collomp, "Une source," 24; Oeyen, Engelpneumatologie, 20; Zieb ritzki, Heiliger Geist undWeltseele, 121). To designate the Father, Clement repeatedly alludes to the famous Platonic "beyond ousia" (e7t?K?iva ttjc o?a?ac, Rep 509B), which had been already appropriated by Justin (e7ieK?iva rc?oTJc o?o?ac, Dial 4:1). God is one and beyond the one and the monad (Paed. 1:8:71), and beyond cause (x? ?rc?iceiva amov, Strom. 7:2:2). 61) C. L. Seow, "Face," in Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible (ed. K. van der Toorn, B. Becking, P. W. van der Horst; Leiden-Boston 1999) 322-325. According to Andrei Orlov (TheEnoch-Metatron Tradition [TSAJ 107; T?bingen 2005] 153, 279), early Enochic texts, such as 1 Enoch, Jubilees, Genesis Apocryphon, or the Book of Giants, make little use of "face" imagery; however, in the context of an ongoing polemic against other Jewish traditions of divine mediatorship, later Enochic booklets?2 Enoch, 3 Enoch?produce extensive reflections on the Face. For a theological evaluation of the theme of the Face in the Pseudepigrapha, see Orlov, The Enoch-Metatron Tradition, and his articles "Exodus 33 on God's Face: A Lesson From the Enochic Tradition" and "The Face as the Heavenly Counterpart of the Visionary in the Slavonic Ladder of Jacob? republished in his From Apocalypticism to Merkabah Mysticism: Studies in the Slavonic Pseudepigrapha (JSJ 114; Leiden 2006) 311-325, 399-419. See also April DeConick, "Heavenly Temple</page><page sequence="18">398 B. G. Bucur / Vigiliae Christianae 61 (2007) 381-413 Clement, "the Face of God is the Son."62 To describe the continual propa gation of light from the Face down to the lowest level of existence (the divine oiKovogtoc), Clement uses the adverb "proximately" (npo6%x5;), to suggest the lack of any interval between the levels: each rank of spiritual entities is "moved" by the one above it, and will, in turn, "move" the immediately lower level.63 The advancement on the cosmic ladder leads to the progres sive transformation of one level into the next, an idea for which Clement offers a highly complex account.64 Ihe first level of celestial entities contemplating the Face are the angels "first created" (tpt6)0KtlaT0t). These protoctists are seven (identified with the "seven eyes of the Lord" in Zech 4:10, Rev 5:6), but they are simulta neously characterized by unity and multiplicity: ... even while they are distinct in number, and individually defined and circum scribed, the similarity of [their] state nevertheless points to [their] unity, equality and being alike. Among the seven, there has not been given more to the one and less to the other; nor is any of them lacking in advancement (RtpoKo1nl); [they] have received perfection from the beginning, at the first [moment of their] com ing into being, from God through the Son.65 Clement's protoctists echo Jewish and Christian traditions about the high est angelic company.66 On the other hand, the protoctists also represent the Traditions and Valentinian Worship: A Case for First-Century Christology in the Second Century," in The Jewish Roots of Christological Monotheism (ed. C. C. Newman, J. R. Davila, G.S. Lewis; JSJ 63; Leiden 1999) 308-341, esp. 327-329. 62) Excerpta 10:6; Excerpta 12:1. April DeConick ("Heavenly Temple Traditions," 325) states that "the image of the Son as the Father's Face may have played a significant role in Valentinian theologies." However, the repeated occurrence of the same designation in Clement of Alexandria (Paed. 1:57 and 1:124:4, Strom. 7:58, as well as in Tertullian (Adv. Prax. 14), suggests that "Face" as a Christological title was at least as popular in mainstream Christianity as it was in Valentinian tradition. 63) Cf. the veiled description in Strom. 6:16:148: "the operative power (fj 8paGXiKT| ?v?pyeia) is imparted by descent through those that are moved successively (8ia xcov 7ipoo?xeax?pov Kivo-ujievcov)." 64) See Collomp, "Une source," 23-24; Oeyen, Engelpneumatologie, 8-9, 12; Bucur, "The Other Clement: Cosmic Hierarchy." 65) Excerpta 10:3-4.1 use two different words for ?uoi?xr|c ("similarity" and "being alike"), because our post-Nicene theological bias would automatically weaken the bearing of this word in Clement. The second time he uses ?uoi?xnc, Clement has in mind "being like" as opposed to "being unlike," not to "being the same as." 66) The group of seven is found in Ezekiel 9:2-3 (seven angelic beings, of which the seventh is more important than the other six), Tob 12:15 (seven "holy angels" who have access</page><page sequence="19">B.

I noted earlier that the cosmological scheme described in Strom. 5:6 or in the Excerpta seems to reserve no place to the Holy Spirit: in descending order, one reads about the Father, the Son, and the protoctists. Le Boulluec synthesizes what we know about this group of seven superior angelic beings.67 He does not, however, discuss the relation between the seven protoctists and the Holy Spirit. This problem constitutes, instead, the heart of Oeyen's contribution, which I will present and discuss in the following pages. It has now become possible to approach the fundamental question, namely the thesis of an "angelic" Pneumatology in Clement of Alexandria. 3.3. Clement's Theory of Prophetic Inspiration Clement is aware of the two major functions traditionally ascribed to the Holy Spirit, namely the inspiration of Old Testament prophets and the before the Glory, where they present the prayers of "the saints"), and 1 Enoch (ch. 20: seven archangels; ch. 90:21, "the seven first snow-white ones"). The notion of "first created" is important to the author of Jubilees: the angels of the presence are said to be circumcised from their creation on the second day, thus possessing a certain perfection and functioning as heavenly models and final destination of the people of Israel (Jub 2:2; 15:27). The Prayer of Joseph seems to imply that Israel ranks higher than the seven archangels, as chief captain and first minister before the face of God. Among Christian texts, Revelation mentions seven spirits / angels before the divine throne (1:4; 3:1; 4:5; 5:6; 8:2), and the Shepherd of Hermas knows of a group of seven consisting of the six "first created ones" (ftpcoTOi KTurG?Vce?) who accompany the Son of God as their seventh (Vis 3:4:1; Sim 5:5:3). The sermon De centesima, sexag?sima, tric?sima (dates for this text are ranging from late second to the fourth century) states that God first created seven angelic princes out of fire (cf. 2 En 29:3), and later made one of the seven into his Son. For the text, see Richard Reitzenstein, "Eine fr?hchristliche Schrift von den dreierlei Fr?chten des christlichen Lebens," ZNW 15 (1914) 60-90, here 82. Among later Jewish writings, 3 En 10:2-6 mentions that Metatron is exalted above the "eight great princes" who bear the divine Name. Pirk? de Rabbi Eliezer (iv:23), a work composed around 750 CE, but incorporating material going back to the Pseudepigrapha, combines the number seven and the idea of "first created." 67) Derived from Jewish speculation on the various angelic ranks in Second Temple Juda ism (e.g., Tob 12:15; 1 En 90:20), identified with Paul's "thrones" (Col 1:16) in Eclogae 57:1), Clement's protoctists are the highest angelic rank, comparable to the 7ipcoxoi KTioG?vre? of the Shepherd of Hermas (Vis 3:4:1; Sim 5:5:3). See Le Boulluec, "Commen taire," 143. Oeyen identifies the protoctists with the particular angelic rank called "powers," in Justin Martyr, Clement, and Origen (Oeyen, Engelpneumatologie, 28-30, and "Die Lehre von den g?ttlichen Kr?ften bei Justin," Studia Patr?stica 11 (1972) 214-221.</page><page sequence="20">400 B.

He affirms, for instance, that the Logos "tunes" the world the great cosmos, as well as the human microcosm-by the Holy Spirit, OC7&amp;.) nVDgcti (Protr 1:5:3). Osborn finds, nevertheless, that inasmuch as Clement (and Origen) articulate a robust doctrine of divine presence in the world, they possess a "worthy theology of the Holy Spirit."69 There is noth ing I disagree with in this statement. However, what exactly Clement understood by "the Logos through the Spirit" becomes clear only in his account of prophecy in the Eclogae and Adumbrationes-that is, precisely in those texts that Osborn (and Clementine scholarship, generally) tends to ignore. The heavens proclaim the glory of God (Ps. 18:2). By "heavens" are designated in manifold ways both "the heavens" pertaining to distance and cycle [= the sky; my note], and the proximate operation (vtVpyeux mpoGe%15) of the first-created angels, which pertains to covenant. For the covenantswerewrought (vi pyi"jlOav) by the visitation of angels, namely those upon Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. For, moved by the Lord, the first-created angels worked in (&amp;vtfpyouv ?i;) the angels that are close to the prophets, as they are telling the "glory of God," [namely] the covenants. But the works accomplished by the angels on earth also came about for "the glory of God," through the first-created angels. So, [the fol lowing] are called "heavens": in a primary sense, the Lord; but then also the first created [angels]; and with them also the holy persons [that lived] before the Law, as well as the patriarchs, and Moses and the prophets, and finally the apostles.70 68) "The Holy Spirit, by Isaiah, denounces..." (Paed. 2:1:8); "the Holy Spirit, uttering His voice by Amos" (Paed2:2:30); "the Spirit prophesies by Zephaniah" (Paed. 2:12:126); "the Spirit [says] by Solomon" (Paed. 2:12:129). In Excerpta 24:2, Clement affirms the perfect identity (i.e., an identity of ouaia and Suvaui?) between the Paraclete that is working (evepycov) in the Church, and the Paraclete who was active (evepynoavxi) in the prophets. See my analysis above. 69) Osborn, Clement, 152-153: "The activity of the spirit in the created world, as it has been renewed by Christ's recapitulation, is more direct than in other accounts"; [Clement and Ori gen] "had... a real doctrine of the continuity and energy of God's working in the world? that is a worthy theology of the Holy Spirit. Clement may have assigned to the Logos the functions of the Spirit; Origen may have failed to discriminate between the functions of the second and third Persons of the Trinity: but both of them had the root of the matter in their lives and in their thought. For them the constant vitalizing activity of God at work in his world was the essential element of their teaching." 70) Eclogae 51-52.</page><page sequence="21">B. G. Bucur / Vigiliae Christianae 61 (2007) 381-413 401 It is clear that the explanations above presuppose the hierarchical world view presented in Excerpta 10, 11, and 27. Prophecy occurs when the Logos moves the first rank of the protoctists, and this movement is trans mitted from one level of the angelic hierarchy down to the next. The low est angelic rank, which is the one closest to the human world, transmits the "movement" to the prophet.71 Through a sort of telescoping effect, the first mover-the Logos-is simultaneously far removed from the effect of prophecy and immediately present. This principle of "mediated immedi acy" becomes evident when Clement says that Jude refers the action of a lower angel ("an angel near us") to a superior angelic entity, the archangel Michael;72 or when "Moses calls on the power of the angel Michael through an angel near to himself and of the lowest degree (vicinum sibi et infimum) ."73 Ultimately, the action of inspiration must be referred to the original mover, the Logos, since Clement also applies the outlined theory of angelic medi ation to the prophetic call of Samuel (1 Sam 3), where the text repeatedly mentions the Lord or the voice of the Lord.74 71) Following the logic of the text, one could say that the prophet represents the highest level in the human hierarchy. A few centuries later, the Ps.-Areopagite will assign this posi tion to the bishop. Clement, instead, seems much closer on this issue to the Shepherd of Hermas (Mand 11:9), for whom the point of contact between the inspiring angel and the community of believers is the prophet, or to the Book of Revelation. In the latter, the state ment about the angel being "a fellow servant" with the prophet (repeated in Rev 19:10 and 22:8-9) may serve, on the one hand, to correct any angelolatric tendencies; but, on the other hand, "John's purpose was... perhaps, to claim for his brothers a certain primacy in the affairs of churches" (Martin Kiddle, The Revelation ofSt.fohn [London 1963] 449); see also Hanna Roose, "Das Zeugnis fesu": seine Bedeutung fur die Christologie, Eschatologie und Proph?tie in der Offenbarung des Johannes (T?bingen 2000) 202-208; Pierre Prigent, Com mentary on the Apocalypse of St. John (T?bingen 2001) 529-533. 72) "When the archangel Michael, disputing with the devil, was arguing over the body of Moses.' This confirms the Assumption of Moses. 'Michael' here designates the one who argued with the devil through an angel close to us" (Adumbrationes in Jude 9). 73) Adumbrationes in 1 John 2:1. This principle of "mediated immediacy," by which Clem ent explains away Biblical passages in which a higher angelic being (e.g., the archangel Michael) is said to interact with humans, instead of an angel of "lower" degree, is strikingly similar to how Ps.-Dionysius explains why Isa 6:1 affirms that Isaiah was "initiated" by a Seraph (CelestialHierarchy 13:1, 300B). 74) Adumbrationes in 1 John 2:1. It is significant that the same idea is alluded to in the Stromateis, yet in a much more veiled manner. Speaking about the theophany on Mount Sinai, Clement says the following: "But there being a cloud and a lofty mountain, how is it not possible to hear a different sound, the nv?.X)\ia being moved by the active cause (rcve-ouaxoc Kivot)|i?vo\) 8i? xfj? evepyovoric aixia?)?...

Bucur / Vigiliae Christianae 61 (2007) 381-413 In this light, it becomes clear how Clement understands the traditional statements about the Logos speaking in the prophets &amp;yipt irvw5?tDt, as in Protr 1:5:3, quoted above: the prophet experienced the presence and mes sage of the Logos by receiving the "energy" by the proximate angel.75 It appears, overall, that "the constant vitalizing activity of God at work in his world" was, indeed, as Osborn noted, an essential element of Clement's thought. What must be added, however, is that when it came to such deeply traditional elements as prophecy, Clement also had recourse to the traditional angelic imagery inherited from the "elders." 3.4. Clement's Understanding of "Spirit of Christ"and "Paraclete" Clement's Adumbrationes, Excerpta and Eclogae provide an interesting interpretation of the fundamental concepts of Christian Pneumatology: "Spirit of Christ" and "Paraclete." "Spirit of Christ" It is thereby made clear that the prophets conversed with Wisdom, and that there was in them the "Spirit of Christ," in the sense of "possession by Christ," and "subjection to Christ" (secundum possessionem et subiectionem Christi). For the Lord works through archangels and through angels that are close (per... propin quos angelos), who are called "the Spirit of Christ" (qui Christi vocantur spiri tus).76 ... He says, "Blessed are you, because there rests upon you that which is of his glory, and of God's honor and power, and who is His Spirit. This "his" is pos without shape, the power of the Word, the luminous word of the Lord, the truth from heaven, from above, coming to the assembly of the Church, worked by the luminous imme diate ministry (?i? cpcoieivfic T^? koogexov? ?iaicovia? ?vr|pyei)" (Strom. 6:3:34, ANF slightly revised). To anyone not previously familiar with the doctrine of inspiration pre sented above, several important elements can easily go unnoticed: Christ ("the luminous Word" cf. SC 446: 130, n. 3) is the active cause of the theophany; he works through the immediate ministry; conversely, the "wind" is "moved" by him. Since he is using "ministry" and "immediate," Clement probably interprets what he calls "the descent of God," and "manifestation of the divine Power" (Strom. 6:3:32) in light of Acts 7:35, 38 and 53, as an angelic manifestation, and an angelic giving of the law. Thus, 7CV?\)|Lia here is signaling the presence of the angelic spirit. 75) The same phenomenon applies to the gift of philosophy to the pagans: the Logos "gave philosophy to the Greeks by means of the inferior angels," o?a xcov imo?eecrc?pcov ?yy??cov (Strom. 7:2:6). 76) Spiritus Christi could, in theory, be translated as a plural ("spirits of Christ"); but Clem ent is here expanding on 1 Pet 4:14, ? too 0?ou 7tve?)|Lia ?cp 'rjfia? ?varcaDExai.</page><page sequence="23">B.

For a comparison with the way in which Clement approached this problem in the Stromata, it is instructive to look at the exegesis of Gen 15:5-6 (Abraham meeting the three heavenly visi tors) in the following text: ... on looking up to heaven, whether it was that he saw the Son in the spirit, as some explain, or a glorious angel, or in any other way recognized God to be supe rior to the creation ... he receives in addition the Alpha, the knowledge of the one and only God, and is called Abraam, having, instead of a natural philosopher, become wise, and a lover of God.80 Clearly, Clement eludes any detailed explanation of what happened. He suggests a certain disagreement with other exegetes, who posit a direct manifestation of the Logos. In light of the theory of prophecy discussed above, the choice between Abraham seeing the Logos, and Abraham con versing with an angel represents, indeed, a false alternative: what Abraham saw was neither the Logos, nor a glorious angel, but rather the Logos in the angelic spirit.8 77) Adumbrationes in 1 Pet 2:3; Adumbrationes in 1 Pet 4:14. 78) Oeyen (Engelpneumatologie, 27-28) and Hauschild (Gottes Geist, 79) identify the "angeli propinqui" with the protoctists. This interpretation appears to miss half of Clement's inten tion: the prophetic inspiration is, indeed, worked out through the protoctists, who are "close" to the Son; yet the movement is further transmitted in the same way to the archan gels, who are "close" to the protoctists, and the angels, who are "close" to the archangels. Finally, the lowest angelic rank is the last element in the chain of prophetic inspiration: this is, for Clement, the "spirit" that rests upon the prophets. 79) For a discussion of the variant reading of 1 Pet 4:14, see Zahn, Forschungen III: 95, n. 11; Oeyen, Engelpneumatologie, 28, n. 24; Michael Mees, Die Zitate aus dem Neuen Testament bei Clemens von Alexandrien (Quaderni di "Vetera Christianorum" 2; Bari 1970) 1:179-180,11:242. 80) Strom. 5:1:8. 81) Oeyen discusses this passage in Engelpneumatologie, 18-19.</page><page sequence="24">404 B. G. Bucur / Vigiliae Christianae 61 (2007) 381-413 "Paraclete" I have-already shown that the "Paraclete" was implicitly identified with the Logos in Excerpta 24:2, where Clement affirms the perfect identity between the Paraclete that is working (V?pEyOV) in the Church, and the Paraclete who was active (?V?p7ylGavtI) in the prophets. The Adumbrationes provide further details about the Paraclete: The things of old (vetera) that were wrought through the prophets, and are con cealed from most, are now revealed to you through the evangelists. "For to you," it says, " have these things been revealed (manifestata sunt) through the Holy Spirit who was sent," that is, the Paraclete, of whom the Lord said, "Unless I depart, He will not come"; "unto whom," it is said, "the angels desire to look"-not the fallen angels, as most suspect; rather, as is true and godly, the angels who desire to attain to the contemplation of His perfection (prospectum perfectionis illius). 82 This passage reinforces Clement's identification of the Church's Paraclete Spirit with the Spirit already manifested in Old Testament prophetic inspira tion. The Paraclete sent to the Church is at the same time an object of contemplation for the angels. This evokes the hierarchical universe described in the Excerpta. Ihere, however, the angels are contemplating the protoctists, who are mediating to them the light of the divine Face. To make things even more ambiguous, the passage above follows immediately after Clement's affirmation that Christ's spirit in the prophets must be under stood in the sense of "possession by Christ," which later on is explained as "Christ working through archangels and angels who are close to us." The exact relation between Christ, the Paraclete, and the protoctists becomes clearer in light of the discussion of the Paraclete references in the Adumbra tiones in 1 John 2:1 ("But if anyone does sin, we have a paraclete with the Father, namely Jesus Christ"): Just as the Lord is a Paraclete for us with the Father, so also is He a Paraclete whom He [scil. the Lord] has deigned to send after His Ascension. For these primitive and first-created powers, unchangeable according to substance, effect divine oper ations together with the subordinate angels and archangels whose names they share (hae namque primitivae virtutes ac primo creatae, inmobiles exsistentes secun dum substantiam, cum subiectis angelis et archangelis, cum quibus vocantur equivoce, diversas operationes efflciunt).83 82) Adumbrationes m 1 Pet 1:10-12. 83) Adumbrationes in 1 John 2:1.

The first interpretation, going back at least as far as Zahn's annotated edition of the text, sees the "primitive powers" as none other than the two paracletes, the Son and the Spirit.84 A second position, argued by Brooke F. Westcott (prior to Zahn), and by Lueken (in direct polemic with Zahn), was adopted by Sagnard, and, more recently, by Ziebritzki. Its most extensive exposition, however, was fur nished by Oeyen.85 According to this reading, the "powers" under discus sion are the seven protoctists, situated below the Son/ Logos, and either identified with the sevenfold Spirit (Oeyen), or juxtaposed to the Spirit (Ziebritzki). 86 At first sight, the two-Paraclete scheme, discussed by Kretschmar with reference to early Christian exegesis of Isa 6:1-3 and the developing reflection on the Trinity, is perfectly applicable to the passage. Christ is the Church's Paraclete before the Father, the Spirit is the Paraclete sent to the Church: hence, two Paracletes, Christ and the Holy Spirit. According to Zahn and Kretschmar, here as well as in other passages (Strom. 6:16:143; Excerpta 10:4, 20; Eclogae 56-57), Clement applies the designation and characteristics of angels or protoctists to Christ and the Spirit, without thereby numbering the latter two among the angels. Yet, unlike "real" angelic beings, Christ and the Spirit would be "inmobiles exsistentes secundum substantiam," that is, according to Zahn, characterized by "an exsistentes secundum substantiam" to mean that their substance is immovable according to substance, i.e., it does not undergo change. 84) Zahn, Forschungen III: 79-103, esp. 98-99. Zahn's opinions carry on to this day: Frangoulis (Der Begriff, 16-17); Barbel (Christos Angelos, 202-203); Kretschmar (Trinit?ts theologie, 71, n. 2); Ladaria (ElEsp?ritu, 255), and Hauschild (Gottes Geist, 79). 85) B.

The combination of the seven gifts of the Spirit (Isa 11:1-2), and the seven angelic spirits of the Lord (Zech 4:2, 10; Rev 1:4; Rev 5:6; Rev 8:2), which we have seen in Clement's exegesis of the sevenfold candlestick, is a well established tradition in early Christianity. See Schl?tz, Die sieben Gaben.</page><page sequence="26">406 B. G. Bucur / Vigiliae Christianae 61 (2007) 381-413 ethical immutability rooted in their essence." As for the equation between the Holy Spirit and the angelic spirits in Adumbrationes in 1 Pet 4:14, such language is not to be taken literally.87 Westcott and Lueken have pointed to a textual problem in the Adum brationes. The entire passage beginning with "hae namque virtutes" and continuing with a discussion of the now familiar principle of mediated immediacy, illustrated by the cases of the archangel Michael, Samuel, and Elisha, seems oddly out of place as an exegesis of 1 John 2:1. This material might have been displaced from the Adumbrationes in Jude 9, where Clem ent discusses precisely the alleged presence of the archangel Michael at the scene of Moses' death; the digression on Moses, Samuel, and Elisha, and Michael working through subordinate angels, would be perfectly justified.88 Unfortunately, Westcott's displacement hypothesis finds no support in the meager text tradition of the Adumbrationes, and must therefore remain a mere conjecture. For some, accepting the preeminence of the text tradition implies accepting the Zahn-Kretschmar exegesis.89 Yet, the equation of the virtutes with the seven protoctists is not dependent on the displacement hypothesis. For Oeyen (who is, of course, sympathetic to this theory), making sense of the reference to "the primitive powers" requires the larger theological con text provided by the Adumbrationes, Excerpta, and Eclogae. In this perspec tive, for instance, the "Paraclete" working in the Church is by no means an unambiguous referent: a few passages earlier in the Adumbrationes in 1 Pet, Clement discloses to his readers that the "Spirit of Christ" resting upon the faithful is, in fact, Christ working through the "angelic spirit," through archangels and inferior angels. Secondly, the description of the "powers" matches other Clementine references to the protoctists. Their being "first created" (7tp(wT6KtaT16o), "primitive" (fpfrO7OVOI), and "immutable," per fectly matches the description in Excerpta 10; "aequivoce" (0'goviD,4uo) can be better explained as referring to the personal name (e.g., "Michael"), 87) Zahn, Forschungen 111:98; Frangoulis, Der Begriff, 17; Kretschmar, Trinit?tstheologie, 71, n. 2.

Lueken rejected Zahns State ment about "ethical immutability," and proposed "local immutability." However, as Barbel (Christos Angelos, 203) notes, substantial immutability implies both. 89) Barbel (Christos Angelos, 202) notes: "Doch wird man dem Zeugnis des ?berlieferung das Vorrecht lassen m?ssen"; he then embraces the identification of the primitivae virtutes with Christ and the Spirit.</page><page sequence="27">B.

The divergence in the interpretation of the Adumbrationes in 1 John 2:1 is not as radical as it may seem. I submit that it is possible to move beyond the divergence by considering the primitivae virtutes in light of a new descriptive category: "angelomorphic Pneumatology." 3.5. Angelic or Angelomorphic Pneumatology? Oeyen contends that the protoctists simply are the Spirit, a plural designation of the sevenfold Holy Spirit.90 Ladaria refuses this identification on the grounds that the indwelling work of the Spirit finds no counterpart in the action of the protoctists, and that there is a clear distinction between the paradigmatic status of the protoctists with respect to the vision of God, and work of Holy Spirit who enables one to see God.9' These objections are easily overcome as soon as it is understood that the protoctists serve as "high priests" of the deifying and theophanic action ultimately performed by the Logos, and therefore mediators of the visio dei. Ziebritzki agrees with Oeyen that the Spirit is, indeed, subordinated to the Logos and abides in unchanging con templation of the latter. He asserts, however, without offering any proof, that the Spirit is assigned to the same hierarchical rank as the protoctists, although he remains a distinct entity.92 Hauschild's cautious observations seem extremely apt at this point: interpreting Clement's Pneumatology depends to a great extent on determining the extent to which Clement is in agreement with the traditions that he is reworking. Given that Clement nowhere identifies them explicitly, he could be equating the protoctists with the Spirit; but he could also be resorting to a traditional view which simply does not speak of a "Holy Spirit," and not have the capacity to bend the inherited framework so as to accommodate the hypostasis of the Spirit.93 90) Oeyen, Engelpneumatologie, 20, 25, 31, 33, 40. For a presentation of the functional identity between the Holy Spirit and the protoctists, see Oeyen, Engelpneumatologie, 22-23. 91) "Mientras que El Esp?ritu Santo es comunicado al hombre y en ?l habita, es decir, se convierte en un principio interno de actuaci?n del creyente, nada de esto se dice en relaci?n con los'protoctistos'" (Ladaria, El Esp?ritu, 252); "hay diferencia entre 'ser ejemplo' y 'hacer capaz de"'(Ladaria, El Esp?ritu, 252, note 17). 92) Geist und Weltseele, 122-123. 93) Hauschild, Gottes Geist, 79, n. 10.

Hauschild, Gottes Geist, 78-79).</page><page sequence="28">408 B. G. Bucur / Vigiliae Christianae 61 (2007) 381-413 The following text may lead to more clarity. And by one God are many treasures dispensed; some are disclosed through the Law, others through the prophets; some by the divine mouth, another by the heptad of the spirit (ro mv?wxUpt0o;r tj _TOCr&amp;) singing in accompaniment. And the Lord being one, is the same Instructor in all of these.94 According to Schliitz this text describes the revelation of the Instructor Logos as both unitary and progressive: the Logos works in the law, later in the prophets, then in the Incarnation ("the divine mouth"), and, finally, the descent of the Spirit at Pentecost. Oeyen prefers a direct equation of "the divine mouth" with the Spirit, on the basis of Protr. 9:82 (where the Spirit is precisely the mouth of the Lord).95 On either view (and I would argue that Clement's Spirit Christology annuls their distinction), the expres sion "heptad of the spirit" refers to the Holy Spirit. The question is to decide whether "holy spirit" is a designation for the seven "angels of the Face," or "seven protoctists" a designation for the Holy Spirit. Briefly put: "angel" Pneumatology or "pneuma" angelology?96 Ladaria prefers to interpret "angels" as references to the Holy Spirit.97 Similarly, Oeyen notes, commenting on the passage discussing the spiritus angelicus (Adumbrationes in 1 Pet 4:14): "nicht nur werden Engel Geist genannt; auch der Geist wird als engelhaft bezeichnet," and concludes "dass es sich ohne Zweifel um den Heiligen Geist handelt, und nicht um einen niedrigeren Engel, der Geist im abgeschwachten Sinne genannt wiirde."98 94) Paed. 3:12:87 (ANF, modified). 95) Schl?tz, Die sieben Gaben, 77; Oeyen, Engelpneumatologie, 27, n. 22. 96) Far from being a Christian invention, much less a peculiarity of Clement's, the use of n\z\)\x,a to designate an angelic being is widespread in pre- and post-exilic Judaism, wit nessed by the LXX and authors of the diaspora, and also prominent at Qumran. In the Old Testament, the locus classicus is Isa 63:9-10, where the Angel of the Lord is referred to as "holy spirit"; in the New Testament, aside from the designation of evil angels as (impure) "spirits," the equivalence of "spirit" and "angel" is implicit in Heb 12:9 ("Father of spirits"), and Acts 8:26.29.39, where Philip's guide is successively described as "angel of the Lord," "spirit," and, "spirit of the Lord."

It would, indeed, be preferable to use the newer descriptive category of "angelomorphic Pneumatology," as proposed by Crispin Fletcher-Louis, namely "wherever there are signs that an indi vidual or community possesses specifically angelic characteristics or status, though for whom identity cannot be reduced to that of an angel."99 The virtue of this definition is that it signals the use of angelic characteristics in descriptions of God or humans, while not necessarily implying that the latter are angels stricto sensu.100 I submit that this new reading lens can help us overcome the two diver gent readings of the passage about the "primitivae virtutes" in the Adum brationes in 1 John 2:1. Granted the basic divergence between the number of the powers involved (two, for Zahn and Kretschmar; seven, for Lueken and Oeyen), there is much in the two exegeses that is only apparently in conflict. Zahn and his followers affirm that Clement is speaking about Christ and the Holy Spirit. As we have seen, Oeyen does not deny the Pneumatological content of passage: the seven first-created angels are the sevenfold Holy Spirit in archaic angelomorphic "disguise." The case for Clement's Spirit Christology has direct bearing on the inter pretation of the passage. This becomes clear if one reexamines Clement's speculations on unity and diversity in light of the conclusions arrived at so far. 3.6. A Final Look at Clement's Speculations on Unity and Diversity How is the equation of the Paraclete with the protoctists coherent with the identification between the Paraclete and the Logos, noted earlier? Briefly put, the solution resides in Clement's view on the relation between unity and multiplicity: the one "Spirit," the Logos, becomes multiform in the angelic "seven spirits." Clement's speculation on the interplay between the "Spirit" (the Logos) and the first created "spirits" has been discussed above. I find it necessary, however, to reintroduce the quotation from Strom. 5:6:35, together with a complementary fragment from Adumbrationes: 99) Fletcher-Louis, Luke-Acts: Angels, Christology and Soteriology (WUNT 94; T?bingen 1997) 14-15. 100) It is important to caution against an anachronistic understanding of the terms "angel" or "spirit." According to Dani?lou (Jewish Christianity, 118), "the use of such terms in no way implies that Christ was by nature an angel_The nature of this supernatural being is</page><page sequence="30">410 B.

Yet, the "inspection" of the Spirit is described as "mani fold," suggesting that Clement understands "the eyes of the Lord" to be not the two eyes of an anthropomorphic God, but rather the same seven "eyes of the Lord" discussed in Strom. 5:6:35, the protoctists. On this read ing, the use of Heb 1:1 ("God-more specifically, Christ, according to Strom. 5:6-spoke to the prophets and patriarchs at sundry times and diverse manners") in both texts, and further down in the Adumbrationes, makes excellent sense: the inspiring Spirit of Old Testament revelation is identified with the Logos working through the protoctists and the entire angelic hierarchy. Clement's texts allow us to restate this idea using RvcIV?V as the reference point. Given that the theory of the one Logos as multiplic ity perfectly parallels the relation between one Spirit and seven powers of the Spirit, and the repeated identification between Logos and Spirit, dis cussed earlier, it is legitimate to conclude that 2tvci4ctU is simultaneously one (qua Logos), and many (qua protoctists). On the one hand, there are in Clement's writings numerous references to the "Holy Spirit." On the other hand, a sophisticated and technical exegesis explains nvci4wt in such traditional expressions as "Spirit of Christ" as designations for the angelic spirits. The question is whether we can still speak about Pneumatology at all. Does all of the above not confirm Zieb ritzki's conclusion that Clement did not have a concept of the Spirit as an individual substace, a distinct third hypostasis?102 Such a conclusion would be unfair to Clement. Aside from the fact that the seven protoctists are described as "immutable" and as "heptad of the not determined by the expression but by the context. Angel' is the old-fashioned equivalent of'person.'" 101) Strom. 5:6:35; Adumbrationes in 1 Pet 2:3. 102) Ziebritzki Heiliger Geist und Weltseele, 123 (quoted above, in the introduction).</page><page sequence="31">B.

First, many pas sages in Clement that contain angelomorphic Pneumatology center around the phenomenon of prophecy. The starting-point is, therefore, the claimed religious experience, and the functional identity of Christ, the Holy Spirit and the angel as grasped by this experience. Clement instantiates a larger phenomenon in early Christianity, namely a certain incongruence between the creedal level of theology and the theological account of the creed. Obviously, articulating a Trinitarian doctrine, in order to reflect a Trinitar ian experience of God, took longer than the introduction of Trinitarian formulae. Second, Clement is ambiguous in his use of angelomorphic lan guage. As has been pointed out with reference to his use of the Excerpta, Eclogae, and Adumbrationes, despite his abundant use of apocalyptic imagery inherited from older tradition (the Face of God, the seven highest angels performing their liturgy before the Face, the various levels of the angelic hierarchy, etc.), Clement's project in fact "sabotages" these very ele ments, by a constant process of internalization and spiritualization.103 A literal reading of the passages illustrating Clement's Engelpneumatologie would be profoundly unfair to the Alexandrian master. Conclusions It is possible at this point to conjugate the results of all previous sections. I begin by positing what seems to be the fundamental aspect of Clement's cosmological and theological view: the hierarchically ordered cosmos, fea turing several angelic ranks, a worldview inherited from older tradition (e.g., Mart. Ascen. Isa., 2En., EpApos), and strikingly anticipating the Cor pus Dionysiacum. Clement refers to the utterly transcendent God whose "Face" is the Logos, and who manifests himself, in descending order, to the seven pro toctists, the archangels, the angels, finally the prophets, as highest repre sentatives of the Church. There is little or no explicit mention of the Holy Spirit in this hierarchy. Moreover, when there is, the term "spirit" describes either the Son, or the angelic spirits. Ihe interplay between the Logos as nvcipt and the angelic tv?wxTo (or, for that matter, Logos as 6vvap; and the angelic 68v61gFt;) reflects Clement's understanding of the interplay 103) See in this respect Bucur, "The Other Clement: Cosmic Hierarchy," 14-18.</page><page sequence="32">412 B. G. Bucur / Vigiliae Christianae 61 (2007) 381-413 between unity and multiplicity, more precisely his understanding unity as multiplicity (6X; notvTOC ?V, Strom. 4:25:156). A generation later, Origen was clearly aware of this theological tradi tion. In the seventh book of his Commentary on Romans, for instance, while discussing at length the possible meanings of nvez,ucc, Origen argued that the Holy Spirit was termed 'qyEgov6Kov, principalis in Ps. 50:14 because "He holds dominion and sovereignty among the many holy spirits" (7.1). Indeed, the Holy Spirit is "the firstfruits of many spirits" by analogy with Christ, who is "the first born of all creation" (7.5).104 Origen's understand ing of the Holy Spirit in relation to the angelic spirits is perhaps the follow ing: "All spirits ... are a part of the School of God's Spirit. The Holy Spirit is the head Teacher, who oversees the spiritual growth and education of every human being. However, like schools in Origen's day, the teachers are different from and inferior to the divine Spirit, but they assist in aspects of the Spirit's work."' 05 Certainly, the Shepherd of Hermas and the Testament of Reuben are part of the background to Origen's statements here.106 The more important element, however, is to be located in the surviving frag ments from Clement's Hypotyposes, where an elaborated angelomorphic Pneumatology is embedded in the tradition of Bible exegesis to which Origen is the direct heir. 107 Whether one chooses to say that for Clement the Holy Spirit is a plural entity consisting of the seven highest angels, or that the hypostasis of the Spirit is functionally absorbed and replaced by the protoctists, or, as I incline 104) "quemque principalem spiritum propterea arbitror nominatum ut ostenderetur esse quidem multos Spiritus sed in his principatum et dominationem hunc Spiritum Sanctum qui et principalis appellatur tenere" (7.1 [554]); "ut ille primogenitus dicitur omnis crea turae tali quadam ratione etiam multorum spirituum primitiae dicatur Spiritus Sanctus" (7.5 [574]).

Bucur / Vigiliae Christianae 61 (2007) 381-413 413 to think, that it is represented in an angelomorphic manner, there is abun dant proof to confirm the thesis proposed by Christian Oeyen in 1966. I have argued that the theological phenomenon under discussion would be more accurately described as "angelomorphic Pneumatology," and that it occurs in a larger theological articulation, namely in tandem with binitari anism and Spirit Christology. Far from being an isolated oddity of Clem ent's, this phenomenon occurs in other early Christian texts as well.108 In historical perspective, angelomorphic Pneumatology constitutes a significant phase in Christian reflection on the Holy Spirit. The use of Second Temple themes, such as the "angelic spirit" and the apocalyptic "angels of the Face," as building blocks in the articulation of early Chris tian Pneumatology, illustrates the indebtedness of pre-Nicene theology to the categories inherited from Second Temple Judaism. 'This way of think ing and speaking about the Holy Spirit was still an option in the fourth century.109 However, with the advent of the new theological paradigm in the wake of the Arian and Pneumatomachian controversies, angelomor phic Holy Spirit became highly problematic, and ultimately a theological liability. Christian Oeyen's Engelpneumatologie bei Klemens von Alexandrien must be credited not only for an important contribution to the study of early Christian Pneumatology, but also for insisting on the relevance of the oft neglected Eclogae, Adumbrationes and Excerpta for a more complete under standing of Clement's theology. I can only hope that the pages above will follow suit in spurring scholarly interest in "the other Clement." 108) See, in this respect, Oeyen, "Die Lehre von den g?ttlichen Kr?ften bei Justin"; Bucur, "Rereading the Shepherd's Christology." 109) See the brief summary in Richard Paul Vaggione, Eunomius ofCyzicus and the Nicene Revolution (Oxford 2000) 122-123 (discussion) and n. 270 (patristic references).</page></plain_text>
