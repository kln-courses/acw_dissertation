A UN fund to help poor countries to adapt to the impacts of climate change is to be launched. It was agreed that poor countries need access to green funds but not who would provide them. • Government officials and activists flying to Bali for the UN meeting on climate change will cause as much pollution as 20,000 cars/ year. • More than a 1000 carbon trader and investors had turned up in Bali. They liked the agreement on a financial mechanism for avoided deforestation. • The 14th meeting of the parties to the UNFCCC and the 4th meeting of the parties to the Kyoto Protocol is to take place 1-12 Dec. 2008 in Poland. • China and India together account for about 70%of the increase in oil consumption over last 2 years. • Half the remaining oil reserves in the 'free world' may be in Canada. • PetroChina has replaced ExxonMobil as he world biggest (twice as valuable) quoted company on 5 November 2007 . • National oil companies control about 80% of oil reserves. • According to Morgan Stanley the world market for clean energy could reach $500 billion by 2020 and $1 trillion by 2030. • Gazprom's net profits fell by 20% from last year in spite of soaring energy prices, rising operating costs and warm weather may be to blame. • Canary Wharf, London, is a carbon trading hub offering commodity services and products, corporate finance, investment banking, retail products.

( FT , 18.12.07) CLIMATE POLITICS AND POLICY "No matter if the science is all phony , there are collateral environmental benefits.... Climate change provides the greatest chance to bring about justice and equality in the world." (Former Canadian Environment Minister) The talks in Bali will be meaningless unless they produce a programme for leaving fossil fuels in the ground. (George Monbiot, The Guardian , 11.12.07) "No, the Bali meeting is not really about doing anything. It is about feeling smug; and getting paid for it. (Editorial, The Daily Telegraph , 3.12. 2007 The Singapore Declaration (21 November 2007) This regional declaration on climate change was signed by major emitters China and India prior to the UN-backed talks in Bali in December 2007. "Australia joined 15 other nations in signing the East Asia Summit declaration in Singapore, but the deal sets only voluntary goals on energy efficiency and other conservation objectives... there were signs that China and India had changed their positions on climate change, which bode well for the crucial Bali talks. {Sydney Morning Herald , 21.11.2007) Extracts: The signatories (the ASEAN countries) affirmed their commitment to the UNFCCC as the core mechanism for addressing climate change at the global level, and for relevant countries, the Kyoto Protocol as well; welcomed the Fourth Assessment Report of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); and expressed concern about the adverse impact of climate change on socio-economic development, health and the environment... the group reaffirmed "the need to take an effective approach to the interrelated challenges of climate change, energy security and other environmental and health issues, in the context of sustainable development and that the pursuit of climate change and energy security policies, but also that this "must avoid introducing barriers to trade, investment and socio-economic development". They supported the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, "as well as our respective capabilities." They declared inter alia to: that developed countries should continue to play a leading role in this regard; to commit to the common goal of stabilising atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations in the long run, at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic</page><page sequence="3">Fuel for Thought 327 interference with the climate system; support work to achieve a common understanding on a long-term aspirational global emissions reduction goal to pave the way for a more effective post-2012 international arrangement; and acknowledge that adaptation is a critical issue for the region. They will participate actively in the process of developing an effective, comprehensive, and equitable post-2012 international climate change arrangement under the UNFCCC process; and in this context, reiterate our support for the successful outcome of the 1 3th session of the COP to the UNFCCC and the 3rd MOP to the Kyoto Protocol to be held in Bali, Indonesia in December 2007. They also promised to intensify ongoing cooperation to improve energy efficiency, and the use of cleaner energy, including the use of, renewable and alternative sources, based on the Cebu Declaration and the Joint Ministerial Statement of the 1st EAS Energy Ministers' Meeting on 23 August 2007, and promote cooperation on afforestation and reforestation, and to reduce deforestation, forest degradation and forest fires, including by promoting sustainable forest management, combating illegal logging, protecting biodiversity, and addressing the underlying economic and social drivers. Also, they will strengthen cooperation on management capacity and measures for natural disaster risks raised by climate variability and change and other environmental challenges; encourage the development of adaptation strategies to mitigate weather-related calamities caused by water; andfoster the conservation and sustainable management of coastal and marine ecosystems and call on the regional and international communities to participate in efforts to avoid marine pollution, such as marine litter, and the destruction of protected and vulnerable areas..., and welcome the "Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries, and Food Security" as one of these efforts .Listing many more laudable initiatives concerning environmental management. (Shortened from http://www.aseansec.org/21116.htm) The Nobel Peace Prize "....the Norwegian Nobel Committee said the scientific reports issued since 1990 by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have "created an ever-broader informed consensus about the connection between human activities and global warming." The peacemaking value of this scientific finding, according to the committee, is that human-induced changes in climate may cause "large-scale migration and lead to greater competition for the earth's resources" and an "increased danger of violent conflicts and wars." No connection between environmental crises and armed conflict Norwegian research suggests, however, that there is no connection between environmental crises and armed conflict. "Extensive climate changes may alter and threaten the living conditions of much of mankind. They may induce large-scale migration and lead to greater competition for the earth's resources. Such changes will place particularly heavy burdens on the world's most vulnerable countries. There may be increased danger of violent conflicts and wars, within and between states." This is an excerpt from the Nobel Committee's explanation for the award of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, shared equally by the former US Vice President Al Gore Jr. and the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). The Nobel Committee interprets "working for peace" as including saving the Earth's environment.

The exception to the rule may be the reduction agreement between the Japanese government and Japanese industry."(Yvo de Boer, Executive Secretary of UNFCCC) "Our job is to ensure that emission reductions are real, measurable, verifiable and additional to what would have occurred in the absence of a CDM project, ( H-J Stehr, Chair of CDM Board, cited in EF, November 2007) China, India and other developing countries probably won't be required to take on legally binding commitments to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions under a new climate-change treaty, a UN official said today. (Kim Chipman, Bloomberg , 7 December 2007) The European Union announced Wednesday that it would lend China 500 million euro (730 million dollars) to fight climate change. The European Investment Bank, the EU's long-term lending arm, said it would provide the money over a 25-year loan. One in five carbon credits issued by the United Nations are going to support clean energy projects that may in fact have helped to increase greenhouse gas emissions, environmental group WWF said on Thursday. (Reuters, 29 November 2007) Since global carbon emissions are climbing and there's no sign anybody is actually doing anything to stop them, the UN delegates in Bali will work themselves into a frenzy of busyness. Given the gaps in national and regional perspectives, from China to India to Europe and North America, real agreement is unlikely, although they will come up with something that they will try to pass off as a big step forward. The truth is they have nowhere to go and no solutions to implement. (T. Corcoran, National Post , 20.11.2007) b. National perspectives before Bali Deepening divisions among developed countries over climate change policy threaten to derail the Bali climate talks and may pressure Kevin Rudd to make an early declaration on mandatory national emissions targets. A powerful coalition of developed countries, which is chaired by Australia and is considered a key swing player at the negotiations, is split on the crucial but contentious issue of mandatory</page><page sequence="5">Fuel for Thought 329 national targets for developed countries in any post-Kyoto climate agreement after 2012. Japan, a key member of the group, has signalled it may be edging towards the position held by the US, which advocates imposing voluntary emissions targets in any post-Kyoto accord on climate change. ( The Australian , 5 December 2007) According to The Australian , the US, Japan and Canada were resisting pressure from the UN and developing countries to adopt dramatic targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions... As business and industry warn of catastrophic economic effects if the ambit claims of 25-40 % emission cuts by 2020 are adopted at the conference, Kevin Rudd and his Climate Change Minister Penny Wong declared Australia will not budge until it knows the full cost of adopting any targets. The Prime Minister offered broad support to the targets and their inclusion in a draft document being negotiated at the conference. But he insisted Australia would not set its own binding short-term goal until the climate change review it has commissioned from economist Ross Garnaut is completed in the middle of next year. "We will then be in a position to frame our own targets," the PM said. "Our own long-term target is an ambitious one of a 60% reduction in emissions by 2050." The Government of Brazil has rejected any suggestion that developing countries should reduce their carbon emissions. Today various government officials simply rejected a suggestion by the UN that poorer nations reduce carbon emissions even with a 40-year deadline saying the problem is with the richer countries. Brazil seems keen on making its voice heard as a spokesperson for the developing world during the international conference on climate change in Bali which begins on Monday. It wants cash from the US and other rich nations to pay for environmentally friendly policy changes. ( ABC News , 29 November 2007) China said "it would not back any new proposals at a UN climate change conference that run counter to existing frameworks that exempt the booming country from reducing greenhouse-gas output; "(The Times of India, 6 December 2007) China wants rich economies to back a fund to speed the spread of greenhouse gas-cutting technology in poor nations as it seeks to persuade delegates at global warming talks the focus of responsibility belongs on the West. While Beijing fends off calls for targets, it will press its own demands, especially that rich nations back a big boost in funds to encourage the spread of clean technology, Chinese climate policy advisers told Reuters." (Chris Buckley, Reuters , 4.12. 2007) " The movement against global warming has turned into a new religion, an ideology that threatens to undermine freedom and the world's economic and social order, Czech President Vaclav Klaus said on Monday. "Also threatened is the prevailing social and economic order, contemporary civilisation, the current prosperity of developed countries and the chances of developing countries to achieve a similar level of prosperity." (Reuters, 11.12. 2007, CCNet 21/2007 - 11.12.07) German Environment Minister Gabriel is promoting a plan to cut emissions blamed for global warming by 40 % at this week's climate talks in Bali. ..(But) At home, RWE AG is building three power plants fired by coal... more than half the new power stations planned for Germany will be fuelled by coal, according to Essen-based RWE, the nation's second-biggest utility.</page><page sequence="6">330 Energy &amp; Environment ■ Vol. 19, No. 2, 2008 Australia's move to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on Monday would augur well for Indian industry and, at best, would push its case in global negotiations. "It will be to India's advantage. Australia will have to meet reduction targets. They will want to offset some of these targets by buying carbon credits. India Ine will be only too happy to find another market for its growing carbon supply," an official told Times of India. Switzerland called for a Global Carbon Tax advocated at Bali "to help save the Earth from catastrophic man-made global warming"... A panel of UN participants on Thursday urged the adoption of a tax that would represent "a global burden sharing system, fair, with solidarity, and legally binding to all nations." "Finally someone will pay for these [climate related] costs," O. Schwank, a global tax advocate. He said at least "$10-$40 billion dollars per year" could be generated by the tax, and wealthy nations like the U.S. would bear the biggest burden based on the "polluters pay principle." The U.S. and other wealthy nations need to "contribute significantly more to this global fund." Schwank explained. "It is very essential to tax coal." The World Bank/UK stated that rich countries also need to provide funding for three more key elements of a global deal. First, there should be an international programme to combat deforestation, which contributes 15-20% of emissions. For $10bn-$15bn per year, half the deforestation could be stopped. Rich countries should honour their commitment to 0.7% of GDP in aid by 2015. This would yield increases in flows of $ 1 50bn-$200bn per year. The extra costs that developing countries face as a result of climate change are likely to be upwards of $80bn a year, and it is vital that extra resources are available. (Nicholas Stern, The Guardian , 30.11. 2007) c. Business fears and expectations: Will emission trading become global? • Taxpayers face having to fork out more than €270m so that Ireland can "buy its way" into meeting the Kyoto agreement on greenhouse gas emissions. Ireland is set to overshoot its Kyoto targets by almost lOOpc as things stand, according to the latest figures from the European Commission. However, this cost could rise significantly if the price of a tonne of carbon rises under the system. Some estimates have even put it as high as €500m. (T. Hogan, Independent , 28 November 2007) • Japan, Italy and Spain face fines of as much as $33 billion combined for failing to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions as promised under the Kyoto treaty. "They're looking at a huge bill now," said Mike Rosenberg, management professor at the University of Navarra's IESE Business School in Barcelona. Spain, Italy and Japan are likely to miss their Kyoto commitments because they underestimated economic growth and future emissions from factories and utilities The penalties will hit local utilities including Endesa SA and refiners such as Compania Española de Petróleos SA, or Cepsa. "Our negotiators didn't have a clue what they were getting into" at Kyoto, Cepsa Chairman Carlos Perez de Brício said at a conference in Madrid June 8. (K. Rix and M.Carr, Bloomberg , 30.11.2007) • "The money will go in the form of carbon credits to European or American corporations that will plant trees in those countries - trees those countries don't need and will not be in position to use them anyway. Greens will prevent them to</page><page sequence="7">Fuel for Thought 331 use trees for forestry in the name of "conservation" and stopping depletion of resources. A tiny fraction will be used to plant trees and pay cheap local labor. The lion's share will stay in industrialized countries trafficking in the carbon credits market." (E. Ferreyra 3.12.07) • Airlines stand to make billions of pounds in "windfall profits" from an emissions trading scheme that was supposed to make them pay for the environmental damage they cause, according to a government-commissioned report. They will take advantage of the scheme to raise fares substantially, even though their costs will hardly change. It will be the second time that an industry has made huge profits from emissions trading. (Ben Webster, The Times , 1.12. 2007) • Without clear guidance from the Bali talks, utilities will continue to rely on coal, said the chief executive officer of Vattenfall AB... Without a successor to Kyoto, the emission trading market, worth $30 billion last year "could disappear," said the executive secretary of the UN FCCC. "Bali agreeing to launch negotiations would be a very important signal to markets and business," he said, http://www.bloomberg.com /apps/news?pid=2060 1 087&amp;sid=aGc vpAHMJxKg&amp;refen=home (12.12 .07) d. Observer perspectives • "A 25-40% cut was endorsed at the Vienna meeting in August. It is designed to force the growing developed countries (mostly the US, Canada, Australia and Japan) to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on emission reduction projects in developing countries. This only works if the developing countries do not themselves have emission reduction requirements, so they can't accept targets. The whole Bali stalemate flows from the economics. And a fine stalemate it is. Enjoy the show."(David Wojick, Energy consultant, 9.12.07) • "The would-be regulators of the world's climate (and your wallet) will be jetting to Bali this December for Ban Ki-Moon's next UN weather fest: "UN Climate Change Conference 2007."

Not much point in taxing their populations to extremes only to have to lose votes and then pay over the booty to someone else!? (M. Martin-Smith, 7.12.2007) • The "rich-must-pay" mantra seems to be catching on around the globe. And for good reason. Green campaigners and eco-scientists from Europe and the USA have been claiming for years that it's Western GHG emissions that have been causing most of the world's environmental problems and disasters. If that were the case, the West would have to pay a devastating price. There can be little doubt that this form of climate 'justice' threatens to burden the developed world with astronomical costs, undermining its international competitiveness and destroying its self-confidence. The West will rue the day they handed over the agenda of international politics and economic policy-making to their green bureaucrats and eco-scientists. (Benny Peiser, CCNet , 29.1 1 . 2007) • In Bali, the Anglosphere nations have in effect drawn a red line in the sand: Unless developing countries agree to mandatory emissions cuts themselves, much of the Western world will henceforth reject any unilateral burden imposed by future climate deals In Bali, more than perhaps ever before, climate alarmism has finally hit the solid brick wall of political reality .As a consequence, the so-called Bali road map adopted last Saturday has shifted the pressure further on to developing nations to share responsibility for C02 emissions, a move that is widely regarded as a significant departure from the Kyoto Protocol. (Benny Peiser, CCNet 200/2007) [Ed. - hence the anti-development/ industrialisation/trade potential of climate policies] • "Japan and Canada are the new bad boys in town. With US, the long-established renegade's stance an old story, it was Japan and Canada's strident positioning against India and other developing countries that caught many delegates' attention on the second day of the UN climate change meeting at Bali on Tuesday. But India won a small battle against them by the end of the day. It got the issue of technology transfer on the agenda of the climate conference." (Nitin Sethi, Times of India, 5.12. 2007) Carbon markets give cautious welcome to Bali deal Carbon market participants have applauded the agreement of the 'Bali Roadmap' - but caution that the agreement is only the starting point of negotiations, and provides little more certainty about the likely shape of a carbon market after 2012. (But) What investors obviously need are firm, binding, numerical commitments. "To expect that to have emerged from Bali was probably unrealistic, but at least we have a process ."The key outcome - the Bali Action Plan - sets a timetable for two years of talks, to conclude in Copenhagen at the end of 2009. The expectation is that this would give sufficient time for a successor agreement to be ratified and enter into force by 20 1 3 . However, efforts</page><page sequence="9">Fuel for Thought 333 by the EU to include an indicative target for emissions reductions from developed countries of 25^10% below 1990 levels by 2020 failed, due to strong opposition from the US, Japan and Canada... attempts to bring developing country commitments into the agreement were also rejected. Instead, the action plan recognises "that deep cuts in global emissions will be required", and references the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC. Most importantly, the Bali Roadmap brings the US back into the process. "There was a risk that the process may have continued without all [developed country] parties," said Eva Weightman, an associate director at UK-based carbon trading and asset management company Carbon Capital Markets... The roadmap also started the ball rolling on two important new avenues for emission reduction efforts - reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and introducing sector- wide emissions targets... "The big picture signal about fairly aggressive global action in the future seemed to have markets at the centre. Almost everywhere we turned delegates had positive things to say about markets," said Dirk Forrister, Washington, DC-based managing director of asset management and advisory services at carbon asset manager Natsource. Elsewhere, further guidance was agreed by Kyoto signatories on the operation of the Clean Development Mechanism. Although the guidance did not go as far as some private sector investors would have liked..., most project developers considered themselves satisfied with progress at Bali. Decisions were, however, deferred on the inclusion of new HFC plants in the CDM, and incentivising carbon capture and storage projects via the mechanism. Least developing countries welcomed final agreement on the Adaptation Fund, which will channel revenues from the CDM to help them adapt to the effects of climate change." (Extract: EF , 20.12. 2007) Threats to free trade? "The fate of the Earth hangs in the balance in Bali, but the issue is not whether humanity will succumb to a "climate crisis," or how the international community might craft a successor to the tattered Kyoto Accord. The real theme of this UN gabfest - like that of its 12 predecessors, and of the hundreds, if not thousands, of related meetings - is whether globalization and trade liberalization will be allowed to continue, with a corresponding increase in wealth, health and welfare, or whether the authoritarian enemies of freedom (who rarely if ever recognize themselves as such) will succeed in using environmental hysteria to undermine capitalism... Any successor to Kyoto will be rooted in hobbling rich economies, increasing the poor world's resentment, unleashing environmental trade warfare, and blanketing the globe with rules and regulations that benefit only rulers and regulators. Bali is not about climate; it symbolizes the continued assault on freedom by those who seek - or pander to - political power under the guise of concern for humanity.

"Recycling of that kind of discredited conspiracy theory is nothing more than a distraction from the real challenge facing society and the energy industry," he said. "And that challenge is how are we going to provide the energy needed to support economic and social development while reducing greenhouse-gas emissions." The Republican report comes on the heels of Saturday's UN conference in Bali. ..In the Senate report, environmental scientist Schnare of the U.S. EPA said he was skeptical because "conclusions about the cause of the apparent warming stand on the shoulders of incredibly uncertain data and models... As a policy matter, one has to be less willing to take extreme actions when data are highly uncertain." (http://www. Washingtontimes, com /apps /pbcs.dll/article? AID= /2007 1221 /NATION / 844993096 /1001) Responses to Bali outcomes US Right unhappy "The UN climate conference in Bali revealed a few things: 1) The UN certainly knows how to throw a party and choose an exotic island paradise venue. 2) The UN once again displayed its intolerance for dissenting opinion as it squelched a team of scientists attending the conference who were promoting an abundance of peer- reviewed scientific data debunking the IPCC predictions. In addition, the UN and the much of the media shamefully ignored a letter debunking climate fears signed by over 100 prominent scientists (including renowned scientists like Dr. Reid Bryson, "the father of meteorology" and Dr. Antonio Zichichi, president of the World Federation of Scientists.... This follows UN leaders saying it was "immoral" to question predictions of climate doom. ...Once again, the UN conference revealed that politics and the preservation of its bureaucracy are more important than "solving" the so-called "climate crisis."

Over and over, he castigated the community for being reluctant to do research on adaptation, and over and over stated that adaptation was cheaper than mitigation... He stated that it was going to be basically impossible to reduce emissions significantly anyway, since the technologies didn't exist to do that... His basic answer to everything was that nobody would (or should) do anything until carbon free energy became cheaper than current means of producing energy by burning</page><page sequence="11">Fuel for Thought 335 fossil fuels.

For the first time ever all the world's nations have agreed to negotiate on a deal to tackle dangerous climate change concluding in 2009. It was the compelling clarity of the science and the strength of the case for urgent action that has made this agreement possible. But it was political leadership that made it happen. Our changing climate has changed our politics, because we knew that we could not let people down. We came here saying we wanted a roadmap that included every country and covered emission reductions from developed countries and fair and equitable contributions from developing countries. We leave here with all of this and more - a groundbreaking agreement on deforestation, and others on adaptation and technology. And against predictions these negotiations will be guided by ambitious goals for emission reductions ( DEFRA , 15.12. 2007) British environmental journalists 1) "In public, climate scientists and European politicians are generally optimistic that rising carbon dioxide levels and temperatures can be curbed. In private, some are less sanguine.... Now, science advisors to two governments with claims to leadership in global climate politics, Germany and the UK, have told BBC News it is unlikely that levels of greenhouse gases can be kept low enough to avoid a projected temperature rise of 2C (3.6F). Meanwhile, the UK still plans a huge airport expansion, there is not the slightest hint of a deal that would see rich nations pay poor nations to capture their emissions from coal and even Democrats in the US Congress want to postpone any tough action on emissions until after 2020. That may be why the scientists' mask of optimism is beginning to slip (R. Harrabin, BBC News , 10.12. 2007) 2) "Hilary Benn [UK environment minister] is an idiot. Our diplomats are suckers. American negotiators have pulled the same trick twice, and for the second time our governments have fallen for it.

It is already happening in Darfiir, they tell us, and the rest of Africa could soon follow suit.... but the current threat scenarios being bandied about are wildly speculative. As a recent study by Norwegian peace researchers Nordas and Gleditsch points out, "the security threat from climate change has been presented in public debate in increasingly flamboyant wording, largely based on secondary and politicized sources." These climate scare stories ignore the ways many poorly resourced communities manage their affairs without recourse to violence. Violent conflict in the Global South is generally more connected to resource abundance (competition over rich mineral reserves in the Congo or diamonds in Sierra Leone) than resource scarcity. Moreover, people and nations are as capable of cooperating as they are prone to fighting... Despite grandiose claims that hundreds of millions of 'climate refugees' will roam the planet, we simply don't know how many people global warming will displace. So much will depend on how effectively the international community rises to the challenge of reducing poor people's vulnerability to drought, storms, floods and sea-level rise, and implements strong disaster-response strategies. Above all, the nature of institutions and power structures at the local, regional, national and international levels determines whether conflict over resources turns violent or not. Blaming the deaths in Darfur on drought and land degradation caused by climate change naturalizes profoundly political forces.... Why are climate change threat scenarios taking hold when there is so little credible evidence to support them? It is one of the oldest games in town to dress up issues as dangerous security threats to garner media attention, funding and political support. The climate change case is no exception."

European emissions continue to climb while our current policies have resulted in emissions tailing off in the United States. The British environmental journal Nature in October said it's time to dump cap-and-trade because it's the wrong approach, and Kyoto has "failed" to cut greenhouse gases. If we are going to impose enormous costs to our economy, a carbon tax would be a much more efficient and transparent approach. In addition, the Senate has passed two resolutions stating that any climate action must neither harm our economy nor fail to include developing countries. Lieberman- Warner does not pass that test. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently wrote that any meaningful emission-reduction cap means a "large number of companies will experience cost increases that make them less competitive.

The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (H.R.6) will increase the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standard from 25 to 35 miles-per-gallon for cars and light trucks, the first increase in 30 years. Environmental NGO the Natural Resources Defense Council estimated this "long-overdue improvement in gas mileage" will save 1 .2 million barrels of oil a day in 2020, save consumers $40 billion and cut global warming pollution by 200 mt of carbon dioxide. Also included in the bill is a major increase in the Renewable Fuel Standard, requiring 9 bn gallons/year in 2008, up from the current 2008 mandate of 5.4 bn. The RFS grows to 36 billion gallons by 2022, and requires increasing volumes of 'advanced' (non-maize) ethanol. It requires 3 billion gallons of 'advanced' biofuels in 2016, rising to 21 bn of the 36 bn gallon total in 2022. The legislation also sets efficiency standards for appliances and lighting, requiring light bulbs to use 25-30% less energy by 2012-14 and two times less by 2020. An earlier version of the bill included a Renewable Electricity Standard, which would have required utilities to include 15% renewable energy in their mixes by 2020. And it would have rescinded $13.5 billion in tax credits for the oil industry and re-directed those funds to support tax benefits for renewable energy. But Republicans threatened to use parliamentary tactics to block progress on the measures, and Bush threatened to veto it if those provisions were included....

WWF questions CDM emissions reductions A WWF-commissioned report claims that 20% of emissions reductions claimed through the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism would have been made regardless. This is equal to about 34 million tonnes of C02 equivalent each year, said the environmental group. ..The report was prepared by Öko Institut, the German environmental consultancy and research institute. CDM project developers are required to prove that their project would not have happened without the potential revenue from the sale of resultant emissions credits - in other words, that the project is 'additional'. WWF said that there are "weak standards and inconsistent approaches towards additionally", which could lead to an actual increase in global emissions, as CDM credits are used to offset rising emissions elsewhere." WWF also suggested that the use of certified emission reductions - the credits generated by CDM projects - be restricted in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to those which are certified by the Gold Standard. The group warns that access to "excessively large volumes" of CERs in Phase II of the EU ETS could lead to a 145 million tonne of C02 rise in emissions from sectors covered by the scheme. The Gold Standard is an independent benchmark for CDM projects, which offers a quality label for projects that provide clear sustainable development benefits. WWF said that many CDM projects fail to promote sustainable development - one of the mechanism's original aims. The group also called for some projects to be phased out of the CDM programme, since they do not contribute to sustainable development. ...The group calls for developed nations to adopt a 30% reduction in domestic emissions by 2020, compared with 1990 levels in a post-Kyoto agreement, in line with the European Commission's goal.

"They will take advantage of the scheme to raise fares substantially, even though their costs will hardly change. The windfall will be highly embarrassing for the Government because it has heavily promoted the trading of aviation emissions to justify its plans to allow air travel to double by 2030. Ruth Kelly, the (UK)Transport Secretary, claimed last week that emissions trading would ensure that the proposed third runway at Heathrow would not add to overall climate-change gases. She said that the scheme would force the industry "to take its environmental responsibilities seriously". (There was public outrage last year when it emerged that British power generators had made more than € 1 billion from the scheme, under which industries have to obtain a permit for each tonne of carbon they emit.)... the power generators were given billions of pounds of free permits at the start to cover their existing emissions. The same problem could occur with airlines, which are due to join the scheme in 201 1 , because the European Commission is proposing that they be given enough free permits to cover 96-97 % of their present emissions. The report, commissioned by the Department for Transport and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, says that the airlines will raise fares by the full value of the permits even though they will pay nothing for them. It concludes: "The consequence of the results set out here is that a high level of free allocation will generate windfall profits." It recommends that airlines be forced to buy a substantial proportion of the permits needed to cover their present emissions. Robin Smale, the economist who wrote the report, said: "The airlines are going to be in the same position as the electricity generators in making windfall profits from a scheme designed to benefit the environment. It could run to billions of pounds and it will be embarrassing for the Government and the industry ."A DfT spokesman said that ministers were aware of the issue and were trying to persuade the EU to adjust the scheme. ..British Airways is demanding the same proportion of free permits as were given to the power generators.

Rapid growth in penetration of renewables and other decentralised electricity resources will require significant deployment of energy storage technologies to stabilise supply, say reports available from research consultancy Delta Energy and Environment.High penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources, in countries such as Denmark and Ireland, is already causing grid-stability problems which could be solved using storage systems. New storage technologies are already supporting an ageing grid in North America. If Europe is going to reach its targets of increased renewable electricity, greater deployment of storage systems will be needed to prevent further instability. Despite this, few utilities are yet deploying or even assessing the storage technologies on offer. Two new reports available from Delta - 'Emerging Electricity Storage Technologies : Time for Utility Engagement ?' and 'Flow Batteries: Technologies, Applications and Markets' - assess the different technologies on offer in the market and will help utilities devise a strategy for engagement with the emerging electricity storage technologies.... Energy storage technologies bring multiple benefits to electricity markets. They can make renewable energy more economically viable by ensuring that supply is consistent with demand; stabilise peaks and troughs of renewable output; support transmission and distribution grids; defer investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure, and enable more efficient use of existing generation assets. Delta estimates flow-batteries and other storage technologies will attract investment of well over US$50 billion by 2050. Contact Carbon International for further details.

(William Kininmonth 19.11.07) Cycle 24 and climate "Astronomers are watching the Sun, hoping to see the first stirrings of cycle 24. It should have arrived last December. The United States' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted it would start in March 2007. Now they estimate March 2008, but they will soon have to make that even later. The first indications that the Sun is emerging from its current sunspot minimum will be the appearance of small spots at high latitude. They usually occur some 12-20 months before the start of a new cycle. These spots haven't appeared yet so cycle 24 will probably not begin to take place until 2009 at the earliest. The longer we have to wait for cycle 24, the weaker it is likely to be. Such behaviour is usually followed by cooler temperatures on Earth Some members of the Russian Academy of Sciences say we may be at the start of a period like that seen between 1790 and 1820, a minor decline in solar activity called the Dalton Minimum. They estimate that the Sun's reduced activity may cause a global temperature drop of 1 .5C by 2020. This is larger than most sensible predictions of man-made global warming over this period.</page><page sequence="27">Fuel for Thought 35 1 It's something we must take seriously because what happened in the 17th century is bound to happen again some time. Recent work studying the periods when our Sun loses its sunspots, along with data on other Sun-like stars that may be behaving in the same way, suggests that our Sun may spend between 10 and 25 per cent of the time in this state. Perhaps the lateness of cycle 24 might even be the start of another Little Ice Age. If so, then our Sun might come to our rescue over climate change, mitigating mankind's influence and allowing us more time to act. It might even be the case that the Earth's response to low solar activity will overturn many of our assumptions about man's influence on climate change. We don't know. We must keep watching the sun."

(Translated message received from Ernst Beck) C02 increase and effects still debated As the increase of C02 in the atmosphere in the past 50 years is about 70 ppmv, this is entirely due to human emissions. If the emissions should stop today, next year the C02 level would decrease by about 1 .5 ppmv. (Ferdinand Engelbeen) "There is no evidence that the C02 emitted from human activities is adding to the C02 in the small part of the carbon cycle that is the air.lt may be, but other factors such as response of the oceans to earlier global warming could be responsible. I ndeed, the C02 in the air has risen by 4% (i.e. 13 ppmv) since 1998 while global temperature has not risen and this fits the hypothesis that previous ocean warming has caused this increase. (Richard Courtney 18.12.07) "I maintain that the data (Mauna Loa) are robust.... The Kuo paper comes to a wrong conclusion, maybe because they are using statistics on small changes without recognising the errors that the data contain. You know very well that there is a correlation between the rising C02 concentration and the rising surface and lower troposphere temperatures. As been pointed out repeatedly that the rise in temperature in the last century could not have produced the rise in C02 concentration. Whether the rise in C02 is the prime cause of the temperature rise is a matter for debate. Physics indicates that there is a connection and it is logical that if the surface is 30-odd degrees warmer that it would be without the GH gases then an increase in GHGs should increase the temperature... To deny the possible effect is to deny physics..." (Jack Barrett 27.11) "We can all agree that the influence of C02 on temperature is smaller than the natural variations on different time scales. Models don't catch any cycle with a length between 10 and 100 years (and longer). ..But that doesn't prove that C02 has no influence at all, only that the influence is small, much smaller than the IPCC wants us to believe via model results... the increase of 70 ppmv in the past 50 years is almost solely the result of human emissions..."

According to Kininmonth, the "scientific emulation of radiative greenhouse effect is not possible because the effect is not clearly defined". Indeed, there are several mutually contradictory explanations of the radiative greenhouse effect in the literature... We know that the 'greenhouse effect' is a raising of the surface temperature about 33C above the radiation equilibrium temperature. But what are the processes that cause the surface temperature to rise? We can calculate that, at the average temperature of Earth, the surface IR emission will increase at about 5 W/m2/C (Stefan-BoltzMann) and the evaporative latent energy loss will be about 6 W/m2/C (Clausius-Clapeyron). For every 1 W/m2 increase in IR back radiation due to C02 increase the surface temperature will rise a little less than 0.1C. A 3W/m2 increase in back IR radiation from a doubling of C02 will increase the surface temperature by about 0.3C. Is this 'dangerous climate change'? (W. Kininmonth 13.12.07) 500 ppm unlikely to ever happen "Probably, there is not enough oil in the ground to cause any doubling of C02, and even if we burned all the coal we'd be hard pressed to increase our C02-generation energy production to a value 320% higher than 1980's, with an expected net effect of seeing a 50% increase in atmospheric C02 compared to 1980 to around 500ppmv.

Consequently, both increasing atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases and decreasing loading of atmospheric aerosols are major contributors to the top-of-atmosphere radiative forcing. We find that the climate sensitivity is reduced by at least a factor of 2 when direct and indirect effects of decreasing aerosols are included, compared to the case where the radiative forcing is ascribed only to increases in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide. We find the empirical climate sensitivity to be between 0.29 and 0.48 K/Wm_2 when aerosol direct and indirect radiative forcing is included. (Published 13 December 2007; full paper at http:// www.agu. org /pubs/crossref/2007/ 2007JD008740.shtml) Climate warming is naturally caused: no human influence: "Climate scientists at the University of Rochester, the University of Alabama, and the University of Virginia report that observed patterns of temperature changes ('fingerprints') over the last thirty years are not in accord with what greenhouse models predict and can better be explained by natural factors, such as solar variability. Therefore, climate change is 'unstoppable' and cannot be affected or modified by controlling the emission of greenhouse gases, such as C02, as is proposed in current legislation. These results are in conflict with the conclusions of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and also with some recent research publications based on essentially the same data.However, they are supported by the results of the US-sponsored Climate Change Science Program (CCSP).The report is published in the December 2007 issue of the International Journal of Climatology of the Royal Meteorological Society [DOI: 10.1002/joc. 1651]. The authors are Prof. David H. Douglass (Univ. of Rochester), Prof. John R. Christy (Univ. of Alabama), Benjamin D. Pearson (graduate student), and Prof. S. Fred Singer (Univ. of Virginia) .Lead author David Douglass said: "The observed pattern of warming, comparing surface and atmospheric temperature trends, does not show the characteristic fingerprint associated with greenhouse warming .The inescapable conclusion is that the human contribution is not significant and that observed increases in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases make only a negligible contribution to climate warming." Co-author John Christy said: "Satellite data and independent balloon data agree that atmospheric warming trends do not exceed those of the surface. Greenhouse models, on the other hand, demand that atmospheric trend values be 2-3 times greater. We have good reason, therefore, to believe that current climate models greatly overestimate the effects of greenhouse gases .Satellite observations suggest that GH models ignore negative feedbacks, produced by clouds and by water vapor, that diminish the warming effects of carbon dioxide." Co-author S. Fred Singer said: "The current warming trend is simply part of a natural cycle of climate warming and cooling that has been seen in ice cores, deep-sea sediments, stalagmites, etc., and published in hundreds of papers in peer- reviewed journals. The mechanism for producing such cyclical climate changes is still under discussion; but they are most likely caused by variations in the solar wind and associated magnetic fields that affect the flux of cosmic rays incident on the earth's atmosphere .In turn, such cosmic rays are believed to influence cloudiness and thereby</page><page sequence="30">354 Energy &amp; Environment • Vol. 19, No. 2, 2008 control the amount of sunlight reaching the earth's surface and thus the climate."

(Charles Clover, The Daily Telegraph , 30.1 1 . 2007) Temperature trend over land not global warming The temperature trend over land between 1980-2002 is estimated to exaggerate global warming during that time by 100%, according to a new paper by Ross McKitrick and Pat Michaels published in the Journal of Geophysical Research- Atmospheres (Dec. 2007). McKitrick and Michaels write: "[We] have concluded that the manipulations for the steep post- 1980 period are inadequate, and the global temperature graph showing warming is an exaggeration, at least in the past few decades. Along the way I have also found that the UN agency promoting the global temperature graph has made false claims about the quality of their data. The graph comes from data collected in weather stations around the world. Other graphs come from weather satellites and from networks of weather balloons that monitor layers of the atmosphere. These other graphs didn't show as much warming as the weather station data, even though they measure at heights where there is supposed to be even more greenhouse gas-induced warming than at the surface. The discrepancy is especially clear in the tropics. The surface-measured data has many well-known problems. Over the post-war era, equipment has changed, station sites have been moved, and the time of day at which the data are collected has changed. Many long- term weather records come from in or near cities, which have gotten warmer as they grow. Many poor countries have sparse weather station records, and few resources to ensure data quality. Fewer than one-third of the weather stations operating in the 1970s remain in operation. When the Soviet Union collapsed in the early 1990s, more than half the world's weather stations were closed in a four year span, which means that we can't really compare today's average to that from the 1980s." Has the World stopped warming? "Contrarily to what was hastily announced at Bali and repeated in news reports including on the BBC web site, the published HadCRUT data strongly support the notion that warming has stopped globally and is now limited to land in the Northern Hemisphere. For the month of November, sea-surface temperatures globally (GL) and in the Southern Hemisphere are near their 16-year low (13th and 15th value respectively), possibly due to ongoing "La Nina" effects, while NH temperatures rank only 10 out of 16... The only noteworthy warming indicator is therefore for northern landmasses alone.

According to Kiehl, a prominent climate modeller, the paradox of how GCMs with very different climate sensitivities nonetheless all more or less agree in their simulations of 20th century climate, can be explained .Kiehl found that the high sensitivity models had low aerosol forcing history and vice versa. Kiehl observed: These results explain to a large degree why models with such diverse climate sensitivities can all simulate the global anomaly in surface temperature. The magnitude of applied anthropogenic total forcing compensates for the model sensitivity. Surprisingly from a main stream climate scientist, he seems to admit that the anthropogenic forcings in the 20th century used to drive the IPCC simulations were chosen to fit the observed temperature trend. It seems to me a quite important admission. http://www.climateaudit.org/?p=2475(From Steve Mclntyre, 1.12. 2007 Is the science ambiguous? "I agree that the polarisation of opinion pro- and anti-AGW may perhaps have been moderately stable over the last few years, which is a political rather than a science phenomenon .But as Richard Courtney has pointed out many times, the science is NOT ambiguous. There is a hypothesis to be tested. That hypothesis is that human carbon dioxide emissions are causing DANGEROUS global warming. It can be tested in many ways, and it so far it has failed all tests. The most obvious is that since 1998 there has been no statistically significant increase in global average temperature despite a 15 ppm (4%) increase in atmospheric C02. The hypothesis is thereby invalidated by that test. The IPCC's other lines of argument are: 1. Evidence that ice caps are melting, storms are growing in frequency or intensity, and so on - ad infinitum. This evidence is entirely circumstantial. In not a single case has it yet been shown that any recent changes that have occurred lie outside the range of natural variation. 2. Evidence, from the hockey stick, that the late 20th century warming was unusual in either magnitude or rate. The hockey stick is completely discredited as statistical chicanery, and all solid empirical evidence points to the late 20th century warming falling well below previous natural temperature highs. 3. "Evidence", from computer GCMs, that future climate will warm. Computer GCMs are not evidence of any kind, but un validated speculations. Even IPCC high priest Kevin Trenberth admits in public (on Nature's blog, no less) that GCMs are not predictive .Left without a leg to stand on other than speculative computer models, in AR4 the IPCC has prepared the way to explain away by ad hoc mechanisms the impending decline in temperature, and to shift the environmental crisis from the atmosphere to the ocean (acidification). You underestimate the cunning and skill of these people at your peril. So, in summary, the science is not ambiguous. Nonetheless, the hypothesis of dangerous human-caused global warming remains an interesting hypothesis regarding which all true scientists are agnostic. For that there is no strong evidence that supports it at the moment does not mean that evidence might not emerge in the future. The problem is that such cautious, balanced agnosticism is getting absolutely swamped in pro- AG W hysteria from the IPCC and their many self-interested supporters. And the even bigger problem is that many otherwise able scientists are strenuously supporting the IPCC hysteria."

A 1998 World Meteorological Organization report said that, "since 1991, the linear [downward] trend observed during the 1980s has not continued, but rather total column ozone has been almost constant ..." However, the same report noted that the stratospheric concentrations of the offending compounds were still increasing through 1998. This lends credence to the sceptical view, widely derided at the time of the Montreal Protocol, that natural variations better explain the fluctuations in the global ozone layer. ... The parallels with global warming are striking. Again we face a real but greatly overhyped environmental problem. In both cases, virtually everything the public has been told that sounds terrifying isn't true - and what is true isn't particularly terrifying. But doomsayers such as Gore simply soldier on.... Perhaps decades from now, participants in the Kyoto Protocol, the global-warming treaty modelled after the Montreal Protocol, will meet and congratulate themselves because none of their scary assertions came true.

Investors spot the problem "At the top of our list is a study found in the Royal Meteorological Society's International Journal of Climatology." Researchers found that many of the computer models used to predict global warming can't even predict the past.

However, behind the more alarmist statements made in press conferences, the actual IPCC working group reports - certainly as regards the physical basis for climate change - have at least engaged to some extent with alternative explanations and forecasts for warming, and have couched their assessments more carefully and cautiously than either the public pronouncements of IPCC officials or popular discussion of climate change would suggest. So, for example, while the headlines would suggest that the Greenland ice sheet is about to melt, catastrophically resulting in sea level rises of</page><page sequence="33">Fuel for Thought 357 seven metres, the report makes clear that this process would take millennia. The report actually suggests that sea level will rise over the next century by 18-59 cm. Meanwhile, the report says: 'Current global model studies project that the Antarctic ice sheet will remain too cold for widespread surface melting and gain mass due to increased snowfall.' In other words, unless great chunks fall off the edge of the South Pole's ice sheet, the mass of ice is likely to get bigger.

This included most recently the UN Atlas of the Oceans, NOAA's Our Living Oceans - Habitat, The Strategic Plan for the US Federal Océanographie Fleet, and the US Strategic Plan for Fisheries Research.Even though none of the chapters I led said that climate warming was bad, I was still reappointed in the next go-around. I quit only when I retired from NOAA, but continue as an expert reviewer in all 3 working groups. Nevertheless, I have written privately to IPCC about my concerns, not very differently than the open letter of Chris Landsea just circulated.

Unfortunately, however, I am afraid that this great interest by the public in climatology is largely the result of a proliferating number of confusing stories in the media that are based on misinterpreted information about the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide. If the IPCC wants to represent this particular scientific field to the world, they are responsible for rectifying the great confusion and misinterpretation of scientific facts in the mind of the public.

(Those who use these</page><page sequence="34">358 Energy &amp; Environment ■ Vol. 19, No. 2, 2008 terms synonymously do not know what they are talking about.) 2. Ask the mass media to stop using scenes of large blocks of ice falling off the terminus of a glacier and of the spring break-up in the Arctic as supposedly due to the manmade greenhouse effect.(Glaciers are 'rivers of ice', so that calving is natural, and spring break-up is a normal, annual event; both have been going on from the geological time.) 3. Ask the mass medial to stop using collapsing houses built on permafrost (frozen ground) as a result of the manmade greenhouse effect.(Their collapse is due to improper construction that allows the house heat to melt the permafrost underneath the structure.) 4. Tell that sea ice in the Arctic Ocean is not a single plate of ice.(The area covered by sea ice changes considerably because of winds and ocean currents, not just by melting.) 5. Call attention to the fact that anomalous, extreme, and unusual weather phenomena are not directly related to the manmade greenhouse effect. (The manmade greenhouse effect is represented by a slow increase of temperature at the rate of 0.6"C/per 100 years.) 6. Acknowledge that the use of the so-called "hockey stick" figure in the 2001 Summary Report for Policy Makers was not appropriate. (It shows a sudden increase of temperature around 1900 after a slow decrease for 900 years, giving the impression of 'abrupt climate change'. )7. Acknowledge that the present warming trend is not unusual or abnormal in the light of past temperature changes .(There were many warmer periods than the present one, which lasted hundreds of years during the present interglacial period that began 10,000 years ago.) 8. Distinguish between the manmade greenhouse effect and a great variety of manmade environmental destructions, which are often mentioned by greenhouse advocates in the same breath. (The latter includes results from the over-harvesting of forests and fish, pollution, extinction of some species.) 9. Stop media reports telling that the sea level has already increased several meters during the last 50 years .(According to the 2007 IPCC Report, the rising rate is 1 .8mm/yer, so that the sea level increased 9 cm during the last 50 years.) 10. Scientists who study satellite data should not use the term "unprecedented changes". (They do not have satellite data before the 1970s and cannot tell if any of the changes are "unprecedented", even those that occurred in the 1930s or 1940s, not having comparable data.) 11. Encourage the mass media not to report only on sensational scientific findings that may represent the opinion of only one scientist or a few.(Reporters who are not familiar with arctic phenomena tend to report normal features as anomalous.) 12. Remind scientists to be careful about hinting at possible disaster scenarios resulting from the greenhouse effect of C02 without solid scientific bases. I believe these are reasonable requests, over which no debate is needed .The public is alarmed and thus concerned about climate change largely because they are confused by the above and other misinformation and misunderstanding, not because they are particularly interested in climatology... I am concerned about the inevitable backlash against science and scientists, when the public learns the correct information about climate change .Even if the IPCC is not directly responsible for the present confusion, they should take the necessary responsible action to help rectify the situation."

Box 757340 Fairbanks, http://people.iarc.uaf.edu/~sakasofu/ )</page><page sequence="35">Fuel for Thought 359 Bad weather and danger now predicted by media: the availability cascade In 2008, your television will bring you image after frightening image of natural havoc linked to global warming. You will be told that such bizarre weather must be a sign of dangerous climate change - and that these images are a mere preview of what's in store unless we act quickly to cool the planet. Unfortunately, I can't be more specific. ...But there's bound to be some weird weather somewhere, and we will react like the sailors in the Book of Jonah. When a storm hit their ship, they didn't ascribe it to a seasonal weather pattern. They quickly identified the cause (Jonah's sinfulness) and agreed to an appropriate policy response (throw Jonah overboard). Today's interpreters of the weather are what social scientists call availability entrepreneurs: the activists, journalists and publicity-savvy scientists who selectively monitor the globe looking for newsworthy evidence of a new form of sinfulness, burning fossil fuels. A year ago, British meteorologists made headlines predicting that the build-up of greenhouse gases would help make 2007 the hottest year on record. At year's end, even though the British scientists reported the global temperature average was not a new record - it was actually lower than any year since 2001 - the BBC confidently proclaimed, "2007 Data Confirms Warming Trend." When the Arctic sea ice last year hit the lowest level ever recorded by satellites, it was big news and heralded as a sign that the whole planet was warming. When the Antarctic sea ice last year reached the highest level ever recorded by satellites, it was pretty much ignored. A large part of Antarctica has been cooling recently. ..When Hurricane Katrina flooded New Orleans in 2005... it was supposed to be a harbinger of the stormier world predicted by some climate modellers... Droughts in California and Australia became the new harbingers of climate change.... The most charitable excuse for this bias in weather divination is that the entrepreneurs are trying to offset another bias. The planet has indeed gotten warmer, and it is projected to keep warming because of greenhouse emissions, but this process is too slow to make much impact on the public. ...Slow warming doesn't make for memorable images on television or in people's minds, so activists, journalists and scientists have looked to hurricanes, wild fires and starving polar bears instead. They have used these images to start an "availability cascade," a term coined by Timur Kuran, a professor of economics and law at the University of Southern California, and Cass R. Sunstein, a law professor at the University of Chicago. The availability cascade is a self-perpetuating process: the more attention a danger gets, the more worried people become, leading to more news coverage and more fear... Once a cascade is under way, it becomes tough to sort out risks because experts become reluctant to dispute the popular wisdom, and are ignored if they do. Roger A. Pielke Jr., a professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado, recently noted the very different reception received last year by two conflicting papers on the link between hurricanes and global warming. He counted 79 news articles about a paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, and only 3 news articles about one in a far more prestigious journal, Nature. Guess which paper jibed with the theory - and image of Katrina - presented by Al Gore's "Inconvenient Truth"? It was, of course, the paper in the more obscure journal, which suggested that global warming is creating more hurricanes. The paper in Nature</page><page sequence="36">360 Energy &amp; Environment ■ Vol. 19, No. 2, 2008 concluded that global warming has a minimal effect on hurricanes... "(Excerpt from J. Tierney, NY Times Science Section , 1.12. 2008) IPCC synthesis economics - outrage to reality "Doubtless you all have reservations about some aspect or other of the distinctly non- even-handed IPCC 2007 Synthesis Report. Here is a quick note on the economics (nothing new here - just a new context) .As you know, Dr Rajendra Pachauri - current head of IPCC - is a one-time president of the International Association for Energy Economics. (I have been a member for a couple of decades.) Ian Castles criticised the SRES "storylines", as used in IPCC 's Third Assessment Report of 2001 (TAR), because the economic growth projected for the Third World was "unimaginably-high" in the high-end (Al FI) case and "implausibly high" in the low- end (Bl) case.IPCC offered no case projecting plausible Third World economic growth .Thus, IPCC offered no genuine low-end case .In its Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of 2007, IPCC didn't revise its economics - despite the best efforts of Ian Castles and David Henderson. These shonky economics are those underpinning Table SPM. 1 (on page 7 of the Synthesis Report) - where "projected carbon dioxide equivalent concentrations", and the equivalent warming, are presented for "six SRES marker scenarios". In 2100 the low-end and high-end concentrations (Bl and A1FI) will be about 600 and 1550 ppm respectively .Bet ween 1980-1999 and the end of the 21st century, the best estimate of warming for those end-cases is 1.8 and 4.0 °C. (To express the changes since 1850-1899, add another 0.5 °C.)IPCC's high-end "storyline" has whole-world real-terms average per capita growth in goods and services of an unimaginable x35 between 1990 and 2100 - including xl 40 in developing Asia (i.e. excluding Japan, Iran and the Former Soviet Union). It then builds a scenario in which that growth is largely powered by coal - to get to 1550 ppm by 2100. Note South Africa, which had the most coal-intensive economy in the last quarter of the 20th century - because of oil-from-coal at Sasol. The low-end storyline invokes only modest economic growth in OECD, but per-capita GDP still grows a phenomenal x70 in developing Asia. Even for the balance of the developing world it will still average close to an implausible x30 .High-end or low-end, IPCC tells us that everyone will be rich by 2100. Just to put IPCC's economic nonsense in perspective, the mother of all economic miracles - Japan's per-capita GDP growth across the 20th century - was x20.In IPCC's 21st century economic paradise, that would be seen as dire failure." (Bob Foster 19.11.07) State monopoly science in action? "A new paper by Ross McKitrick of Guelph University and Patrick Michaels of the Cato Institute suggests the latest IPCC climate-change icon could be as flawed as the hockey stick... The short version is that the IPCC ignored findings related to the heat effect of people living in urban areas, and the degree to which measures of urban temperatures have been compromised over the years. It's hotter in cities not because of climate change, but simply because cities are hotter. "Claims about the amount of warming since 1980 ... should be reassessed using uncontaminated data," Mr. McKitrick says .Most revealing, however, is the scientific runaround Mr. McKitrick</page><page sequence="37">Fuel for Thought 361 experienced when, as an official IPCC external reviewer, he presented his evidence on the degree of contamination in the IPCC 's official Global Temperature Record. Not only is IPCC science in question, but on display is the IPCC's domineering bureaucratic methodology, state monopoly science in action .So now the IPCC temperature scares have been corrected at both ends. First, warming periods of the distant past were wrongly eliminated or diminished. And now the warming periods of the present have been exaggerated. What's left as proof that unprecedented anthropomorphic climate change is taking place as predicted?" (From Marc Morano http://www.nationalpost.com/story-printer.html?id=ccfdd609-3321-42d5-b9ef- 40e20fc8db33 ,6.12.07) My Nobel Moment "... I see neither the developing catastrophe nor the smoking gun proving that human activity is to blame for most of the warming we see. Rather, I see reliance on climate models (useful but never "proof') and the coincidence that changes in carbon dioxide and global temperatures have loose similarity over time. There are some of us who remain so humbled by the task of measuring and understanding the extraordinarily complex climate system that we are sceptical of our ability to know what it is doing and why. As we build climate data sets from scratch and look into the guts of the climate system, however, we don't find the alarmist theory matching observations. (The NOAA satellite data we analyze at the University of Alabama in Huntsville does show modest warming - around 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit per century, if current warming trends of 0.25 degrees per decade continue .)It is my turn to cringe when I hear overstated-confidence from those who describe the projected evolution of global weather patterns over the next 100 years, especially when I consider how difficult it is to accurately predict that system's behaviour over the next five days. Mother Nature simply operates at a level of complexity that is, at this point, beyond the mastery of mere mortals (such as scientists) and the tools available to us...." Begin all of your scientific pronouncements with 'At our present level of ignorance, we think we know . . ."'I haven't seen that type of climate humility lately."

The only major nuclear nations left outside the scheme now are the UK, Germany, Sweden and India. 1 1 December 2007 Canada joins GNEP Canada has become the 18th member of the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership which is developing new nuclear fuel cycle technologies to improve proliferation resistance while increasing recycling and reducing wastes. This brings all major uranium producers into the partnership. Iranian weapons programme halted since 2003 A consensus report by US intelligence agencies has concluded that Iran halted work on developing nuclear weapons in 2003, reversing the conclusion of a 2005 report. In its latest National Intelligence Estimate, Iran: Nuclear intentions and capabilities, the US National Intelligence Council judges "with high confidence" that Tehran halted its nuclear weapons programme in the third quarter of 2003 and is also confident that it has not to date restarted it. 4 December 2007 Thailand, China discuss nuclear co-operation China will consider a request for transfer of nuclear energy technology, according to Thai government spokesperson... Visiting Chinese defence minister Gen. Cao Gangchuan told Thai Prime Minister Chulanon that he would discuss the issue of transfer of nuclear technology with the relevant Chinese agencies. 4 December 2007 USA and Russia propose amending 'Suspension Agreement' The USA and Russia have tentatively agreed to allow limited imports of uranium from Russia, suspending an ongoing antidumping investigation. The move would allow Russia to directly supply US utilities with nuclear fuel. 5 December 2007 Russia and China share insurance As a symbolic gesture related to historic links, China and Russia have agreed to share nuclear insurance risks at a token level. The Russian nuclear insurance pool is now ten years old and comprises 23 companies covering liability of some $350 million. However it has no reinsurance links apart from Ukraine, despite having ratified the Vienna Convention, while China has well-developed nuclear insurance and plays an active part in international pools. 3 December 2007 Russian push for international business continues Russian diplomats and officials have continued their push for nuclear power contracts worldwide, addressing Bangladesh, Uruguay, Turkey, Morocco and even the UK. 3 January 2008 Russia delivers nuclear fuel to Iranian reactor On 16 December, Russia delivered the first shipment of fuel for the Bushehr nuclear</page><page sequence="39">Fuel for Thought 363 power plant, which it is helping to construct in Iran. The delivery of fuel for the plant followed months of project delays which Russia attributed to payment arrears, but which Iran blamed on pressure from Western countries. 17 December 2007 China contributes $1.4 billion to ITER China will contribute 10 billion yuan ($1.4 bn) to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Nuclear Reactor. Chinese researchers will build components and transport them to France, where construction is due to start this year. 8 January 2008 Remote control of tokamak A fusion reactor in Japan has been remotely controlled from Germany as part of preparation work for the multinational Iter project towards nuclear fusion power. 4 January 2008 Europe and Russia European energy developments on fast track The European Commission has announced plans to speed up energy technology developments including Generation IV reactors. Meanwhile, a cross-party group of 56 members of the European Parliament have signed a declaration calling for nuclear to be maintained and developed in the European Union. 23 November 2007 Nuclear energy agreed "indispensable" in EU Members of the European Parliament have voted overwhelmingly in favour of a report stating that nuclear energy is indispensable if the EU is to meet its basic energy needs in the medium term. It is the parliament's first explicit endorsement of nuclear power as Europe's largest carbon-free energy source, providing one-third of the electricity. There were 509 votes for and only 153 against the resolution, in the context of Europe relying on imports for some two-thirds of its total energy needs to 2030. Any "renunciation of nuclear power will make it impossible to achieve the objectives set regarding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and the combating of climate change." 7 December 2007 First meeting of European Nuclear Energy Forum The newly-created ENEF held its first meeting in Bratislava, Slovakia, on 26-27 November. The forum aims to promote an EU-wide debate on the role of nuclear energy in meeting future energy needs. The creation of the ENEF was initiated by the European Council in March, and the ENEF process was subsequently launched by the European Commission in June 2007. Europe approves of Belene plan The European Commission has issued a 'favourable opinion' of financial arrangements to build two new nuclear reactors at Belene in Bulgaria. 10 December Total must enter nuclear, says CEO The CEO of French oil giant Total, said in an interview with business newspaper Les Echos that he expects the company to enter the nuclear energy industry. 13 Dec. 2007</page><page sequence="40">364 Energy &amp; Environment ■ Vol. 19, No. 2, 2008 Are va lands world's biggest ever nuclear power order France's national nuclear champion Are va will build two power reactors at Taishan, China and undertake a feasibility study for a used nuclear fuel reprocessing plant as part of an Eur8 billion deal ($12 billion). Electricité de France also has involvement. It will take part of a joint venture company to build, own and operate the power units. 26 November 2007 Construction of Flamanville EPR begins Electricité de France announced that construction of the third reactor at the Flamanville nuclear power plant in Normandy started on schedule. The new reactor is a demonstration unit of Areva's 1650 MWe Evolutionary Pressurized Water Reactor (EPR). EdF said that the construction will last for 54 months until the reactor is brought into service, which is scheduled for 2012. 4 December 2007 Enel ready and waiting for Italian new build Italy is facing a worsening energy shortfall but the country's largest utility, Enel, is ready to build new nuclear plants and just waiting for the political go-ahead, according to its CEO. There are now signs that a revival of nuclear power is under consideration in Italy, with members of parliament from different ends of the political spectrum voicing their support for nuclear. 6 December 2007 Italy buys into new French nuclear plants A long-delayed agreement will see Enel, Italy's largest utility, take a 12.5% stake in Electricité de France's Flamanville-3 reactor. The agreement fulfils a 2005 cooperation agreement and commits Enel to pay its share of construction and operating costs, as well as decommissioning and waste disposal. Enel has the option to take a similar share in five future EPRs in France - a total of another 1000 MWe - and gains the right to use EPR technology. In exchange, EdF can participate in construction and operation of future Enel nuclear power plants in Italy or elsewhere in Europe and the Mediterranean. Enel's subsidiary Slovenské Elektrarne is building two 1000 MWe WER reactors at Mochovce in Slovakia. British Energy prepares for new build BE has made transmission connection agreements with National Grid for possible new nuclear plants at Sizewell, Hinkley, Dungeness and Bradwell ready for appropriate grid connections to be in place from 2016 onwards. 27 November 2007 UK life extension for limping reactors British Energy has announced a five-year life extension to 2016 for its four Hunterston B and Hinkley Point B nuclear power reactors, totaling 2435 MWe. In 2006 BE closed these AGRs on account of boiler degradation in the non-nuclear part of the plants. They were restarted in mid 2007 at about 60% capacity and BE intends to increase this to 70%. A further life extension will be considered in 2013, and is likely if electricity prices stay high.</page><page sequence="41">Fuel for Thought 365 UK centres energy policy on nuclear power "... The prime minister framed the new policy in terms of taking "determined long- term action to reduce carbon emissions," using "nuclear power [as] a tried and tested technology [which] has provided the UK with secure supplies of safe, low-carbon electricity for half a century." Nuclear currently supplies 19% of UK electricity. "Set against the challenges of climate change and security of supply, the evidence in support of new nuclear power stations is compelling," according to the minister introducing the white paper. ..Some 30-35 GWe of new generating capacity will be required in the next two decades, most of it baseload. The government itself will take active steps to open up the way for construction of new nuclear power stations by addressing siting assessment criteria and progressing the Generic Design Assessment of new reactors over three years to 2011. However, it was careful to stress that "it will be for energy companies to fund, develop and build new nuclear power stations in the UK, including meeting the full costs of decommissioning and waste management." These measures are being addressed in a new Energy Bill coming before parliament. After many years of incoherence, radioactive waste management policy is developing on a separate track, with wastes from new plants likely to end up in a single national repository. A further white paper is to set out a framework for implementing deep underground storage and disposal. ...The UK will work to strengthen the EU Emissions Trading Scheme to provide continuing incentive for investment in all low-carbon technologies, and if necessary it will introduce further measures.... However, the government is confident that the basic economics of nuclear power are attractive both for investors and the wider economy. Furthermore the carbon abatement cost with nuclear, it is claimed, is only £0.3($0.6)/tC02 compared with onshore wind (the next cheapest) at £50($100)/tC02... construction of new nuclear plants could commence in mid 2013. Several could be in operation by 2020. The levelized cost of generation is then 3.64 pence (7.13cents) per kWh.
