Lehman, however, has argued that localism should not be treated as a unidimensional construct and that an analysis of both social and cultural localism raises doubts about Roof's interpretation. This paper addresses these issues using data from a 1985 national Dutch survey. The results tend to support Lehman's assumption, with cultural localism being far more predictive of religiosity and conservative social attitudes than social localism. Parts of Roof's theory are replicated, but several aspects find no support. Possible explanations of the divergent findings are discussed. INTRODUCTION Does traditional religious commitment affect people's position on social and ethical issues? This intriguing question has been of both last- ing general intellectual interest and of particular importance to sociologists. Answers to it have implications not only for theories of religiosity and social attitudes, but might also cast light on theories of ideology, culture, and economy. Recently, the American sociologist Wade Clark Roof (1972, 1974a, 1974b, 1976, 1978) provided a new and promising answer to this question. According to his theory the relation- ships observed previously between religious commitment and various forms of social conservatism may in fact be largely spurious and may instead be simply an artefact of local community identification. Roof argues that in advanced industrial societies traditional norms and values, religious or otherwise, are likely to be more plausible and have greater legitimating power in the local social context than in society at large. Localism may therefore be considered a primary source of both traditional religiosity and social conservatism. In addition, this antecedent variable explains away the relation- ship between religiosity and some of its so-called 'consequential dimensions'. In the years since Roof first presented his localism theory, relatively little research has been done to probe his potentially important con- tribution (Ammerman, 1981; Petersen and Takayama, 1983, 1984; Lazerwitz et al., 1988). The replications of his research conducted so far have provided mixed to moderately strong support for his observations. Yet the application of regional and non-random samples and indirect measures of localism leave the question of religion and its attitudinal consequences unsettled and point to the need for additional empirical research. Moreover, in most applica- tions localism is conceived as a unidimensional construct. Edward Lehman (1986, 1988), however, has argued that localism should not be treated as a unidimensional measure but as a concept involving at least two dimensions, i.e. social and cultural localism. This paper analyses Roof's localism theory using data from a 1985 national Dutch survey. Before discussing the results, however, we shall first look into some of the substantive issues of localism theory. THE LOCALISM THESIS A major step in understanding the relationship between traditional religion and social con- servatism, Roof contends, is to determine the social enclaves within contemporary Western society in which traditional religious meaning- systems have retained their plausibility. Within</page><page sequence="2">COMMUNITY, COMMITMENT, AND CONSERVATISM modern culture it can no longer be taken for granted that traditional religious norms and values are widely shared and uniformly meaningful to all people. Social changes like secularization, individuation, and the seg- mentation of social life have watered down the churches' ability to permeate society with overarching symbols and to provide all people with meaning in the context of a comprehensive world-view. Modern Western societies offer people a variety of value- and belief-systems, both traditional and modern, religious as well as secular. Consequently, traditional religious beliefs have increasingly become one of several options among which people may choose those they consider the most plausible. Under these circumstances not only the maintenance of traditional religious beliefs, but the formation and preservation of any kind of value-system or world-view, religious or otherwise, requires a community of individuals committed to it and supporting each other in that commitment. These interaction networks confirm and reinforce definitions of reality and ensure that beliefs and world-views remain subjectively meaningful. Such a supporting network of individuals who share common beliefs and sentiments is what Peter Berger (1967) called a 'plausibility structure'. Because of the plurality of effective providers of meaning, Roof continues, the supporting plausibility structures for religion have dimin- ished in scope, from society as a whole to smaller social sectors. Traditional religious meaning-systems have increasingly become a subculture, i.e. a set of beliefs and values associated with a subsystem of interpersonal networks and institutions existing within the larger culture. They currently appear for the most part in the private sphere of the family, the local church, and the neighbourhood, and have largely come to be dependent upon primary group attachments and the small milieu of personal life to undergird them and give them plausibility. It does not follow that these communal networks have suddenly become the new social base for religious traditionalism; on the contrary, they have always been the stronghold of religion. It only follows that in modern society the bedrock of traditional Christianity is increasingly restricted to smaller 'subworlds' of social experience, like the local community and its interpersonal networks. Hence, one sphere of social experience which in Roof's view continues to serve as a plausibility structure for traditional religion and the established church is the local residential community. Local community orientations are therefore expected to have plausibility- maintaining effects and are thus considered to be an important source of traditional religiosity in modern society. Following Robert Merton (1957), these orientations are taken by Roof to vary on a local-cosmopolitan reference group continuum, ranging from the local community to the broader national society. Essentially, however, the continuum gauges the degree to which individuals are attached to their social locale. While locals have strong local attachments and identifications, cosmopolitans, in contrast, have shifted their commitments away from the immediate social environment. They identify with and relate themselves to issues, events, and social organizations outside the local community, to society as a whole. Local community orientations are expected to have implications for both the belonging and meaning aspects of religiosity (Greeley, 1972). As to the belonging component, Roof maintains that religious involvement offers locally-oriented people opportunities to develop communal bonds, which they value highly and which provide them with a sense of social location. In addition, locals are more exposed to the normative influences of primary groups that have traditionally supported religious participa- tion, such as the family and ethnic groups. Turning to the meaning component of religion, it is argued that traditional religious beliefs are more congruent with the life-styles and daily experiences of locals and hence produce fewer cognitive strains. A possible explanation for this may be that locals are inclined to personalize the social world and tend to view reality in a concrete manner, relevant to their own lives. They conceive reality in such a way that orthodox religious beliefs, for example, or anthropomorphic conceptions of God, obtain plausibility of meaning. This is not to suggest 124</page><page sequence="3">EUROPEAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW that cosmopolitans find their faith irrelevant or anachronistic. But rather than putting stress, as locals do, on creedal formulas and loyalty to the local church, cosmopolitans emphasize the existential meanings of their faith. Religion is relevant to them mainly as part of their quest for ultimate meaning in life. As developed by Roof, localism theory is a specification of the secularization thesis (Dobbelaere, 1981: 140-3). It argues that the segregation of religious and non-religious spheres of social life have lessened the extent to which religious norms and values inform public realms. Religion today is only one of the many institutions which offer meaning-systems, the result being that both its reach and its plausibility have declined. This argument that religion has lost its overarching claim and control over society corresponds with the interpretation of secularization as a process of laicization of social institutions. Moreover, it is also consistent with secularization in the sense of the churches' shrink- ing reach and the resulting decline in personal religious commitment. In addition, Roof's theory is related to the value structure or value commit- ment theory, which emerged from the finding of a widening cleavage in the United States between a growing modernist subculture of counter- cultural values and the traditional culture of conventional life-styles and practices, supported by the established churches (Roof, 1984). Social correlates of religious commitment Roof's localism theory not only provides a potentially significant contribution to a sociolo- gical explanation of the sources of religious commitment; it also helps in understanding how some of its traditional correlates, specifically education, geographical mobility, urbanization, and age, shape and give substance to traditional church religion. Education is theorized by Roof (1978) not only as having a negative impact on social conservatism, but also as generating opposing influences on religious commitment- a direct positive status effect and an indirect negative exposure effect via localism. On the one hand, education is related to social status which, in the US social context, tends to be associated with religious participation as a symbolic means of representing a middle-class position (Stark and Bainbridge, 1988). On the other hand, however, education exposes individuals to new perspectives, values, and life-styles, and broadens their mental horizons. And these experiences may easily have the effect of creating doubts about traditional religious concerns. Geographical mobility is anticipated to have the same influence as learning. Individuals on the move geograph- ically are often also on the move intellectually and tend to become culturally more diversified. Both residential and mental mobility may reduce the individual's attachment to the social locale which, in turn, may weaken religious commit- ment (Thielbar, 1970). Likewise, localism is also expected to mediate the effect of urbanization on religious commitment, because urban living facilitates opportunities to adopt a more cosmopolitan outlook which, successively, may undermine traditional religious concerns. Finally, age is also supposed to have a bearing on both traditional religiosity and localism. Although it is very unsafe to generalize about the religious trends involved in aging, few sociologists of religion would question that, in general, religious involvement is higher for older persons. In addi- tion, age is relevant to localism because the longer people reside in a given community, the more likely they are to develop attachments to it and to possess a localistic world-view. Accordingly, age is an important control variable positively related to length of residence-an indicator of geograph- ical mobility. In sum, localism is considered to be an important linkage mediating the effects of education, geographical mobility, urbaniza- tion, and age on religious commitment. Consequences of religious commitment As pointed out above, traditional religious beliefs and practices are viewed as closely related to the narrow and parochial perspectives on life typical of those whose horizons do not extend beyond the local community. However, locals' limited world-view is also expected to manifest itself in conservative social attitudes. Locally- oriented individuals define the social world in restrictive and unsophisticated terms. It will therefore not upset any intuitive conception to reason that such individuals espouse traditional non-religious values and conservative life-styles. The inference drawn by Roof is that the confined 125</page><page sequence="4">COMMUNITY, COMMITMENT, AND CONSERVATISM perspective wrought by localism is partly responsible for the relationship that has frequently been posited between religious commitment and social conservatism (see, for example, Wuthnow, 1973). His localism theory contends that there is indeed a relationship between traditional religious beliefs and social conservatism, but that this relationship is actually epiphenomenal of a localistic world outlook and its attitudinal ramifications. Conceptual ambiguity and refinements Although Roof's empirical research appears to bolster his theoretical arguments, it also raises an issue which merits special attention. Roof conceives localism as a measure of embeddedness in the local residential community. Yet he obscures the meaning of the concept by adding that it is also a measure of the individual's 'breadth of perspective'. Distinctions have been drawn between the narrow-minded and the broad-minded, the naive and the sophisticated, which approximate to the local-cosmopolitan divide. Moreover, when referring to localism Roof frequently oscillates between locality orientation and breadth of perspective as if they were two co-equal elements of the same phenomenon.1 To avoid conceptual ambiguity localism and breadth of perspective should be treated as two different concepts. While localism deals with the individual's involvement in the social locale, breadth of perspective refers to the breadth of the individual's cognitive meaning- systems or world-view. It may be that because of the 'myopia' of small-town life, localism and breadth of perspective vary concomitantly, but to enhance conceptual clarity and to avoid contamination the two phenomena should be kept distinct.2 The definitional obscurity surrounding localism is probably due to its operationalization. Lehman (1986, 1988) has argued that the indicators used by Roof do not conceptualize the attachment to a geographically bounded social locale, but instead concentrate on the values and meanings individuals attach to local symbols, local life-styles and local affairs-in short, to local community life in general. Consequently, much of what Roof has attributed to localism may be more a matter of the values individuals attach to any local community, than of community attachment per se. To examine this assumption, Lehman refined the localism concept by distinguishing between cultural localism: the values and meanings individuals attach to local community life in general; and social localism: locality identification. His findings appear to provide weak (Lehman, 1988) or no support (Lehman, 1986) for Roof's hypothesis that local community involvement immerses people in plausibility structures which encourage religious activity. Research objectives Roof examined his theory using data from US regional samples of Southern Baptists (Roof, 1972) and Episcopalians (Roof, 1974a, 1974b, 1976, 1978) and found it, by and large, to be sustained. Our interest is to determine the theory's generalizability beyond mainstream Protestant groups by using data from a nationwide Dutch survey. This paper examines the influence of both social and cultural localism on church involvement, Christian belief, and the related dimensions of ethnic prejudice, cultural conservatism, and nationalism. In addition, it also examines the role social and cultural localism play in mediating the effects of education, geographical mobility, urbanization, and age on religiosity and social conservatism. DATA AND MEASURES Data were taken from the 1985 national survey 'Social and Cultural Developments in the Netherlands'. Following a stratified probability sampling technique, designed to represent the adult population living in private households, 1,045 respondents were selected from the general population. Readers who require further information on the survey design and the research sample are encouraged to consult the documentation by Felling et al. (1987). The respondents ranged in age from 18 to 70, with a mean age of 40.7 years. Education was indicated by the highest educational attainment; the seven-point scale ranged from elementary school to university. Geographical mobility was measured by a quasi-interval scale combining 126</page><page sequence="5">EUROPEAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW length of residence in the present location (measured in actual years) and number of removals over the past ten years. Urbanization, a rural-urban continuum, was indexed by several measures drawn from census material of the Netherlands' Central Bureau of Statistics, including population size, density, and hetero- geneity (percentage rural farm population). To cover cultural localism, four indicators were selected from the items developed by Roof (1978); one additional statement was introduced for the present study. The cultural localism items reflect interest in local news rather than national or international events; agreement with the idea that involvement in local clubs can be more rewarding than participation in nationwide organizations; the importance of family cred- entials for someone aspiring to a public office in the community; and stress on the value of local communities compared with large cities. Social localism was operationally defined by four items newly devised for use in this research. These items deal with the respondents' neighbourhood and concentrate on the identific- ation with this particular place. The Christian belief scale encompassed a set of ten Likert- format items that measured the degree of acceptance or rejection of the existence of a personal God and a transcendental realm, as well as the belief that fundamental aspects of human life such as life itself, suffering and death, and good and evil possess a supernatural meaning. Church involvement was measured by asking the respondents about their past and present religious involvement; their parents' church membership; church attendance; and participation in special church activities. Because the items were found to yield a unidimensional Guttman scale (scalability = 0.91, reproducibility =0.97), responses were combined so as to produce a six-point involvement index ranging from low to high. The criterion for selection of the consequential dimensions was whether they had been used previously in local-cosmopolitan research. As indicated above, three variables were finally settled upon: nationalism, ethnic prejudice, and cultural conservatism. The instrument used to measure nationalism consisted of seven state- ments dealing with the superiority of Holland and the native Dutch. The items reveal attachment to traditional Dutch values, conformity with the ways of the prevailing group, and rejection of other populations as outgroups. Outgroup rejection by autochthonous Dutch was also brought into focus by the ten-item ethnic prejudice scale. This measure assessed a stereo- typed negative attitude toward Holland's ethnic minorities. The instrument measuring cultural conservatism was constructed as a composite of three multi-item subscales: (i) restriction of civil liberties (the right of free speech and free publication, the right to criticize the Royal House, to refuse military service, to dem- onstrate); (ii) resistance to human interventions in life and death (abortion, euthanasia, and suicide); and (iii) traditional imagery of woman (agree-disagree responses to the following statements, abbreviated here: 'Women are better suited to raise children than men'; 'Education is less important for girls than for boys'; 'Boys can be brought up freer than girls'; and 'It's unnatural for women to give guidance to men'). Data reduction For the purpose of data reduction, the correlation matrix of the attitude items was obtained and this matrix was then subjected to the iterative principal-axis extraction technique (SPSSX, PA2). Four criteria for determining the appropriateness of the factor model were employed, including mean inter-item correlation (&gt; .20), eigenvalue (&gt; 1.0), Kaiser-Meyer- Olkin's measure of sampling adequacy (&gt;.60), and communality (&gt; .20). As would be expected, the items appeared to have six factors in common. The resulting matrices were then rotated to 'simple structure' using the direct oblimin option in SPSSX. The results are shown in Table 1 along with the reliability of the six sets of items determined by item analysis. A cursory examination of the factor pattern structure indicates that there is little overlap in the items that go into the factors. All but two of the items (VI: 2 and VI: 3) have a substantial loading only on the factor they were assumed to measure. Conversely, all factors, including social and cultural localism, centre on the items incorporated into the survey to indicate them. Hence, localism breaks down into a social and 127</page><page sequence="6">COMMUNITY, COMMITMENT, AND CONSERVATISM TABLE 1 Factor pattern matrix: dimension, scale item, loading, communality, and Cronbach's alpha (N= 1045) Dimensions and scale items Factor pattern loadings h2 I II III IV V VI(a) I Ethnic prejudice (Cronbach's alpha =.91) 1 Most Turks are easy-going .81 .64 2 With Moroccans you never know for certain whether or not they are going to be aggressive .80 .67 3 Gypsies are never to be trusted .78 .65 4 Most Surinammers are slow workers .78 .54 5 Surinammers are short-tempered .76 .58 6 Gypsies drive around in big trailers at the expense of the tax-payer .74 .59 7 Most Moroccans are rude people .70 .50 8 Foreigners carry all kinds of dirty smells around .69 .51 9 Turks have so many children because they are slightly backward .67 .48 10 When you are dealing with Jews, you have to be extra careful .67 .51 II Christian belief (Cronbach's alpha=.96) 1 There is a God who wants to be a God for us .96 .83 2 There is a God who is concerned with every human being personally .94 .82 3 There is a God whom we can know through Jesus Christ .90 .74 4 God takes care that good will finally overcome evil .89 .81 5 There is a God whose Kingdom will come .87 .71 6 All the good in the world finally comes from God .83 .77 7 Life is meaningful, only because there is a God .78 .70 8 Sorrow and suffering have a meaning, only if you believe in God .69 .66 9 Death has a meaning, only if you believe in God .65 .54 10 You can bear a lot of pain during illness, if you believe in God .56 .44 III Social localism (Cronbach's alpha=.75) 1 I am entirely content with my neighbourhood .86 .69 2 I really feel at home in my neighbourhood .85 .67 3 I would not like to live anywhere else but here .54 .40 4 I know most of the people in my neighbourhood .41 .29 IV Nationalism (Cronbach's alpha = .81) 1 We, the Dutch people, have reason to be proud of our history .68 .55 2 We, the Dutch people, are always willing to pull our load .62 .40 3 Other countries can learn a lot of good things from our country .60 .33 4 I am proud to be Dutch .59 .47 5 Generally speaking, Holland is a better country than most other countries .58 .30 (continued) 128</page><page sequence="7">EUROPEAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW TABLE 1 (continued) Dimensions and scale items Factor pattern loadings h2 I II III IV V VI(a) IV Nationalism (Cronbach's alpha =.81) (continued) 6 Dutch people are beloved throughout the world .47 .26 7 While striving for international co-operation, we have to take care that no typical Dutch customs get lost .45 .36 V Cultural localism (Cronbach's alpha =.71) 1 Local news is often more interesting than news about events happening elsewhere .71 .50 2 Newspapers generally pay much too little attention to all sorts of local news .64 .39 3 It is better to be a member of a local community club than of a nationwide association .57 .38 4 Big cities are indeed important, but the small local community is our country's backbone .44 .39 5 When it comes to choosing someone for a responsible office in my community, I prefer persons who were born and raised here .33 .39 VI Cultural conservatism (Cronbach's alpha=.57) 1 Resistance to human interventions in life and death .42 .44 2 Restriction of civil liberties .25 .38 .34 3 Traditional imagery of women .23 .30 .41 Eigenvalues:(b) Unrotated untruncated solution 11.1 5.5 2.7 1.7 1.4 1.1 Unrotated truncated solution 10.7 5.1 2.2 1.3 1.1 0.9 Obliquely rotated solution 10.1 5.0 2.1 1.5 1.4 1.2 Total percent of explained variance: 52.7% Factor correlations: I II III IV V VI I Ethnic prejudice 1.00 II Christian belief .31 1.00 III Social localism .22 .24 1.00 IV Nationalism .66 .42 .32 1.00 V Cultural localism .52 .42 .47 .57 1.00 VI Cultural conservatism .47 .56 .30 .49 .50 1.00 Notes: (a) Roman numeral refers to the order in which the factors appear in the obliquely rotated solution.

The data in Table 1 reveal that the attitude scales possessed quite acceptable psychometric properties. All factors accounted for a passable proportion of the variance in the variables and the reliability coefficients (Cronbach's alpha) suggested a reasonable degree of internal consistency for each scale. ANALYSES AND FINDINGS To examine localism theory, regression analyses were applied to the data. First, multivariate regressions (MANOVA) were performed to decide which predictor variables contributed significantly (p&lt;.05) to criterion variation. Next, standardized regression coefficients were obtained from univariate regressions excluding predictor variables that failed to reach sig- nificance.3 A summary table of the results is displayed as Table 2. The total effects of the predictor variables are shown in the unbracketed columns; figures in brackets represent their direct effects. The significance test discussed by Sobel (1987) was used to obtain t-values for the indirect effects. In various respects, the Dutch data resemble the findings presented by Roof. On some points, however, the results diverge. Background variables Roof found that length of residence has a positive impact on the consequential measures via its influence on localism and then through religious commitment. The findings pertaining to geographical mobility-the reversal of length of residence (combined with number of removals) -echo this observation. The effects are all negative, though weakly so, and they are mediated by the two localism subdimensions. The largest effects of both geographical mobility and urbanization are those on social and cultural localism. The direct effects of urbanization on the other variables, with the exception of nationalism, lack significance, and its negative indirect effects flow via social and cultural 130</page><page sequence="9">EUROPEAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW localism. Roof's findings concerning the impact of age are generalizable to the Netherlands as well. Age has positive effects on localism, religiosity, and the consequential dimensions. Similarly, education shows appreciable direct or indirect negative effects on all variables in the model. No support, however, is found for Roof's (1978: 110) observation that 'education generates status pressure leading into the direction of church participation'. On the contrary, in present-day Holland higher education predicts non-membership and less religious activity and this negative, though weak, effect is entirely indirect and flows via localism. Social and cultural localism The findings also support Roof's observation concerning the relationship between localism and the belonging aspects of religion. The positive effect of social localism on church involvement points to the role of local community attachments as a source of religious activity. However, the influence of social localism on church involvement should not be over-emphasized. Age and cultural localism appear to be more important in this regard. Perhaps the most striking finding apparent in Table 2 is that social localism has no relevance to the explanation of Christian belief, cultural conservatism, or nationalism. Moreover, its negative effect on ethnic prejudice is in the opposite direction from what Roof's model leads us to expect. Accordingly, no evidence emerges here for the general picture Roof portrayed about local communities now constituting the plausibility structure for the belief component of religious commitment and conservative attitudes. Cultural localism is far more predictive than social localism. Hence, the results contradict the local community aspects of Roof's theory and support Lehman's argument that cultural localism is the crucial variable rather than local community identification. Finally, our empirical findings do not replicate Roof's observation concerning insignificant relationships between religious beliefs and conservative social attitudes. As can be seen, Christian belief exerts a moderately strong influence on both ethnic prejudice and nationalism and quite a strong effect on cultural conservatism. This observation is inconsistent with Roof's assertion of spuriousness and suggests instead that religious beliefs per se may stimulate certain kinds of conservatism. DISCUSSION Roof's approach to understanding religious commitment in contemporary mass society highlights the function of the local community in maintaining plausibility. Localism, it is argued, encourages religious activity, preserves the plausibility of traditional religious beliefs, and explains away the spurious associations between religious orientation and social con- servatism. Having tested localism theory in the Netherlands, we now arrive at several conclusions about its generalizability. One of the findings of this study is that localism is best conceived of as a two-dimensional concept. The present research replicates the distinction proposed by Lehman between the values and meanings associated with local community life in general, cultural localism, and the attachments to a geographically bounded social locale, social localism. While our analysis tends to support some of Roof's ideas and observations, several aspects of his theoretical framework are not replicated here. The findings concerning the background variables call for little discussion. By and large the results echo Roof's observation of education, urbanization, and geographical mobility having negative and age having positive effects on localism, religiosity, and social conservatism. The Dutch data only go against his US finding that education shows a direct positive status effect on religious participation. In Holland educational experiences tend to weaken institutional commitment (via localism). The relatively strong influence of age on religious involvement represents the combined result of an aging or life-cycle effect, a cohort effect (the influence of childhood socialization at a given time-period), and a period effect (the influence of a historical time-period on all people). In the absence of longitudinal data it is virtually impossible to adequately isolate and compare the effects they have on religion. 131</page><page sequence="10">COMMUNITY, COMMITMENT, AND CONSERVATISM Previous empirical studies indicate, however, that religious disaffiliation in the Netherlands is probably not a life-cycle event, i.e. the pattern is not one of a movement away from religion when young and then a reclaiming of affiliation when old. In the past several decades the Dutch have gradually been giving up religious affiliation over both historical periods and generations (Sasaki and Suzuki, 1987; Felling and Peters, 1988). The results of the current study are also consistent with Roof's ideas about the inter- vening role of localism. As a summary statement, the background variables affect religion and conservative social attitudes directly and/or indirectly through their impact on social and cultural localism. The outcome that social localism is predictive of church involvement supports his argument that locality identification stimulates religious activity, although the effect is not as strong as we would have expected given Roof's theoretical model. In contrast to his observations, however, social localism appears to occur independently of Christian belief. Accordingly, the data do not warrant the conclusion that local communities now constitute plausibility structures for the meaning com- ponent of religious commitment. Nor do findings support Roof's observation that the relationships between religiosity and conservative social attitudes are an expression of localistic orientations. Some of the effects of Christian belief are quite strong, particularly the influence on cultural conservatism. This result not only raises questions about the assertion of spuriousness, but also supports Wuthnow's (1973) argument that the consequential effects of religious commitment vary depending on measures of both religiosity and conservatism. Lastly, the present findings stress the importance of including cultural localism as an additional explanatory variable in research on the relevance of religion for non-religious domains of thought. In Holland, at least, ignoring this variable could become a source of fruitless debates over the social consequences of religious commitment. Although the implications of the findings are fairly clear, it would be premature to conclude that Roof's local community assumptions are simply inadequate to the task of understanding religious commitment and its consequences. There are several possible explanations for the differences between the patterns described in this study and those noted by Roof. One plausible explanation, of course, is that the dissimilarities are simply due to the distinction between social and cultural localism, not pursued by Roof. Another possibility may be that while Roof's research (conducted in the late 1960s) is confined to regional samples of mainstream Protestant groups, this enquiry examined a 1985 national sample of Dutch citizens. But the results of the present study may also be unique due to the measures of religious belief used. Whereas Roof analysed the accept- ance of traditional beliefs about God, eternal life, the soul, heaven and hell, this study examined the endorsement of general theistic expressions. Perhaps the predictor variables do not correlate with religious orthodoxy in the way they have with Christian belief in this survey. Another explanation takes into account cross- national differences between Holland and the United States: of the many contrasts between the countries that can be made, two are particularly worth noting. First, the countries differ with respect to their demographic setting. The United States has, for example, an average of 65 inhabitants per square mile. In contrast, the Netherlands has an average of almost 1,200, making it one of the most densely populated countries in the world. Under these divergent circumstances, local communities and community attachments acquire very different meanings. Second, with respect to the United States, the secularization thesis-the notion that religions are an anachronistic throwback to a pre-modern era and that modernizing societies inevitably move away from them-is at best premature. Religion in America is neither dead nor dying: standard religious indicators such as the belief in God, heaven, eternal life, the divinity of Jesus, and church attendance rates (with the possible exception of the post-conciliar decline in Catholic churchgoing in the early 1970s) show virtually no change since 1940 (Hout and Greeley, 1987; Greeley, 1989). Holland, on the other hand, has witnessed a tremendous change 132</page><page sequence="11">EUROPEAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW in its religious landscape since the beginning of the twentieth century and has inevitably felt the tensions and strains of modernization. Religious indifference has marched on apace and meta- physical conceptions of man and the cosmos have taken on an increasingly marginal role. Repeated Dutch surveys trace a decline in the proportion of people claiming a religious preference, a decline in religious practices such as church attendance, a decline in the participation in religious rites of passage, a decline in religious endogamy, and so forth. All show a downward trend in identification with and adherence to traditional Christianity, in the direction of secularity. Because the credibility of traditional religious perspectives seems to be more problematic in the Netherlands than in the United States, plausibility structures are probably more crucial for the maintenance of church religion in Holland. However, not all local communities function as a social base for traditional religion, an issue entirely overlooked in localism research. Roof's proposition that local communities now constitute plausibility structures for traditional religiosity implicitly rests on the assumption that local communities are religious communities. This, however, should not be taken for granted. In Holland, at least, there are numerous communities which are not very religious in terms of the inhabitants' attitudes and behaviour. Hence, attachment to those locales will probably not serve to reinforce traditional beliefs and practices. Rather than equating local communities with religious communities, a multi- level research programme might be designed to investigate both the individual and contextual effects of community on religious commitment. NOTES 1. At times localism is described as local community orientation and viewed as a product of limited experiences and narrow horizons (Roof, 1974a), at others localism is referred to as a measure of 'breadth of perspective' (Roof, 1974b; italics added). Both definitions were even conjoined: 'To obtain a measure of breadth of perspective, we utilized a local- cosmopolitan scale. Three items, all validated in previous research, were designed to measure an individual's orientation to, and involvement in, local community affairs.' (Roof and Perkins, 1975: 117). 2. A similar argument was set forth by Tamney (1979), who proposed a distinction between local involvement and broadness of interest and Ammerman (1981: 344), who reasoned that 'though individual breadth of perspective is theoretically a very important explanatory variable in understanding religious and political ideology, localism is simply not the same thing. At best, the two are highly correlated.' 3. The regression coefficients in the multivariate model are identical to the univariate estimates for each dependent variable taken separately. It is only in the tests of significance and confidence intervals that the multivariate results depart from the univariate findings (Finn, 1974).
