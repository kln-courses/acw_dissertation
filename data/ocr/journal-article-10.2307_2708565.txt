<plain_text><page sequence="1">THERIOPHILY IN ANTIQUITY: A SUPPLEMENTARY ACCOUNT BY JAMES E. GILL The origins in antiquity of theriophily or animalitarianism-the conve- nient labels given by George Boas and Arthur 0. Lovejoy1 to the concept underlying the inversion of human and animal traits and the argument that animals are in some way superior to men-have been ably sketched by Boas and by the editors of the first volume of A Documentary History of Primi- tivism and Related Ideas.2 However, despite their brilliance and thoroughness in tracing the development of theriophilic arguments, there is considerable evidence relating to the growth of the tradition which they have not reported. The purpose of this article, therefore, is to supplement their account of the sources and to articulate more clearly the relationships among them. Although earlier allusions to or expressions of the tradition occur, its his- tory as a more or less coherent notion properly begins-as Lovejoy and Boas note-with Aristotle's discussions of the powers of the animal or sensitive "soul" in his Historia animalium, discussions which allow to animals greater intellective powers in potentia than the more rigid definitions of the De anima. A more direct "Aristotelian" influence on the tradition, however, was in all likelihood the view of Aristotle's pupil and successor Theophrastus, who apparently argued on the basis of the physical similarities between man and brute that there is a close mental kinship between them. Theophrastus thus acknowledges that "differences of degree no doubt occur on the most ex- tensive level; but there are no really qualitative distinctions with regard either to the intellect or the emotions, and still less with regard to sense-perception. In the mental as in the physical sphere the 'fundamental ingredients' or ele- mentary facts are the same."4 'In The Happy Beast in French Thought of the Seventeenth Century (Baltimore, 1933), 1, and A Documentary History of Primitivism and Related Ideas, Vol. I: Primi- tivism and Related Ideas in Antiquity (Baltimore, 1935), 389-420. 2See Boas, 18f. and passim, and Lovejoy, Boas, et al., 389-420. 3Ibid., 390-391. See also 389ff. Most of the early references listed here (Alcmaeon, Anaxagoras, Archelaus, and Socrates) really represent favorable comparison of man with beast. The reference to Xenophon's Memorabilia (I, iv, 2 and IV, iii, 9-12) and the passages from the pseudo-Platonic Axiochus alluded to by Boas (22) really only involve the question of whether the beasts live more pleasurable lives than men; such passages are probably anti-Hedonistic or anti-Epicurean arguments-see A. E. Taylor, Plato: The Man and His Work (New York, 1956), 550-552-and do not involve arguments supporting the moral superiority of beast over man. I am unable to account for the Democritean fragment quoted by Lovejoy and Boas (391), and can only conjecture that praise of animal intelligence is often, but not always, attendant on a monistic philosophy. I should also add that Pythagorean respect for animals may have influ- enced the theriophily of the Cynics and of Plutarch. On this subject see C. J. DeVo- gel, Pythagoras and Early Pythagoreanism (Assen, 1966), 150, 162, 181, 186, and 271; Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers, trans. R. D. Hicks, 2 vols.

GILL Thus in Theophrastus this coalescence of the functions of the sensitive and rational soul leads to the view that soul is a "self-developing activity, under the concept of a cosmic process," a notion which eventually led his follower Strato of Lampsacus to obliterate "completely the limits between reason and the lower activities of ideation."5 Consequently, for Strato the "activity of the soul, which some had thought reserved to the highest intellectual operations, is indispensable to the simplest perceptions."6 The result of such modifica- tions or developments of Aristotelian hylomorphism inevitably is a greater re- spect for the intelligence of animals and in fact led to a monism and doctrine of immanence, which in turn could be used to sanction the "natural" activities of animals. That, in any event, was the effect of similar doctrines which the Stoics began to develop during this same period.7 These later redactions of Aristotelian views account at least for some of the earliest expressions of the unfavorable comparison of man with beast quoted by Lovejoy and Boas, particularly those fragments by Menander, who is known to have been a student of Theophrastus.8 One fragment, for example, laments the fact that human evil arises in part from man's "inventiveness" and consequent alienation from nature: All the animals are most blessed and have much more intelligence than man. Look first at this ass. He is admittedly born under an unlucky star. No evil comes to him through himself, but whatsoever evils Nature has given him, these he has. But we, aside from the necessary evils, invent others by ourselves. We are pained if someone sneezes; if someone speaks ill, we are angry; if someone has a dream, we are frightened; if an owl hoots, we are terri- fied. Struggles, opinions, contests, laws, all these evils are added to those in nature.9 And an earlier fragment, even more specific in its condemnation of human society, reveals men's insensitivity to principles of "natural justice." This animal [man] alone wins success unjustly and does ill. The best horse has better care than the others. If you are a good dog, you are much more highly honored than a bad dog. A well-born cock lives on a particular kind of food, the low-born fears his better. A man even if he is good, well-born, well- bred, has no advantage among the present generation. ... To be born an ass would be better than to see one's inferiors living more splendidly than oneself. 10 Laurie Magnus and G. G. Berry, 4 vols. (London, 1955), IV, 495. The main argument of Theophrastus' lost work "On Piety," which embodied these arguments, is known pri- marily through Porphyry's De abstinentia and through Plutarch's De sollertia animalium. The occasion for the defense of animals in "On Piety" is Theophrastus' op- position to the practice of animal sacrifice. For similar arguments see Ovid, Metamor- phoses, XV, v. 116ff. and 463ff. According to Gomperz (IV, 495) Theophrastus also apparently wrote a separate work now lost, "On the Intelligence and Disposition of Animals." 5Wilhelm Windelband, A History of Philosophy, trans.

It is probably safe, however, to regard them as standard comic comparisons given currency by contemporary philosophical specula- tion.' Another possible philosophical influence on theriophilic utterances in the New Comedy may have been Cynic comparison of man with beast. Although, as Lovejoy and Boas note, there is no direct evidence that the early Cynics em- ployed animalitarian arguments, theriophily is entirely consistent with the Cynic austere program of a life of bare subsistence, a life deprived of the com- forts and superfluities of civilization.'2 And there is some evidence that even Diogenes determined the "real" needs of men by comparing men with crea- tures who managed to live without the "benefits" of civilization.13 Certainly one argument supporting early Cynic use of animalitarian argu- ments is the complex and ambiguous role of their philosophical cousins, the Stoics, in the development of theriophily. Like the later Cynics, some Stoics also apparently employed the comparison of man with animal for ethical in- struction, although the Stoics almost inevitably moderated and modified Cynic ideas.14 The Stoics argued that just as the beasts live according to their na- ture, so man ought to live according to his. But whereas the Cynic doctrine im- plied the equality of all creatures under nature and condemned the unnatural- fragments from Philemon see 393-395. "See Webster, 202-203, who explains Fragm. 534 as "referring to the Aristotelian distinction between 'natural' or 'general' and 'super-added appetites' "-a reference to Nichomachean Ethics 1118b, 8. Certainly as germane a reference is Politics 1253a, 30- which I quote from Aristotle's Politics, trans. Benjamin Jowett (New York, 1943), 55: "For man, when perfected, is the best of animals, but when separated from law and jus- tice, he is the worst of all; since armed injustice is the more dangerous, and he is equipped at birth with arms, meant to be used by intelligence and virtue which he may use for the worst ends. Wherefore, if he have not virtue, he is the most unholy and the most savage of animals, and the most full of lust and gluttony." Possibly a Theophrastan comment on these Aristotelian themes is Menander's real source; yet another, more remote possibility is the presence of Cynic influence. "2This discussion of Cynicism is drawn from Donald R. Dudley, A History of Cyni- cism from Diogenes to the 6th Century A. D. (London, 1937), esp. 32, 82, 184, and 200; Farrand E. Sayre, Diogenes of Sinope: A Study in Greek Cynicism (Baltimore, 1939), passim; and Lovejoy and Boas, 117-52 and 391-393. "3Diogenes Laertius, II, 25, and Dudley, 32. Note that Diogenes Laertius' source of this anecdote is Theophrastus. See also the views attributed to Diogenes by Dio Chrysostom quoted in Lovejoy and Boas, 393. Cynics also figure prominently in. the art of adoxographical writings, or "mock" forms such as the encomia, laudes, or lauda- tiones, which frequently praise the insignificant or abhorrent-including animals-and thereby parody their serious counterparts. For a study of adoxographical forms and their practitioners-including Dio Chrysostom, Fronto, Favorinus, Proteus the Cynic, Libianus, Lucian, Philostratus, and Synesius-see A. S. Pease, "Things without Honor," Classical Philology, XXI (1926), 27-42; Pease also provides a significant con- nection with the Renaissance paradoxists discussed by Boas, 10-17.

GILL ness of civilized men, the Stoics argued that man's nature differs from that of the beasts, for man possesses reason as an essential characteristic.15 Thus, just as animals are true to their instinctive nature, so man, argued the Stoics, ought to be true to his rational nature. This analogy is given point by the Stoic belief that Nature regulates the activities of animals in a beneficent way, for animals pursue only what is appropriate to them. Consequently the lives of the beasts are but manifestations of a higher power, or universal or- der, of the logos. 16 Thus, despite the very real differences between Cynicism and Stoicism, both schools employed the unfavorable comparison of man with beast in simi- lar fashion, and both at times appear to subscribe to the same type of "hard" primitivism, especially in criticizing the superfluities and excesses of civilized societies. Seneca, for example, exclaims in Cynic fashion against luxuries and their makers and not only contrasts primitive society with weaker "artificial" societies, but also uses animals as norms. How, I ask, can you consistently admire both Diogenes and Daedalus. Which of these two seems to you a wise man-the one who devised the saw, or the one who, on seeing the boy drink water from the hollow of his hand, forthwith took his cup from his wallet and broke it .... If mankind were willing to listen to this sage, they would know that the cook is as superfluous to them as the soldier. Those were wise men, or at any rate like the wise, who found the care of the body a problem easy to solve. The things that are indispensable require no elaborate pains for their acquisition; it is only luxuries that call for labor. Follow nature, and you will need no skilled craftsmen.... Nature was not so hostile to man that, when she gave all the other animals an easy role in life, she made it impossible for him alone to live without these artifices.17 of Greek Philosophy, trans. L.

The position of orthodox Stoics on this matter is that animals exist for man's benefit-see the exposition of the Stoic Balbus in Cicero's Of the Nature of the Gods, trans. C. D. Yonge (London, 1902), 74ff.-and probably hinged on their distinction between logos endiathetios (ratio) or the immanent reason of the world and logos prophorikos (oratio) or the reason inherent in human discourse. Both are ultimately functions of the same thing. For a discussion of these terms see E. Vernon Arnold, Roman Stoicism, Being Lectures on the History of the Stoic Philosophy with Special Reference to Its Development within the Roman Empire (Cambridge, 1911), 146; and for the role of these terms in the quarrels between Stoics and skeptics see H. Chadwick, "Origen, Celsus, and the Stoa," Journal of Theological Studies, XLVIII (1947), 34-49, esp. 36-37. For related issues see Lovejoy and Boas, 246-248, 252, 263; and 451; and Hiram Haydn, The Counter-Renaissance (New York, 1950), 468ff. '6On Stoic pantheism and the difficulties inherent in Stoic theory see Windelband's discussion, I, 180ff. and 209, especially where he notes, "Reason was for them that which should be, as well as that which is.... And this antithesis, the two sides of which came into strenuous opposition in their doctrine of freedom and their theodicy, was the prob- lem of the future." It is to this "antithesis" and perhaps to the following statement that we can trace the fundamental ambiguity of the Stoic analogy between animal and hu- man behavior: "By the nature with which our life ought to be in accord, Chrysippus understands both universal nature and more particularly the nature of man, whereas Cleanthes takes the nature of the universe alone as that which should be followed, with- out adding the nature of the individual" (Diogenes Laertius, II, 197). On the exploita- tion of these problems by the skeptics see below. "7Seneca: Ad Lucilium Epistulae Morales, trans. Richard M. Gummere, 3 vols.</page><page sequence="5">THERIOPHILY IN ANTIQUITY 405 Animal life also, according to Seneca, illustrates the principle of natural no- bility: But the first men and those who sprang from them, still unspoiled, followed nature, having one man as both their leader and their law, entrusting them- selves to the control of one better than themselves. For nature has the habit of subjecting the weaker to the stronger. Even among the dumb animals those which are either biggest or fiercest hold sway. It is no weakling bull that leads the herd; it is one that has beaten the other males by his might and his muscle. In the case of elephants, the tallest goes first; and among men, the best is re- garded as the highest.18 And elsewhere Seneca also acknowledges that animals in some ways appear to be more fortunate than men. First, they are not troubled by remorse and pre- monitions as human beings are: "And so foresight, the noblest blessing of the human race, becomes perverted. Beasts avoid the dangers which they see, and when they have escaped them are free from care; but we men torment our- selves over that which is to come as well as over that which is past."'9 A similar statement in a later letter also provisionally concedes that beasts are physically superior to man and more self-consistent; thus if pleasure were in- deed the highest good, then animals would clearly be happier creatures than man: Besides, many things which are wont to be regarded as goods are granted to animals in fuller measure than to men. Animals eat their food with better ap- petite, are not in the same degree weakened by sexual indulgence, and have greater and more constancy in their strength. Consequently they are much more fortunate than man. For there is no wickedness, no injury to themselves, in their way of living. They enjoy their pleasures and they take them more of- ten and easily, without any fear that results from shame or regret.20 Seneca's most elaborate treatment of animals, however, occurs in Letter CXXI, where in orthodox Stoic fashion he emphasizes the beneficent role of Nature in the constitution of animals: "Nature brings up her own offspring and does not cast them away .... Therefore, . . . even young animals, on issuing from the mother's womb or from the egg, know at once of their own accord what is harmful for them, and avoid death-dealing things." Moreover, the beasts exhibit wonderful skills, for "without any reflection to prompt the idea, and without any advice, whatever Nature has prescribed, is done."21 Thus one can see "how skillful bees are in building their cells" and "how the spider weaves a web so subtle that man's hand cannot imitate it .... This art is born, not taught . . .I22 In short, such "arts" surpass human art: "Whatever art communicates is uncertain and uneven; but Nature's assignments are always uniform."23 The lesson of this essay, however, is not that the beasts are in (London, 1917-25), Letter XC, II, 403-407. But see also, II, 421, where Seneca states that the wise man has not followed nature "as the other animals do, with eyes too dull to perceive the divine in it." And see also Lovejoy and Boas, 400, on Seneca's De Ira (II, 16) where setting up animals as examples of good conduct is explicitly condemned. 180p. cit., II, 397. "9Seneca, Letter V, I, 25. 20Seneca, Letter LXXIV, II, 123. His conclusion from this argument is, of course, that man should "limit the supreme good to the soul."

GILL most ways superior to man; it is rather an analogy implied in the concluding lines: "In no animal can you observe any low esteem, or even carelessness, of self. Dumb beasts, sluggish in other respects, are clever at living. So you will see that creatures which are useless to others are alert for their own preserva- tion."24 The beasts are useful and instructive, even if in peculiar ways. Seneca's observations about animals are curiously ambiguous-a fact not always explicable in terms of his wit-for although he sometimes praises them as models of "natural" living and argues analogically from their example, he is almost inevitably eager to qualify such remarks either immediately or at a later time by emphasizing the uniqueness of man in the universe. In short, he at one time speaks of animal behavior as being the manifestation of the logos and at another speaks of animals in the usual deprecatory way-a double usage not peculiar to him but found in the writings of other Stoics also.25 Thus in spite of their dogmatic opposition to the belief that animals are superior to men, the Stoics are found to have indulged occasionally in a mild and often equivocal approximation of harsh Cynic use of animal behavior as norm. Such approximations, I believe, not only point to the long-recognized serious logical flaws in Stoicism but also explain how the Stoics abetted the development of theriophily despite themselves.26 Certainly contributory to this fruitful confusion is the fact that in the Stoic system the terms "nature" and "reason" each had two different though related and complementary meanings-meanings which could be confused and which were in fact later perverted in theriophilic arguments. The term "nature," for example, could be used to refer to the divinely ordered and determined system of the world, the logos; or it could denote the particular "nature" of the species or of the individual creature in relation to the world system.27 More particularly, when applied to man, the term could be used in two senses by the Stoic: "the primi- tive impulses of nature in the individual," akin to instinct if not identical with it, and "those which are later unfolded" in man in the course of education and maturing. The latter, "being expressive of man's latent reason and of the spe- cial kind of sociability which is connected with this, manifest themselves in the arts."28 Thus, "while sometimes natura is distinguished from ratio, or is 24Ibid., III, 411. Cf. Cicero, Definibus, III, 16. 25Such qualifying remarks occur, for example, in Letter LXXVI (III, 161-163) fol- lowing Seneca's statements in Letter LXXIV; see also Letter CXXIV (II, 441) for a statement which qualifies his remarks in Letter CXXI: "There are animals without rea- son, there are animals not yet endowed with reason, and there are animals who possess reason incompletely; in none of these does the Good exist, for it is reason that brings the Good in its company." For similar ambiguous usage see Epictetus' Discourses in Epictetus: The Discourses as Reported by Arrian, The Manual, and Fragments, trans. W. A. Oldfather, 2 vols. (London, 1926-28), I, 67, where at one point he asks rhetori- cally whether men who lack self-sufficiency do not become "more vile and craven than the irrational animals, every one of which is sufficient to himself and lacks neither its own proper food nor that way of life which is proper to it and in harmony with nature." Most of Epictetus' comparisons of men with animals are, however, favorable to hu- manity, as are most of Seneca's. See, for example, II, 413, and compare I, 259-261, with Seneca, III, 437-449. 26As we shall see, arguments in favor of bestial intelligence appear chiefly in anti- Stoic polemics. 27Diogenes Laertius, II, 197, and Windelband, I, 208-209. 28Lovejoy and Boas, 252-253, where these remarks are made about Cicero. They seem equally applicable to the Stoics, from whom Cicero in part derived them.

"29 Similarly, "reason" means both "man's inherent and acquired reason" and the "reason immanent in the world's system." Despite the careful distinctions between educated and innate reason and between primary and "realized nature" preserved in these definitions, their fundamentally tautological character may be seen as providing a sufficient temptation for blurring just such crucial distinctions as those between innate or "natural" rational impulses and the cultivated reason of the civilized phi- losopher. The loss of such distinctions-or the blurring of the distinction be- tween logos endiathetos and logos prophorikos-would enable, if not require, one to see the causes of animal behavior under the Stoic system as resembling the causes of human behavior: if man reasons, then so must beasts reason, for both manifest "reason" in their actions. Moreover it would be possible to hold, as in fact the Cynics argued, that animals are plainly models of "natural" and therefore "rational" behavior which men should heed. Finally, a timely application of "hard" primitivism under such circumstances might lead one to question the efficacy of strictly human reason and the value of civilization itself.30 Such "confusion," which, as we have seen, seems to characterize some Stoics, was almost certainly stimulated by the philosophical skeptics of an- tiquity-by the middle academy, whose thought Cicero popularized, and by the later school of Sextus Empiricus-whose main occupation was attacking the dogmatic philosophers. In fact, the use of animals as possible norms was apparently a standard skeptical argument employed against anthropomorphic and anthropocentric concepts. In Cicero's De natura deorum, for example, we find Cotta the Academic criticizing the anthropomorphic conception of the gods held by the Epicurean Velleius by hinting that all species of animals might conceive of the deities as taking their respective shapes; and he co- gently notes that the Egyptians worshipped animal forms. "You say that with- out virtue no one can be happy. I willingly concur .... You likewise say that virtue cannot reside where reason is not. That I must necessarily allow. You add, moreover, that reason cannot exist but in human form. Who, do you think, will admit that?'31 To support his contention Cotta points out that animals sometimes show signs of reason, the elephant being the most notable example. Furthermore, he states that the talents and abilities of men are so variously and unequally distributed that an anthropomorphic conception of the gods (or of God) is subject to every man's whimsy.32 Later Cotta also attacks the Stoic system advanced by Balbus, who speaks eloquently about the divine system of the world, including nature's marvelous care of the beasts, their virtues and skills which they teach man, and their proper use by rational beings.33 In rebuttal Cotta lists numerous human crimes and then sarcastically comments: This now is reason; that reason which you say the divine goodness has denied to the brute creation kindly to bestow it on men alone. . . all agree that reason 29Chadwick, 36-37. 3For similar analysis of analogous processes see Haydn, 468-489. 310f the Nature of the Gods, trans.

GILL is the author of all the ill, as well as of all the good which is done; that it makes few act well, and that but seldom, but many act ill, and that frequently; and that in short, the Gods would have shown greater benevolence in denying us any reason at all than in sending us that which is accompanied by so much mischief; . . . so I do not know whether it would not be better for mankind to be deprived of wit, thought, and penetration or what we call reason, since it is a thing pernicious to many and very useful to few, than to have it be- stowed upon them with so much liberality and abundance.34 Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Cotta's criticism of Stoicism here is that it attacks the Stoic view of human reason but quietly leaves intact the Stoic view that animals exhibit in their actions the immanent reason of the universe. We shall discover that this maneuver characterizes most fully de- veloped theriophilic arguments. Later Sextus Empiricus, the most influential of the skeptics, employed the comparison of animal and human faculties in somewhat similar fashion against the Stoics. In one instance he demonstrates that man cannot be cer- tain of the objective validity of his sensations-and therefore of his knowledge for the sense data of each animal species (including man) differ from those of others because the organs of perception differ according to species. Conse- quently, "we cannot prefer our own sense impressions to those of irrational animals."35 And later he attacks the Stoic distinction between logos endiathe- tos and logos prophorikos. After attacking the Stoic contention that "man is providentially constructed," he presents evidence that animals possess "'uttered reason' " and then declares, "Besides, there is a plausible argument to show that the irrational animals are not unwise. For if they possess 'uttered reason,' they must necessarily possess also 'internal reason'; for apart from this latter the uttered reason is non-existent."36 In other words, if one grants that men are able to reason as the Stoics say, then it is a consequence of their doctrine that animals must also reason in this way. Sextus here really seems to be attacking the entire Stoic epistemology by way of controverting their dis- tinction between "uttered" and "internal reason." His aim is not to prove that animals reason but to question the efficacy of human reason. His dialectic nevertheless has the effect of raising the possibility that animals reason as well as-or perhaps even better than-man. The oblique but apparently decisive role of the Stoics in the development of the tradition is, however, best seen in the fact that the main sources of theriophily in antiquity, Plutarch's De sollertia animalium and Bruta ani- malia ratione uti (or Gryllus) are in part, at least, anti-Stoic polemics.37 In the first of these dialogues the main points-at-issue are ostensibly the ethics 34Ibid., 128-129. 350utlines of Pyrrhonism in Sextus Empiricus, trans.

Forced to consider whether beasts reason, they subsequently decide that they do. The Stoic position, which they first attack, includes the doctrine that ani- mals exist for man's use and the supporting argument that every quality in na- ture proves the existence of an antithetical quality: the Stoics apparently justified man's exploitation of animals on the grounds that they are "irra- tional"-a fact in turn proved by the proposition that human rationality presupposes its antithesis, bestial irrationality.38 Autobulus quickly disposes of this position. There are plenty of "irrational" objects in the world--objects without "souls": "Everything that is soulless, since it has no reason or intelli- gence, is by definition in opposition to that which, together with a soul, pos- sesses reason and understanding."39 Autobulus' point is that it is absurd to argue that reason in man implies "irrationality" in other sentient beings. One might as well say that reason in man logically implies that man is also an ir- rational being.40 Neither can Autobulus accept the Aristotelian distinction between the rational and sensitive souls, for no creature is merely sentient: if it did not exercise memory and judgment, then it would be unable to make use of its senses.41 Clearly the beasts reason. Autobulus does not, however, argue that animals reason better than man. He then, who holds that what is not fitted by nature to receive the perfection of reason does not even receive any reason at all, is, in the first place, no better than one who asserts that apes are not naturally ugly or tortoises naturally slow for the reason that they are not capable of possessing beauty or speed. In the second place, he fails to observe the distinction right before his eyes: mere reason is implanted by nature, but real and perfect reason is the product of care and education. And this is why every living creature has the faculty of reasoning; but if what they seek is true reason and wisdom, not even man may be said to possess it.42 The argument's tendency toward a general skepticism, which can be seen in its simultaneous use and rejection of Stoic principles as well as in the last quoted sentence, is, however, arrested by Autobulus' conclusion that if man "surpasses the animals in his capacity for learning and in sagacity and in the requirements of justice and social life . . many animals . . . surpass all men, not only in bulk and swiftness," but also in countless other ways.43 38See the translators' notes, Plutarch, 326ff. The lack of antithetical charac- teristics is apparently, in the Stoic view, logically impossible since it would imply that nature is "incomplete." Whether Plutarch's attribution of these ideas to the Stoics is entirely accurate I am at present unable to determine. 39Plutarch, 327. The term "soul" here is apparently used in a sense compatible with both Stoic and Aristotelian usage. See Eduard Zeller, The Stoics, Epicureans and Sceptics, trans. 0. J. Reichel (New York, 1962), 208. 40Plutarch, 327. Most of us, of course, accept this contradiction as answering the facts, but it does not meet the demands of the argument under discussion. For this type of argument as used by the Stoics see, for example, Arnold, 207. 41Plutarch, 329. 42Plutarch, 339. 43Op. cit., 353.</page><page sequence="10">410 JAMES E. GILL This judgment is in reality Autobulus' way of dialectically defining the questions which are debated in the remainder of the dialogue-questions which might be phrased, "What is fair game in hunting?" and "Which are cleverer-land animals or sea animals?" The answer to the first is clearly given: hunting and fishing are justified only if one tracks down "animals that are anti-social and merely injurious, while taming those that are gentle and friendly to man. . .."44 The second question is never really answered al- though a bewildering number of wonderful examples of animal behavior give support to both sides. Instead, Soclarus concludes, "by combining what you have said against each other you will together put up a good fight against those who would deprive animals of reason and understanding."45 In the succeeding dialogue, "That Brute Beasts Make Use of Reason," the argument that animals reason appears in a much more extreme form. Here Gryllus, one of Ulysses' men changed into a pig by the enchantress Circe, is allowed to choose between returning to his former human state and remaining as he is. The dialogue consists of Gryllus' explanation to his former master of his reasons for desiring to remain a swine. A satire of human vices, the dialogue ultimately rests on the same kind of analogy between brute in- stinct and human reason employed earlier by the Cynics and Stoics. Thus Gryllus at least partially echoes and retorts to Stoic doctrine that beasts do not reason but act only according to instinct: For if you speak the truth and say that Nature is their [i.e., the beasts'] teacher, you are elevating the intelligence of animals to the most sovereign and wisest of first principles. If you do not think that it should be called rea- son or intelligence, it is high time for you to cast about for some fairer and even more honourable term to describe it, since certainly the faculty that it brings to bear in action is better and more remarkable than human intelli- gence. It is no uninstructed or untrained faculty, but rather self-taught and self-sufficient-and not for lack of strength. It is just because of the health and completeness of its native virtue that it is indifferent to the contributions to its intelligence supplied by the lore of others.46 Inasmuch as Stoic ontology and epistemology are here perverted to Cynicism and beyond, the attribution of the Stoic virtues of "self-sufficiency" and "in- difference" to animals merely adds spice to what is essentially a parody of Stoic theory. Gryllus in fact argues that beasts "reason" better than man, a contention 44Plutarch, 353. Pythagoras' views are cited in justification of this conclusion. It is interesting to note that according to Diogenes Laertius (Lives, II, 109) some Cynics also practiced the vegetarianism associated with Pythagoreanism. Similar arguments are also found in Porphyry and in the pseudo-Plutarchian essays, De esu carnium, Plutarch, 537-579. 45Plutarch, 479. According to the translators, many of these examples of animal in- telligence derive from Aristotle and from succeeding works now lost. Many are "tall stories" obviously deriving from legend and myth and are also found in Pliny's Natural History. 46Plutarch, 527. See also 501: "you are conceding the point that the soul of beasts has a greater natural capacity and perfection for the generation of virtue; for without com- mand or instruction, 'unsown and unploughed,' as it were, it naturally brings forth and develops such virtue as is proper in each case."</page><page sequence="11">THERIOPHILY IN ANTIQUITY 411 proved not only by the particular merits of each animal species (each of which is superior to the corresponding quality in man), but also by their superiority in general.47 Thus they possess a greater degree of fortitude: unlike Ulysses, they resort to neither cunning nor deceit in war, but meet their opponents head-on. Moreover, they "maintain an indomitable spirit to the very end. Nor are they conquered even when physically overpowered; they never give up in their hearts, even while perishing in the fray .... Beasts never beg or sue for pity . .. : lion is never slave to lion, or horse to horse through cowardice . . ..48 Trapped beasts will often die rather than serve man: "But nestlings and cubs, which by reason of age are tender and docile, are offered many be- guiling allurements and enticements that act as drugs. These give them a taste for unnatural pleasures and modes of life, and in time make them spiritless to the point where they accept and submit to their so-called 'taming,' which is really an emasculation of their fighting spirit."49 Yet another trait, which shows that Nature favors animals, is the equality of fortitude as well as strength in the male and female. A sow, for example, is as valiant as the hog in defending her young.50 The beasts are not only braver but also more temperate and continent than man. For example, beasts never lust after gold, fine clothes, perfumes, and un- usual foods.51 Man is often gluttonous, and "alone of all creatures he is om- nivorous. '52 Moreover, the beasts mate only during appropriate seasons, and then chiefly for the reproduction of their kind. "Neither does the female continue to receive the male after she has conceived, nor does the male at- tempt her."53 They are never guilty of sexual excesses, sodomy, or homo- sexuality. Among them there are no prostitutes, and the females "are not coy and do not cloak their desires with deceits or trickeries or denials ... ."54 Examples of the particular virtues of each species support Gryllus' argument. Moreover, he proves that animals not only receive knowledge of various arts from Nature but also teach them to each other. If you are doubtful that we can learn arts, then let me tell you that we can even teach them. When partridges are making their escape, they accustom their fledglings to hide by falling on their backs and holding a lump of earth over themselves with their claws. You can observe storks on the roof, the adults showing the art of flying to the young as they make their trial flights. Nightingales set the example for their young to sing; while nestlings that are caught young and brought up by human care are poorer singers, as though they had left the care of their teachers too early.55 Against Gryllus' many arguments Ulysses makes little headway; neverthe- less, at the end of the dialogue there is little doubt that he wants to remain a man just as much as Gryllus desires to remain a pig. Against the obvious de- sirability of being a man are balanced the many arguments that beasts are better than man. The conclusion of the dialogue is, in fact, inconclusive, for when Ulysses plays his trump card, Gryllus is ready with an appropriate quip: Odysseus. But consider, Gryllus: is it not a fearful piece of violence to grant reason to creatures that have no inherent knowledge of God? 470p. cit., 501-511. 48Ibid., 503. 49Ibid., 505. 50Loc. cit. 51Op. cit., 513-519. Animals also naturally know appropriate cures for their illnesses. 520p. cit., 525. 53Ibid., 519. 54Ibid., 519-523. 55Ibid., 529. A lacuna in the manuscript at this point was probably filled with ad- ditional examples of animal virtues. See also 529 n. f.</page><page sequence="12">412 JAMES E. GILL Gryllus. Then shall we deny, Odysseus, that so wise and remarkable a man as you had Sisyphus for a father?56 The pig's answer, in fact, neither denies nor affirms that beasts have no knowledge of God. Aside from being a personal insult to Odysseus, Gryllus' reply in fact questions whether even men have "inherent knowledge of God." It is, therefore, difficult to say whether his attitude is only a sign of his swinish- ness or whether it is Plutarch's version of academic skepticism, or both. But if the work itself is not ironic and paradoxical, it at least foreshadows the ironic and paradoxical use of the theriophilic argument in later writers.57 In Plutarch's Gryllus the major elements of the tradition of theriophily have at last been united into an argument which is coherent if not logical. Men are seen as being physically inferior to the brutes, and the existence of human vice and its dependence on the social structure imply that animals are even morally superior to man. The unchanging nature of animals and their "or- derly" patterns of existence are taken as proof of their superiority and natu- ralness. Indeed, it is this very "naturalness" which allows Gryllus to argue that animals are better than men even if they do not reason, for their behavior embodies the "reason" of the world's system. The immanence of nature thus underlies the argument and simultaneously accounts for bestial reason and human unnaturalness, for man has apparently become alienated from nature. A consequence is the implicit disjunction between the reason of nature and human reason. In fact, given the concept of immanence and considerable dissatisfac- tion with one's strictly human plight, all the rest seems to follow easily. The continuation of both the Aristotelian and Cynic-Stoic-anti-Stoic traditions of the man-beast comparison and their complex relations with Averroistic Aristotelianism, neo-Epicureanism, neo-Stoicism, and anti- Cartesian polemic in the Renaissance and XVIIth century have, of course, already been sketched by various authors, especially by Boas, and their ap- pearance in literature from Erasmus to Swift has been noted. I believe that further study will reveal a close correspondence between the development of the tradition in antiquity and its uses in modern literature, and will account for its widespread incidence as well. The University of Tennessee. 56Ibid., 531-533 and nn., where the translators refer both to legends that Sisyphus was Ulysses' "real" father and to Reiske's reading of the final lines: "If those who do not know God cannot possess reason, then you, wise Odysseus, can scarcely be de- scended from such a notorious atheist as Sisyphus." It is interesting to note that Love- joy and Boas, 415 and 420, quote text and translation which lack Gryllus' final quip. 57For other signs of this tradition in antiquity see the article by Chadwick cited above and his introduction to his translation of Origen's Contra Celsum (Cambridge, 1953), x-xi.
