<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOCIAL EDUCATION FOR TEACHERS IN CEYLON by T. L. GREEN, Colombo Though this article is concerned primarily with Ceylon it appears prob- able that its theme will have relevance to other countries, particularly those in Asia, which today are described as "underdeveloped". For these countries tend to share many conditions, in addition to, or as a result of, or even as a cause of, their underdeveloped state. The purpose of the article is to present a sufficient theoretical analysis to act as a basis for a practical discussion of teacher education. The purpose cannot completely be fulfilled, not only because of the exigencies of space, but because of limitations of knowledge. Informal education is co-existent with man. Formal education has a long history. Yet, for education of any kind there are remarka- ble gaps in our knowledge. In terms of theory, for example, we have little which relates to the school as a social institution and, if we know little of the sociology of education, we appear to know less of its anthropology. Despite our lack of theory we are forced to take action in practice, thus, because the processes of education are in operation it becomes desirable to direct them with what theory we have. Nowhere can this be more desirable than in countries such as Ceylon which, though they have claims to have suffered from western domination, are in danger of out-doing previous political overlords in seeking to copy western educational systems. This does not mean that a traditional past must be sus- tained, but that the moulding of the future by the shaping of the present must be seen as a process of cultural adaptation, not as cultural continuation nor copying. The social situation in Ceylon Ceylon is in a state of transition, from a feudal structure and a recent political dependence, to a nationhood and democracy which do not yet exist though political independence, in terms of Dominion status, is now a fact. Although small in number, certainly over eight millions at present, the people are divided into a number of sub-cultural groups by ethnic, linguistic and religious factors. In ethnic terms there are the large majori- ty of Sinhalese, six times as many as the Ceylon Tamils, and very small minorities of Burghers (of mixed descent), Ceylon Moors, Malays and others. The Sinhalese and Tamil languages are of different origins and use different scripts. The Sinhalese are mostly Buddhist and the Tamils mostly Hindu, but some of both are Christian. The Moors and Malays are Muslims while the Burghers are mostly Christian and have adopted English as a sign of past European ancestry, though it was Portuguese and Dutch.</page><page sequence="2">SOCIAL EDUCATION FOR TEACHERS IN CEYLON Ceylon is typically agricultural with a large rural segment of popu- lation and a small urban one, in which increases of relative size are not yet as much due to an urban drift as may appear. The rural peoples are poor and the amenities of rural life are far below those of even the smallest towns. Social organisation includes elements derived from both caste and feudal hierarchies and kinship patterns closely control inter-social re- lations. A comparatively small minority owns the largest proportion of the Island's wealth and, though many villagers own land, the land tenure system involves uneconomic fragmentation and there are many who are landless. Occupational opportunities are limited. Agricultural work ab- sorbs most of the labour, industry is little developed and a clerical, or other white collar job, in government service is the commonest ambition of youth. Despite a fairly long history and considerable recent development education is limited, though it is the most sought after of the Island's social services as it alone offers a door to security and status for those not enjoying inherited privilege. The value systems in this society, as in others like it, derive from religious belief, social mores, magic and anthropomorphism. They are transmitted informally and formally, and they are constantly influenced by inter-cultural contact and re-inforced by a resurgent national senti- ment. The resulting social situation, especially in regard to individual values, has been discussed by Ryan (1); Straus (2) has discussed some of the psychological qualities of the individual and Ryan and Straus (3) have described the integration of Sinhalese society. Green (4) has discussed some of the educational implications of the social situation. From these analyses and from extended personal experience it is possible to diagnose certain of the most marked characteristics of character and society in Ceylon: a. Its division into a number of sub-cultures on ethnic, religious and linguistic grounds. b. A history in which divided loyalties have been more marked than unity of purpose. c. The presence of inter-personal and inter-group tensions in all social situations. d. The under-developed condition of such concepts as nationhood, democracy or co-operation. e. Unwillingness to accept personal responsibility by becoming involved in social situations which appear to be only the concern of others. /. The tendency to take short-term rather than long-term views. g. Stressing of social status rather than individual ability and worth. h. Lack of a developmental view in relation to childhood and youth. 201</page><page sequence="3">i. The search for the authority of status rather than of a social situation. j. Economic and social inequality coupled with limited and socially differentiated educational and occupational opportunity. k. A conflict of values consequent upon culture contact between East and West. 1. A tendency to go to extremes in either accepting or rejecting domestic or foreign values. m. A generally low economic level which, for a considerable part of the population, can only be described as poverty. n. Ill health, much of it avoidable, which is associated with poverty and contributed to by ignorance. Education and the teacher Though education has been described as the most sought after of the Island's social services, and though it makes some positive contribution to value formation (Nesiah, 5) and has been greatly developed in the post- war years, particularly since Independence (Arulnandhy, 6), it is open to criticism when subject to evaluation (Green, 7). Three features are of particular importance. Firstly, as education is seen primarily as a means of achieving social status, its informational aspect is stressed at the expense of its potential cultural or social contri- bution. Secondly, it is conducted in a markedly authoritarian social climate. Thirdly, its curriculum tends to be of traditional type with little relation to social needs, especially in regard to differentiation and adap- tation in respect of rural areas. These conditions, which are not uncommon in underdeveloped countries today in Asia, are the resultants of the social forces to which reference has been made earlier. The raising of standards of living and the acceleration of general social progress, especially in regard to improved social relations, is largely dependent upon the constructive control of education as an implement of social action. It would be idle to pretend that attention to any one aspect of education alone will reconstruct the whole, and thus reconstruct society also. Yet there is a growing belief that education as "social philosophy in action" is to be the one social instrument over which we have control and which we could use for the purposes of reconstruction, providing that we can make it a process of socialization. Three factors suggest that it is possible to do this: 1. The attitudes, value systems and inter-personal relations which at present exist must, where they are barriers to social progress, be changed. For example, the social forces of tradition and hierarchic caste structure, although they have been agents of social equilibrium in the past, are today often barriers to progress. Attitudes and their derivatives are most sus- ceptible to control and reorientation in childhood and youth - the educa- tional period. 202 T. L. GREEN</page><page sequence="4">SOCIAL EDUCATION FOR TEACHERS IN CEYLON 2. Even where it is inadequate it yet is true that, largely in view of having had a longer history than other social services, education has achieved the most widespread and efficient degree of organisation. Edu- cation, in the form of the village school, may be the only social service with permanent representation by a local staff in continuous residence as opposed to periodic visits by workers in other fields. Moreover the school, simple though it may be, is frequently the only non-domestic building available for use as a secular centre for social welfare work. 3. The teacher occupies a functional position which makes him a po- tentially valuable agent in the processes of socialization (Green 8). In many parts of Asia, as in Ceylon, the teacher enjoys a high social prestige which derives from the "guru" tradition - for the priest was once the teacher. In the very backward areas, and in areas of limited literacy the teacher enjoys both the prestige and the power consequent upon being the most literate of local people. Where he is bilingual, in both the indigenous local language and the language of the government or that of a former overlord, he is in a still more favourable position. Moreover his social sphere is wider and his contacts more numerous than those of the villager. Thus he is, in virtue of his literacy, in contact with all other governmental and voluntary social agencies; and in virtue of his profession he is in con- tact with the future, through his pupils, and with the present, through their parents. It may thus be said that education is, or could be the spearhead of the social attack on backwardness, and that the teacher could well be the centre of that attack. It will only be possible for him (or her) to fulfil so important a function if he has been prepared for it. While this preparation is traditionally described as "training" it would be far more appropriate to make it an education, and one in which a social emphasis contributes to ultimate fitness for a social task. The Social Education of the Teacher Similar views have been expressed in regard to teacher training else- where. Thus educational sociology, social psychology, social studies and related subjects play an increasing part in teacher education, particularly in U.S.A. and, on a lesser scale, in the U.K. The introduction of these studies into Ceylon and other similar countries is not easy for three major reasons. Educational sociology, for example, developed first in America (though the term received early acceptance also in England) so that its content, problems, methodology, and results have a western setting and may be largely inapplicable to Asian, or other conditions. Anthropological studies 203</page><page sequence="5">in education, social psychology, and child development are also mostly of western origin. Though a few among them are concerned with Asian situations they tend to relate to even less sophisticated sections of back- ward societies and to be incidental to studies which are primarily anthro- pological. The work of Ammar (9) is one of the few large scale studies dealing with a situation such as is typical of Ceylon. Because such studies have not been developed, there is thus a lack of staff trained in these fields in the Asian setting. The number available with western training is at present small and there is some tendency for them to seek to apply western techniques to eastern conditions with insufficient adaptation. It is often those with a secondary training, who have learned new techniques in their own setting, who are best able to adopt them to the local scene. These new studies, with their social orientation and lack of obvious relevance to educational techniques in the narrowest sense, are often misunderstood. Thus there are barriers to the acceptance of them as part of the education of teachers, though they may find a ready place as "pure" studies in other faculties. These three factors, limited knowledge and applicability, lack of quali- fied staff and the existence of barriers to acceptance must be taken into account in planning for the social education of the teacher. Nor must it be overlooked that, whatever plans are adopted, they must be formulated in broad terms, offering a series of principles applicable to many situations. The essence of the social scene in Asia, even in so small a country as Cey- lon, is variety. Thus, in one country family life may range over polyandry, polygamy and monogamy and the adolescent girl live in conditions ranging from ghotul to purdah. In view of the complex variables of the social situation it appeared necessary to lay down a series of directional points which would guide the development of teacher education in Ceylon. Before dealing with these it must be pointed out that this whole programme is centred in the Depart- ment of Education of the University of Ceylon. The students attending the course are all graduates, have all had some experience of teaching, and have come back to read for the Diploma in Education. The student body has now reached a top limit of seventy-five. In addition to the Head (Chair- man) of the Department there is a full time staff of eight members and a part time staff from other sources. The staff includes members whose experience is considerable and some who have had only a few years of teaching experience. All senior members have been overseas for post- graduate training, which provides a basis of maturity and experience for a socially orientated course. 204 T. L. GREEN</page><page sequence="6">SOCIAL EDUCATION FOR TEACHERS IN CEYLON The directives formulated to guide the course are as follows: 1. In view of the hierarchic structure of society in Ceylon, in which caste still operates and in which a class stratification is developing, together with the resultant authoritarian nature of personal relationships, the Course should, as far as possible, be democratic in regard to social climate and organisational procedures. Its content is planned jointly by the staff members and attention is given to views expressed by students who are offered opportunity not merely to listen, but to participate in discussion and tutorials. 2. Because of the marked emphasis on informational gains through an abstract bibliographic approach, much use should be made of varied forms of practical work, not only in terms of laboratory techniques and handicrafts, but in field surveys of small scale social problems. 3. Because of the neglect of the developmental aspects of child matu- ration, and because many of the students would be in charge of schools with a wide age range, attention should be given to the genetic aspects of psychology in relation to the periods of infancy, childhood and youth - and not merely to the "secondary school child". 4. In order to provide a theoretical basis for the understanding of problems relating to inter-personal and inter-group relations and the interactions between social values and social forces, there should be an emphasis upon the study of social psychology, educational sociology and their related techniques, such as sociometry. 5. Because of the socio-economic patterns of living in Ceylon with their markedly rural aspects, and the potential dangers of a highly centralized administrative system with an urban bias, there should be an emphasis upon the study of the social and educational needs of rural areas. 6. Because of the multiplicity of sub-cultural groups in Ceylon atten- tion should be given to inter-group education and to techniques for its conduct and study. 7. Because of the urgent need to ensure that resurgent national senti- ment shall not lead to neglect of the greater world setting, attention should be given to the problems of using education in the cause of international understanding. 8. Because the acceptance of traditional patterns from the past, or over-westernized schemes in the present, together with present day social "drives", tends to lead to a lack of harmony between the content of education and present social needs, there should be an emphasis on curriculum studies, especially from the social angle. 9. In order to break down the effects of an "atomistic" approach, through the study of "subjects", emphasis should be laid upon an inter- 205</page><page sequence="7">disciplinary approach whereby the socializing elements should not be restricted to specialist fields, but should be carried over into all other studies. 10. Because Education is considered to be the spearhead of all social action programmes the activities and contacts of the University Depart- ment of Education should include a wide extra-mural segment. Thus staff and students should be encouraged to participate in extra-mural activities in the social sphere. 11. Because of the dangers of applying westernized concepts too un- critically to Asian conditions, and because of our lack of knowledge of the educational implications of some of these conditions (e.g. child rearing practices) a research programme in this field should be initiated. 12. There should be the usual concomitants of an education course, such as academic subjects (eg. History of Education) and professional subjects (e.g. Health Education, Methods of Teaching etc.), and these subjects should also be used as vehicles of socialization. It will be seen, from the foregoing, that the intention has been to give a social bias to the course of study in two ways. Firstly by control of its content, and secondly through its methodology. Students, for example, would not merely learn about the theories of social dynamics, such as the effects of social climate, but do so in a controlled social climate. In other words, the aim has been to design a course which, in addition to providing information, would also affect attitudes by providing experiences of suit- able type. It must be added that the normal procedures of university education apply to the Course. The student has to attend classes, submit written work, engage in teaching practice for ten weeks and sit for a written examination comprising five papers of three hours each. The layout of the Course comprises various subjects within the following groups: Group One: Philosophy and Sociology of Education. Group Two: Psychology and Child Development. Group Three: National and Comparative Education. Group Four: Methods of Teaching. Group Five: Health Education. The Social Components in the Course It will be realized that in many, if not all, of the various divisions of the course there is opportunity to deal with the social aspects of educational problems. Such opportunity is widely used so that, in any one division of the study programme, there is attention not merely to pure theory, but also to its application in social situations. 206 T. L. GREEN</page><page sequence="8">SOCIAL EDUCATION FOR TEACHERS IN CEYLON In order to indicate the method of treatment of these social aspects certain sections of the curriculum are described in greater detail below. Though now widely used, the term "educational sociology" has a diffuse meaning and its connotations are almost as numerous as its users. We have taken it to mean the study of the ways in which social forces in the past have shaped educational institutions and procedures and the ways in which these are affecting the individuals of today. Such a "definition" makes up in convenience what it lacks in logic. On the one side it is concerned with the historical and social determinants of the past, on the other with the social and educational determinants of the present. The former aspect is dealt with in Group Three (The Edu- cational System of Ceylon). The latter aspect receives its main treatment under Group One, mostly as "Educational Sociology". Formulation of a programme for this subject presented difficulties which have already been mentioned or implied. Chief among them is our lack of knowledge of educational sociology in an Asian setting. The work of the past seven years has thus had to partake of the nature of a pilot project, carried out in a pioneering and exploratory manner. Throughout one aim has been kept constantly in mind - the fact that what teachers most need is not a knowledge of sociology, or of sociology applied to education, but a greater knowledge and a deeper understanding of children - and of children in the social setting of reality, not only in the formalized atmosphere of the school. In order to seek achievement of this aim, work in the field of edu- cational sociology has been carried out along the lines described below. Educational Sociology I. The lecture course The topics covered by lectures and reading and supplemented by semi- nar and tutorial meetings include: The social background of education. Techniques of study in educational sociology. Sociometric analysis in education. The individual and the group; interaction and group processes. The sociological analysis of the curriculum. Methods of case work. 2. Practical Work The need for practical work is obvious, but it is not easy to provide opportunity for it in a way which will not merely be a repetition of theory under a new title. The procedures adopted have been as follows: 207</page><page sequence="9">a. Training in techniques All students were required to learn to use some or all of the following: Moreno's sociometric test procedure. Social distance scale (a modified Bogardus scale). Methods of studying stereotypes. Application of intelligence tests and inter- pretation of results. Use of personality rating devices. Use of different techniques for studying interests. b. Pilot Study As an optional activity students are encouraged to undertake a small pilot study in their own school, during one vacation. Usually more than half the group undertake this. Choice of topic is free and the choices made include: Comparison of the interests of urban and rural children. Sociometric relationships in a single class. Comparison of scores upon an intelligence test of rural and urban pupils. Inter-group relations in a mixed group. This pilot study ensures that some students gain a clear and practical understanding of at least one simple technique which can be applied more rigorously later. c. Group Studies 1. Each year the whole class is used as the basis of a study of intelligence test responses. The protocol material is used for group discussion with the class and treated in relation to the effect of culture pattern on test performance. 2. Each year the whole group is used as the raw material for some other study. The following have been applied over the past four years: Inter-group attitudes in Ceylon. Occupational interest inventory. Sociometric analysis of class relationships. Teachers' attitudes to children's behaviour. Each year this kind of project has aroused interest (and criticism) and led to greater understanding of the academic problems involved. Of greater importance however is the democratic relationship with the Tutorial Staff. These activities have indeed been "projects" and, as such, they have provided a practical training in the conduct of project studies. Their value has been enhanced also by the fact that the results have been incorporated in published studies, thus encouraging teachers to realise that they can make original contributions to research. 3. Smaller self-selected groups have worked at topics of their own choice. Usually these have been pairs of students integrating their results on urban and rural children, on boys and girls and the like. In a few cases the group has numbered four or more. One such group made a study of juvenile delinquency, spending a whole term in a local Borstal Institute 208 T. L. GREEN</page><page sequence="10">SOCIAL EDUCATION FOR TEACHERS IN CEYLON where they taught in the school section, took part in practical, social and athletic activities as well as conducting their analytical study. d. Individual Case Study Each student has to do ten weeks teaching practice. During this period the student makes a special study of a single child selected by him. The tendency has been to select a "problem child", often one determined as an isolate or rejectee by sociometric test. With ten weeks at his disposal, some training in case study methods and some preliminary knowledge of methods derived from a pilot study each student usually prepares an extensive study of his case. e. Class Studies With growing experience the idea has developed that the class as a whole should co-operate in a single large scale study. There is at present in progress a study of the sociology of childhood in Colombo city by the students of 1955-56. The work has been planned in conjunction with the Census Department and is based on a one percent random sample, using education students for the field work. The material collected will provide data on a number of topics relating to child life and the factors affecting it, the extent and use of educational and social facilities, the implications of education for social mobility and the like. Analysis will take a consider- able time and will be carried out by present and future students and staff members. The results, apart from their academic interest, will be of practical help for planning in Ceylon - especially in regard to voluntary social provisions, such as clubs and community centres; and the expe- rience will be a valuable aspect in the social education of the parti- cipants. Other Subjects Other subjects have been dealt with along similar lines, with a basis of theory and extensions into individual and group work. In Rural Edu- cation, for example, there were lectures by various available experts, such as Dr Spencer Hatch of Unesco, local officials and voluntary workers. These were related to seminars and practical work and a group of students was attached to a Rural Development Centre where they made a series of studies of important rural topics and visited homes, schools and villages. Similarly, in relation to Social Studies, Child Psychology, Health Edu- cation and the like there has been an attempt to deal with theory and practice in terms of experience. 14 209</page><page sequence="11">Research The field for educational and social research in education in Ceylon is almost unlimited and the need for it urgent, in order that education may be fitted to social needs. The Departmental research programme has been organized around a number of local problems. Those which are relevant to the problems of social education are concerned with: a. Social relationships, inter-personal and inter-group attitudes, etc. (10, 11) b. Cultural determinants of psychological abilities, personality structure, child rearing practices, etc (12) c. Curriculum analysis in relation to social needs (13, 14) d. Sociological aspects of education (15) The numbers in brackets refer to published research in each field, details of which are given in the bibliography. It is the part of the settled policy of the Department to encourage students to participate in the research programme, both as subjects of such research and as collaborators in such work. It may be pointed out here that such experiences contribute to a deeper understanding of edu- cational problems in general and stimulate lasting interests. Reference is made to this last point in the following section. Evaluation Even though there may well be qualities in society and individuals which are not susceptible to measurement that is no reason for failing to attempt an evaluation of an educational or other social action programme. Too often good intentions have been taken as an estimate of success - or we have sought evaluation on too narrow a front and in too short a time. Teacher training is traditionally evaluated by examination of knowledge gained and skill acquired. Both are important, but knowledge may not affect actions and skill may be wrongly estimated - and the estimation of teaching ability seems particularly open to subjectivity. In addition to these, the traditional modes of evaluation, it should be possible to explore others. We might, for example, investigate changes of attitude and also of behaviour or action to which they might have led. Nor should we ignore the fact, even if we cannot act on it, that the ultimate results of changes of teacher training should be seen in changes in society. In this course in Ceylon the normal routine of examination is followed and, in addition to the written papers, the candidates' practical work in teaching and in the writing of essays, case studies etc. is taken into account. Other methods of evaluation have also been attempted. 210 T. L. GREEN</page><page sequence="12">SOCIAL EDUCATION FOR TEACHERS IN CEYLON Attitudinal change has been investigated in a preliminary manner, and tentative though the results are, they suggest that this is a method worthy of greater attention. The attitudes of teachers, mental hygienists and other adults towards various aspects of child behaviour were studied by Bott (16). Using Bott's method, with slight modifications, a study was made (17) of the attitudes of teachers toward children at the beginning of the education course and at the end. The very low correlation found be- tween initial and terminal attitude scores is looked upon as evidence of a change of attitude resulting from the socializing effect of the course. As a cross check it is suggested that one of the well known teacher attitude inventory scales (suitably modified in relation to culture pattern) might be used. Procedural changes have not yet been followed up in a systematic manner, but they offer, to those engaged in the social education of teachers, one more index of the degree of success achieved. There is a concensus of opinion, which is at present subjective, though based on a close contact with schools over a period of six years, that teaching methods are improv- ing. The social climate of the class room is less authoritarian - without endangering discipline and the quality of work. More attention is being given to the use of audio-visual aids. There is more practical work and the social aspects of education, not only in social studies, but in other subjects, appear to receive more attention. Continued student participation in departmental activities is a notable feature. Past students not only "keep in touch" but collaborate as field workers in research work and continue their own studies in education, This continued interest has been evinced in many ways. It was, for ex- ample, a big factor in the founding and continued growth of the National Education Society of Ceylon and has motivated the making of many contributions, by teachers, to the Society's Journal. It appears probable that an increased interest among teachers in the social aspects of edu- cation made some contribution to the founding of the Ceylon Mental Hygiene Society and to stimulating the Ceylon Association for the Advancement of Science to organise a section devoted to the Social Sciences. Past students have also written articles on education and a few are preparing books. Some of this work is in vernacular languages and so reaches a wider public. One past student has founded and edits a ver- nacular educational journal. Contributions to knowledge, though on a small scale at present, have undoubtedly come about through the stimulation of interest and research 211</page><page sequence="13">in the social aspects of education. Apart from the research work already completed there is other work now in progress. Thus there is slowly being built up a more extensive and a more exact knowledge of the social aspects of education in Ceylon. What may be of greater importance is the fact that socially aware teachers participate in social life and activity in their area, and bring the school and the community into a closer and more functional relationship. Thus the effect of social education among teachers spreads outwards into society and helps to generate attitudes and degrees of "educational readiness" which permit an acceleration in the acceptance of progressive ideas. Conclusion The problems of teacher education have not only been subjects of study for a long period, but have been so in the recent past, in reviews sponsored by Unesco, the International Bureau of Education and other bodies, official or voluntary and national or international. There has been, in these reports and reviews, an increasing attention to the social aspects of education, but there have also been two other features. Firstly, most of the studies have related to the non-graduate teacher, and secondly they have been discussions of principles, with suggestions for content, but with little if any attention to procedures. In this article the concern has been with graduate teachers, whose training is of such importance, not merely because they are responsible for secondary education, but because they are the cadre from which principals, inspectors and adminstrators come. Moreover, in addition to discussing some of the theoretical aspects of the situation, the practical procedures involved have been described and there has been some attempt to evaluate the work done. It is not claimed that this programme of social education for teachers is free from shortcomings, nor that it cannot be improved, nor that it is relevant, without modification, to places other than Ceylon. Nor is it suggested that the many and desirable changes, which are so marked a fea- ture of educational progress in Ceylon, result only from this single factor. It can however be presented as an attempt to develop a rationale and apply a procedure in the social education of graduate teachers which has aroused the interests of its students and has flowed over into action and study which have contributed to educational improvement. It certainly has acted as an integrating factor in the work of the Department and has stimulated no little activity. Such success as it has achieved is due to the co-operative efforts of all engaged in it, both as students and staff - and their contributions are very gratefully acknowledged by the writer. 212 T. L.

GREEN, Colombo Zwei Fragen bilden den Ausgangspunkt der Uberlegungen des Verfassers: Welche Stellung nimmt der Lehrer in der Gesellschaft Ceylons ein, und welche gesellschafts- wissenschaftliche Ausbildung erhalten Lehrer an der Universitat von Ceylon? Die Antwort auf diese Fragen ist zweifellos von Bedeutung fur andere Lander ahnlicher Struktur, insbesondere solche, die wie Ceylon vorwiegend landwirtschaftlich be- stimmt sind und sich auf einem niedrigen sozial-6konomischen Stand befinden. Die Auswirkungen des Kastensystems und andere soziale Ungleichheiten beeinflussen die Erziehung und den Leistungswillen der Jugend. Ethnische, religiose und sprach- liche Unterschiede fiihren zu Spannungen zwischen einzelnen Gruppen. Gesell- schaftliche Struktur und herrschende Erziehungsformen bringen bestimmte Person- lichkeitsmerkmale hervor und fiihren unter anderem zu innerer Unsicherheit. Wenn auch die Erziehung vorwiegend als ein Mittel zur Erreichung und Sicherung einer</page><page sequence="15">pers6nlichen Position angesehen wird und daher einen stark abstrakten und forma- len Charakter aufweist, k6nnte sie sehr wohl zum Instrument einer sozialen Neuord- nung werden. Dazu bedarf es aber einer Neuorientierung der Lehrerbildung, gerade im Hinblick auf die sozialen Moglichkeiten des Lehrers, dessen in der Gesellschaft eines unterentwickelten Landes hochbedeutsame Funktion voll auszuschopfen ware. Das Hauptgewicht der in diesem Aufsatz beschriebenen Lehrerausbildung liegt auf theoretischen und praktischen Studien zur Gesellschaftswissenschaft, insbeson- dere sozialer Verhaltensweisen. Der Ausbildungsgang wird genau verfolgt, und die fur die gesellschaftswissenschaftliche Ausbildung bedeutsamen Faktoren sorgfaltig untersucht. So machen z.B. die Studenten Milieustudien, bearbeiten Einzelfalle und fiihren wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen durch. Abschlief3end unternimmt Verf. eine Auswertung des beschriebenen Studienganges. Er betont die Wirkungen auf die Lehrer und die damit verbundene direkte und indirekte Weiterwirkung auf die Gesellschaft Ceylons. Ein solches Studienprogramm mit einer Orientierung im sozialen Bereich spielt innerhalb der Lehrerausbildung eine wesentliche Rolle, beeinfluBt die Haltung der Lehrer und hilft mit, die 6ffent- liche Anerkennung der sozialen Bedeutung der Erziehung zu f6rdern. FORMATION SOCIALE DES MAITRES A CEYLAN par T. L. GREEN, Colombo Quelle place est accord6e aux mattres dans la soci6t6 cinghalaise et quelle for- mation sociale re9oivent les maitres dipl6m6s a l'universit6 de Ceylan ? Les commen- taires apport6s a ces deux questions valent sans doute 6galement pour d'autres pays sous-d6velopp6s. Dans ces pays comme a Ceylan, en effet, l'6conomie est surtout de type agricole, l'industrialisation modeste et les standards socio-6conomiques faibles. Les castes et d'autres formes de pression sociale ont un effet indiscutable sur 1'6du- cation et les ambitions de la jeunesse. Les divisions ethniques, religieuses et linguis- tiques entrainent des tensions entre les groupes. Form6e dans un tel contexte, la personnalit6 de l'enfant en re9oit l'empreinte et se trouve marqu6e, entre autres, d'un stigmate d'ins6curite. Bien que l'6ducation soit consid6r6e surtout comme un moyen de promotion individuelle et qu'elle ait un caractere assez abstrait et formel, elle peut devenir l'agent d'une r6novation sociale. La formation des maitres doit pour cela recevoir une orientation plus d6cid6ment sociale qui leur permette d'ex- ploiter a fond la haute fonction qu'ils occupent, au b6nefice de la soci6te sous-d6ve- lopp6e a laquelle ils appartiennent. Une s6rie de directives vise a favoriser le d6veloppement de la formation sociale des maitres; elles servent de base a un enseignement ou l'accent se trouve mis sur les attitudes sociales, les 6tudes et les exp6riences sociales. Le contenu de ce cours et son d6roulement sont d6crits par le d6tail et les 6elments sociaux en sont examin6s avec soin. Les 6tudiants ont a faire des 6tudes de milieux, des 6tudes de cas et participent A un programme de recherches. Mention est faite dans l'article des r6sul- tats obtenus. L'A. s'efforce de donner une appr6ciation sur ce cours et de montrer l'effet qu'il peut avoir sur les maitres et, directement ou indirectement, sur la soci6t6 cinghalai- se. La conclusion est qu'un enseignement dot6 d'une telle orientation sociale joue un r61e important dans la formation des maitres, influe sur les attitudes qu'ils seront amen6s a prendre et contribue &amp; former le jugement du public sur l'importance ociale de l'6ducation. 214 T.
