D., Anthor of Tenants of an Old Farm," etc. A PEEP WITHIN AN ANT HILL. Early in spring, when frost has well vanished from the soil, one notices little heaps of sand or pellets of soil raised here and there along the garden path, or above the joints that mark where paving stones have been laid against one another. Whence have these little heaps come ? Always it will be noticed that in or near the center there in an opening, into and out of which numbers of yellowish ants are passing. They are members of the genus La8ius, and for popular purposes we may call them the yellow Lasius. Let us follow one of these workers down the central shaft. We find ourselves in an inner chamber, or cavern, of irregular shape. Passing through this we are intro- duced into a gallery not unlike the tubular sewers under- neath our city streets. Hurrying on, we come to another and smaller chamber. Here our emmet guide pauses, and turning to the jagged sides of one of the walls, begins with great energy to dig therefrom particles of soil. Comrades are engaged in like work all around the sides of this underground room. How is the digging done ? By the mandibles, - the tool for all work which kindly nature has bestowed upon ants. These are two strong, palmlike organs, toothed along the outer margins, concave underneath, and lashed to the vigorous jaws by stout muscles. They move backward and forward like the jaws of higher animals, except that their motion is hori- zontal instead of vertical. The sharp teeth tear into the earth, loosening particles of sand, which are kneaded to- gether in the hollow mandibular palm, a work which is aided by moisture secreted from the salivary glands. When the soil has been formed into a tiny ball, the worker seizes it with its mandibles, which now become tools of carriage, and turning back upon her path hurries through gallery and cavern, mounts the shaft and dumps the pellet upon the fast growing heap outside. What is the explanation of this process ? The worker ants, or neuters, as they are sometimes called, are busy making room far the large increase to the community which the coming summer will bring. The amount of work accomplished by a single ant is not great ; but when this is multiplied by the host that constitutes a large for- micary, and this again by the innumerable families and colonies that occupy the earth, the aggregate is enormous. Nor is this without value to mankind. If one will walk across a meadow in early spring, and note carefully the surface, he will be surprised at the number of ant hills, great and small, within the field. All these are busy pul- verizing the soil, shifting it from its position underneath the surface to a place on top of ground ; and thus, in course of time, serve the agriculturist by giving to his farm a good top soil. But of course our little insect is not to be credited with a philanthropic motive. It is only intent upon the role which nature, in some mysterious way, has impressed upon that wonderful bit of nerve organism which serves it for a brain. This work goes on not only underneath the ground by excavations, but within trees and woods, where carpenter ants work by a somewhat similar process, and upon branches of trees, where paper making ants, like paper-making wasps, are busy enlarging their communal bounds. The ordinary reader is familiar with the idea of a " queen bee " and a " queen ant " ; but it may be doubted whether the exact value of the terms is well understood outside the circle of special observers. One's idea of a queen is that of a ruler, with power absolute or limited. No such being has place within an ant hill. The queen's sole function is to produce eggs, from which the ant family is recruited. Except in the very first stages of a new community, she does not take care of these eggs ; for the workers, who are themselves undeveloped females, seize them as soon as they are dropped, and bear them away to the nurses, that none of these precious atoms may be lost. The queen may be seen surrounded continually by a circle of guardian workers, who by courtesy are known as " courtiers." It is curious and interesting to watch the manner of these courtiers toward îfcei* No doubt they are careful of her and watchful in the extreme. No doubt they would lay down their lives at any moment to protect her from harm. But none the less their office seems to be to keep the queen within bounds, rather than to contribute in any wise to her administrative power. The guardian circle never leaves her. If the queen moves, they move with her ; if she stops, they stop with her. Indeed her movements are more or less regulated by her attendants. I have often watched the methods by which a queen ant would be persuaded here or there, to this or that behavior, by her courtiers. One would seize an antenna, the most sensitive part of the organism, and by a gentle pull thereon would persuade her majesty to turn her head to this side. Another would coöperate in this persuasion by nipping in its mandibles the last joint of a loyal leg, and by tugging thereat add the weight of its influence to turn the royal head into the course desired. If by any chance, as I have sometimes seen it, the queen should escape from her attendants, and attempt a solitary promenade upon the upper surface of the formicarium, she would soon be followed by an eager, if not indignant, group of courtiers, who by the process just described would succeed, though sometimes with difficulty, in con- vincing the errant monarch that her duty to her subjects required her descent into subterranean regions to resume her functions within the sacred circle of guardian cour- tiers. Surely if this be a monarchy, it must be a very constitutional one. No doubt our emmet friends are governed by the wis- est instinct in thus watching their queen's actions. Cer- tainly without her the community would soon be extinct. The waste of life in an ordinary formicary is great. Multitudes are continually perishing beneath the careless tread. Birds pick them up ; toads and serpenteare fond of a menu of living ants, and other creatures prey upon them. No wonder, therefore, that the fertile queen is a person of such consequences aud is so carefully guarded. But it may be asked, " Is she able to meet such demands upon her fecundity ? " Quite so. The number of eggs which an ordinary queen can lay in any one season amounts to many thousands ; and the possible capacity of a single queen no doubt reaches scores of thousands of fertile eggs. I was permitted to note the touching interest which focuses upon the queen of a formicary, while visiting Sir John Lubbock, one summer morning, at his home in Lon- don. This distinguished naturalist had succeeded in pre- serving two ant queens to a marvelous age, one of these having reached the vast antiquity of fourteen years. This longevity was due to the careful protection extended by Sir John and his attendants ; for it is true of emmet herds, as well as of domestic animals, that they thrive under human protection. As I greeted Sir John on the morning referred to, in response to an invitation to break- fast with him and some of his friends, I inquired at once about the health of his ancient queen. " Alas, Doctor," he cried, " I have sad news to tell you. My old queen is dead." "Dead?" I exclaimed. "That is sad news indeed. When did she die ? " " Only last night," was the response, "and I have not yet told even my wife about it ; for I dare say she will feel as badly over the loss as myself." Perhaps this may seem trivial to the ordinary lay mind ; but to Sir John Lubbock and the writer it was a serious matter, for it ended one of the most interesting experiments as to the prolonged life of invertebrate crea- tures that the world has ever known. The dead queen lay in one of the chambers, as I have described them, resting on her back, with her six legs turned upwards and bent in the rigor of death. A crowd of courtiers surrounded her. Some were licking her as though in loving care of her toilet. One would nip an antenna, and another a leg, and by various other solicita- tions seek to arouse her. Alas, there was no response. It was curious and touching, as well, to watch their methods. " They have not yet accepted the fact," said Sir John, " that their queen is really dead. Indeed, I doubt if they are fully persuaded thereof. They have been surrounding her thus, and trying to get some response from her ever since she died." So we left the royal death room. Whether this inter- esting creature was taken by its kindly guardian and placed in a collector's bottle or upon m entomological pin, or left for interment at the hands of her devoted courtiers, I never learned. But no one who witnessed that scene could doubt the strong interest and affection with which the venerable qneen ant was regarded by her subjects. Ants have a curious habit of carrying the dead of their own community from the confines of the formicary de- positing them together in a convenient spot outside the bounds. So far as I have observed they do not treat the carcass of an alien ant in this way, but appear to show this mark of respect to those of their own community alone. This is the basis of the popular notion that ants have cemeteries for the burial of their brotherhood. I have verified the fact to the extent above stated, and the point opens an interesting field for larger and more ac, curate study by some enterprising lover of emmet life. It has been said that the ant egg when dropped by the queen is seized by one of the attendants and carried away to the nurses. These receive it, and place it in one of the chambers along with others of its kinds. In a little while the egg becomes a little white worm, or larva, with a greedy appetite for sweets. It is as helpless as a human baby, and as dependent upon the care of adults. That care is not wanting. It is pleasing to see the fashion of these nurse-ants with their younglings. They cleanse them carefully with their tongues, which are well fitted by their roughness for that purpose, the necessary mois- ture for the bath being supplied by the salivary glands. No particle of dust is permitted to cling to the delicate pubescence that covers the soft skin of the tiny antlings. They are constantly shifted from point to point, apparently with a canny regard to the degree of heat or the amount of moisture that may be most wholesome for their develop- ment. In fact the architecture of some of the more finished structures of these and other insects is, no doubt, due to an instinctive regard for the necessities of the young, and is so arranged that the varying degree of moisture and warmth, in the external world, are regulated by the varying positions and structure of the internal arrangements. One can hardly fail to notice, also* the common charac- teristics of maternal fondness in dealing with these baby ants. The nurses shift the little ones back and forth, from one position to another, as far at least as a human being can judge, without having bettered the matter in the least. Seemingly they have only indulged the fancy of a mother to move about her baby just to gratify her own affections. They even appear to me at times to take the little things up and dandle them, as though they loved to fuss over them, after the fashion of a young mother with her first infant. However, all this may be but "anthropomorphism," a state of mind from which the observer of social insects can scarcely ever wholly escape. A full explanation of how these helpless creatures are fed would require a better knowledge of emmet anatomy than can here be given. Let it suffice, therefore, to say that ants, like bees and some other hymenopterous crea- tures, store away food within what is known as a crop or false stomach. The contents of this crop are under the control of the proprietor, who reserves them almost ex- clusively for the benefit of the emmet public. A squeeze upon the little lace-like bag of muscles that surrounds the crop operates like the pressure of a lady's hand upon the bulb of a spraying bottle, and the sweet contents thereof are pressed through the œsophagous, out of the mouth, and thence into the mouths of the baby ants, who perk up their blackish brown heads and open wide their jaws to receive it. By the same method foraging ants who have gone abroad to secure nectar and other supplies and have returned to the formicary laden with the same, communicate of their abundance to the hungry workers and nurses who have been toiling within the community bounds, while their sisters were off upon their excursions. It is a remarkable and interesting example of the division of labor as it exists in these insect communities. - And as the years roll onward Through the ages yet to be, As wider grows and wider This empire of the free, Grander shall grow the story Of those men, trne and tried, Those noble and heroic eonls Who bravely fonght and died, r -Adapted frorņ Tarbw«</page></plain_text>
