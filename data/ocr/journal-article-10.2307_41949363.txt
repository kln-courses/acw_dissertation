<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dis-Figuring Reproduction: Natural History, Community, and the 1790s Novel Tilottama Rajan University of Western Ontario THE (IM)POSSIBLE COMMUNITY OF THE 1 7 9 0 S NOVEL Given an almost total forgetting of certain Romantic novels by standard lit- erary histories, what were the epistemic shifts that made their writing possi- ble at the time? What new configurations of the aesthetic and the social emerged in the late eighteenth century, invisibly, and at an archeological rather than manifest level? And what developments in Continental philoso- phy and theory have made it more possible to read these novels now? With such questions in mind, this paper explores the dis-figuration of reproduc- tion in radical novels of the Romantic period that focus on women. It does so in the context of a larger reorganization of knowledge from Hegel and Schelling to Benjamin and Nancy which, I argue, unfolds from the philo- sophical study of nature that began in the late eighteenth century. The econ- omy - or anti-economy - of ideas that subsists between these thinkers allows us to conceive the relation between art, history, and the social outside of the "reproduction" of culture. Inasmuch as history and literary history invisibly rely on a metaphorics of (re)production, the disfiguration of aesthetic • 211</page><page sequence="2">212 • Dis-Figuring Reproduction production raises profound questions about the "work" of art in history: about whether these texts melancholic abjection of the aesthetic makes them unassimilable into history and the Symbolic,1 or whether it contributes to the dialectic of history conceived as natural history. I will start with the prevalence - in work by Mary Hays, Mary Wollstone- craft, Eliza Fenwick, and Mary Shelley- of miscarriages, (symbolic) infanti- cides, and other forms of withdrawal from domestic economy. In The Philosophy of Nature, Hegel sees reproduction as functioning on several lev- els: sexual, aesthetic, cultural (and curiously, excretive). While plants prolif- erate laterally, reproduction in animals is a historical, generational process. The individual assimilates what is other (including the negative in experi- ence), and "re-produces" itself anew: across time, the species takes in what is different, yet continues the same. Biological reproduction, through the family, underwrites the reproduction of values, with aesthetic reproduction being a further part of this cultural economy. The dejection of biological reproduction thus has complex extensions, including for the text which dis-figures both its writing as a reproduction of things as they are, and its reading as a conventionalizing transmission. In Wollstonecraft s The Wrongs of Woman (1798), left unfinished when she died in childbirth, the protagonist is locked up in an asylum by her husband, and writes the novel as a memoir to her abducted daughter. The passing on of daughters in marriage guarantees social continuity, often figured through the marriages that pass on the text itself to the next generation. In The Wrongs , Maria leaves her husband, while her future with Darnford, the rev- olutionary adventurer she meets in the asylum, is haunted by the failure of Wollstonecraft s encounter with the New World through her relationship with the American adventurer Gilbert Imlay. The generational transfer of this text would thus have to be through the feminist community it tries per- formatively to produce, comprised of Maria, her daughter, and Jemima, the jailor who helps her to escape. But it is unclear whether the child is even alive, and her reappearance in one of the "scattered heads for the continua- tion of the story"2 appended by Godwin may be only a hallucination. Her phantasmatic (dis)appearance figures Wollstonecraft s doubts about com- munication and community, and about the very shape feminism should</page><page sequence="3">Tilottama Rajan • 213 take. Would a discourse formed around motherhood even be feminism, or would it just differently reproduce what Godwin called "things as they are'? Mary Hays answers this question in one way by letting the plot kill off Emmas daughter in Memoirs of Emma Courtney (1796). The generic female child, who passes almost unnoticed in the sentimental idyll that encases her, functions as a part-object on which Hays vents her ambivalence about the obligatory reproduction of woman as mother. This symbolic infanticide is later literalized in the actual murder, by Montague, of his child by a servant to whom he turns in a degradation and abjection of himself after Emma returns to her first love, Augustus Harley. Montague, whom Emma marries simply because she must marry, responds violently to the wound of gender that men as much as women suffer. In a sublimation of this textual violence, Emma loses little Emma, replacing her with Augustus Jr., son of the man she could not marry. But Augustus too was no more than a misfiguration of the impossible desire underlying Emmas Romantic idealism. By adopting the son after the plot has killed off his father, Emma finally escapes the system of reproduction, if only symbolically. She sublates biological into literary and ideological motherhood as she writes her memoirs to him- seemingly as a warning, but in fact to refigure herself as the parent of his desire. Hays friend Wollstonecraft also complained that she was too much in the company of children.3 But Wollstonecraft, who ran a school and wrote manuals of children's education, could not concede an ambivalence about motherhood, buried in suicide attempts that would have abandoned the daughter she so sentimentalized in letters to the faithless Imlay. Godwin sensed this ambivalence when he emphasized his wife's uneasiness with Englishness in the controversial memoir he wrote upon her death. The French Revolution, he suggested, effected a "vehement concussion' in "the prejudices of her early years" and her "respect for establishments." For Godwin, who stressed Wollstonecraft s restless travelling, her initial conven- tionalism thus tended to "damp and contract" her singularity, giving her a "character pro tempore* that we should not mistake for her "fixed and per- manent character."4 In The Wrongs of Woman, motherhood again provides Wollstonecraft with an enunciative position, a character pro tempore whose Symbolic externality</page><page sequence="4">214 • Dis-Figuring Reproduction is reflected in the overwrought rhetoric accompanying it. Does the childs flickering (dis)appearance on the text s margins also figure a necessary infan- ticide, one that is unspoken because it is itself a figure: not a rejection of maternity but an unease with the way it economizes women? Is the childs uncertain existence as the bond between Maria and the working-class Jemima the symptom of an awkwardness in this solidarity? For the child, as what they have in common, can only be a phantasmatic support for the more complex "being in common" around which Jean-Luc Nancy defines community. And this community, rather than the model of civil society they inherited from the Scottish Enlightenment, was what the Jacobin novelists- dissenters with a deeply anarchistic notion of political justice - seemed to seek avant la lettre . For Nancy, community is a space of differences and self-differences quite distinct from the "fusion" into a "common substance" that occurs in society. Community involves a "being in common" that is not "communion" but that means "no longer having ... in any empirical or ideal place" a "substantial identity." This "partage" consists in the joining that occurs at a point of sep- aration where one shares a "lack of identity."5 For community is a sensitivity to the singularities that make the political a "differential structure."6 While society presupposes "a higher form of substance or subject taking charge of separate individualities," and thus defines individuals as bounded egos, com- munity occurs when "closed off entities" are yet to be detached "from a form- less ground," and where "singular being" is thus also plural, open to its otherness {Inoperative Community ; 30). Nancy s reference to a "higher" form of "substance" as the goal of individuality is an oblique allusion to Hegel, whom he allies with individuality as the basis for society, against singularity as the basis for community (15, 36)7 And Hegel, as well as Coleridge, did indeed develop the concept of an individuality codependent on totality when he distinguished humans from plants.8 Coleridge further elaborated the link between individuality and society in insisting on "integration" as necessary to "constitution." Yet Nancy also concedes that Romanticism "came quite close" to a perception of singularity (27), a word Hegel himself uses in distinction from "individuality" as the subsumption of the asingular into the universal ( Philosophy of Nature, 443).9 Coleridge touches on this sin- gularity when he discloses in the subject a "plurality" that threatens its con-</page><page sequence="5">Tilottama Rajan # 215 stitution, both in the body politic and at the level of the body itself or sense. Coleridge s fear that without "integration," individuation might actually be at odds with "constitution" suggests that for the Romantics, the very concept of individuation could verge on singularity. For individuality is the multi- plicity not just of different individuals but of the individual herself developed to a maximum point of sensibility.10 The very concept of individuation proves to be not a Concept in the totalizing sense normally associated with Hegel, but a "concept" in the sense of Deleuze and Guattari, for whom concepts are infinitely subdivisible into the possibilities opened by their multiple compo- nents, links, and deferrals.11 Perhaps women's singularity can no more emerge through a feminist socialism than through another possible ending of The Wrongs of Woman that seems equally formulaic: Marias elopement with Darnford, which would simply reproduce the marriage plot under the guise of "free love." The texts incompletion withholds it from any discursive reproduction, even within a revolutionary or feminist discourse. Such reproduction would elide the unbridgeable differences, the (dis)connections between the main characters, around which the writing of this text haltingly proceeds. For The Wrongs begins with Maria displaced outside herself in the conventionalism of writ- ing, as she attempts "some rhapsodies descriptive of the state of her mind" (86). It continues as an attempt by the asylums three inmates to form a com- munity through the exchanging of life-stories. But the stories lack immedi- acy, and are interrupted at crucial points in their telling or broken off in their writing. Indeed, the text not only suffers from a certain rhetorical awk- wardness but also thematizes writing and speech as ill-fitting prostheses. Yet in contrast to the listlessness of Wollstonecrafts pre-revolutionary Mary (1788), The Wrongs is driven by a passion to relate, in both senses of the word. Perhaps, then, we should see it not as marred by, but as communicat- ing a lack of identity. Community, as Nancy says, is not "objectifiable and producible (in sites, persons, buildings, discourses, institutions . . ." {Inoperative Community, ; 31). Wollstonecraft implicitly recognizes this in producing her text as an "unworking of its communication" {Inoperative Community , 40) that cannot be finalized in a "work" of art. And Godwin fur- ther unworks this work in his editing by foregrounding breaks in its writing</page><page sequence="6">216 • Dis-Figuring Reproduction and characters that do not quite work. His final, bleak enfolding of the novel in Wollstonecraft s death from childbirth cuts off its reproduction within the universalist discourse of "rights" evoked by its title,12 even as it opens the text to a different kind of community that we are forced to think of across the female body as a "limit" to any transparent communication.13 HEGEL'S PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE: A SINGULAR ILLNESS IN THE REPRODUCTION OF CULTURE That the (dis)appearance of the child as the text s future coincides with Wollstonecrafts own death from childbirth is an irony of history that Godwin registers by refusing to re-produce the text as a totality. To be sure, the term reproduction is not generally thought to have gathered its full range of meanings till the later nineteenth century; and as a scientific term that replaced generation, it is not actually used in these novels to describe the bearing of children. By the 1790s, reproduction, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, had its procreative sense, and referred to a bringing back of earlier ideas before the mind, but not to cultural or mechanical repro- duction. Kant and Hegel distinguish between productive and reproductive imagination, but it requires the sense of reproduction as mechanical to make explicit a technologization of the terms network of meanings under the heading of the "reproduction of culture"- a turn that also subordinates the productive to the reproductive imagination.14 Nevertheless, the notion of the "reproduction" of culture can be found in Hegel s extensive use of the word in The Philosophy of Nature as the culmination of a psycho-physiolog- ical sequence leading from sensibility, through irritability, to "reproduction." Hegels lectures, the second book of his Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences (1816-1831), go back to his work at Jena in the opening years of the nineteenth century. As an "encyclopedia" they take in much eighteenth- century science, including work by Buffon, Bichat, Goethe, and British med- ical theorists such as John Hunter and John Brown, whose Elements of Medicine was brought out by Wollstonecraft s publisher Joseph Johnson in 1788. But Hegels goal is not empirical science, and given that he describes nature as the prehistory of Spirit (Philosophy of Nature, 3), his discussion is</page><page sequence="7">Tilottama Rajan # 217 an anthropomorphic amalgam of science, philosophy, and proto-psychology. It is thus a laboratory for the cultural anxieties and investments that later surround reproduction, and is part of the history of the terms metaphoric extensions. Hegel uses the term reproduction in two senses: as a synonym for gen- eration, and to describe "the system of digestion* (371). By digestion he means not just the assimilation of food but a meta-process underlying all "animality," and thus all human activity. As the drive behind generation, this process is the "self-movement" of the animal s "consuming and producing itself," as it digests what is other and reproduces itself anew (355). Or as Hegel further puts it, "reproduction is this infinite negativity of transform- ing what is outside me into myself, and myself into externality" (358). Reproduction in this second sense thus raises to a philosophical level Bichat s purely biological notion of assimilation as what preserves life from death. Moreover, Hegel identifies three forms of this animal process: excre- tion, the reproduction of the species, and the constructive instinct (404). In theory, the aesthetic thus involves the same relation to the world or species as sexual reproduction, though as we shall see, Hegel himself dis-figures aes- thetic reproduction. Aesthetic products are a "self-externalization ... a building [Einbildung] of the form of the organism into the outside world" (406). In them "the creature" "produce [s] itself as an outer existence and yet remains the same" (409). Similarly in reproduction, the animal produces itself anew, but endures as the same. It is true that the term Hegel actually uses to describe the constructive instinct that encompasses nests as well as art is not Reproduktion, but Bildungstrieb (406-7), which David Farrell Krell glosses as "the drive to construction, education, cultivation, and culture."15 But for Blumenbach, whom Hegel mentions (406), Reproduktion is a form of the Bildungstrieb. Interestingly, Blumenbach does not use reproduction in its usual procreative sense, but to mean "reparation," a connotation it also has in Huttons geology,16 and one that afflicts Hegels anthropogenesis with a sense of supplementarity. Reproduction is the process whereby a polyp regenerates itself when a part is cut off, or whereby the flesh grows back in the case of a wound, but always with a slight "depression."17 1 will return later to this notion of reproduction as traumatic survival.</page><page sequence="8">218 • Dis-Figuring Reproduction For now, suffice it to say that for Hegel, reproduction is a bio-psychic economy that joins the body, culture, and the aesthetic to the destiny of the species. As the underlying semiosis of organisms,18 it involves a constant self-destruction and renewal of the body and the species through the sacrifice of parts to the whole. Within the body, the animal assimilates for- eign matter as food, but also assimilates and reproduces itself. For the body consists of members, each of which "draws on the others for its own needs," since "each secretes animal lymph which ... is brought back into the blood The structural process is thus conditioned by the consumption of the products [of the organism]." In this process, though each member "is hostile to the others," each "delivers itself up to them. Nothing in the organ- ism endures, but everything is reproduced, not excepting the bones" (Philosophy of Nature, 378). This sacrificial logic extends obviously enough to the social body. Thus Hegel could be writing, and elsewhere did write, of the reproduction of culture19 when he says that "[structure, as alive, is essen- tially process." In this biosocial process, or what Bourdieu calls habitus, "the organism converts its members into a non-organic nature . . . lives on itself and produces its own self" (377). The sacrificial economics of reproduction has to do with the development of the species, which Buffon took in a his- torical direction in his Natural History of 1749. Whereas species for Linnaeus was a "logical category" that allowed for classifications, and while any col- lectible specimen could be a species, for Buffon the term "species" is restricted to organisms and involves a "dimension of temporality." Reproduction is at the heart of species as a "historical succession of recur- rent forms" within a "material chain of reproduction." The essence of a species consists in its "power of producing its likeness," and thus its "suc- cession," "renewal," and "duration."20 Hegel calls this chain of reproduction the genus-process underlying all particular species (415). If the genus is "life in its universality," in the genus-process the genus exists, "but still only as a singular (Einzelnes) . . . inadequate to the universality of the Idea" (443). The "genus-process" is thus the process of producing the "genus." Reproduction, through the genus-process, is thus the underlying semiosis of a history that has as its goal society, not community. For the genus, Hegel says, "produces itself through negation of its differences," and is a "negative power over the</page><page sequence="9">Tilottama Rajan • 219 individual." From this perspective, "the sex-relationship [is] . . . just as much, or . . . even more, a digestive process" (414, 346).21 Hegel s discussion of nature is a transferential site for his philosophy and social theory. By the same token, his grounding of spirit and Bildung in nature reveals anxieties about the relation of the subject to culture focused at the matrix of reproduction. Let me mention three such anxieties, begin- ning with the problem of sensibility and irritability. Sensibility, the object of a morality in Anglo-American criticism, is rather the subject of a sympa- thetic phenomenology in German Idealism. Hegel borrows from medical discourse, including the well-known work of John Brown, a scheme in which animal process involves three elements: sensibility, irritability, and repro- duction. He develops irritability in particular in connection with illness, including psychosomatic illness, as a failure of reproduction. Briefly, sensi- bility or sensitivity, also a normal part of self-consciousness, is the initial stage of an illness that is "virtually present, but without any actual morbid- ity" (Philosophy of Nature, 433). Sensibility is the first upsurge of singularity. For as Nancy says: "To undergo pain ... is to feel oneself singular. ... In mis- fortune, I am precisely subject, sense of myself."22 In irritability, a form of negativity, the organism is "irritated" into conflict with its being in a reac- tion against an external stimulus that also turns the sick member against the larger body. In this stage, the psyche is no longer just sense, sentience: it becomes "for the self," but as "the negative of itself," turned against its very structure (358-9, 429, 433). Despite the egoistic discourse surrounding it, irritability as self-difference is the place where a certain singularity mani- fests itself in Hegel s thought as illness. Irritability may indeed seem closer to individuality (in Nancy s sense) than to singularity. But it is a self-hard- ening of the individual to protect the singularity manifest in sensibility: indi- viduality only as the negative of itself, and not as subsumed into the universal. The third stage of animal process puts an end to this irritability. For reproduction is a return to the universal: it recycles individuals into the species, and singularities into a body often described through political figures of constitution and (in)corporation.23 Many thinkers, such as Schelling and Coleridge, place reproduction at the base, and sensibility at</page><page sequence="10">220 • Dis-Figuring Reproduction the apex of the triad, as a disposition more fully developed in higher animals which cannot be reduced to mere fertility. Indeed, Schelling uses the pre- dominance of sensibility in humans to rethink illness and deviance as rela- tive concepts: the hypersensitivity that is illness in one entity is perhaps normal in another.24 Illness is itself a kind of "freedom" born of the refusal of the part to be incorporated, reproduced, in the whole.25 But Hegel, who pro- foundly respects negativity, is torn between valorizing and overcoming sen- sibility and irritability as resistances to reproduction. Thus, on the one hand, he degrades reproduction by tracing it through bodily processes such as digestion and excretion. He agrees that the "higher forms of life" are those where sensibility and irritability have "existences of their own," and dis- misses creatures like jellyfish, "which are nothing more than a reproductive process" (Philosophy of Nature, 358). But he also praises reproduction as a resolution of illness in which the body "digests" its morbid singularities, reproducing itself anew. If Hegel deeply respects illness, his return to the dialectic of reproduc- tion reflects his emphasis on the genus-process: that Darwinian will from which his contemporary Schopenhauer melancholically withdrew. Retreat from the reproductive moment enforced by the economy of the novel char- acterizes the endings of many Jacobin novels: these novels are full of sensi- ble or irritable characters who hang on to their illnesses to the very end.26 Indeed, this holding onto illness is why Anglo-American literary history from Babbitt27 onwards has been unable to digest the Romantic phenome- non. Hegel first introduces illness in connection with the genus-process and just before the section on reproduction. The genus-process for him is not just the sex-relation or the species, but a psychological relation: "the relation of the individual as genus to itself within a single subjectivity" (411). This relation may take the form of a "disharmony in disease," where the individ- ual member withdraws from the whole. Or it may end with "the preservation of the genus . . . through the transition of the individual into existence as a universal." But that Hegel feels this transition as "death" (411) is significant; for death - literal or figurai - is the second anxiety that haunts reproduc- tion. On the one hand, Hegel argues that the individual plant or butterfly perishes in reproduction, while higher animals survive. Yet he also says that</page><page sequence="11">Tilottama Rajan • 221 even here the genus-process is "realized through the sacrifice of [the] indi- vidual which it replaces by another" (346). And if the individual does nor- mally survive procreation, what of death in childbirth? Uncertain whether the animal genus preserves or dispenses with the individual, Hegel, in the passage cited, creates a non-choice: either one withdraws from the genus- process, which is illness, or one accedes to the universal, which is "death." At issue in the discourse of reproduction, which Blakes Thel also questions in the 1790S, is a broader human problem: that of whether reproduction respects singularity. Though gender focuses this problem with particular intensity on the bodies of women, the Jacobin novel generalizes it across the social body. In Godwins Fleetwood (1805), the eponymous male character is drawn to his much younger bride because of her melancholia, damaging her further as if to expose and probe a wound in his own psyche with regard to the economy of the family. In Eliza Fenwicks Secresy (1795), Arthur Murden as much as Sibella is a figure of excessive sensibility and resistance to the system of social reproduction. The suppression of singularity brings up a final anxiety in the reflection of/on culture through nature: that of other forms of community and self- relation at odds with reproduction. Idealist science is anxious to distinguish animals from plants in the service of a certain anthropology. Animals are said to be superior because they achieve a higher degree of individuation, but this individuation is finally subordinated to the genus-process, even though it goes against the grain of this process. Plants, on the other hand, threaten this Bildung in several ways. For natural history had uncovered an immense diversity of forms of reproduction and reparation in plants. Questioning the synonymity of "reparation" with the perpetuation of the genus, Goethe describes how a tree that was accidentally damaged by wood- cutters was "grafted onto itself" and "remarkably" healed itself, though only partially, thus developing a new shape.28 Goethes observation indicates the epistemic work performed by natural history, inasmuch as it constituted nature as a domain within the larger field of knowledge for the exploration of singularities and differences. The notion of the tree as different rather than simply "damaged" reflects an archeological shift underway from pre- formation, which held that the organism contained the seeds of its future</page><page sequence="12">222 # Dis-Figuring Reproduction evolution at birth, to epigenesis, according to which the organism could develop new organs and capacities not present in the embryo. From this per- spective, in an arc that leads from Romantic naturalism to the work of Canguilhem and Nancy, illness - that which could seem like a deviation from, or failure of, the creatures original or intended form- can instead be seen as a new, if profoundly disturbing, way of being.29 Hegel, too, found in nature fascinating disconfirmations of the notions of history, the social, and the human that he sought to project onto nature.30 In plants, he says, the genus-process must "arrest ... an unrestrained sprouting from bud to bud" ( Philosophy of Nature , 342-43): an excess Goethe phrased in terms of the danger that the "spiral" process in vegetation might over- whelm the "vertical."31 Plants need not be sexually differentiated: often the difference between male and female "is only a difference of parts on the same plant."32 A plant, Hegel says, can reproduce in two directions; even the basic plant seems more a congeries of parts than a single structure: the plant "falls apart into a number of individuals, the whole plant being rather the basis for these individuals than a subjective unity of members" (363). The plant could be thought of as a community, profoundly threatening to society. Hegel praises Goethes Metamorphosis of Plants (1790) as a compromise formation, because it at least promises some relief to the social specter figured in plants. Goethe at least reassures us that "the growth of plants [is] a metamorphosis of one and the same formation. . . . The going forth of the plant from itself into several individuals is at the same time a total structure" (315). Yet Hegel is not content with this totality that Nancy calls "society" as "the autodevelopment of an anonymous Subject or Reason." His critique of formalism in ethics, his sense that right and law may not coincide, and his profound reservations about Scottish Enlightenment models of civil society, with their focus on "the interest of individuals,"33 are evidences of his desire to think relationship in a more organic way that exceeds governmentality- a point Nancy himself recognizes, both in The Inoperative Community (9, 12) and more recently in Hegel : The Restlessness of the Negative (1997).34 Hegel and Nancy concur in seeing individualism as "atomistic," the basis of Hegels critique of civil society as a mere apparatus or set of governmental tech- niques for the management of "self-subsisting extremes and their particular</page><page sequence="13">Tilottama Rajan • 223 interests."35 Hegel, therefore, seeks a "quite different kind" of relation between individuals and what exceeds them: a "living totality" in which "Union as such," rather than the satisfaction of wants, "is itself the true con- tent and end."36 Nancy thus discerns in Hegel a desire for community that subsists, paradoxically, in his notion of the state as something beyond, dif- ferent from, civil society. For the Hegelian state, according to Nancy, "has as its principle the reality of love, that is to say, the fact of "having in another the truth of ones own subsistence" (Hegel, 12). To be sure, the identification of this alterity with the state, an institution of the kind Godwin saw as no more than a flawed embodiment of political justice, prematurely determines and encloses the ontological in the political. One needs to think the state not as the alternative to civil society that Hegel posits it as being, but simply as the transitional articulation of an inadequacy in the latter. Yet the state, despite being positivized by being placed in the realm of Objective Spirit, attests to Hegels desire for a more idealistic form of social relation. That desire also emerges more negatively (and in ways that push us to think beyond the state) in the uneasiness about reproduction that surfaces in Hegel s exploration of other ways of being in nature and in the life of the organism. BORN DEAD: MELANCHOLIC ABJECTION IN THE JACOBIN NOVEL I turn now to the economy of the Jacobin novel as a de-jection of the semi- osis of reproduction. For many of these novels constitute themselves around a refusal of marriage and romantic relationships that is not a refusal of eros, of desire. In Mary Hays Victim of Prejudice (1799), Mary Raymond, sheltered by a priest from her mothers fall into prostitution and execution as an unwitting accomplice to murder, falls victim to the logic of the family when she falls in love and her adopted father is forced to reveal her past. This first love, a necessity of the gendered adolescent body, precipitates Mary s decline as her fiancé leaves her, exposing her to a persecutor who tries to rape her. Osborne then suddenly offers to marry her when he finds himself moved by her resistance and ensuing social isolation by a society that commodifies</page><page sequence="14">224 • Dis-Figuring Reproduction women. Refusing him, Mary dooms herself to destitution by pursuing a chastity that withdraws from all forms of paternal economy, all symbolic compromise. Through her chastity, at once a choice and a traumatic protec- tion, she abjects herself from the system of reproduction. Her subsequent life exemplifies the regressive, conservative instincts of Freud s death drive, in a curious reverse bonding with her mother that articulates a rudimentary self which can emerge only in her death, as dead. Mary Shelley s Mathilda begins with its autobiographical protagonist s intense childish love for her widowed father, dis-figured by the structures of the family as unconsummated incest when she enters adolescence - though whose incest is fundamentally unclear. Driving her father to commit suicide in remorse and despair, Mathilda at seventeen withdraws from society and feigns her death. In her posthumous life-in-death, she meets the Shelleyan poet Woodville, who wants to subsume her incurable melancholy into his ungendered universal sadness. Telling him that if he loves her he should join her in suicide, Mathilda rejects this Romantic Imaginary, and instead gives herself over to depression as a way of being-towards death. Shelley s text, stripped to its rudiments with only three characters, is sin- gle-minded. But when these novels have children, often in subplots, they are unwanted: associated with poverty, filth, social and psychological deteriora- tion. In Wollstonecraft s first novella, Mary (1788), where the heroine avoids living with her husband and listlessly falls in love with a man whose main narrative function is to die, five dirty children of a nameless woman briefly interrupt the texts progress towards its inevitable end. This end leaves Mary, too, waiting to pass on to "that world where there is neither marrying, nor giving in marriage."37 Far more women die from childbirth than is consistent with the actual mortality rates,38 or else the mother survives but dies shortly afterwards, like the unnamed mistress of Marias husband in The Wrongs of Woman . Even deaths some years later seem obscurely connected with child- birth, as in Godwins Fleetwood , where Mary is no longer really alive after the traumatic separation in which she flees to give birth to her child away from her jealous husband. Moreover, children in these novels almost always die prematurely, like the 30 percent of children who actually did die in their first year.39 Children are cathected with a certain depression, more generally felt</page><page sequence="15">Tilottama Rajan • 225 as a naturalism that depresses reading. For how to read these texts poses a unique problem of affect and effect, as their protagonists listlessness towards even alternative romantic relationships dispirits the reader too from realizing her desire. Indeed, the Jacobin novel anticipates that most depressive of literary forms, naturalism: a naturalism born from women's existence as natural beings, and from the female body as the dejection of Romantic idealism. But given the asymbolia that Kristeva associates with melancholy, given that naturalism too is a dejection of figure, can one rather think of these texts as dis-figuring their desire? By "dis-figuration" I mean a mutilation of figure that is its own kind of figure, and thus not wholly outside Symbolic inter- vention. Novels, even those that unfold badly, usually end with a gathering of the pieces in a reproductive moment. The non-purgative, unaesthetic deaths that conclude Victim or Mathilda , as well as Godwins Fleetwood and Mandeville (1817) - which ends with the protagonists self-mutilation - refuse this catharsis. Similarly, Secresy , by Wollstonecrafts friend Eliza Fenwick, ends not with the usual multiple marriages promised by its social form as a network of epistolary interchanges, but with the horror of a child born dead. If the epistolary mode reaches towards some transmission to the future, this future seems foreclosed by the murdering of reproduction. And yet, Secresy could be read as culminating in an aborted birth: the text s melancholically abjected production of itself, not as something readable, digestible, but as a catachresis, a figure for what has no name. Secresy is a baroque arrangement of criss-crossing correspondences in which we are constantly switched from one epistolary circuit to another.40 For the woman reader who struggles to find herself in this maze, only to be displaced from identification with any one character, what stands out are the failed plots of romantic love and female friendship. Caroline, a people-man- ager and préfiguration of Austens Emma, befriends Sibella, a wild, romantic girl, educated in seclusion by her uncle. The misanthropic Valmont raises her in the sole company of his adopted son Clement, secretly his natural son. He wants them to love each other, incestuously, in a forbidden Romantic desire, a transgression (in Batailles sense) of the social: a comm(unity) beyond the discontinuity that pervades his mechanized society. Yet Valmont,</page><page sequence="16">226 • Dis-Figuring Reproduction who fantasizes through Sibella his own withdrawal from society, also cruelly separates the lovers: he sends Clement into the world to put his virtue on trial, dis-figuring his own desire by mediating it through his sons venial nature. Secresy ends with Sibellas miscarriage and death when she finds that Clement has married Carolines mother for her money. Unlike other novels where children are the result of women's bodily subjection to unwanted hus- bands, Sibellas child is a true child of nature, conceived when she freely gives herself to Life and Desire, like Blake's Oothoon. The child cathects both the potential and the trauma of a Romantic idealism that must inevitably mis- carry. In addition to Sibella, the plot s other casualties include Caroline and Murden. Murden, a cynic turned melancholic, dies after a long decline when confronted with Sibellas pregnant body: his love for her has always been artificial, a cover for a more profound apathy that miscarries a lost, narcis- sistic desire. Caroline survives, but as a placeholder for a female community that she does not understand, and as the symptom of the female reader s helplessness as she tries to gather her regrets into a reproductive moment. If Murden, who loves Sibella as an image, is dissociated from himself in the Imaginary, Caroline, the dutiful sister, is equally disconnected from the Real of a feminist desire that has been mediated, reproduced for her, by the Symbolic. The text s thematic of characters as ghosts and phantasms unsettles any too-easy reproduction of its imaginary and symbolic logics. First, Secresy powerfully resists the communicative rationality that might seem implicit in its structure of multiple correspondences, for the proliferation of intradiegetic readers creates an involution of the text upon itself, deferring its transference to the actual reader and unsettling the terms of its repro- duction. Of seventy-one letters among ten characters, involving four sus- tained correspondences, no letter gets an immediate reply after the first seven letters between Caroline and Sibella. One character does not reply within the diegesis,41 while some correspondents cross paths in the plot but not in the communicative sphere. Sibella writes only to Caroline and never to Clement, except extradiegetically.42 Even Caroline, the principal purveyor of the plot and closest to knowing everyone's stories, does not correspond with all the characters. Collectively these letters construct communication</page><page sequence="17">Tilottama Rajan # 227 as incomplete, decentered, and inaccessible to any totalizing hermeneutic. The text is like Hegels plant, which is the basis for a number of individuals rather than a unity of its members. Yet the structural model for reading this curious assemblage is perhaps a kind of hypertext narrative, and the forms of community to which it is correlated are no more than phantasms of an absent political unconscious. If the text frustrates its hermeneutic reproduction, it also dis-figures authoriality. There are two characters who are part-figures for a dejected or rejected authoriality: the patriarchal but enigmatic Valmont, and Caroline, who is Fenwicks experiment with feminist authority. Caroline is not just the main narrator of other s stories;43 she is a facilitator of others lives, a pseudo- author. Caroline describes herself as "a speculator and a moralist" (Secresy, 161). She aims to educate and improve Murden and Sibella, even to marry them, overlooking the deep traumas that make them resistant to her narra- tive ambitions. But as the text unfolds, Caroline increasingly moves from narrating the past to participating in events she can neither decode nor con- trol. Trying to repair the damage from a typically 1790s romance that crosses class boundaries, she fails miserably as the woman dies. Yet she claims suc- cess: "Thus have I saved Davenporť (165). But at the end, as Sibella too dies, Caroline is left with the inability of her story of sense and sensibility to make sense of, to contain, Sibellas desire. Through Caroline, Fenwick pro-jects and de-jects the role later consoli- dated for the woman novelist by Austen. This role gives women governance of a domestic-social sphere, withdrawing them from a public sphere that it thereby protects from the private, from affect. Fenwick s own failure to write her novel is figured in the miscarriage and the ruin that provides her subti- tle: Secresy; or, The Ruin on the Rock . Built by Valmont, the ruin is a "small beautiful edifice of white marble" without "design or utility" (76-7): a "tomb" and a repository for characters desires. It is perfect, yet without an inside - external to itself and the narrative, like a prosthesis. The ruin configures the text within what Hegel calls the "symbolic" phase of art, exemplified by the pyramids - also forms that conceal an interior which is spirit s exteriority to itself. For Hegel, the symbolic is not (yet) art, and presents itself as a "prob- lem" still to be solved because spirit has not "found its own inner life"</page><page sequence="18">228 • Dis-Figuring Reproduction ( Aesthetics , 1:354). Spirit cannot "speak . . . the language of spirit" and grasps "the inward ... as the negative of life, as death" (354-5). This spirit, melan- cholia rather than mourning, configures itself in the pyramids which, as "external shapes produced by art," "conceal ... an inner meaning" and "are there for" this absent meaning. Hence they possess "only one side, and that a formal one the shape for [the] inner meaning still remains just an exter- nal form" (356). Yet the death of spirit is not death but a life still (to be) born; hence the art of the Egyptians does not bury the dead, but preserves them melancholically as "corpses" (355). Fenwicks ruin is similarly an "external environment," and figures the text as having "the inner element of subjec- tivity outside itself" ( Aesthetics , 1:356, 358). Projecting art into an elsewhere, the ruin is the ruin of an art that Fenwick dis-owns by setting it to one side of the text as a contrivance. This art is missing from the text, which is awk- ward and malformed, and is itself missing something. If the ruin marks the shape of a dissociation between art and the body, figuring art as a ghostly simulacrum and inadequate prosthesis, the body absent from art traumatically transmits itself at the end as a dead body. Yet this death seemingly differs from that of Victim and Mathilda in miscarry- ing a birth that itself figures a new level of awareness on Sibellas part. For Sibella, up til now, has been a nymph or dryad, displaced from herself in the fantasy of others, bearing out Lacans notion of woman as a symptom. In her death she is no less an object, a victim of gender, who describes herself as "a shadow! [a] dream!" (Secresy, 356). But on another level, given the belief that the "mother s imagination had the power to mark or shape her fetus,"44 Sibellas miscarriage is a willed infanticide, a refusal to cede her unborn desire to existing discourses of shame, betrayal, or repentance. As Slavoj Zizek argues, woman becomes a subject "when she finally becomes an object for herself" in a form of self-abjection, when she "experience[s herself] as . . . victim" and "confronts] the utter nullity of [her] narcissistic pretensions" in unreservedly accepting the death-drive.45 The death-drive as an instinctive deconstruction is the clearing for what it traumatically forecloses. As Baudrillard says, "It dissolves assemblages . . . and undoes Eros organic dis- course by returning things to an inorganic, ungebunden state, in a certain sense to utopia as opposed to the articulate topics of Eros."46</page><page sequence="19">Tilottama Rajan • 229 But subjectification in the death-drive is not self-consciousness, since the psyche is abjected in the body, deadened, without interiority. In Godwins Fleetwood , too, woman becomes a subject only by becoming a cipher, by hav- ing no name, as Sibella says (Secresy, 356). Woman as generic, withdrawn even from an identification with herself, cannot be a site of identification for the reader, who is confronted at the end with an absolute exteriority. Thus there is also no self-consciousness for the reader, who is depressed, not empowered: no transition to what Hegel calls the Concept. These novels achieve only a still-birth. Fleetwood s misanthropic, Othello-like jealousy renders his child's birth and his wifes survival, for a further year, formalities: Godwins heroine might say, with Sibella, "Am I not dead dead already?" ( Secresy , 356). And in Secresy , the characters never quite come to life: the text is wooden, awkward, "absent from itself in the signifier." The miscarriage literalizes the trauma of a text that can only give birth to itself as dead. The reader must, then, keep faith with this text by respecting its estrangement from imaginary or symbolic recuperation. The text cannot be the ground of communication as communion, but solicits a different being-in-common. The reader cannot digest, cannot incorporate the dead text by transforming it into a "representational idealization" in the process Freud calls mourning; she must introject it, maintaining it "intact as the living dead, a foreign crypt that inhabits the ego,"47 a mummified life. Mathilda marks this difficult relation between text and reader when she addresses her memoir posthumously to Woodville, "as if I wrote for strangers" ( Mathilda , 176). And Shelley further repeats this dejection of communication in seeking to publish her fictional and fictitious accusation of incest by sending it to her father. Godwin did not publish the text, which appeared only in 1954. And yet Shelley, who meant to wound her father, also does write for him as dead, on condition of the death to which the text sub- jects the man referred to only generically as the father. As a text that sur- vives posthumously only by putting its characters to death, Shelley s novella is structured by trauma, which Cathy Caruth analyses as intermingling life- and death-drives around the paradox of survival. For Caruth, trauma is characterized by survival.48 But in Victim , Mathilda , and Fleetwood , this is not literal survival, and is rather the woman's survival as text, her death in</page><page sequence="20">230 • Dis-Figuring Reproduction writing, bearing in mind Derridas sense that the exteriority of writing is "the process of death at work in signs."49 I describe this paradox of a text that gives birth to itself as dead by the term melancholic abjection.' Melancholic abjection could be seen as a con- tradiction in Kristevas terms. In her psychoanalytic tryptych, Kristeva seems to separates melancholy (in Black Sun) from abjection (in Powers of Horror ): she associates melancholy with a letting-go of life, and abjection with survival, whether through the expulsion of the other or the abjection of oneself as other. But in practice, Kristeva overlaps the terms, thus asking whether melancholy can foreshadow an embryonic self: whether it can be productive, or contribute to history conceived as community. For Kristeva does associate melancholy with survival: its very withdrawal keeps a space for a "primitive self- wounded, incomplete, empty." But this survival is deeply problematic. On the one hand, to retrieve in melancholic narcissism a life-drive ignored by Freud and Klein, Kristeva links it to eros; she protects it from any Kleinian aggression against the other or self-destruction.50 While melancholy is connected to abjection, it is therefore distinguished from it by nonviolence. The melancholic protects the residues of abjection, the "Thing" that is a chora or "recipient that contains my dejecta" {Black Sun, 15); but she withdraws from the activity- as distinct from effects- of abjection. On the other hand, melancholy also involves a certain violence: the melancholic puts the self to death to avoid the matricide or expulsion of alterity by which the subject constitutes itself in abjection (18). And again, if melancholy were nonviolent, it would lose its lifeline to desire and eros. Depressive "diserotization," Kristeva writes, leads "the subject to com- mit suicide without the anguish of disintegration, as a reuniting with archaic non-integration" (17, 19). That melancholy, as the impossibility of mourning, also tends to withdraw from figure, moves it further towards thanatos, asymbolia (20). Hence, perhaps, Kristevas sense that abjection is necessary and that melancholy is sometimes aggressive, masochistically constitutive. Or in Hegelian terms, melancholia as pure sensibility must become irritability if it is to produce, in abjection, a wounded, incomplete self, the negative of itself.</page><page sequence="21">Tilottama Rajan • 231 In Secresy s phenomenology of the dysfunctional spirit, Murden slips painlessly into non-integration. Murden, a shadowy non-figure, cannot "con- catenate" himself, in Kristevas words ( Black Sun , 33), and leaves no trace on the readers psyche; he is nothing but sensibility. But melancholic abjection names a more contradictory withdrawal: rather than a pure letting-go, it suggests a mutilation of desire that encrypts the life-drive in the death-drive. For the deaths in these texts all devolve from a moment of desire that is mis- produced through its transference onto the conventional topoi of eros: sex- ual love in Secresy and Victim , female friendship in Secresy , and paternal idealization in Mathilda. If these texts are mobilized by a romantic awaken- ing for which love of an other is a limiting figure, death is the burial and trau- matic survival of this primal romanticism. By melancholic abjection, I mean to convey a depression that is passive yet aggressively bitter. It involves not just a putting-to-death of the self, but a state wherein the subject produces herself tropologically, irritably, by a turning on herself that abjects both the self and the cultural conditions that produce this abjection. Yet this turning, to repeat, is topological, always incomplete. For the subject produced by a turning out of the self as other, or a turning upon the other who is the self, is a mis-figuration, melancholically attached to the residues of its abjec- tion - to the fathers desire in the case of Mathilda, or the poetry dejected through Woodville, which clings woodenly to the text in the form of its lit- erary allusions and "overwrought . . . 'lyrical' prose/'51 Among the forms of reproduction analysed by Hegel is precisely this abjection, which he describes as excretion. The self, working through its ill- ness, pulls itself together by excreting itself as its own waste product. This abjective activity is somehow reparative, as Hegel describes the Thing excreted by the term Gestalt or shape-formation. In Secresy , this dis-figured reproduction occurs in Sibella's final concatenation of herself around the birth of her dead child. But perhaps this petrified birth can serve as a figure for what also happens in texts such as Victim and Mathilda , where there seems to be only death. For these texts, where the naturalism of depression is deeply figurai, also give birth to a subject: still born and still to be born. Or perhaps this strange birth can serve as a figure for what actually happens in</page><page sequence="22">232 # Dis-Figuring Reproduction (literary) history, as the community that establishes itself through time con- ceived as a "series of abortions"52 For Shelley s text is itself the dead child of its literary parents: the textual survival of the idealism miscarried by Wollstonecraft s death in childbirth.53 LITERARY HISTORY AS NATURAL HISTORY What can these texts that turn away from reproduction - biological, hermeneutic, and cultural-contribute, however negatively, to the dialectic of history? Until recently they have not been part of literary history, even of a gynocentric history that bypasses the early nineteenth century, with the exception of Austen.54 Such a history, while it constitutes itself as an act of resistance, thinks community as essence, and is thus despite itself "the clo- sure of the political" (Nancy, Inoperative Community , xxxviii) and the impos- sibility of political justice. For this justice cannot be encompassed within an identity-politics, and necessarily falls outside the political, inasmuch as it seeks to be sensitive to singularity. So how should we characterize these texts generically so as to read them within the experience of community? We should not see them as novels of sensibility, at least as defined by Anglo- American criticism, where the term gives women their own genre but cuts them off from a broader historiographical vision.55 Sensibility remains part of the cultural reproduction these texts resist. Nor should we ally them with common sense and the genres of everyday life- another move characteris- tic of Anglo-American feminism. We can perhaps see the feminist novels discussed here as historical novels, beginning from Godwins perception that the domestic is part of history.56 Yet the very adjective "historical," used for these pathologically introverted novels, can be no more than a catachresis: a provocation, a polemical misnomer. Given this catachresis, under what historiographical conditions can one read these texts, and with what models of history are they bound up? I sug- gest that they find their place in a kind of natural history: they exemplify this history as a way of writing women's lives, while the reconception of aesthetic as natural history- a history profoundly resistant to aestheticization- is the condition of their survival. The term natural history has a complex genealogy</page><page sequence="23">Tilottama Rajan • 233 that crosses between history and science. Within the domain of history, "nat- ural history" shifts significantly from its deployment by historians during the Scottish Enlightenment to its use by Benjamin and Adorno, as an effect of developments in science from Buffon to Darwin. Within the domain of sci- ence, going back as far as Jean-Baptiste Robinet in the later eighteenth cen- tury, and then in the German Naturphilosophie that was also of interest to Coleridge and his friends John Abernethy and J. H. Green, natural history mutates into what Foucault calls "a history of nature." Given a frequent aes- theticization of nature- the metaphor of Nature as artist- the idea of natures products as historical, and sometimes unaesthetic, has implications for artistic products as organisms that are part of an incomplete process. It is in the interstices of this complex genealogy that overlaps history and sci- ence, as well as natural history, naturalism and the history of nature, that the texts I discuss find their conditions of possibility. The link, to be sure, is not obvious or thematic, but archeological in Foucault s sense - hence my phrase "conditions of possibility." As a form of science, natural history goes back to Pliny and signifies a description of any natural product or phenomenon.57 Though it is not "his- tory" in admitting a temporal dimension, natural history is organized by a principle of inclusiveness, whereas literary history - at least prior to the impact on it of natural history - would have been selective. A literary his- tory, or indeed a history in the sense critiqued by Hayden White and Hans Kellner, would include only what is memorable.58 More like an expansible database, natural history is the equivalent in the domain of nature to the cabinets of curiosities in the domain of culture. From the early modern period, travel greatly increased the natural phenomena requiring classification. That the plenitude of natural history posed a challenge to aes- thetic judgment is admitted by Kant in the third Critique (1790), remember- ing his own exploration of natural history in his courses on Geography (1756-60). In effect questioning the law of genre, Kant writes that "the forms of nature are so manifold" that new laws must be found for their under- standing.59 The "naturalized empirical outlook," as Philip Sloan says, "was to undermine the early Enlightenment ideal of a human science based on the uniformity of 'human nature.'"60 The principle of total inclusion organizing</page><page sequence="24">234 # Dis-Figuring Reproduction natural history is a minimal condition for allowing texts that have fallen out- side aesthetic history to survive into our own time. If the inclusiveness of natural history underlies the preservation of these texts, natural history in a second sense also accounts for their method and content The term, on the one hand, indicates a domain distinct from sacred, ecclesiastical, or civil history. But this domain is not confined to extended matter: It includes the mind, which according to David Skene is as "truely a Natural Production" as the body, having "its own particular Constitution . . . compounded of distinct principles . . . which have their origin, progress &amp; decline."61 Since there can therefore be natural histories of enthusiasm or dreams, as well as minerals or birds, the term slips from naming a domain to naming a method. As Bacon uses it, natural history is a way of organizing material based on the discipline of natural history, and following a method that is scientific, systematic in attending to empirical facts, and free of super- stition. It will often follow an entity or species through its life cycle or history.62 This methodological usage explains how "natural history" in the Scottish Enlightenment comes to mean civil history. Lord Kames, Adam Ferguson, and John Millar saw their histories of society as natural histories of man in his social state - man, according to Ferguson, being "no more than a variety in the system of life," subject to the same laws as other organisms."63 Enlightenment natural histories were also natural in being secular; Herder s Essay on the Origin of Language (1772) is a natural history of language, in contrast to seventeenth-century Adamic theories of language. Needless to say, the term "natural" in the Scottish Enlightenment naturalizes a particu- lar view of history as "improvement." But as Sloan explains, the blurring of the human-animal distinction had quite different long-term consequences, inserting "humankind into a fully naturalistic cosmology."64 In terms of the transfers between science and history, the natural-historical method thus led eventually to a naturalistic vision of history and to the naturalism of late nineteenth-century writers such as Zola. It is this sense that informs Benjamins allusions to natural history in The Origin of German Tragic Drama: a usage that reflects more pessimistic developments in nineteenth- century natural science, as much as the Scottish use had reflected an earlier anthropogenetic natural science. For Benjamin and Adorno, natural history</page><page sequence="25">Tilottama Rajan • 235 is a repudiation of a Hegelian, universal history of spirit. It is a questioning of "human history" as "the progressing mastery of nature," and thus of a freedom emancipated from necessity- to evoke the Kantian terms whose separation is already problematized for the Frankfurt School by Friedrich Schelling.65 Benjamin and Adorno are significant here because they frame the problem of natural history within that of negative dialectics. As Jameson suggests, natural history is the "negative" face of this two-sided coin that is "negative dialectics." "Natural" and "social" history ceaselessly alternate without reaching a synthesis, and are "immense rewriting programs, neither of which contradicts each other, but which ceaselessly recode the findings of each in an incompatible language." Natural history is a question at the heart of social history. As important for our purposes, gender "preeminently marks the spot where human and natural histories bewilderingly intersect."66 The Jacobin novels share this vision of natural history as the loss or deferral of a Utopian history of freedom: a human or universal history lead- ing to political justice. Moreover, they arrive at this de-jection of utopia by being natural histories: scientific tracings of characters lives, as well as his- tories that unfold in nature or "things as they are." In The Wrongs of Woman, the principal characters all cast their lives in the form of natural history rather than autobiography per se. Mathilda is the natural history of an indi- vidual, indeed a single passion: an incurable depression, traced from its obscure psychic and familial origins and followed to the end of the narrator s life. Victim of Prejudice is similarly the natural or case history of Mary Raymond, who is bound by a baleful heredity. In the two latter cases, a relentless empiricism governs the unfolding of the plot from the protago- nists origins to her death. Indeed, Hays novel is organized as a scientific experiment - a favorite word of Godwins - performed on the Utopian prem- ise of political justice. The text asks what happens when a child doomed by heredity is given a chance at a new life. It seems the daughter is bound to a reverse repetition of her mother s fate, through a stubborn attachment to a chastity that becomes just as much an instrument of natural subjection as her mother s promiscuity. This bleak answer is verified by giving Mary s story every chance to unfold differently, as she is offered compromises that she refuses out of a counter-necessity that seems branded into her very psyche.</page><page sequence="26">236 • Dis-Figuring Reproduction Moreover, it is biology that precipitates the bewildering intersection of natural and human history, sex, and romanticism. For as we have seen, it is Mary s entry into womanhood that dooms her both to her own desire and to a sexualization that traps her between love, prostitution, and a scarcely preferable marriage. Hays novel can be contrasted with Sophia Lees The Recess (1786), where the unknown daughters of Mary, Queen of Scots, are also brought up by a priest in a recess, sheltered from the dangers of their maternal inheritance, until they too reach womanhood. Hays novel is the natural history of a feminist desire which, in The Recess , is worked out romantically if just as tragically. Finally, though its epistolary layout makes it more narratologically complex, in Secresy, social history and the Utopian social planning of both Valmont and Caroline are again bound to natural history. In this case it is the natural history of Sibella, a child of nature, whose life unfolds towards her death: a death already written into her body as her biological destiny, and a life that follows a certain bio-logic. As natural histories of female desire, these Romantic novels all come out of an early version of naturalism: Godwins necessitarianism. Necessitarian- ism held that individuals were determined by environment and circum- stances, which in these novels includes the fatality of the female body. At the same time, since the mind is a tabula rasa, this determination is entirely social, which is not to deny that the social acts biologically, as a form of bio- power. As the bewildering intersection of human and natural histories, the gendered body exemplifies necessitarianisms painful paradox of a freedom bound within necessity: the aporia that blocks and energizes negative dialec- tics. The Jacobin novelists continue to seek what David Krell, writing on Schelling s philosophy of nature, calls "'the concealed trace of freedom' in nature* ( Contagion , 93). But for the moment, let me only say that because these texts also accept the dark side of the necessitarian paradox- the sub- ject s reduction to "bare life" as Agamben calls it - they anticipate the liter- ary mode of naturalism, in which individuals are determined by environment, heredity, and biophysical drives. There are other examples of naturalism in the 1790s in which gender also fatally entwines the natural and social: the history of Margaret in Wordsworths The Ruined Cottage , and that of the woman in his Salisbury Plain, which curiously resembles the mothers</page><page sequence="27">Tilottama Rajan • 237 history in Victim. These histories focus on decline and death, and are unre- lieved, unaesthetic. As Benjamin suggests, the melancholy of the baroque trauerspiel, which for him epitomizes natural history, differs from tragedy in this resistance to aestheticization: Whereas in the symbol destruction is idealized ... in allegory the observer is confronted with the facies hippocratica of a history as a petrified, primor- dial landscape. Everything about history that . . . has been untimely, sorrow- ful, unsuccessful is expressed in a face-or rather a deaths head. And although such a thing lacks all "symbolic" freedom of expression, all classi- cal proportion, all humanity - nevertheless, this is the form in which mans subjection to nature is most obvious ... [as is] the biographical historicity of the individual.67 But in these 1790s texts, what we confront is not even melancholy, with its artistic lineage going back to the Renaissance, but its naturalistic female counterpart: depression. The invention of naturalism as a vehicle for the aporia of gender can be further seen in Godwins Memoirs of Wollstonecraft, which also closes with a deaths head that expresses everything about his- tory that is untimely and unsuccessful. The text shocked contemporaries because it did not aestheticize the dead subject through hagiography or epi- taph. Godwin was scientifically frank about his wife's relationships with Fuseli and Imlay, and the details of her delivery and death in childbirth: the puppies which were used to suck off her breastmilk, and the mortification of her body when the placenta was improperly removed. The Memoirs , mis- understood by anti-Jacobins and feminists, is best seen as natural history: an account of the origins, progress, and termination of a life; a subjection of the social history Wollstonecraft tried to practice in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman to natural history, including the history of the female body. If the Memoirs and Vindication represent natural versus social history, Godwins publication of The Wrongs of Woman at the same time as the Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman' sets up a further negative dialectic between these histories, each of which rewrites the findings of the other in an incompatible language. For the novel ends on an aporia between</page><page sequence="28">238 • Dis-Figuring Reproduction the social and the natural. On the one hand, it is the autobiography of Wollstonecraft s birth as a political subject, through Marias progress from sentimental effusions to her speech on political justice in the concluding trial, where she pleads for a divorce. On the other hand, the history of the text is the dejection of this social history: through Marias continuing vul- nerability to her female nature, her betrayal by her lover Darnford, and her possible suicide; and through Wollstonecraft s own death and subsequent infamy, written into the margins of Godwins editing as his abjection of rev- olutionary hope. A ROMANTIC HISTORIOGRAPHY: BETWEEN NATURAL HISTORY AND THE HISTORY OF NATURE But what is "natural" if nature has a history? Benjamin did not identify his- tory written under the sign of nature with naturalism, but with allegory, as the depression of a history of spirit and the encryption of its traces. Moreover, from 1775 to 1825 the relation of nature and history underwent an important mutation, often described as a shift from natural history to a "history of nature." As Foucault explains, Enlightenment natural history as a system of classification had more to do with "a theory of words" than with a "philosophy of life." Though Classical space allowed for development, that development "did no more than provide a means of traversing" a "preor- dained table of . . . variations." Time was thus no more than the unfolding of space. But the "breaking up of that space" at the end of the Enlightenment "reveal[ed] a historicity proper to life itself."68 This historicity tied nature to temporality through the involvement of natural science - formerly con- nected to the spatial discourse of physics - with the (d)evolutionary dis- courses of biology, medicine, and anthropology.69 This mutation, paralleled by the shift from preformation to epigenesis in embryology, is further informed by Kant s distinction between Naturbeschreibung and Natur- geschichte as the replacement of a mechanics by a teleology of nature.70 In a largely unexamined Romantic interregnum, nature as life, as temporality, is also the basis for imperfection as potentiality. For teleology, once it is decoupled from preformation as the basis for a predictable history, and</page><page sequence="29">Tilottama Rajan # 239 linked to epigenesis as the production of new forms, is the force of the future rather than a path leading to the end of history. Potentiality, in this sense, is not progress. Rather, it is the possibility opened by the persistence of Utopian desire across the impossibility of confirming, through nature, spirit s hope for a dialectic of enlightenment. Crucial here is the gap opened by a history of nature between the pro- jection onto nature of narratives of progress, and the discovery in natures actual history of phenomena that thwart this model or require its rethink- ing. From this perspective, the inclusiveness of natural history remains an imperative behind the linearizing of nature as human history. Romantic his- tories of nature, such as Vital Dynamics by Coleridges follower J. H. Green, see Nature as a historical Chain of Being whose gradations are part of her "apprenticeship" in learning to make man.71 They absorb classical specimen collection into this anthropology of progress: a move we see in the natural history museums of Blumenbach and Hunter, and the still influential narra- tivizations of these museums by Coleridge and Abernethy as well as Green.72 In these displays, the relics and phenomena that do not fit, the abjects of his- tory, are placed in a creative evolution where, as Coleridge says, "problems" in the lower stages find their "solution" later on.73 And yet the proliferation of these anomalies creates a pressure to recognize exceptions as more than just obstacles to improvement. Of particular concern are monstrous and pathological phenomena. Arguing for the coherence of the genus-process through the resumption of phylogeny in ontogeny, Green attributes these phenomena to the embryo being "interrupted at some early stage of its reg- ular evolution." He describes nature as proceeding to perfection through "a series of abortions" ( Vital Dynamics , 40). He wants to see it as a "system" that "permit[s]" but corrects deviations (45), as Caroline corrects Sibellas and Murdens excesses. Yet he concedes that pathology can become hered- ity, and that life could become "permanently possessed by an alien and hos- tile power" (83). This "contrariant agency," as Green calls it (45), is at the core of the later philosophy of Schelling, who analyses spirit s anthropogenesis in ways that resist the Hegelian model, or that bring out Hegel s own resistance to the semiosis of reproduction. The Philosophy of Nature is in part what Green</page><page sequence="30">240 • Dis-Figuring Reproduction calls a "physiogony," a study of nature as a "preface and portion of the his- tory of man."74 Hegel wants this history to be the anthropology of spirit s progress, not the very psychoanalysis of anthropology itself. For Schelling, by contrast, spirit as its prehistory, its own unconscious, is locked in a rotation between expansive and contractive drives that forever stalls this progress. This psychosis persists in the transition from the semiotic to the symbolic that is history, where religious and social formations can be no more than symbolic resolutions of underlying contradictions. For to attain the thetic stage and enter history, desire must contract itself into a form that limits and warps it. Exposing the Romanticism of desire to the Real of nature, and then developing his philosophy of nature into a theory of history, Schelling forestalls history in its psychic prehistory. He thus creates a space for a his- tory not focused on public events but on melancholy, psychosis, and other pathologies: a space for what he calls evil in the Freedom essay. Evil is the withdrawal of a part from the whole, as in illness, where the sick member pulls out of cooperation with the body into self-centeredness, claiming a freedom that is itself necessitated, driven. Schelling asks whether this evil thwarts the productive unfolding of history, or is a resistance which is its condition of possibility. As the possibility of what it lets emerge only through limitation, evil - though in itself it is only "irritable" - is the space that his- tory makes for singularity. In the genealogy connecting Schelling to late Marxism, this dark core of Romanticism has been interpreted variously. It may be that the death-drive of the social, its melancholy and at times Gothic perversion, forecloses or at least retards a Hegelian dialectic of history- as it does for Benjamin and Adorno. Or this very negativity may generate myths, fanaticisms, and behav- iors that are allegorical "preappearance[s]" in which "something not yet made good pushes its essence forward," as Habermas says in describing the concealed trace of Schelling s Romanticism in the work of his Frankfurt School colleague Ernst Bloch.75 In Secresy , Valmont represents this Utopian potential of cultural psychosis that Zizek theorizes by drawing on Schelling s ideas of evil and myth as anthropomorphosis.76 Withdrawing from a frivo- lous society, Valmont expresses his de-jection of things as they are through his education of Sibella in solitary confinement. Yet Valmont is no simple</page><page sequence="31">Tilottama Rajan # 241 patriarch and, just as much as Sibella, must be read for his singularity. It is he who creates the conditions for Sibella and Clement to fall in love {Seer esy, 140, 206), albeit as a warped experiment that fails when Clement proves as unworthy as his father, thus killing the idealism that Valmont protects in Sibella. It is also Valmont who covertly encourages Caroline and Sibella to correspond, and who in withdrawing Sibella from the social, lets her read books normally withheld from women (65). Valmont, it would seem, keeps creating and perversely thwarting the conditions for Sibella to expand her horizons, in a compulsive projection and abjection onto her of his own thwarted desires. Finally Valmont s malformation of Sibella is the condition of what Caroline dismisses as her "Romantic enthusias[m]" (140), which frees her from the conventions by which Caroline herself is bound. This dis- astrous freedom, an "error" on one level, is a form of potentiality: the gigan- tic shadow, as Percy Shelley says, "which futurity casts upon the present."77 The condition of this futurity is precisely a Romanticism wherein his- tory, as nature, is still unfolding. Earlier, Robinet in De la nature (1761-68) had seen nature as a single organism that develops an original prototype through a series of mistakes. If nature is an unfinished process, the history naturalized by nature is also incomplete: open to failure, or to the possibil- ity that, as Krell says of Schelling, its abortions are a "'botched attempt to depict the absolute" ( Contagion , 96-97). Hegel, in The Aesthetics, transfers this idea of a dis-figured reproduction that calls for historical reading into the analysis of art. Hegels classical artist can focus on producing a beauti- ful form, because he only "reproduces" ideas in the service of the state (1:439). But Hegel is more interested in romantic and symbolic art as dis-figurations of this adequacy of form to content. Symbolic art is awkward:78 either it is amorphous and obscure, or else it falls into a "bad and untrue determinacy" ( Aesthetics , 1:76), as in the premature solidarity of Maria and Jemima. Its fail- ure to come together reflects the "restless fermentation" and "labour" of a consciousness still involved in "producing its content and making it clear to itself" (i:438).79 An art that proceeds through its own dis-figuration has less to do with aesthetic history as the education of society than with history as the possibility within failure: as community. It is perhaps here that natural history comes together with a history of nature - a historicity of nature as</page><page sequence="32">242 • Dis-Figuring Reproduction unfinished and constituted by a series of abortions- to create the condi- tions for a uniquely Romantic historiography.

In The Inoperative Community, Nancy largely develops the concept of singularity in contrast to individuality, and in correlation to the distinction between community and society. In Hegel: The Restlessness of the Negative, he associates it with the "manifesta- tion" of the "phenomenon," not as Husserlian self-evidence but as the "vitality" that "gives itself," "bears itself outside of itself," and that therefore cannot be reduced to an identity: "[Singularity does not subsist, or its subsistence is identical to its upsurge, that is, to its punctuality, and therefore to its negativity" (trans. Jason Smith and Steven Miller [Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2002], 22, 33). In effect, Nancy in Hegel develops the link of singularity to "sense" (in its double, indeed Hegelian, sense), which is what allows Deleuze and Guattari to draw singularity into an analysis of con- cepts rather than subjects (see note 11). 8.

The word Hegel uses is Einzelnes/Einzelheit , in contrast to Individualität (Werke in zwanzig Bänden [Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1970], 9:538). Einzelheit has particular conno- tations of the characteristic or unique. At times, Hegel appears to use the two terms in overlapping fashion (e.g., Elements of the Philosophy of Right [1821], ed. Allen Wood, trans. H. B. Nisbett [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991], 275-76). That this conflation of the term occurs in the context of a discussion of the state is sympto- matically significant. However, in Philosophy of Nature, Hegel clearly means to make a distinction between the two. Defining the genus-process as "life in its universality," Hegel writes: "in the genus-process the genus exists, but still only as singular (als Einzelnes). . . . death, is the sublating of the singular (Einzelnen) and therewith the emergence of the genus, the procession of spirit; for the negation of natural being, i.e. of immediate singularity (unmittelbaren Einzelheit), is this, that the universal, the genus, is posited In the individuality (Individualität), this movement of the two sides is the process which sublates itself and whose result is consciousness, unity (Einheit), the unity in and for itself of both, as self, not merely as genus in the inner Notion of the singular (Einzelnen)" (443). 10.

This notion of concepts is specifically tied to "singularity" (7, 35). It also draws on Derridas notion of language, wherein the sign (and thus the concept) is never "present in and of itself" because it always refers "to another element which itself is not simply present": this "interweaving results in each element' . . . being constituted on the basis of the trace within it of the other elements of the chain or system" (Positions [1972], trans. Alan Bass [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981], 26).

Godwin describes A Vindication of the Rights of Woman as an "epocha" in the history</page><page sequence="34">244 # Dis-Figuring Reproduction of feminism (Memoirs, 84), and yet hastily passes over it as an early work which the "Wrongs" of woman (probably his title) puts in a new light. For elaboration of this point see my "Framing the Corpus: Godwins 'Editing* of Wollstonecraft in 1798," Studies in Romanticism 19 (2000)," 516-17, 522-24. 13. Nancy implicitly takes up Blanchot s and Lévinas (as opposed to Heidegger's) notion of death, to argue that the death that is "not ours" is an opening towards community because in it we are exposed to the other (Inoperative Community, 14-15). Following Batailles notion of "the woman's 'breach,'" he also sees in woman a "limit" or "unbear- able extremity at which communication," in the sense of community, "comes into play." It is unbearable because the structure of the female body exposes an inside - though not an interior - to an outside (31): a crude symbolism, to be sure, but one that is borne out in these novels as women's particular biocultural exposure to depression and death. 14. Kant in The Critique of Pure Reason distinguishes between the two forms of imagina- tion, though as aspects of the understanding rather than of the aesthetic. The repro- ductive imagination is little more than recollection, while the productive imagination operates in the construction of schemata (see G. N. G. Orsini, Coleridge and German Idealism : A Study in the History of Philosophy [Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1969], 114). Hegel distinguishes three grades of the imagination: the lowest or "reproductive" form, bound to mere "recollection," which simply reproduces images; the associative, which interrelates them; and the productive, which produces symbols and signs ( Aesthetics : Lectures on Fine Art, trans. T. M. Knox [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1975], 1:40). The Aesthetics is hereafter cited parenthetically in the text. See also Hegel, Philosophy of Subjective Spirit, ed. and trans. M. J. Petry [Dordrecht: Reidel, 1979], 3:163). The OED dates the notion of mechanical reproduction to 1856. 15.

James Hutton, Theory of the Earth, with Proofs and Illustrations, 2 vols. (Edinburgh: 1795). For Hutton the world is an organized body, sometimes subject to ruin or decay, but possessing a "reproductive" or reparative power that assures "duration, stability, and equilibrium to the system of the succession of worlds" (1:16-17). Hutton's notion of reproduction thus combines the idea of reparation with Buffons notion of the dura- tion of the species. 17. Timothy Lenoir, The Strategy of Life (Dordrecht: Reidel, 1982), 20. 18. I use the term "semiosis" partly in Kristeva's sense to indicate a realm of drives that pre- cedes the Symbolic, but in this case constituting a kind of bio-power that inscribes the Symbolic upon the body as a habitus, or through what the Lacanian psychoanalyst Serge Leclaire calls "letters," socially imprinted marks on the body that have a biologi- cal force (Psychanalyser: Un essai sur l'ordre de l'inconscient et la pratique de la lettre [Paris: Editions du Seuil, 1968], 71, 94, 150, 163).</page><page sequence="35">Tilottama Rajan • 245 19. Hegel says that the classical artist adopts a "content" already established by "national faith, myth," etc., and thus already "determined for imagination as settled," and "freely reproduces it out of his own resources 'frei aus sich reproduziert]" Concentrating on "the task of shaping the external artistic appearance ... to such content," he is "freer" than the symbolic artist "because he does not enter himself into the process of [the] generation and parturition [Zeugens und Gebärens]" of ideological material" (. Aesthetics , 1:439; Werke, 14:28). Despite the use of the qualifier "freely," it would seem that the classical artist uses only the secondary or reproductive imagination, while it is the symbolic artist who deploys the primary or productive imagination.

The only way of tempering sex as the consumption of the other is through marriage , which "establishes the juridi- cal equality of each partner ... as owner of the other" (Susan Meld Schell, The Embodi- ment of Reason: Kant on Spirit, Generation, and Community [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996], 153). This can hardly be true, however, when marriage leads to a woman forfeiting her property to her husband, the central legal injustice from which Wollstonecrafts The Wrongs begins, and on which other 1790s novels, such as Anne Radcliffes The Mysteries ofUdolpho (1794), focus. Apart from its juridical inequality, marriage is a social form at odds with a being-in-common that Wollstonecraft and Godwin sought to preserve after their marriage by maintaining separate establish- ments. Godwins anarchism and belief in a "euthanasia of government" are a further aspect of his resistance to "society." 22. Nancy, Hegel, 41. Nancy is hard to pin down on whether we should resist a notion of "singularization" that is in any way analogous to individuation (Inoperative Community, 27), or whether the phenomenon does indeed "singularize" itself, as he implies in the passage just cited (see also Hegel, 33). But in general, Nancy keeps singularity, as well as negativity, in his reading of Hegel at the prereflective level of "sense." Therefore there are clear limits to reading Hegel with Nancy, which I have tried to bring out in not decoupling Hegelian singularity from a form of individuality, and in placing my own argument between Hegel and Nancy. In general, the difference between Nancy and Hegel (even that Hegel who comes after Hegel) has to do with "determination"- an aspect of post-Kantian Idealism that also distinguishes Schelling s conception of "free- dom" from Nancy s. For Nancy, the self must be unbound "from every determination to which it would be attached: that of a substance or that of a subject in the sense of a</page><page sequence="36">246 • Dis-Figuring Reproduction given personal identity, that of an individual or a people, that of ... a form, or of a figure" (Hegel, 37). Nancys work therefore does not lead to a politics or a psychology. Though it is also true for Hegel and Schelling that "desire cannot become what it is in an object, in a given determination" (Nancy, Hegel, 61), desire must continue to posit itself through this inadequate determination that Schelling sees as the contractive force necessary for the expansive drive to define itself, even if desire is the perpetual unworking of this work. Nancy s difference from Hegel and Schelling accounts for the fact that he scarcely mentions the former in his book entitled Hegel, and mentions Schelling even less in The Experience of Freedom (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1994): while Hegel is "the inaugural thinker of the contemporary world," it seems he has been "left far behind us" (Hegel, 3, 7). I would want to question the claim to a post- Heideggerian enlightenment implicit in this word "behind," and to say that the very topic of "community" calls for a reading of Nancys work in relation to, if not as, a pol- itics and/or a psychology. It is in such a reading, to evoke Foucault, that even as we try to escape Hegel, "we find ourselves brought back to him, only from a different angle" ("The Discourse on Language" [1971], in The Archaeology of Knowledge and The Discourse on Language, trans. A. M. Sheridan Smith [New York: Pantheon, 1972], 235). 23. See, for example, Hegel, The Philosophy of Mind, 1830 version, trans. William Wallace (Oxford: Clarendon, 1971), 262, 265. 24. F. W. J. Schelling, Erster Entwurf eines Systems der Naturphilosophie, in Schriften von 1799-1801, Ausgewählte Werke (Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1967), 1:221. 25. Thus Schelling writes: "The individual member, such as the eye, is possible only in the whole of the organism; nevertheless it has a life for itself, indeed a kind of freedom, the obvious proof of which is disease, which lies within the eyes capability" (Philosophical Investigations Into the Essence of Human Freedom and Related Matters [1809], trans. Priscilla Hayden-Roy, in Philosophy of German Idealism, ed. Ernst Behler [New York: Continuum, 1987], 228). 26. Godwin similarly witholds this reproductive moment in his editing of The Wrongs, which refuses to pull the text together, even as a fragment that could have been com- pleted. While Maria tries to reproduce herself anew as a political subject in her con- cluding "paper" (195) on women's rights, Godwin, by embedding the text in allusions to Wollstonecrafts life (her relationship with Imlay, her suicide attempts) deliberately takes us back to moments of sensibility that fail to constitute a subject because of their very singularity. 27.

Fawcett and Robert Cohen (1978; reprint, New York: Zone Books,</page><page sequence="37">Tilottama Rajan • 247 1989). I discuss Canguilhem in relation to Hegel in "(In)digestible Material: Dialectic and Disease in Hegel's Philosophy of Nature," in Eating Romanticism : Cultures of Taste/Theories of Appetite (forthcoming, Palgrave, 2003). Going back to late-eighteenth- century medicine, Canguilhem argues that the pathological is not simply a deviation from or quantitative variation of the normal, but a difference from/in it. His idea that illness is a new way of "being," developing as it does from an understanding of medi- cine that is silently inflected by Heidegger, stands behind Nancy s account of his heart transplant in L'Intrus. L'Intrus extends Nancy s work on community by exploring how illness changes ones relation to others and to oneself- a dimension implicit in Canguilhems admittedly more purely historical work. There is also a curious connec- tion between Nancy s reflection on the strange symbiosis between the artificial and the organic occurring in his body, and Goethe's account of the tree that survived (half dead) by being grafted onto itself. 30. "Spirit," Hegel writes, "is presaged in Nature" which, however, "seems an alien existence, in which Spirit does not find itself" ( Philosophy of Nature, 3). 31.

Leavey and Richard Rand (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1986), 114. 33. Nancy, Hegel, 76; Hegel, Philosophy of Right, 276. 34. The point, which is not explicitly stated by Nancy, is highlighted by Jason Smith in his introduction to Nancy s Hegel Smith argues that Nancy's affinity with Hegel consists in their both seeking a more organic conception of the social and political than that of the current Foucaultian emphasis on the state as an apparatus of power: a set of disciplines and techniques ("Nancy, the State, and Us," xiv-xvi). Both Nancy and Hegel thus agree on not reducing the political to what Nancy calls the "proprietary and securitary indi- vidualism" (76) that Hegel critiques in civil society. They share a certain idealism which, I would argue, makes Nancys thinking fundamentally Romantic. Where they part com- pany, as Smith points out, is in Hegel's hypostasis of the ontological in the political form of the state: "There is ... no separation of ontology and politics in Hegel; the com- mon is not simply elaborated in the state, it is realized" (xxii). Hegel's foreclosure of the ontological within the political explains why Nancy can describe Hegel "as the inaugu- ral thinker of the contemporary world," and yet claim to have "left [him] far behind us" (3, 7). It also explains his reticence about the Hegelian state, which he mentions only elliptically (76, 119n), and the particular focus of his work on Hegel. For Nancy is inter- ested not in the object(s) of Hegelian thought but only in its form or spirit: namely "sense" and "negativity" (and negativity considered only at the prereflective level of sense and not within the Symbolic). Nancy's reading of Hegel is powerfully influenced by Jean Hyppolites Logic and Existence (1953), a more post-Heideggerian text than his earlier Genesis and Structure</page><page sequence="38">248 • Dis-Figuring Reproduction of Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit (1946). However, rather than leaving Hegel "far behind us," I would want to agree with Foucault s insistence on what Hyppolite teaches us: that "Hegel, insidiously perhaps, is close to us," and that even when we seek to escape him, we are brought back to him "from a different angle" ("Discourse on Language," 235). Nancy acknowledges this proximity in admitting what Hegel "gives" him: the restlessness of the negative, a certain idealism, and one could even say desire for the future. But does Nancy also sometimes fall into a more insidious form of Hegelianism that one avoids, paradoxically, by thinking between Nancy and Hegel? For Nancy s forgetting of the political in the ontological seems at times like a return of spirit, a form of transcendentalism, arising from his resistance to "determination" already discussed (note 21). For Hegel, unlike Nancy, thought must have an object in addition to thought itself, and must be temporarily determined by this object as it works through it, even though it cannot come to rest in a "bad and untrue determi- nacy" ( Aesthetics , 1:76). If Hegel forgets this caution in allowing the ontological to be bound within the state, Nancys refusal of "determination" sometimes entirely unbinds the ontological from the political, and transfers philosophy to what Shelley in Prometheus Unbound calls "the intense inane" (in the Latin sense of inanus). Arguably, this immateriality of Nancy s thought (perhaps most of all in The Experience of Freedom and least of all in The Inoperative Community or L'Intrus ) can make it a thought of pure spirit, just as much as Hegel's crudely materialist identification of being-in-common with the state does. 35. See Nancy ( Inoperative Community, 4) and Hegel (Philosophy of Mind, 257) for the char- acterization of individualism as "atomism." Hegel's discussion of civil society in terms of specific disciplinary apparati such as the family, the police, and the judiciary, is behind the thought of Foucault and Althusser (Philosophy of Mind, 255-63; Philosophy of Right, 199-274). Of particular interest is his notion of the "corporation, in which the particular citizen in his private capacity finds the securing of his stock, whilst at the same time he in it emerges from his single private interest, and has a conscious activ- ity for a comparatively universal end" (Mind, 265). While "corporation" does not quite have its present meaning, there is clearly a reference here to the Scottish Enlightenment's valorization of commercial society from which Hegel distances him- self in his desire for a more spiritual and organic society. 36.

Lloyd Bonfield, Richard Smith, and Keith Wrightson [Oxford: Blackwell, 1986], 237-38). Schofield 's statistic is conjectural, since vital registration records only began to be kept</page><page sequence="39">Tilottama Rajan • 249 in 1837, and parish records do not record stillbirths, the "maternities in which the mother s life is most at risk," with a mortality rate five times higher than for live births (235-36). The London Bills of Mortality, which show a higher rate than elsewhere in England, show a mortality rate of 11.4 per 1000 from 1750 to 1799, and 9.2 per 1000 from 1800 to 1830 (232-33). Schofields statistic is based on Swedish records which he takes to be a reliable index to British maternal mortality rates. While he concludes that the figure was not catastrophically high, he concedes that given fertility rates, a woman ran a 6-7 percent risk of dying in childbirth over her lifetime, and that every woman knew someone who had so died (259). His conclusion that mothers did not live in fear of dying through childbirth seems overly sanguine, but if indeed he is correct, then the portrayal of childbearing in the Jacobin novel is all the more striking. 39.

Gilbert and Susan Gubar in The Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer in the Nineteenth-Century Literary Imagination (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1984) devote a chapter to Austen, but otherwise deal only with Mary Shelley, mostly with Frankenstein. Elaine Showalter in A Literature of Their Own: British Women Novelists from the Brontës to Lessing (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1977) claims that the "early women writers refused to deal with a professional role" and that "almost no sense of communality and self-awareness is apparent among women writ- ers before the 1840s." Touching upon only Burney, Austen, and Edgeworth, she consti- tutes the woman's novel in terms of "an all-inclusive female realism, a broad, socially informed exploration of the daily lives and values of women" that effectively confines it to the separate sphere of common sense, morality, and the genres of everyday life (18, 29). Anne Mellor does not mention Fenwick. For her, the female Romantic tradition (including Hays, Wollstonecraft, and Mary Shelley) is dedicated to a rationality that reacts against sensibility, but is based on an ethic of care - and that is built around the egalitarian family as a model for the nation-state ( Romanticism and Gender [London: Routledge, 1993], 33-8, 48-49, 68). Janet Todd devotes a chapter to Hays and Wollstone- craft, but says "it is not with them that the strength of late eighteenth-century fiction lies" but rather with Austen, Edgeworth, Burney, and others who "managed to insert into the novel that extraordinary authority already noticed in Hannah More, of the woman as moralist" (The Sign of Angelica: Women, Writing and Fiction, 1660-1800 [London: Virago, 1989], 228).

Slavoj Zizek, The Indivisible Remainder: An Essay on Schelling and Related Matters (London: Verso, 1996). Zizek writes that an "idea" becomes "actual spirit only through its egotist' . . . contraction into a real Person" (11). His return to a Schelling whom he sees as closer to Hegel than is commonly thought reflects his interest in the cultural potential of psychosis. If Zizek, with his explicit interest in German Idealism, is partic- ularly useful for understanding masculine dis-fìgurations of "spirit," Kristeva's analyses of melancholia and abjection can be seen as contributing to an equivalent feminist phe- nomenology of the dysfunctional spirit. 77.

Hegel's use of the term "symbolic" is obviously quite different from the conventional use of the term by Goethe, Coleridge, Schelling, and others for whom the symbol is the presence of the universal in the particular, or the coincidence of the ideal and real. Hegel uses the term "classical" to describe this form of art, while his term "symbolic" is closer to the allegorical for Benjamin (see in particular Aesthetics, 1:357-58). 79.
