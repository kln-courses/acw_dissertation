Swaffham, UK: Anglo-Saxon Books, 2010. Pp. 542; many color and b&amp;w figs., maps. $170. ISBN: 9781898281566. doi:10.1017/S0038713412002576 Vast in both scale and scope, this enormous volume (30cm χ 30cm) presents a new his tory of early Anglo-Saxon art of the pre-conversion period, with particular emphasis on metalwork. The text is by Stephen Pollington, the drawings are by Lindsay Kerr, and Brett Hammond contributed both artifact research and photographic plates. The volume is subdivided into six major sections. The first, on "Barbaric Style," pro vides a solid overview of contemporary issues concerning the functions and applications of style in art and a discussion of Anglo-Saxon identity and its regional subgroups as ex pressed in the archaeological record. Next follows "Style and Evolution," which endeav ors to place the several phases of Anglo-Saxon metalwork production in the context of their sources and of parallels in the late Roman and Scandinavian world. A third section, "Crafty Smiths," considers the metalworkers themselves and their repertory of tools, media, Speculum 87.3 (July 2012)</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 915 and techniques. The fourth section, "Wondrous Works," proceeds systematically through the range of artifact types that are the bearers of the art of early Anglo-Saxon smithcraft. The last major section, "Reading the Record," examines meaning in Anglo-Saxon art, both in abstract elements of design and in zoomorphic and anthropomorphic motifs. The vol ume closes with a short section on post-conversion art, a brief postscript on Celtic art, a useful set of maps, and a series of appendices: three on typology, respectively, of pottery stamps, buckles, and wrist-clasps; one on Old English taxonomies of color, plants, and animals; and an addendum on the recently discovered Staffordshire Hoard and its con text. The volume introduces and illustrates a significant number of heretofore unpublished examples of Anglo-Saxon metalwork, and therein lies much of the volume's value for schol ars in the field. Kerr's precise and elegant illustrations instructively clarify details of these objects, complementing Hammond's photographs. What issues may be raised here mostly concern Pollington's text, which—like many of his earlier publications—attempts to ne gotiate a middle ground between the scholarly complexities of the field and presentation of this material for a more general readership. The publisher notes on its website that the aim of the volume is to "prompt a better understanding of Anglo-Saxon art and the so ciety which produced it." Certainly such awareness would be beneficial to the future of Anglo-Saxon studies. But how much will the general reader gain from Pollington's brief explanations of such complex issues as Colin Shepherd's controversial application of Bayesian probability analysis to the seriation of ornamental styles? Moreover, Pollington's central arguments often reflect problematic methodological choices as well as a strongly held viewpoint. Pollington's text implies that Anglo-Saxon visual culture is best understood by the application of traditional and often dated art historical methods: a linear sequence of styles and a fixed and systematically applied ico nography. Pollington's iconographie approach is premised on the concept of a Germanic cultural continuum, united in its religion, mythology, and rituals from the Iron Age to the Vikings, and borrowing a significant number of practices and beliefs from circum polar shamanism. Although his introductory chapters include references to new approaches informed by theory, the main body of the text seems completely unaware of the work of such schol ars as Roberta Frank in challenging the anachronistic application of later literary texts to reconstruct meaning in significantly earlier Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian artifacts. Pollington's emphasis on continuity is particularly evident in reference to ritual activities, such as the symbel or mead feast, as fixed and quasi-liturgical (281). Pollington is cer tainly right in seeing many connections both in material culture and in the practices it reflects between the Angles in England and their Continental ancestors and contempo raries, but the Germanic cultures he discusses were strongly locally inflected: more cur rent studies, as in Signals of Belief in Early England: Anglo-Saxon Paganism Revisited (2010), provide more site-specific readings of Anglo-Saxon cultic activity. Pollington's approach also lends itself to unfortunate exclusions and overstatements. Of the several current scenarios for the arrival of the Angles in eastern England, Pollington argues for prior collapse or ethnic cleansing of the previous population of Britons so that Anglian visual culture may be studied as an isolated Germanic import. At the other end of the story, the earliest illuminated manuscripts, notably the Book of Durrow and the Lindisfarne Gospels, are presented here as showing little or no Irish or Pictish influence: they are "English" manuscripts, their ornament based on Salin Style II. Although pro moted in several major mid-twentieth-century publications, the argument for Anglo-Saxon primacy in manuscript illumination in the British Isles has been superseded in recent de cades by a more inclusive reading of an Insular continuum accommodating the variable intermixture of visual cultures. Pollington reads the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons as a Speculum 87.3 (July 2012)</page><page sequence="3">916 Reviews collaborative power play by Church and kings, eradicating entire categories of visual con tent and suppressing rather than transforming the rich legacy of what Pollington calls "hea then" art (67 et passim). Numerous informational errata also mar the text. Herewith a few responses to some examples: the hanging bowls are not cauldrons, as their enamelwork would not with stand the application of heat; not all Anglo-Saxon drinking horn fittings are from au rochs horns in princely graves, as there are many examples from the smaller horns of do mestic cattle; whalebone, not walrus ivory, was the preferred substitute for elephant ivory in pre-Norse England. The volume also suffers from a number of production flaws. Most critically, the plates list only rarely indicates current museum location, and the figures list and captions ex clude this information completely, an oversight that will make use of the volume difficult for researchers, given the number of previously unpublished objects illustrated here. Images of objects are often placed chapters away from the relevant text section, and many objects discussed at length are not illustrated at all. For the higher-numbered color plates, the ref erences by number in the text do not match the numbering of the plates themselves. From a book so rich both in new objects and in sheer range, reflecting such a prolonged invest ment of time and labor, one might wish for a higher level of attention to detail.
