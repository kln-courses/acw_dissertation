How far do his writings reflect a tradition or "school" of Jewish scriptural study associated with Alexandria perhaps for several generations? The classic formula- tion of the question was Wilhelm Bousset's Jidisch-christlicher Schulbetrieb in Alexandria und Rom (1915). Master Philonists like Goodenough and Wolfson acknowledged in passing that Philo frequently writes in response to the views of other exegetes with whom he agrees or disagrees, but whom he never describes at length. Recently Burton Mack has advocated a kind of tradition criticism of the Philonic corpus based on discrimination of varying exegetical approaches (see especially his "Philo Judaeus and Exegetical Traditions in Alexandria," pp. 227- 71 in Aufstieg und Niedergang der rdmischen Welt 2:21.1). Professor Tobin's book, a revised Harvard dissertation, is a venture extending this line of inquiry. Most of his book is devoted to distinguishing various pre- Philonic interpretations of the creation of man embedded in Philo's works. To identify the different exegetical traditions he relies on Philo's explicit references to other exegetes and on logical inconsistencies in his commentaries. Having identified traces of a distinct exegetical tradition, Tobin analyzes its overall meaning as an attempt to deal with the problems of the biblical text, considers its relationship to previous exegetical traditions, and then seeks possible connections with developments in ancient Stoic and Middle Platonic philosophy, especially as these can be linked with Alexandria. Apart from examination of Philonic texts, Tobin devotes most of his attention to discussing ancient Hellenistic philosophical writers. One of the distinctive features of his general position is that Hellenistic Jewish exegetes regularly sought to show that the Bible was in harmony with the best philosophical insights of their respective time periods. What results is a bold, if speculative, reconstruction of the history of Hellenistic Jewish exegesis concerning Gen 1-2 down to and including Philo. The earliest stratum was atomistic anti-anthropomorphism-efforts to answer individual criticisms of the biblical text. This was connected with the study of philosophy, mainly of Stoicism and pre-Middle Platonic Platonism. This level of material resembles anti-anthropomorphisms in Aristobulus and may be dated to the second or first century BCE. The next stage of interpretation, dated in the first * Thomas H. Tobin.

Around the beginning of the Common Era, Jewish Platonists probed the question why Genesis offers two accounts of human creation and answered it with a "double creation" theory: Gen 1:27 described a "heavenly man" (a sexually undifferentiated archetype) in contrast to the "molded" man of Gen 2:7 (a composite of body and soul). Philo's own contributions to the exegetical tradition were marked by important innovations influenced by new trends in Middle Platonism. He placed primary emphasis on spiritual experience (the "allegory of the soul"), and for him the two creation narratives depicted two kinds of minds rather than two men (Philo was also more concerned with the "fall" than with creation as such). Now for the first time there emerged an explicitly stated distinction between literal and allegorical levels of exegesis; Philo usually employed technical terms for allegory only in connection with "allegory of the soul." Finally, in contrast to previous exegetes, Philo consistently maintained respect for all his exegetical predecessors. Although he himself preferred allegorical exegesis, he considered the interpretations of all those predecessors inspired and valid, despite their conflicts with one another. This led him to incorporate them into his commentaries generally without revision, although he did revise some interpretations which he deemed question- able (p. 92). As a result the Philonic commentaries offer conflicting statements on exegetical as well as philosophical issues, but this very feature indicates their great value as trustworthy repositories of the diverse teachings and writings of a synagogue-related institution of Jewish exegesis in Alexandria that was active for over a century. The foundation of Tobin's investigation is a close reading of the Philonic texts that gives particular attention to incongruities suggestive of multiple tradi- tions. Consider Legum Allegoriae 1.31-42, a series of comments on Gen 2:7. In §§31-32 Tobin discerns a "double creation" viewpoint in terms of two different men. In §§36-38 a "single creation" anti-anthropomorphic orientation surfaces. In §§39-40 a "single creation" interpretation persists, but no longer an anti- anthropomorphic one. Then in §42 we have a "double creation" view again, but this time worked out in terms of minds rather than men. According to Tobin, Philo was conscious of the tensions among these interpretations, which stem from so many different predecessors and traditions, but he reproduced all with faithful- ness to substance and terminology. Tobin's book draws attention to the significance of the fairly frequent explicit mention of other exegetes in Philo's writings. Yet a passage pivotal for his argument, Quaestiones et solutiones in Genesin 1.8, illustrates the ambiguity of the data. Here Philo reports that some exegetes interpreted the two accounts of man's creation as of the "intelligible and invisible" man made in the image of God, on the one hand, and of a "sense-perceptible" molded man, on the other. 74</page><page sequence="3">TOBIN'S CREATION OF MAN-HAY 75 Tobin urges that this points to an extensive tradition of Platonic Jewish exegesis at least a generation older than Philo. But this passage in the Quaestiones is virtually unique in its clear reference to Platonizing exegetes; moreover, it says nothing about their date and not much about their opinions. Scholars will also differ on how persuasively Tobin has identified sharp contra- dictions or conflicts in Philo. A passage like Legum Allegoriae 1.31-42 surely offers a twisted strand of ideas, but how far its threads of thought are incom- patible or need to be assigned to different exegetical traditions is debatable. A recent dissertation by David T. Runia (Philo of Alexandria and the Timaeus of Plato; Leiden, 1986) is much more doubtful about the possibility of practicing source criticism on the Philonic treatises, although he confirms Tobin's judgment about the importance of the Timaeus for Philo's exegesis (see his critique of Tobin on pp. 556-58). On balance, the methodology employed in this study is important, even if controversial, and Tobin's rigorous application of it is a definite step forward in Philonic studies. His schematic account of the history of pre-Philonic exegesis may be too neat, but it offers an important framework for further discussion. The book enhances our awareness that a complex history of Jewish exegesis must underlie Philo's voluminous writings. Tobin has drawn a careful picture of what that history may have been like, in the process making sense out of many odd elements in Philo's texts, and this is a major accomplishment even if his argument is only a chain of probabilities. And quite apart from its overarching hypothesis, the book offers a series of subtle and stimulating explorations of the major Philonic passages bearing on the creation of man. DAVID M.
