<plain_text><page sequence="1">Impartiality and Participant-Interest Theories of Organiza- tional Effectiveness Michael Keeley This article analyzes how the concept of organizational effectiveness might be formulated so as to impartially reflect the various interests of organizational participants or constituents. Typical participant-interest theories of effec- tiveness are compared, the advantages of theories incor- porating a principle of justice are discussed, and a harm- minimization principle for evaluating organizations is proposed. Recent studies of organizational effectiveness have em- phasized the subjectivity of this concept. Whereas researchers have traditionally defined effectiveness in terms of objective organizational goals, some have lately attempted to define effectiveness from the subjective viewpoints of organizational participants or constituents (Cummings, 1977; Keeley, 1978; Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978; Connolly, Conlon, and Deutsch, 1980; Kanterand Brinkerhoff, 1981; Zammuto, 1982). The purpose of this article is (1) to clarify the logic of participant- interest notions of effectiveness and (2) to compare theories in this category. TRADITIONAL VIEWS AND INTERACTION IST ALTER NATIVES Goal-based definitions of effectiveness are still the rule in organizational theory (Hall, 1980); as Etzioni (1 975: 135) has stated: "Effectiveness establishes the degree to which an organization realizes its goals under a given set of conditions." Theorists, of course, use the term "effectiveness" to convey evaluative information. The term does not simply denote de- gree of goal attainment, which is potentially a matter of fact; but it expresses a general and somewhat vague virtue of organizations, a matter of value. Steers (1977) has noted that effectiveness is a broad construct, implying positive value, that remains theoretically obscure, but which tends to be operationalized in the form of organizational goal attainment. He also elects a goal-based formulation, advancing the following common argument (p. 5): The major advantage of the goal approach in evaluating effectiveness is that organizational success is measured against organizational intentions instead of against an investigator's value judgments (that is, what the organization "should" be doing). Thus, "we can study within a more objective framework what an organization is actually trying to do - and how well it succeeds" (Steers, 1977: 12-13). It is questionable, however, whether a goal-based approach is really objective. First, it is difficult to specify organizational goals or intentions objectively. Participants may disagree about these, as mig ht independent observers. It is frequently suggested that one analyze actual policies and procedures to determine an organization's "real," operative goals (Perrow, 1961), but the purpose of organizational policies and procedures is generally ambiguous. In a manufacturing operation, for example, policies and procedures may generate objective consequences, such as products, salaries, profits, pollution, etc. Some of these conse- quences are presumably goals, i.e., reasons for action; others are costs, i.e., expenses of action. How does one categorize consequences like profits and salaries? Certain participants and observers (e.g., shareholders) may see the manufacturing 1/Administrative Science Quarterly, 29 (1984): 1-25 ? 1984 by Cornell University. 0001-8392/84/2901-0001/$1 .00 I wish to thank Thomas Donaldson, Raymond Zammuto, and the anonymous ASQ referees for their constructive com- ments on earlier drafts.</page><page sequence="2">operation as a profit maker, whose costs include salaries; some (e.g., workers) may see this operation as a salary maker, whose costs include profits; still others (e.g., taxing bodies) may consider both profits and salaries to be goals, or costs (e.g., customers). There is ordinarily no objective criterion by which to resolve such differences. Ultimately, what are taken to be goals of an organization look very much like subjective goals for an organization, as conceived by someone or other. Furthermore, it is not obvious why organizational goals are appropriate criteria of effectiveness, that is, why criteria de- rived from organizational intentions are any more objective, in the sense of having normative validity, than other evaluative standards (say, ones derived from individual rights). Even if one could demonstrate that organizations really have goals (for instance, survival, integration, or other aims attributed to or- ganizations in systems models), one must still justify their status as criteria for evaluation. From the fact that an organiza- tional goal exists, one cannot logically infer that it ought to exist and be attained. Perhaps organizations like the Ku Klux Klan do try to survive; it does not follow that they should survive or be judged on their survival capacity. In fact, the attainment of all sorts of goals of all sorts of organizations is regularly subordi- nated to other values in our courts, press, customs, and within many organizations themselves. Theorists have been reluctant to become entangled in debate over the value of organizational goal attainment (Simon, 1957), but it is a mistake to think that it is not a matter for debate, that it is a self-evident good. Subjective value judgments are inherent in evaluation (Campbell, 1977), and the question that a useful theory of effectiveness must address is whose values should count for how much. Goal-based theories often begin with a reasonable assumption, namely, that the values of organizational partici- pants, not academic experts, should furnish the primary criteria of effectiveness. The researcher's task is merely to sys- tematize the value judgments of the subjects of research. Although this assumption cannot yield an objective criterion, it may yield something almost as good, an impartial criterion, which respects the basic interests of persons who actually participate in organizations and which is free of researcher bias toward any special interests. Traditional goal-based approaches typically fail to achieve impartiality because they incorporate a subsequent, less reasonable assumption: that organizational goals reflect the common values of our subjects, or at least the values of persons classified as organizational members. How- ever, even a narrowly defined class of members may have no common interest in any particular goal.' Contrary to received doctrine, organizations need not entail shared purposes, but only shared activities, which serve the diverse and conflicting purposes of individuals - profits for some, wages for others, etc. (Keeley, 1980). Thus, any "organizational" goal may only reflect the values of some subjects, and the attainment of such a goal is hardly an impartial measure of effectiveness. To reduce bias, theorists generally no longer rely on single-goal measures of effectiveness, like profitability or productivity. Many propose that organizations have multiple and conflicting goals that represent the diverse values of specific interest groups (Van de Ven, 1980; Scott, 1981; Hall, 1982); yet, the important question of whose goals (values) should count for 2/ASQ, March 1984 1 Of course, one can narrow the definition of organizational membership to such an ex- tent as to nearly force goal consensus. For example, one could regard only sharehold- ers as true members of a corporation, whose goal is profit. Even in this extreme case, however, goal consensus is not as- sured. Some persons and activist groups hold stock in major corporations not for profit, but simply to challenge company policies. Moreover, as organizational boundaries are narrowed to include fewer participants as members and more as out- siders, the primacy of organizational goals vis-6-vis conflicting environmental expecta- tions becomes more difficult to justify. Finally, no matter how narrow the set of members, theirinterests may not be impar- tially served by attainment of a shared goal because of the distribution problem en- tailed in goal-based theories (explained below).</page><page sequence="3">Participant-Interest Theories how much remains (Cameron and Whetten, 1983). Moreover, multiple goal-based measures may still misrepresent the values of participants, because even those who share an interest in an organizational outcome may have no common interest in its overall level of attainment, as goal models imply. Employees, for instance, may all have an interest in increased wages, which are sometimes included in the goal set of an organization; but employees care about theirown wages, and perhaps how they compare to those of others, not necessarily about the aggre- gate level of wages that an organization attains. If an organiza- tion increased its overall wage level by increasing the compen- sation of favorably situated individuals (relatives of officers, possessors of scarce skills or prestigious degrees), it is unlikely that many others would consider the higher wage level to be much of an improvement. The point is that goal-based mea- sures of effectiveness, whether single or multiple, are rather insensitive to the distribution of outcomes, whereas organiza- tional participants usually care a great deal about how outcomes are distributed. It is only when persons feel that their own interests are protected by some equitable distribution principle (e.g., allocation of profits according to shares held, in the case of owners) that they may value the overall attainment of a collective outcome or goal. In general, goal-based theories are biased toward the values of participants who have the most to gain by the attainment of a given goal. Such problems have led some theorists to challenge not only traditional notions of effectiveness, but traditional notions of organization itself. Despite the often drawn distinc- tion between facts and values, there is a connection between how we conceptualize a thing and how we evaluate it (Taylor, 1967). It may not make much sense to continue to view organizations as systems for the attainment of collective goals if goal-based evaluation is so problematic. The most serious challenge to received views involves the idea that organizations are negotiated interaction systems, which are instruments for the satisfaction of personal interests. Reflecting this idea are models that portray organizations as political coalitions (March, 1962), games (Allison, 1971), com- petitive arenas (Cummings, 1977), markets (Pfeffer and Salan- cik, 1978), negotiated orders (Strauss, 1978), and contracts (Keeley, 1980). All avoid anthropomorphic imagery that attrib- utes intentions, needs, welfares, and other biological prop- erties to organizations; instead, organizations are seen to be nonteleological social structures consisting of the interrelated behaviors of self-interested participants or constituents (much broader categories than members, usually including any per- sons who affect one another through an organized system of rules). Interactionist models do not deny that a shared purpose may emerge among participants, but such a purpose is not assumed to be an essential aspect of organizations; it is an occasional feature requiring empirical confirmation. It is not assumed to be a goal of the organization as a personified entity; it remains a goal for the organization of natural persons. And it is not assumed to have any intrinsic value; it is but a means of furthering individual purposes for cooperation. The descriptive credibility of interactionist models has been demonstrated in a number of studies (Dalton, 1959; Allison, 1971; Farberman, 1975; Storey, 1980); myconcern hereiswith 3/ASQ, Ma rch 1984</page><page sequence="4">their normative implications. These models suggest that or- ganizations are effective to the extent that they do, in fact, satisfy the interests of participating individuals. Such a general criterion of effectiveness is, of course, subject to differing interpretations, and, like goal-based criteria, it lacks objectivity. Yet, unlike goal-based criteria, it has potential for impartiality over a wide range of circumstances. Typical interpretations, in the form of four distinct theories of effectiveness, have been identified by Zammuto (1982). While certainly not the only possibilities, these theories represent major approaches to defining effectiveness in terms of participant interest- satisfaction. Howthese approaches fare in displaying impartial- ity is an important point of comparison.2 RELATIVISTIC APPROACH Perhaps the most straightforward theory is the strongly rel- ativistic multiple-constituency approach of Connolly, Conlon, and Deutsch (1980), who contend that no single statement about organizational effectiveness is possible nor desirable. The authors believe that judgments of effectiveness are inevi- tably contingent upon which individuals or groups (constituen- cies) supply the criteria for evaluation. "Individuals become involved with an organization (as owners, managers, em- ployees, customers, suppliers, regulators, etc.) for a variety of different reasons, and these reasons will be reflected in a variety of different evaluations. It appears somewhat arbitrary to label one of these perspectives a priori as the 'correct' one" (Connolly, Conlon, and Deutsch, 1980: 212). The relativistic, multiple-constituency approach is intuitively plausible, but it contains some critical points of ambiguity, one of which is whether there is any nonarbitrary justification for regarding a given constituency's perspective as more valid or correct than another's. Connolly and his colleagues (1980) tend to dismiss attempts at justification, suggesting that each con- stituency's perspective is equally valid. This suggestion is defended only indirectly, however, causing further ambiguity concerning why each perspective is valid. It is true that the evaluations of different constituencies will generally vary (Pickle and Friedlander, 1967); yet, from this empirical fact, one cannot logicallydrawthe normative conclusion that one evalua- tion is as valid as another. To reach such a conclusion, an implicit normative premise is required (Williams, 1972). The premise relied on by Connolly, Conlon, and Deutsch (1980), along with most relativists, seems to be that it is less ethnocentric, authoritarian, biased, or the like -and it is therefore right -to accept the validity of virtually any participant's judgments. In fact, the authors grant no special standing even to the perspec- tives of direct participants, but use the term "constituencies" "to emphasize the possibility that individuals and groups not directly associated with the focal organization may form evalu- ations of its activities" (Connolly, Conlon, and Deutsch, 1980: 213). Presumably, these evaluations are legitimate as well. One might ask whether it really is less biased, and thus rig ht, to accept the validity of just about anyone's judgment regarding an organization. Some participants' perspectives may themselves be heavily biased against the basic interests of others, and it is questionable whether they should be granted the same validity as anyone else's. A relativist might argue, for instance, that if 4/ASQ, March 1984 2 Impartiality is a reasonable, minimal stan- dard for assessing theories of organiza- tional effectiveness. A claim to something like impartiality is implied not only in theories that purport to identify an ultimate common good or collective goal, but also in theories that reject shared orientations and define effectiveness from the separate viewpoints of an organization's multiple constituencies. Impartiality is of special im- portance in defending thevalidity of norma- tive theories to subjects of research. It may not be feasible to invoke criteria of empiri- cal 'proof," but demonstration that theories favor the basic interests of no particular persons is an appropriate re- sponse toanyone who would challenge the validity of an effectiveness conception.</page><page sequence="5">Participant-Interest Theories owners prefer hig her profits and workers prefer better wages or working conditions, it makes no sense to say that one preference is more deserving than the other. In some circum- stances, it may indeed appear arbitrary to order these prefer- ences, but not always. In the nineteenth century, a good deal of public debate took place overthe employment of children in the English textile industry. Mill owners vigorously opposed labor restrictions because they feared increased competition from foreign goods and reduced profits. However, reports of the conditions to which children were exposed in the industry shocked others and eventually led Parliament to enact protec- tive legislation despite the owners' objections.3 In considering mill conditions, in enacting the Factory Acts, the British Parlia- ment had to choose between the preferences of owners for greater profitability and the preferences of children for health, education, and opportunity to escape poverty. Few today would regard the choice made as arbitrary or doubt that it signaled a genuine improvement in the factory system. The drawback of an unqualified relativism is that it recognizes no limits on the validity of demands that organizational partici- pants may place on one another. In attempting to avoid bias it may unintentionally, but effectively, legitimate the most ex- treme demands, prejudices, and, in some cases, outright cruelty (thus calling into question its own claim to impartiality). Obviously, it is not always possible to order conflicting partici- pant preferences with great confidence; and the task may only become easy with the advantage of considerable hindsight. Nevertheless, the task need not be an impossible one, as alleged by relativists, and it is a far more practical one than they usually admit. The proposition that it is not necessary or desirable to order constituency perspectives in accordance with a general effec- tiveness criterion contains a final ambiguity: not necessary or desirable for whom? For theorists, it may be convenient to adopt a thoroug hgoing relativism, but not for those who actually take part in administering complex organizations (man- agers, regulators, judges, etc.). Connolly, Conlon, and Deutsch (1980) recognize that conflicts among perspectives are quite common in organizations and present serious problems for administrators; still, their extreme form of relativism permits them to say little about means of resolution, and they "feel no embarrassment" about leaving such conflicts unresolved. In disputing the importance of a preference-ordering criterion, the authors are convincing only in cases where different organiza- tions are the subjects of conflicting evaluations; for example, they state (1980: 21 6): We would argue that the question "Is General Motors more or less effective than HEW?" is of the same order as "Is an elephant more or less effective than a giraffe?" . . . We see no particular merit in an obsessional search forthe single measure of merit on which organiza- tions can be compared. Administrators, and other parties, however, do want to know whether GM or HEW ora woolen mill is itself more effective at one time than another. These are important comparisons; participants will make them, and act on them; and theories of effectiveness that ignore them seem rather impractical. 5/ASQ, March 1984 3 Testimony before Michael Sadler's Select Committee of the House of Commons in 1832 provides a graphic description of mill conditions (Wing, 1837). One witness, Matthew Crabtree, reported starting in a mill at the age of eight, working regularly from six in the morning to eight at night and from five to nine during brisk periods, per- forming operations that rubbed skin from the hands until they bled, running through- out the day to keep pace with the machine speed, suffering beatings with straps and clubs when fatigue diminished output, and being unable to even eat at the end of the day for anxiety about the next. Crabtree's testimony, and others', indicate that his experience was not unusual and was better than many.</page><page sequence="6">DEVELOPMENTAL APPROACH In response to the ambiguity of a strongly relativistic approach, Zammuto (1982) advances an "evolutionary" theory of effec- tiveness, which is similar to the relativist view in its normative outlook but goes a bit further in identifying a direction for organizational improvement. According to Zammuto (1982: 82), "effectiveness stems from the ability of an organization to satisfy changing preferences of its constituencies over time." He assumes that preferences will vary among constituencies and within the same constituency over time, but he does not assume that this variation necessarily results in unresolvable conflicts. A way of handling competing preferences is offered in his evolutionary "meta criterion." This criterion "specifies that effective performance increases the adaptability of the organization/environment by changing the constraints on per- formance, allowing it to satisfy changing constituent prefer- ences" (Zammuto, 1982: 78). The idea is that organizations operate in niches, composed of physical, biological, and social constraints that "define what is possible and limit the alterna- tives available to organizations" (1 982: 72). An effective organi- zation, then, is one that eventually expands its niche, the limits on what is possible, in order to better satisfy participants in the long run. Although Zammuto's evolutionary theory is framed in the language of an organismic social model (Keeley, 1980), its main argument is separable from such a model, and the theory is properly classified as a participant-interest view.4 The argument might be put in other words by saying that organizations are not zero-sum games: should conflicts among constituent prefer- ences arise, these should be handled not by subordinating some groups or by redistributing outcomes among groups, but by imaginatively expanding the range of possible outcomes so as to permit the satisfaction of both current and emerging preferences, which is "the hallmark of effectiveness from the evolutionary perspective" (Zammuto, 1982: 147). Unfortu- nately, this approach does not go far enough in specifying a clear criterion of effectiveness, for many situations may be zero-sum, or close to it. As an example of relatively effective adaptation, Zammuto cites the strategy of General Motors during the 1970s. The company downsized its product line and strengthened its international operations by expanding its niche overseas. It remains to be seen, however, whether GM can devise a strategy that is effective in terms of satisfying current and emerging con- stituent preferences. From the viewpoint of many consumers, product and process innovations have not been sufficient to offset the higher labor costs built into domestic vehicles. Some American workers have already lost jobs and benefits through GM's attempts to adapt, and more are threatened by company plans for further overseas expansion. In short, the effective- ness of GM, according to Zammuto's (1982) criterion, is inde- terminate. This case is not exceptional. Many changes in social systems result in gains for some constituents and losses for others (Thurow, 1981). Zammuto's meta criterion yields little information about these changes. The criterion strongly resembles a Pareto efficiency principle, though it is not altogether clear whether Zammuto has in mind 6/ASQ, March 1984 4 The separability of Zammuto's argument from an organismic model is evidenced in the normative implications of his theory. These are distinct from the implications of more naturalistic evolutionary models (e.g., Aldrich, 1979), which stress system versus participant well-being. Whether or not one agrees that Zammuto's view represents a true evolutionary theory, it is representative of the important class of economic devel- opmental theories that qualify as participant-interest approaches. Earlier comments on goal-based theories and the following section on power-based theories address issues raised by other evolutionary models.</page><page sequence="7">Participant-interest Theories a criterion of actual orpotential Pareto efficiency. The former lends approval to a social change only if someone is made better off and no one worse off; the latter lends approval to a change if it increases system potential to make someone better off and no one worse off, given hypothetical compensation for any losses. In any event, Pareto-like principles are notoriously inconclusive (Little, 1950; Rawls, 1971). Thurow (1981: 219) contends that, since someone is likely to be made worse off by virtually any large-scale social change, "nothing is [actually] Pareto efficient in the real world"; furthermore, changes that are only potentially Pareto-efficient conceal true conflicts be- tween constituent's preferences, which simply cannot be ignored in the real world. Thurow's view may be too pessimis- tic; there may be certain cases where a more-is-better-than- less approach is informative, but nontrivial cases for a theory of effectiveness are precisely those in which such an approach produces no confident judgments - cases in which some constituents get more over time, some get less, and a choice must be made about whose preferences should have priority. Zammuto assumes that this choice can be avoided if enough imagination is used in organizational design. In the final analysis, "the evolutionary approach does not raise the question of whose preferences should be satisfied. Rather, it's a question of how preferences are going to be satisfied" (Zammuto, 1982: 83). The first question is not so easily set aside. There are, after all, objective limits on organizational capacity to satisfy partici- pants' preferences; and participants' subjective expectations tend to rise along with system capacity to meet them, suggest- ing that attempts to satisfy current and emerging preferences may entail a futile run on a "hedonic treadmill" (Brickman and Campbell, 1 971). For practical purposes, it is often necessary to distinguish between more or less legitimate preferences, as in laws and other normative codes. Theories that make no such distinctions generate not only indecisive evaluations, but troublesome normative implications. It is too much to ask that an effectiveness theory provide a decisive evaluation of every conceivable social change; some organizational changes are probably neither good nor bad, and an attitude of indifference toward them is appropriate. Still, a theory that equivocates over a very wide range of change has a decidedly conservative bent. Using Zammuto's (1982) criterion, for instance, one could not even say for sure whether the abolition of slavery represented a real improvement in American plantation organizations. Many constituents were dissatisfied by the change, and it did not reduce constraints on the performance of many plantations or enhance their capacity to satisfy future preferences. Developmental theories may not directly endorse the status quo, but indirectly, they can serve to support the most extreme patterns of social or economic advantage by implying that there are no good reasons for changes that redistribute system benefits, in contrast to ex- panding them. The developmental approach (like the relativist approach) has value in emphasizing that the satisfaction of human interests is the basis of organizational effectiveness; however, it under- estimates the probability of collision between the interests of organizational participants. What is needed to address ade- quately the distributional issues raised by a participant-interest 7/ASQ, March 1984</page><page sequence="8">theory of effectiveness is a criterion for prioritizing conflicting constituent preferences. Two priority rules have been men- tioned most often in recent discussions of the effectiveness concept: one ordering preferences according to participant power (Pennings and Goodman, 1977; Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978), the other according to a liberal notion of justice (Keeley, 1978; House, 1980). POWER APPROACH One of the most complete statements of a power-oriented approach to evaluation is provided by Pfeffer and Salancik (1978). The authors begin with an interactionist model suggested by Cyert and March (1963) and conceptualize organi- zations as coalitions of self-interested groups or participants. Coalition participants enga'ge in exchange relationships through the medium of the organization, which remains viable to the extent that it supplies personal inducements sufficient to elicit participants' continuing contributions. According to Pfeffer and Salancik (1978: 26), organizations function much like markets: There is no requirement for the participants to share vested interests or singular, paramount goals. Anything that justifies a participant's involvement is sufficient from an organizing point of view.... Organizational participants may come into the coalition when there is some advantage to be gained and leave when there is no longer any advantage. The gains and costs ire defined in terms of the individual participants or groups, not in terms agreed upon by all or promulgated by the organization's management. From this perspective, they develop a participant-interest theory of organizational effectiveness, in which effectiveness is a multifaceted concept reflecting the criteria and preferences of various interest groups. Pfeffer and Salancik recognize that balancing the diverse and competing demands of these groups is a basic problem of administration. They argue that not all demands are equally important. Some participants contribute more critical and scarce resources to the organization, and it is primarily those persons, who have the most power to affect operations, whom an effective organization must satisfy. Therefore, to assess or- ganizational effectiveness one must, first, identify relevant participants, considering what resources are critical to the organization and who could possibly provide them; second, weight the relative power of participants to control critical resources; third, determine the criteria by which various partic- ipants evaluate the organization; and, finally, assess the impact of organizational actions on these weighted criteria. Pfeffer and Salancik (1978: 89) advance both descriptive and normative claims for this procedure: it "represents both a model of organizational behavior and a prescription for manag- ing organizations to ensure their continued survival." The normative, if not the descriptive, claim is controversial. Perhaps some organizations do act so as to satisfy the most powerful participants. The question remains whether they should. Pfeffer and Salancik offer a reasoned defense of their norma- tive position. They do not rely on a simple might-makes-right type of justification, but assume that the rewarding of uncom- mon skills and material contributions can increase organizational capacity to provide benefits for all participants, including those 8/ASQ, March 1984</page><page sequence="9">Participant-interest Theories who have less to bargain with. The ultimate justification, then, for a power-based system of incentives is that it can work to everyone's advantage, not merely to the advantage of the powerful. Early advocates of such systems, like Adam Smith (1 937) and Frederick Taylor (191 1), were quite careful to stress their advantages to even "the lowest ranks"; Pfeffer and Salancik are similarly careful. A power-based theory, of course, raises the problem of specify- ing just what is to everyone's advantage and, in turn, what resources are critical for its attainment. The acceptability of any meritarian theory of effectiveness depends largely on its ability to identify a mutually advantageous outcome. Smith (1937) and Taylor (191 1) assumed that it was a collective goal, the produc- tion of aggregate wealth, that advantaged everyone. Unfortu- nately, the attainment of this goal, or any goal, may not benefit anyone but the powerful. Pfeffer and Salancik (1978: 47) do better in supposing it is a general means (of attaining partici- pants' own goals) that works to everyone's advantage; they propose that, while participants may have different prefer- ences for organizational ends, all have an instrumental interest in perpetuating the organization itself: "it is in the interests of all coalition participants to have the organization survive, for their continuing participation in the organization indicates they are obtaining benefits theywould like continued." Hence, organiza- tional survival serves as a common value, a basis for distinguish- ing critical resources, and a reason for giving priority to the demands of participants who control such resources. Though organizational survival carries a heavy justificatory burden in power-based theories of effectiveness (see also Pennings and Goodman, 1977), it may not be a sufficiently impartial value to bear the load. Pfefferand Salancik's assertion that participants all have an interest in organizational survival is debatable. It is not consistent with their initial theoretical model, which regards shared interests as unnecessary. Moreover, mere organizational participation does not indicate that persons are really obtaining benefits they want continued through system survival; Pfeffer and Salancik (1 978: 98) themselves demonstrate that, Organizations may purposely manipulate the illusion of satisfaction to avoid the open expression of some demands. Patients in a psychiatric hospital may be drugged to reduce their demands on the staff. At the same time, relatives may be told about all the fine therapeutic activity going on. As the example suggests, some people participate in organiza- tions because they have virtually no choice or because they are mistaken in their expectations about the benefits of participa- tion (Hirschman, 1970). Many participate in the hope of secur- ing goods, which may never materialize (e.g., a successful career promised to hard-working employees, social popularity promised to consumers of beauty aids) or which are eventually outweighed by accompanying ills (e.g., hidden product hazards, a latent industrial disease). People may simply discover too late that the costs of organizational participation exceeded the benefits, and the interests of such participants might have been better served had the organization not survived. As Pfeffer and Salancik point out, it is not in the interest of a survival-oriented organ~ization to pay much attention to disad- 9/ASQ, March 1984</page><page sequence="10">vantaged participants, unless they acquire the collective power to withhold critical organizational resources. And organizations can diffuse this power; for instance, through cosmetic ac- commodations to interest groups, by which participants are given a feeling of influence. "A consumer affairs department can deal with complaints about the product with a letter and a free sample, but the production and development departments remain unaffected" (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978: 274). While letters and samples may not fully relieve the regret over participation of former customers, they may be sufficient to prevent collective actions, such as calls for governmental regulation or warnings to new customers, that could endanger an organization's resource supply. Even regulations and warn- ings may pose ineffective threats to organizational survival and prompt little organizational concern for regretful consumers if potential customer resources are plentiful (as in the tobacco industry). From an impartial point of view, the objectionable feature of the powerapproach is that individual persons are ultimately granted only instrumental worth. Consumers, employees, and other participants take on importance only insofar as they can con- tribute to or threaten system survival. The danger is that this approach may sanction harsh or deceptive practices that work to the organization's advantage, i.e., someone's advantage, but not to the advantage of all participants, which is the rationale for a power-based incentive system in the first place. This danger is present whenever a collective consequence - organizational goal attainment, system survival, revolution, etc. - is adopted as a surrogate for individual interests and the basis of participant value. An impartial theory of effectiveness cannot overlook the intrinsic worth of individual persons. Intrinsic worth implies that each participant has at least some claims that do not depend for their legitimacy on one's personal power to affect organiza- tional well-being. Claims of this sort (say, to disclosure of information about the risks of investment, employment, or purchase) often appear just as deserving as more functional demands; they are certainly not trivial to many organizational participants. In order to allow for these claims, it is essential to view individual participants as ends in themselves, not merely as resources forthe organization's use. This shift in perspective underlies attempts to derive criteria of effectiveness from theories of justice. SOCIAL JUSTICE APPROACH Among approaches that invoke liberal principles of justice as standards for organizational evaluation, Zammuto (1982) in- cludes the theories of Keeley (1978) and House (1980), both of whom build on the ideas of John Rawls (1971 ).5 Such theories are not distinctive in applying philosophical notions of justice to problems of effectiveness, but only in making this application explicit. Justice and effectiveness are parallel concepts. Both represent a primary measure of social-system value: "Justice is the first virtue of social institutions" (Rawls, 1971: 3), just as "effectiveness is the ultimate question in any form of organiza- tional analysis" (Hall, 1980: 536). And both concepts require the same type of measure, one that fairly balances the interests of system participants: "Principles of social justice . .. provide a way of assigning rights and duties in the basic institutions of 1O/ASQ, March 1984 5 Dahrendorf (1979: 96-97) clarifies the meaning of "liberal" in this context: "The moral element of liberal thought is the conviction that it is the individual that mat- ters, and the defence of his inviolability, of the unfolding of his potential, and of his life chances which follows from this convic- tion. Groups, organizations, institutions are never a purpose in themselves, they are instruments for the purpose of individual development."</page><page sequence="11">Participant-interest Theories society and they define the appropriate distribution of the benefits and burdens of social cooperation" (Rawls, 1971: 4); similarly, "the effectiveness of an organization is a sociopolitical question" (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978: 1 1) concerning "who wants what and how important is it that the demand be satisfied? and what are the implications of the satisfaction of one demand for the satisfaction of other demands?" (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978: 87). Organizational theorists have not often realized that their conceptions of effectiveness fall within the broad scope of social justice, and some are uneasy about the overtly normative language of justice (Connolly, Conlon, and Deutsch, 1980), but recognition of the connection between these concepts permits us to draw upon a long tradition of philosophical thought. In fact, all the approaches to organizational effectiveness re- viewed thus far have, in one way or another, been advanced by philosophers as theories of justice-goal-based approaches as forms of utilitarianism, power-based approaches as meritarian theories, and so forth. Furthermore, these classic theories of justice have lately been subject to criticism on precisely the grounds that the corresponding ideas of effectiveness have been criticized: they fail to respect impartially the basic inter- ests of participants in social systems (Rawls, 1971). To ap- preciate the demands of justice, we need a better understand- ing of the meaning of impartiality. Central to the meaning of impartiality is respect for persons (Taylor, 1978). Such respect is entailed in the proposition that individual human beings are ends in themselves, not merely resources or means to organizational well-being. In explaining this proposition, Vlastos (1 962: 48-49) has stated: Everything other than a person can only have value for a person. This applies not only to physical objects . .. but also to. . . an epic poem, a scientific theory, a legal system, a moral disposition. Even such things as these will have value only because they can be (a) experienced or felt to be valuable by human beings and (b) chosen by them from competing alternatives. Human beings, on the other hand, can themselves experience well-being or other emotions, choose plans, and respond to interests of their own; and it is this capacity to experience, choose, or value for one's self that sets persons apart as sources (rather than mere objects) of value and ends in them- selves. Because social systems, such as states, organizations, or component groups, lack this capacity of persons, they can have only derivative value. McTaggart (1934: 109) has argued forcefully that the personification and attribution of indepen- dent worth to nation-states, for instance, amounts to a crude form of fetish-worship -compared with which "zoolatry is rational and dignified. A bull or a crocodile may not have great intrinsic value, but it has some, for it is a conscious being. The state has none. It would be as reasonable to worship a sewage pipe, which also possesses considerable value as a means." For evaluative purposes, every organization is much like a sewage pipe; that is, it acquires worth from its functional value to persons, whereas individual persons have inherent worth. From the notion of respect for persons, an impartial norm for evaluating social systems can be derived, subject to the follow- ing general requirement (Taylor, 1 978: 49): 1 1/ASQ, March 1984</page><page sequence="12">To be substantively impartial a norm must be such that, when adopted and applied, every person as a person is given equal consideration. This does not mean that everyone must always be treated in the same way. But it does mean that each person's total set of basic interests is regarded as making the same initial claim-to-fulfillment as every other person's. (Basic interests are here understood to include, first, what- ever is necessary forpreserving an individual's autonomyas a chooser of his own value system, and second, whatever is necessary for realizing those of a person's ends and goals that are of fundamental importance in his or her self-chosen value system.) In accord with this requirement, an organization can be consid- ered just or effective to the extent that the basic well-being of each participant is given equal consideration in policymaking and implementation. Equal consideration implies recognition that every participant has some unconditional rights to well- being, rights independent of personal resources or talents, organizational needs, etc. It does not imply, however, that any and all preferences have identical standing or that all partici- pants must be treated alike. Consideration for the basic well-being of different persons may in fact call for differential treatment. If someone is threatened with murder, it is not partial or unjust, indeed justice demands, that such an individual receive more than ordinary police protection to allow the chance for an ordinary level of personal well-being (Vlastos, 1962). Similarly, persons with physical or cultural handicaps may deserve special treatment to compen- sate for those handicaps. It may also be impartial and just to permit individuals with natural talents and resources to profit from these advantages, not because they are more worthy of social and economic rewards or because they have greater capacity to promote organizational welfare, but because the basic well-being of persons lacking natural advantages might be further diminished if incentives for social cooperation were denied to the more talented and resourceful (Benn, 1967). Impartiality, then, involves treating persons as equals, in con- trast to treating them the same.6 The distinction reflects an assumption that some interests are more fundamental to human well-being than others, for example immunity from physical attack, access to employment opportunities, and the like. These are the interests that deserve equal consideration. In a just social system an attempt is made to ensure their satisfaction for each and every participant. This means giving first priority to participants whose fundamental interests might be in jeopardy. Principles of justice expressing this priority include Benn's (1967: 76) principle of equal consideration of interests, which "provides for the satisfaction of interests in order of urgency, every individual's claim being otherwise equal"; Rawls' (1971) difference principle, which provides for maximizing the expectations of the least advantaged partici- pants in a social system; and Keeley's (1 978) minimization-of- regret principle, which provides for minimizing the dissatisfac- tion of the most regretful organizational participants. For purposes of social evaluation, such principles are useful rules of thumb. They describe general directions for organiza- tional improvement that fit many of our normative intuitions. Rough rules of thumb, however, may yield very counterintuitive judgments in some cases, and they may be difficult to apply in others (Nozick, 1974; Strike, 1979). To better assess the merits 1 2/ASQ, Ma rch 1984 6 Dworkin (1978: 227) has discussed this contrast in some detail. He notes: There are two different sorts of rights [implied in the notion of equality]. The first is the right to equaltreatment, which is the right to an equal distribution of some opportunity or resource or burden. Every citizen, for example, has a right to an equal vote in a democracy.... The second is the rightto treatment as an equal, which is the right, not to receive the same distribution of some burden or benefit, but to be treated with the same respect and concern as anyone else. If I havetwo children, and one is dying from a disease that is making the other un- comfortable, I do not show equal con- cern if I flip a coin to decide which should have the remaining dose of a drug. This example shows that the right to treat- ment as an equal isfundamental, and the right to equal treatment derivative. In some circumstances, the right to treat- ment as an equal will entail a right to equal treatment, but not, by any means, in all circumstances.</page><page sequence="13">Participant-interest Theories of various principles of justice as evaluative criteria, it might be helpful to compare alternatives within a wider framework of possible effectiveness theories. BASES OF INTERPERSONAL JUDGMENT In order to develop a practical and impartial measure of organiza- tional value, it is necessary to recognize that the ends of participants will often vary and conflict. Theorists have at- tempted to simplify the problem of evaluating social systems by assuming uniformity of ends or lack of conflict among ends, or both. These simplifications restrict the applicability of theories and create potential for bias. Figure 1 classifies typical theories according to the degree to which they take seriously (1) the variability of participant ends and (2) the prospect of conflict among participant ends.7 These dimensions are logically inde- pendent: people could have the same ends, but still experience conflict over the enjoyment of those ends (e.g., in competing for a poker pot); and people could have different ends, yet experience no conflict in their separate attainment (e.g., in an ordinary exchange transaction).

Assumptions of effectiveness/justice theories. Collaborative Views Theories in the lower half of Figure 1 treat conflict among participant ends as unproblematic or, at best, as of secondary importance. Examples of some of these views have already been discussed, and their shortcomings can be quickly sum- marized. In traditional single-goal models of organizational effectiveness, e.g., a profit-maximization view, it is assumed that participants share very specific ends and nonconflicting interests in higher overall levels of goal attainment. These are strong assumptions, empirically credible only in special cases, perhaps in small businesses or pressure groups, cults, etc.; extending these assumptions to more complex organizations discounts legitimate interests in opposing outcomes as well as participant concerns over outcome distribution. The credibility of single-goal models can be strengthened by supposing that participants have only the most general end in 13/ASQ, March 1984 7 Theories are categorized according to pri- mary assumptions; some theories have secondary implications that could fit another category. Utilitarian and functional theories, for instance, have distributive im- plications, but these derive from more basic assumptions in the categories indicated.</page><page sequence="14">common, such as maximization of subjective welfare or utility, as in classical utilitarianism. By definition, welfare is a universal good, and a utilitarian measure like "the greatest good of the greatest number" could apply to almost all organizations. In aggregating utility moreover utilitarianism appears to avoid bias by giving each participant's welfare equal weight, accord- ing to Bentham's maxim of "everybody to count for one, nobody for more than one." However, it is still assumed that conflicts overwhose welfare goes up or down in the process of social change can be disregarded; as long as total (or average) welfare in a system increases, a change is for the better, even if some individuals experience significant welfare losses. Be- cause participants usually care very much about such losses, their own interests and separate worth are not respected in utilitarianism (Rawls, 1971). And because persons count only as data points in calculations of aggregate utility, controversial implications result (Hart, 1979: 830): given the same overall level of welfare, "the situation in which a few enjoy great happiness while many suffer is as good as one in which happiness is more equally distributed." In functional effectiveness theories, the assumption of com- mon participant ends is relaxed somewhat, and the ultimate ends of participants are viewed as variable. It is nevertheless assumed that participants share interest in aggregate organiza- tional consequences, which constitute very general means to everyone's particular ends. The distinguishing feature of func- tional theories is that these consequences are nondivisible or otherwise immune to conflict over their distribution, as in the theory of Pfefferand Salancik (1 978), which posits a commonly valued consequence of organizational survival (see also Yuchtman and Seashore, 1967; Pennings and Goodman, 1977). Such theories take no account of the fact that a given conse- quence may have widely differing impacts on individual partici- pants. Some may benefit a great deal, for instance, from organizational survival; others may benefit more from dissolu- tion and sale of assets; still others may benefit most from a consequence in between - takeover, reorganization, divesti- ture, or another fundamental change in organizational charac- ter. To choose one consequence as the appropriate means to participants' ends seems rather arbitrary and serves to conceal conflicts among these ends. Functional theories divert atten- tion to conflict over participants' instrumental value to the organization, which is easier to manage (e.g., by prioritizing claims on the basis of power) but which is harder to reconcile with the intrinsic worth of participants and impartial respect for their particular outcome preferences. Developmental effectiveness theories allow for more variability in participant ends. As illustrated in Zammuto's (1982) evolu- tionary model, no constraints on preferences are imposed; instead, a rate of organizational or economic development sufficient to satisfy both current and emerging desires is assumed. Thus, conflicts among ends are theoretically avoided by growth in the benefits of cooperation. This approach is a bit utopian, given limits on the capacity of cooperative systems to provide benefits and given the tendency of expectations to rise along with economic development. Conflicting expectations are not so readily dismissed, and, operationally, developmental l14/ASQ, Ma rch 1984</page><page sequence="15">Participant-interest Theories theories often revert to functional or goal-based views (e.g., in supply-side economics). Distributive Views Theories in the upper half of Figure 1 treat the problem of conflicting participant ends more seriously. In these theories, social systems are evaluated on the basis of how fairly the interests of participants are balanced and satisfied. The paradigm model of distributive justice addresses the question of allocating some specific, uniformly valued good (as in dividing a pie). Presumably, all individuals prefer more rather than less for themselves, and their conflicting preferences require a distributive principle to evaluate alternative allocation policies. Various principles have been advanced: distribution according to need, desert, strict equality, etc. (Vlastos, 1962; Leventhal, 1980). Most such principles find some application in everyday life; yet, none is unobjectionable as a criterion of organizational justice or effectiveness, because of disagreements over the ultimate object of distribution. For the sake of argument, imagine a very simple organization: a cooperative formed by a group of persons to buy (at wholesale markets) perishable commodities for home consumption. Sup- pose that all participants have roughly the same disposable income and need for food. Suppose that all have comparable skills and contribute equally of their time to the project; perhaps they take turns visiting the wholesale markets in the early morning and, subsequently, allocating their purchases. Sup- pose, finally, that an equal share of food is distributed and an equal share of its cost is assessed to all. While this arrangement may satisfy a variety of principles of distributive justice, it may not satisfy requirements of impartiality, since participants could have two distinct reasons for joining a cooperative - some, mainly to save money on food; others, mainly to obtain better quality, fresher goods than those available elsewhere. Assum- ing that shopping in the early morning will maximize quality and freshness, the economy-minded could legitimately complain that this shopping policy favored the others, that by shopping later they might get bargains on leftovers and minimize cost. Neither an early nor late shopping policy would equally respect the interests of all. Of course, alternative policies that do so might be devised, but the point is that simple models of distributive justice, which ignore the variability of participant ends, do not guarantee impartiality. Welfare-based theories of justice (Figure 1) share with utilitarianism the assumption that participants have only the mostgeneral end in common, namely, subjective welfare (Sen, 1979); in contrast to utilitarianism, this general end is seen to pose important conflicts over its distribution. Individuals prefer more rather than less welfare for themselves, though not necessarily for their social system as a whole. Welfare-based theories can incorporate any of the usual principles of distribu- tive justice; however, they display greater impartiality by allow- ing for more variability in preferences for specific outcomes. Reconsider the case of the cooperative. What seems to make both the early and late shopping policies unfair, despite their consistency with common principles of distributive justice, is the fact that each policy disadvantages some participants in terms of providing personal welfare. If welfare is the object of 1 5/ASQ, M arch 1 984</page><page sequence="16">distribution, another policy is required: the participants might alternate shopping times, the quality-minded shopping early one day and the economy-minded shopping later the next. Such a solution gives equal consideration to the interests of both, although there remains a problem with welfare-based approaches. Assume thatthe cooperative participants do alternate shopping times so as to equalize personal welfare or bring welfare distribution in line with some other principle of justice (choose any distributive principle). Say that this shopping policy, P1, yields e units of welfare to the economy-minded participants, the E's, and q units of welfare to the quality-minded partici- pants, the Q's (e and q may or may not be equal, depending on the principle chosen). If the participants have rather ordinary tastes, the means of producing e and q, i.e., P1 or some variant, are unlikely to be objectionable. According to a pure welfare- based theory, though, any policy that yields e to the E's and q to the Q's must be just as good as P1. This implication is difficult to accept should the welfare of some participants derive from very expensive or very modest tastes or prejudicial attitudes (Sen, 1979). Imagine, for instance, that over time the E's become indifferent to their menu; they eat to live. The Q's, on the other hand, come to crave delicacies; they live to eat. In this event, an alternating shopping policy may yield welfare levels less than e and q. Perhaps, however, the Q's can convince the E's that it would be more efficient to specialize their functions in the organization: the Q's will do all the shopping, while the E's handle clerical duties. The Q's, now, privately decide on a discriminatory shopping policy, P2 - they will shop really early, spending most of the food budget on delicacies for themselves and scavenging the previous day's uncollected trash for things to distribute to the E's. Since the E's are satisfied with calories alone and the Q's can satisfy their cravings, such a policy could conceivably yield welfare levels e and q; and, based on the distribution of welfare, P2 could be just as good or fair as P1 (possibly even better, if the Q's get more than q because they take perverse pleasure in tricking the E's: a Pareto-efficient move from P1). This sort of implication is inconsistent with widely-held normative beliefs. The cooperative case is deliberately contrived for purposes of argument, but it is not too far removed from reality. In firms, powerful insiders can sometimes waste assets, enrich them- selves at others' expense, or otherwise behave irresponsibly, yet still keep shareholders, employees, and customers rela- tively happy by following a kind of "mushroom" theory (keep them in the darkand coverthem with manure). The mushroom metaphor has an element of black humor precisely because we are not indifferent to means of producing human satisfaction; some means seem better, more impartial, than others. Welfare-based theories typically miss this point. Resource-based theories of justice (Figure 1) represent a decided improvement over pure welfarism. In such theories, as in functional effectiveness views, social participants are seen to have similar interests only in very general means to their own diverse ends. These means or resources, however, are now objects of conflict; individuals prefer more forthemselves. One of the best known resource-based approaches is Rawls' theory of justice. Rawls (1971: 93) assumes that "though men's 16/ASQ, March 1984</page><page sequence="17">Participant-interest Theories rational plans do have different final ends, they [all] require for their execution certain primary goods, natural and social." The primary goods, which are means to everyone's ends and the subjects of social justice, are "rights and liberties, opportunities and powers, income and wealth" (Rawls, 1971: 92), as well as grounds forself-respect. In general, Rawls proposes that social systems should be arranged so as to maximize the expectations (for primary goods) of participants who have the least of these goods.8 In other words, the higher the prospects of the worst-off group, the better the system. Because Rawls focuses on the distribution of commonlyvalued resources and not their contribution to personal welfare, his theory avoids the bizarre implications of welfare-based views (e.g., the more one craves caviar, the more one becomes entitled to it). His theory also reflects a greater respect for persons and their individuality than others discussed so far. Compared to single-goal or single-good theories, it allows for a plurality of (nonperverse) personal ends, which may be oppos- ing and incommensurable. Compared to utilitarian and func- tional theories, it does not permit the sacrifice of individual interests for the sake of some collective consequence that affects participants in an arbitrary way. Nevertheless, Rawls' theory has limitations. By emphasizing resources apart from their contribution to welfare, it not only discounts extreme tastes but, to some extent, special needs or handicaps as well. It is possible that a modified resource-based theory can over- come this difficulty (Sen, 1980; Schick, 1980; Dworkin, 1981). It is less clear, however, that a general, resource-based princi- ple of evaluation can be successfully applied to complex organizations (other than as a rough rule of thumb). Rawls and other advocates of resource-based theories concen- trate for the most part on the problem of justice in society as a whole. This is a simpler problem than that of justice within a particular organization, where the identification of commonly valued resources is usually more difficult. Rawls' primary goods, for instance, may be reasonable subjects of justice when evaluating the basic structure of society (and Rawls explicitly confines his analysis to this structure), but it is not reasonable to expect each specialized substructure of society to provide this same mix of resources to all participants (Rawls, 1982: 63). Rawlsian primary goods simply imply too much homogeneity of purpose to allow for the variability of ends that participants pursue in specific organizations, like major corpora- tions, in which some shareholders seek profits but not neces- sarily power, other shareholders seek both, workers seek wages or security or self-fulfillment in varying degrees, cus- tomers seek goods or services but not occupational opportu- nity, and so on. The fact is that different organizations serve different instrumental functions for different participants, even though all the organizations that constitute society or a person's domain of action may together serve a similar instrumental function when considered as a whole. This obviously compli- cates the evaluation of individual organizations. It seems, then, that the first question for a theory of organiza- tional evaluation to answer is not how to distribute or maximize some unproblematic good but, rather, what to adopt as an object of interpersonal value. Empirically, participants in com- plex organizations do cooperate despite disagreements over 17/ASQ, March 1984 8 As a special case of this general principle, Rawls stresses the priority of basic liberties over other primary goods. A detailed ac- count of the nature of primary goods can be found in Rawls (1982).</page><page sequence="18">the value of goals and the value of resources they expect organizations to provide. Normatively, it is essential to recognize these disagreements, if an impartial respect for persons and their separate interests is to be maintained. It is also worth recognizing that, in order to cooperate fairly or effectively, participants cannot disagree over everything; some element of common value is what distinguishes organizations from cases of mere aggregation (e.g., crowds) or exploitation (e.g., slavery). Resource-based theories are correct in proposing that it is agreement on multipurpose means, not ends, that defines this value element and binds many social systems together (Keeley, 1980); the general means specified are just not multipurpose enough. The diversified nature of large-scale organizations calls for an evaluative theory further to the right in Figure 1, i.e., one that identifies more fundamental grounds for agreement and accommodates a greater variety of human aims. A harm-based theory may best fit this requirement. Such a theory would hold that, to cooperate effectively, participants need only have similar interests in the avoidance of certain means to whatever ends or resources they hope to attain in organizations. In short, the value focus shifts from primary goods to primary bads. Though harm-based views have been explored by various social philosophers (Mill, 1956; Feinberg, 1973), a completely satisfying view applicable to the evaluation of organizations has yet to be developed. I will not pretend to develop one here; the following is a rough outline of what a harm-based theory of effectiveness might look like, what problems it solves, and what new questions it raises. MINIMIZING HARM Many philosophers have noted that people are very different in whatthey aim for in social life, butvery much alike in whatthey aim to avoid or find harmful (Baier, 1958; Watkins, 1963; Popper, 1966). Almost everyone seeks to avoid what is painful, life-threatening, disabling, damaging to one's property, pros- pects, or name. Associated harms generated by organizations could include industrial injuries, diseases from use of products or exposure to by-products, fraud, employment discrimination, and defamation, to name a few. There is considerable societal consensus on the seriousness of such harms (Meier and Short, 1982), and, as a matter of justice, everyone is entitled to avoid them. They jeopardize the basic interests of persons, whose equal worth implies that one need not earn freedom from harm. There is also an important asymmetry between organizational harm production and good production. The major objection to Rawls' resource-based theory was that, from an obligation of society to provide primary goods, we could not infer an obliga- tion of each organization in society to provide this same mix of goods to all participants. The objection does not apply to harms. If society owes members freedom from a particular harm, it follows that each organization ordinarily does have an obligation to avoid inflicting this harm on any participant. The distributive rule suggested by a harm-based theory, thatno persons should be subjected to serious harm by organizations, is less controversial and potentially more impartial than other principles. Few would wish to maintain that organizations should produce harm or that we should be indifferent to whether they do or not. Even his most conservative colleagues 1 8/ASQ, M arch 1984</page><page sequence="19">Participant-interest Theories and radical opponents might agree with George Will (1983: 80) that "you can argue about exactly what hospitals should do, but surely they should not spread disease." A no-harm rule, how- ever, like other rules, entails ambiguities that require clarifica- tion if it is not to mean all things to all people. In the abstract, the principle proposed here specifies that organizations improve- become better, more just, or effective - as they minimize harmful effects on any participants (without inflicting harms on others). The main ambiguities concern the interpretation of harm and minimization. Harms can be broadly defined as impairments of persons' basic interests (Kleinig, 1 978). Recall that, according to Taylor (1 978: 49), basic interests involve "first, whatever is necessary for preserving an individual's autonomy as a chooser of his own value system, and second, whatever is necessary for realizing those of a person's ends and goals that are of fundamental importance in his or her self-chosen value system." While this is a very general conception of basic interests, it is possible that some very specific impairments can be identified. We can imagine concrete events that would frustrate virtually anyone's purposes, regardless of what those purposes happen to be, e.g., losing one's hand in a punch press. Such impairments will be termed "basic harms," to distinguish them from mere failures to satisfy a personal preference, e.g., finding peach ice cream unavailable at the corner grocery (which may not frus- trate the next customer). This distinction implies only that some interests are more basic to human well-being, less dependent on subjective tastes, and more deserving of protection than others. It does not imply that harms are limited to active invasions of interests; many failures to benefit another are probable harms (e.g., malpractice, breach of contract). In identifying basic harms, it is not necessary, or sensible, to disregard all individual differences, but only differences in subjective preferences. Every harm occurs in a certain situation, and in judging potential harms we must imagine some given circumstances: one is crossing the street when hit by a company's truck, or one is operating a punch press under terms of employment when losing a hand. A more precise criterion, then, for distinguishing basic harms is whether virtually any- one, in a particular set of objective circumstances, but despite any particular set of subjective preferences, would find his or her purposes frustrated by an event.9 These objective circum- stances could include physical characteristics of the person as well as the environment, such as a physical disability requiring the use of a wheelchair. Thus, structural barriers that impair mobility and frustrate the purposes of virtually anyone in a wheelchair could be basic harms, but not structural barriers around bank vaults that frustrate the purposes of someone who prefers robbery to other sources of income. The criterion offered above will not, of course, settle all disputes over the identification of basic harms. Disputes can still arise about which circumstances are relevant in describing and categorizing an alleged harm. More theoretical work needs to be done to isolate factors that make special circumstances significant (e.g., the incapacity to avoid such circumstances, as in the case of race, sex, or disabilities). Nevertheless, for practical purposes, the proposed criterion may be good enough to distinguish a wide variety of basic harms. It could be used, for 19/ASQ, March 1984 9 By "virtually" anyone, I mean to exclude only those with extremely unusual mo- tives, e.g., saints who have negligible con- cern for their own welfare or fanatics who have negligible concern for another's. By "subjective preferences," however, I do mean to exclude a rather wide range of cognitive states, e.g., mental disabilities, beliefs about the material world, religious convictions, etc. Such things are ordinarily not mere matters of taste, and they might be better categorized as circumstances of action.</page><page sequence="20">instance, to assess the validity of harms recognized (or over- looked) in law. A detailed listing of organizationally generated harms proscribed in legislation, administrative codes, and judi- cial decisions would require volumes if not libraries; and law is a logical starting point in itemizing harms (Eser, 1966; Clinard and Yeager, 1980). Some statutes and decisions, however, may just reflect the political influence of dominant groups or historical accident; they may give too much protection to some interests and too little to others. Even a crude criterion of basic harm could be helpful in sorting outthese cases. Deciding whatto do about basic harms, once identified, is perhaps the tougher problem. It is a widely accepted belief that harm minimization (in some sense) should take precedence over other organizational con- cerns. In many normative systems, including the Anglo- American system of law, it is ordinarily no justification for harmful conduct tha't an act was performed for the sake of organizational well-being, goal attainment, or to satisfy the preferences of certain constituents. As systems of law also illustrate, harm minimization can be a practical ideal. People can function, often with a good deal of freedom, under harm- enjoining rules; so can organizations. Although it may be very difficult to satisfy any and all participant preferences (for high profits, job satisfaction, product quality, service, and so on), it is less difficult to respect everyone's rights to avoid basic harms. The principle of harm minimization may be impractical, though, if it is interpreted too narrowly, if minimization is taken to mean that even the most remote risk of harm must be avoided (Fried, 1978). There are at least two ways of attempting to minimize harm. One is to try to reduce directly the occurrence of harmful consequences through preventative interventions, such as prohibitions or restrictions on conduct that may lead to harm. The other is to try to reduce the personal impact (and maybe, indirectly, the occurrence) of harmful consequences through after-the-fact liabilities, such as assignment of compensatory damages for the consequences themselves (Stone, 1980). Both strategies are sometimes legally imposed on organiza- tions, sometimes voluntarily adopted, but neither strategy is necessarily required by the harm-minimization principle. One or the other may be logical depending on the activity. The inter- ventionist approach appears to be more appropriate for dealing with specific activities that are intrinsically harmful. For exam- ple, contamination of food products or long days of heavy labor for children carry enough risk of harm to warrant preventative restrictions on processing and employment practices. While preventative restrictions and prohibitions may stimulate search for better practices, the interventionist approach has obvious limitations. The only sure way to prevent harm is to prohibit even the most general sorts of activity; to prevent all traffic or industrial injuries, for instance, one would have to prohibit any kind of transportation or industry. Organizational harm cannot be minimized through extensive prohibitions, because persons' basic interests can be impaired by restrictions on activities as well as engagement in activities. Both must be subjected to the same type of analysis to determine whether they constitute basic harms. If virtually any participant's purposes would be frustrated by prohibition or 20/ASQ, March 1984</page><page sequence="21">Participant-interest Theories given restrictions of an activity, despite the risk of harm, it is a basic harm to prohibit or restrict the activity. Almost any participant might choose to avoid prohibition or certain restric- tions of general activities, like transportation or industry, despite the risk that he or she could ultimately be harmed by the activity. What most would not accept, however, and what the principle of harm minimization opposes, is avoidance of liability by organizations that cause harm in the course of an activity. A strict liability approach, which prescribes compensation for harmful consequences even if unintentionally caused or the result of a reasonable risk (Epstein, 1980), seems especially applicable to organizations. From an interactionist perspective, organizations as nonorganic systems of activity cannot them- selves literally intend harm, though they may produce harmful consequences, and much of the harm that organizations do produce is probably not intended by any participants. A strict liability standard (such as currently applied to industrial injuries under workers' compensation statutes) affirms these points, in addition to the fundamental point of the harm-minimization principle: basic harms are wrongs that call for some form of remedial action. Further research may reveal other ways of dealing with harm and other conditions under which particular strategies are appropriate (Stone, 1980, 1982). Although the harm- minimization principle does not specify exactly how to reduce harm (any more than, say, goal-based principles specify how to maximize system goal attainment), it provides at least an orientation for normative inquiry, and it has some unique implications for organizational evaluation. It suggests, first of all, that harm is a continual prospect in organizational life. This does not mean that organizations are generally evil or "criminogenic" (Gross, 1978), nor does it mean that organizational policymakers or other participants are usually bent on causing harm. The fact of the matter is simply that synergy in collective action works in more than a benign direction. As Shue (1981: 596) illustrates in the case of carcinogens, There is no Invisible Hand to guarantee that choices made without regard to health and safety will magically avoid damaging health and safety, especially when the harmful by-products of every individual firm are mixed together . .. in unconsidered and unintentional and sometimes unknown and unprecedented interacting combinations. In short, when people act together, they often create harms, along with benefits. Weick (1 979) has pointed out that organiza- tional participants may initially act together for personal reasons and, later, search fora common goal orgood to justify their past behavior. Participants, direct and indirect, are also likely to find harms produced in this enactment process, which provide grounds for criticizing past behavior. Of course, one has to look for harm in order to find it. The harm-minimization principle suggests, secondly, that we should look for harm. This implies, for instance, more balanced reporting of organizational goods and bads. Research on organi- zations has traditionally emphasized goods: profitability, pro- ductivity, innovation, motivation, commitment, etc. Bads are no less interesting and, given comparable effort, no less discern- able. The vast amount of litigation involving organizations, the reports of investigative journalists, and the growing literature on corporate crime indicate that organizations produce a fair 21/ASQ, March 1984</page><page sequence="22">amount of well-defined harm. In the United States, annual deaths resulting from (legally or socially defined) misbehavior by business firms are estimated in the tens of thousands, serious injuries in the millions, and financial losses in the billions of dollars (Clinard and Yeager, 1980; Schragerand Short, 1980). The extent of harm caused by governmental, health-care, and other kinds of organizations is more difficult to estimate, but presumably still significant, e.g., unnecessary surgery at a rate of possibly two million per year and a cost of four billion dollars per year (Meier and Geis, 1979). Furthermore, organizations no doubt produce harms that are not so well-defined in terms of societal or legal expectations. These expectations, and the range of things recognized as harms, increase over time as we learn more about individual capabilities, technological pro- cesses, and ways in which basic human interests can be impaired. Friedman (1973) and White (1980) have furnished relevant analyses of the expansion of harms in American law. Research on organizational effectiveness could play a larger role in informing social change by aiding discovery of potential as well as clear-cut harms, that is, by identifying presently accepted practices that have harmful effects and are candi- dates for legal control in the future. Some obvious examples are employee termination-at-will (Blackburn, 1980) and the expor- tation of hazardous products or processes (Shue, 1981). With respect to the latter, is there justification for American firms to transfer asbestos production south of the border and impose on Mexican workers a carcinogenic environment that is prohibited in the United States? Organizational theorists may prefer to ignore such questions; however, managers, lawmakers, media representatives, and others will debate them, resolving them one way or another. It would seem that a theory of organiza- tional effectiveness ought to have something to contribute. The principle of harm minimization suggests, finally, that or- ganizationally produced harm is worth doing something about. As discussed earlier, appropriate action might involve redirec- tion of activity to prevent some harms, redistribution of re- sources to compensate for others, but the principle does not advocate inaction to eliminate harm. And it does not require people to be concerned only with avoiding harm. It is helpful to keep in mind that the minimization of organizational harm, indeed any criterion of organizational effectiveness, is hardly the sum and substance of virtue for individual persons. A harm-based theory upholds from the outset the value of individual autonomy. It allows organizational participants to pursue a variety of personal goals and positive ideals of excel- lence. In contrast to additional views, it does not impose on participants the oppressive duty of furthering someone else's idea of excellence, as entailed, for instance, in effectiveness criteria derived from abstract organizational goals. The only absolute duty a harm-based theory might place on persons is that of acting without intentionally or directly inflicting basic harms on others (Fried, 1978). This generally includes the duty of abiding by voluntary contracts and working agreements made between organizational participants, noncontractual duties of forbearance or aid where another participant's au- tonomy is on the line, but not duties to the organization itself. Accountability for direct harm represents a reasonable, minimal standard of interpersonal responsibility, which balances one 22/ASQ, Ma rch 1984</page><page sequence="23">Participant-interest Theories person's freedom to pursue private interests against another's. The avoidance of direct, intentional harm in interpersonal transactions, however, may not ensure the goodness of the broader social systems those transactions compose, for sys- tems of action often have indirect and unintended conse- quences that cause harm. The harm-minimization principle recommends amelioration of these consequences as well, should persons wish to transcend minimal interpersonal stan- dards and try to better their organizations at large. This prescrip- tion is also reasonable because it does not seem fair that some participants must bear the cost of harmful consequences so that others can enjoy beneficial outcomes. How much people should care about indirect, unintended system effects - how much they should care whether their organizations, in any overall sense, are fair or effective - is an open question; but most people probably care to some extent, and we expect some people to care quite a lot. Those whose decisions have little impact on organizations or other participants (e.g., small shareholders, individual custom- ers, operating employees) may be justified in not worrying a great deal about whether their organizations are any good overall. They are not necessarily irresponsible or immoral if they are concerned mainly about whether an organization is any good for them (so long as they observe the minimal standard of interpersonal responsibility). On the other hand, we expect those whose decisions have wide impact to show more concern for the organization as a whole and less concern for their own self-interest. Some persons have the power to decide and must decide, on a large scale, who will ultimately benefit from organizations, who will suffer, and to what degree. It is not too much to ask of them to decide impartially. In fact, we demand impartiality from those given final power over organizations: judges, legislators, and other officials of the state. In democratic societies, their decisions have displayed a gradual tendency toward minimizing organizational harm (Stone, 1966). Perhaps it is time that theories of effectiveness encouraged more respect for impartiality by all those who play a major role in the administration of our complex organizations. I have argued that a harm-based theory is more impartial, because it is easier to specify what no one wants from organizations than what everyone wants. Certainly, adminis- trators ought not disregard profits, wages, services, or other goods; but it is important to recognize these things for what they are outcomes that largely satisfy the preferences of some participants. If we remain committed to maximizing such outcomes, there may be no logical (unbiased) escape from a relativistic approach to evaluation, which allows us to say only whether an organization is getting better or worse from the viewpoint of an arbitrary constituency. A relativistic approach (Connolly, Conlon, and Deutsch, 1980) is not always inappropri- ate; it is a sensible alternative in cases where a harm-based theory permits us to say nothing else (e.g., where organizations generate not even remote harms). The prevalence of systemic harm, however, means that one's options are not limited to bias or relativism in evaluating organizations. If one is truly con- cerned with the welfare of all constituents, with the organiza- tion as a whole, there is good reason to look beyond positive 23/ASQ, March 1984</page><page sequence="24">outcomes in theory and, in practice, to temper one's search for excellence with care for those persons who wind up paying the freig ht.
