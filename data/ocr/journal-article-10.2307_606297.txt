<plain_text><page sequence="1">DIVINE IMAGES AND ANICONISM IN ANCIENT ISRAEL* THEODORE J. LEWIS UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA This article evaluates T. N. D. Mettinger's recent in-depth analysis of the aniconic tradition in an- cient Israel as it is understood against its ancient Near Eastern backdrop. Mettinger's comparative anal- ysis of the ancient Near Eastern material is very helpful, yet at times is uneven and its relevance for understanding the aniconism of Iron Age Israel overstated. Mettinger's treatment of the West Semitic cult of standing stones (masseboth) is thorough with respect to the archaeological record but is in- complete with respect to the literary documentation. Because his analysis focuses primarily on the cults of standing stones and of the male deity, a more complete study needs to include male bronze statuary, female figures, theriomorphic representations, and vegetative representations. This review also presents a framework for understanding the various aniconic traditions in a pluralistic Israelite society. ONCE AGAIN TRYGGVE N. D. METTINGER, professor of Old Testament studies at Lund University, has pro- duced a thorough analysis on a neglected topic crucial to the reconstruction of ancient Israelite religion. Since the 1970s, Mettinger has written provocative articles on the aniconic tradition and related issues.1 Here we have his mature thought in an exhaustively researched volume, * This is a review article of: No Graven Image?

Mettinger is correct in his assertion that "the issue of Israelite ani- conism presents itself as a matter of high priority to the scholar engaged in the study of Israelite religion" (p. 37). As his book No Graven Image? will be the de- parture for all future studies on aniconism, it deserves close analysis. Need and Timeliness Recent works on ancient Israelite religion have em- phasized the common cultural identity of ancient Israel and her ancient Near Eastern neighbors. Due most likely to an emerging consensus regarding the settlement ques- tion, a paradigm shift can be detected: scholars now are more prone to emphasize the indigenous character of an- cient Israelite religion that, in its nascent period, is al- most indistinguishable from Canaanite religion. This is clearly a shift away from a previous generation of schol- ars who were more likely to emphasize the distinctive Other Essays, ed. T.

Little by little schol- ars are reexamining such past claims of distinctiveness. The aniconic tradition has long been held to be one of the unique traits of ancient Israelite religion. Mettinger's No Graven Image? satisfies the need for a sober, well- informed reexamination of the topic. The aniconic tradition has always been the subject of considerable reflection, from the curiosity of the Roman historian Tacitus to the voluminous writings of theolo- gians wishing to probe the meanings of the first two commandments.2 In recent years, however, there has been a proliferation of works on the aniconic tradition, especially as it relates to reconstructing ancient Israelite religion.3 The tide shows no signs of ebbing.4 Recently, 2 See Mettinger, No Graven Image, 14. 3 A sampling of the bibliography on the topic written over the past two decades, in addition to Mettinger's previous work, in- cludes the following: R.

Met- tinger takes this aspect into account, as well as the re- search by the Freiburg school on divine symbolism.6 All of this makes Mettinger's work very timely and useful. Description Mettinger states that his purpose is "to place Israelite aniconism in a comparative perspective and look for sim- ilar developments in other cultures of the ancient Near East" (p. 36). In particular, he uses a comparative ap- proach to explore the origin of the Israelite aniconic tra- dition. ("Our focus of interest will be on the genesis of Israelite aniconism, viewed in the light of the compar- ative material" [p. 36].) What distinguishes Mettinger's work from that of many other biblical scholars is his di- alogue with the archaeological record. Mettinger's use of the archaeological realia (in particular his analysis of the masseboth material) as well as his awareness of Peircean conism and Anthropomorphism in Ancient Israel" and T N. D.

This consistently aniconic tendency in the preserved remains is astonishing." Holladay contrasts the aniconic tendency in "official religion" ("established worship") with iconic tendencies in "tolerated nonconformist worship" on the popular level. 6 0. Keel and C.

He also introduces the terms "material aniconism" (no anthropomorphic or theriomorphic icon of the deity serving as the central cultic symbol) versus "empty space aniconism" (sacred emptiness such as Yah- weh invisibly seated on the cherubim [see pp. 19-20]). Mettinger is also fully aware of the difficulties of inter- preting the archaeological record (e.g., distinguishing between representations of deities and those of votaries or worshippers given to deities).8 After an initial chapter on definitions and methodol- ogy, Mettinger reviews aniconic activity in the religions of Mesopotamia and Egypt (pp. 39-56), Nabatea (pp. 57-68), pre-Islamic Arabia (pp. 69-79), the Phoenician- Punic world (pp. 81-113), and Syria and Anatolia (pp. 115-34). The final chapter of the book is a well- documented analysis of Israelite aniconism, in particu- lar the masseboth material (pp. 135-97). CRITIQUE Use of Comparative Material The five chapters on the comparative method are well researched, yet uneven in their relevance to the topic at hand, a study of the origins of Israelite aniconism. The chapter on Nabatean aniconism, dependent largely on the work of J. Patrich, is important for understanding the Nabatean national deity, Dusares. Yet, with the majority of the evidence coming from the second and third cen- turies C.E., it is of little relevance for reconstructing the Israelite aniconism of the Iron Age. Mettinger ad- mits as much: "there can, of course, be no question of the Nabateans influencing the religion of ancient Israel" (p. 68). Similarly, the chapter on pre-Islamic cults of standing stones and their relation to the Kacba, as well as the programmatic repudiation of images in the Is- 7 Mettinger, No Graven Image, 20-22. The recent works by Evans and Halbertal and Margalit (see note 3 above) also use Peirce's theory of signs with regard to the aniconic tradition. Many more insights remain to be gained from a better under- standing of Peirce. 8 See especially Mettinger, "Aniconism: A West Semitic Con- text," 160. lamic traditions of Muhammed and the Caliph Yazid II, do not belong in a book on Iron Age Israel. The chapter on the Phoenician-Punic world is slightly more relevant; but here too there is very little Iron Age evidence, the ninth-century Bir Hadad stela being a rare example. Mettinger's methodology is often one of em- ploying late material and then "working backwards to the 'classical' Phoenician cults of Tyre, Sidon, and Byb- los" (p. 85). An example of the latter: Mettinger draws a "reasonable conclusion that the empty cherubim throne in Solomon's temple was due to Phoenician artistry" (p. 113), based on the empty "Sidonian" sphinx thrones; but even here we are dealing with late (first century C.E. or later) votive gifts. It is better to support such a claim by turning to Late Bronze representations such as the Ahiram sarcophagus from Byblos and the ivory plaque and model from Megiddo.9 The chapter on Mesopotamia and Egypt, as well as the one on Syria and Anatolia, adduce, however, well- documented earlier material which might have some bear- ing on Iron Age Israel. Mettinger states that the norm within Mesopotamia was to represent deities anthropo- morphically, although he points out that aniconic trends may be seen in the kakkum and gurinnum symbols and the iconography of the kudurrus from the Kassite pe- riod. There is no evidence of a "programmatic" aniconic tradition within Mesopotamia. Mettinger nicely surveys a great amount of material; yet he leaves out some crucial texts. In particular, one thinks of Esarhaddon's "Renewal of the Gods," a text which describes at great length the renewal (or better, the "remaking") of the cult images.'0 This was an elab- orate affair involving extensive divination to locate a time for the task, to select the many different artisans, and to determine the place of refurbishing (the bit mummi). Various craftsmen are listed in detail as are the costly materials (e.g., red gold, precious stones) used to make the statue, together with its crown and decorative jew- elry, so that the gods could be ceremoniously "born."1" The transfer of the gods to Babylon is then described amidst sacrificial rites and installation ceremonies, chief 9 Mettinger has written superbly on this material in his ar- ticle, "YHWH Sabaoth," 113-16. 10 R.

Mettinger notes (p. 41, n. 18) that the texts describing the all important "mouth washing" ritual are still unpub- lished.12 He is certainly correct in concluding that this is "a performative ritual designed to dissociate the statue from its aspects of man-made artifact" (p. 41). This is borne out by texts such as STT 200 which state that the cult image is the joint product of human and divine artisans.13 Human artisans were acting on behalf of the gods in fashioning the statues and any skill displayed was ultimately that of specific craft deities. It is clear that the statues could not "become divine" through mere human activity. The "opening of the mouth" was a mag- ical act enabling the statue to act as a vessel for the deity. Thus we end up with human artisans even dis- avowing that they have crafted the deity, for, in Esar- haddon's words, "the making of (images of) the gods and goddesses is your (i.e., Ashur's and Marduk's) right, it is in your hands." As for Egypt, Mettinger notes that it too used prima- rily anthropomorphic and theriomorphic representation for deities. Yet in the abstract Aten and Amun cults he finds a striking contrast to the Mesopotamian sphere, for here we have "a conscious theological programme" of aniconism (p. 56). It is said of Aten that "the sculptors do not know him" and indeed Aten never appears in the form of a statue, but only as a sun disk with rays ending in human hands (a "concession to anthropomorphism" [p. 49]). Nevertheless, due to the fact that Amarna the- 12 Provisionally, see the 1966 Oxford B. Phil. thesis of C. B. F Walker, "Material for a Reconstruction of the Mis Pi Ritual," and the forthcoming article by Walker and Dick, "The Induction of the Cult Image in Ancient Mesopotamia," which surveys previous scholarship on the rituals and includes many of the ba- sic sources, including a few of the more important incantations, and to which I am very much indebted.

See also Ashur 418 (= E. Ebeling, Tod und Leben nach den Vorstellungen der Babylonier [Berlin: Walter de Gruyer, 1931], ?27, 108-14) which differs from other "mouth washing" texts in that it uses diagrams to illustrate the actual placement of the cultic apparatus (e.g., reed mats, patiru- altars, bricks, and curtains). Dick has recently collated this text and delivered a paper at the 1992 annual meeting of the S.B.L. on its relation to the biblical prophetic parodies against making cult images. ology was a short-lived phenomenon, Mettinger consid- ers the "highly transcendent deus ineffabilis" of the New Kingdom Amun cult to be more important for recon- structing Israelite aniconism. In this period Amun is as- sociated with the air and the wind and of him it is said "none of the gods know[s] his true form" (p. 50). Follow- ing J. C. de Moor, he also notes that Amun as sunlight is (like Aten) "of whom there do not exist sculptures by artists" (p. 50). Finally, on very little evidence, Met- tinger follows the notion put forth by Wainwright in 1928 that Amun iconography at Thebes consisted of an aniconic stone, a sacred meteorite (pp. 51-53). Three times Mettinger cautions us not to overlook the "ample attestations of figurative iconography for Amun" both anthropomorphic and theriomorphic in Egypt and Palestine (p. 53; cf. pp. 54, 56). But it seems that Met- tinger has done just that by putting too much weight on very little evidence and then going even further in con- cluding that such an aniconic Amun cult may have in- directly "played a role in the formation of Israelite aniconism" (p. 56), having first had an impact on the cult of Canaanite El which in turn made up a "major component of the concept of Yhwh" (p. 54). Yet the bulk of the Amun traditions is strongly anthropomor- phic. There may have been some tension with certain verbal formations as Mettinger suggests (p. 53), yet we need not rewrite Amun worship (or Israelite aniconism) on such slim grounds.'4 Mettinger's analysis of various Syrian cities (Mari,15 Ebla, Qatna, Emar, Ugarit, and Byblos) and his treat- ment of the Hittite huwasi-stones concludes that iconic and aniconic cults coexisted in many of these Bronze 14 The tension with verbal representations is a more complex issue. Compare the Amun verbal formulations with a similar, though opposite, tension in the literary traditions of ancient Is- rael, which felt no qualms about representing Yahweh with fre- quent anthropomorphisms even during times of a well-developed aniconic theology. For example, the biblical deity was depicted as one who could walk about in the Garden of Eden (Gen. 3:8), smell the aroma of burnt sacrifice (Gen. 8:21), and descend from heaven to see what was happening at Sodom and Gomor- rah (Gen. 18:20-22). We also read of the biblical deity having arms, eyes, and ears (cf. Isa. 30:27), as "a man of war" (Exod. 15:3), and as one "sitting on his throne" (1 Kings 22:19). 15 For additional evidence regarding sikkanum from Mari, now see J.-M.

Age cities, as evidenced by the presence of both stelae (Ugaritic stelae most often have anthropomorphic repre- sentations) and cultic images in the round. Mettinger is tempted "to see this as resulting from a fusion of a West Semitic plain-stone tradition with the artistic traditions of Mesopotamia and Egypt with their anthropomorphic depictions" (p. 128). Conspicuously absent from Met- tinger's work is the best Iron Age temple we have from Syria, Ayn Dara. Here we have one of the most fasci- nating finds depicting the divine. A series of four huge footprints (each measuring approximately three feet in length) seem to depict the deity entering into the temple. At the portico entrance to the temple we find the feet rep- resented side by side. As one draws nearer the cell each threshold has a single footprint: first the left, then the right. The ancient artisans seem to have striven for an aniconic presence of a deity standing at the entrance to the temple before entering its inner sanctum.16 In conclusion, Mettinger's comparative analysis is helpful on many points, but at times it is uneven, and it overstates its relevance for the aniconism of ancient Is- rael. In addition, there needs to be better control of the use of the comparative method. Cults of Masseboth The preceding chapters set the context for the rest of the book, which is devoted to Mettinger's main interest, the aniconic tradition in ancient Israel. Here he differs from previous scholars in utilizing a significant segment of the archaeological record, primarily the Israelite cults of standing stones, masseboth. Mettinger's collection of the vast data on masseboth is superb, the most thorough since Graesser's (unpublished) Harvard dissertation.'7 In addition to discussing standing stones at the Iron Age sites of direct relevance (e.g., the "Bull Site," Lachish, 16 It is unclear to whom the temple was dedicated. Some scholars favor Ishtar.

In particular, he uses U. Avner's overlooked work that demonstrates that such standing stones were present in the Negev-Sinai for millennia.18 They date from the eleventh millennium in the Uvda Valley and become common from the sixth to the second millennia. The interpretation of the masseboth material (archae- ological and textual) is tricky business, with pitfalls ev- erywhere. One need only remember such failed attempts as the identification of the stone pillars in structure IA of Megiddo VA-IVB by May, Lamon, Shipton, and oth- ers. In actuality, these pillars were architectural, but the desire is strong to interpret every object coming out of the ground as cultic.19 In addition, archaeologists must decide whether to interpret a fallen slab as a massebah, a house pillar, a table, or an altar. Graesser has docu- mented a long history of scholarship which introduces extraneous items (e.g., primitive stone worship, phallic symbols, sacred mountains) into the reading of a text.20 While Mettinger is very sober in his analysis, he tends to regard all masseboth references as cultic. Thus, al- though aware that the five pillars at Beth-Shemesh are taken to be simply Iron Age house pillars by Bunimovitz and Lederman (p. 153, n. 85), he nevertheless concludes that Beth Shemesh contains "the remains of an open-air high place with masseboth in function during Iron II" (p. 153). Mettinger criticizes Graesser's classification of the masseboth into four functional types (commemora- tive, memorial, legal witness, and cultic), for failing to recognize the cultic aspects of the first three catego- ries.21 He concludes too strongly that "the cultic function 18 U.

In support of his argument that memorial functions may develop into cultic events, Mettinger notes how Albright stressed the funerary character of the bamoth. He does not seem to be aware seems to me to be predominant" (p. 32) and, with even less justification, that the "cultic masseboth must be regarded as aniconic representations of the divine" (p. 37). Even if Mettinger were correct with the first claim, this by no means implies the second. Every group of standing stones does not necessarily document a pantheon; every massebah may not have represented the deity. Mettinger's treatment of the masseboth passages in the Bible is far too brief (approximately one page!) and selective (see pp. 140-41). He admits to restricting his analysis to those masseboth passages referring to divine representation (p. 140). But this is precisely the prob- lem. By not looking at how the term masseboth is used universally, he fails to notice that the term was applied to standing stones that did not mark the deity's pres- ence. For example, nowhere in Mettinger's treatment does one learn that masseboth functioned as tombstones (for Rachel, Gen. 35:19-20), as boundary markers (between Jacob and Laban, Gen. 31:44-49), as markers for twelve tribes (Exod. 24:3-8), and as surrogates for a male heir (2 Sam. 18:18).22 In none of these passages is a masse- bah symbolic of a deity. Further, none of the four bib- lical passages which Mettinger proposes as "masseboth as representations of the deity" (p. 140) is explicitly so. Two of them offer no such information. Even if Micah's shrine (bet 'elohim) in Judg. 17:5 was a betyl, as Met- tinger suggests, this does not equate the betyl with the deity. Hos. 3:4 certainly notes that the massebah was "among the standard cultic paraphernalia" (p. 141) but says nothing about it being a divine symbol. Even Mettinger's two strongest test passages are in- conclusive. He cites Jacob's massebah in Gen. 28:18- 22; yet here a stone functions as Jacob's pillow and then as a marker of a theophany. The massebah may be called a bet 'elohim, and thus mark sacred space, but this is different from representing the deity per se. Similarly, the massebah in Isa. 19:19 seems to be described as "a massebah to [not "of"] Yahweh" similar to the preced- ing "altar to Yahweh" (mizbeah le-yhwh). Mettinger is curiously silent on the two masseboth passages which support his case. These come from mate- rial representing the "established religion" or the "nor- mative tradition," and they condemn masseboth usage as of a tide of writings disproving Albright's hypothesis. See briefly, W. B. Barrick, "The Funerary Character of 'High-Places' in An- cient Palestine: A Reassessment," VT 25 (1975): 565-95; T. J.

While many "illegitimate" masseboth pas- sages seem generic (masseboth are condemned along with other so-called "Canaanite" practices, such as the asherim23), two specifically support the thesis that the word massebah can be used as a symbol of a deity. Both references come from the Deuteronomistic historian who specifically mentions "the massebah of Baal which his father made" (2 Kings 3:2) and "the massebah of Baal" which resided in "the temple of Baal," demolished dur- ing Jehu's purge (2 Kings 10:26-27; cf. 2 Kings 23:14).24 In short, the lack of interaction with the textual ma- terial by one of the world's fine biblical interpreters is sadly obvious and renders the work incomplete.

LaRocca-Pitts does an admirable job of studying the various textual sources that refer to mas- seboth with a careful eye toward not homogenizing the source material, as done in past scholarship.25 By failing to interact with the archaeological data, however, this work does not reach its full potential, much as Met- tinger's work comes up short in failing to interact with the textual material.26 23 See Exod. 23:24, 34:13; Lev. 26:1; Deut. 7:5, 12:3, 16:22; 1 Kings 14:23; 2 Kings 17:10, 23:14; Jer. 43:13; and 2 Chr. 14:2, 31:1. Mettinger is aware of these passages and refers to them occasionally (pp. 24-26), yet he does not probe the reasoning behind their condemnation as it relates to his overall thesis that masseboth could indeed be divine symbols. 24 Even this could be elliptical, where the "pillar of Baal" could refer to a pillar dedicated to Baal in thanks for his bene- ficence or to mark his theophany without necessarily denoting the actual cultic symbol of Baal, but this is improbable. The Covenant Code is ambiguous when it states, "you shall not bow down to their [i.e., those of the prior inhabitants of the land] gods, nor serve them... but you shall utterly overthrow them and break their (i.e., the inhabitants' or the gods'?) masseboth in pieces" (Exod. 23:24). The most natural reading would suggest the inhabitants' masseboth and not the masseboth of the deities. Lev. 26:1 is less explicit, but it too seems to prohibit "bowing down" to a massebah or any other graven image (the antecedent of lehiftahdawt Caleyha is ambiguous) due to its use as a (for- eign) divine symbol. There are other passages in which masseboth are dedicated to foreign gods, but not explicitly called symbols of the deities. Jer. 43:13 mentions the massebot bet semes, "the stone pillars of the Sun temple"). 25 E. C. LaRocca-Pitts, "'Of Wood and Stone': A Source Crit- ical Analysis and Study of Early Biblical Interpretation Con- cerning bamot, massebot, 'daserm, and mizbehot," (Ph.D. diss., Harvard Univ., 1994), 236-66. 26 W. G. Dever has pleaded for a true dialogue between the textual and the archaeological material. See "Unresolved Issues Work Yet To Be Done on the Aniconic Traditions For the most part, Mettinger has restricted his archae- ological analysis to the masseboth material. Yet there is a significant amount of other material from the ar- chaeological record bearing directly on the problem of aniconic traditions in ancient Israel. Here we find the greatest idiosyncrasy of Mettinger's book. In a work which devotes a large number of pages to cultures not immediately relevant or even germane to reconstructing Iron Age Israelite aniconism, it is confounding to read that the author will "not devote special attention to a discussion of possible indications of iconic worship in Iron Age Palestine" (p. 136). As a result, the title of Met- tinger's book, No Graven Image? Israelite Aniconism in Its Ancient Near Eastern Context, belies its content, for the volume is a study of just one small part of the ani- conic question: the West Semitic cults of standing stones. A complete study of Israelite aniconism, yet to be writ- ten, will need to confront the following types of archae- ological artifacts. Male Statuary The lack of bronze statues of gods in Iron Age strata of Israelite cities is often cited as empirical verification of biblical claims regarding a robust aniconic tradition. R. Hendel has noted that this lack is especially sur- prising in light of the abundant quantity of such figu- rines in the Late Bronze Age.27 Dever has written that "no representations of a male deity in terra cotta, metal, or stone, have ever been found in clear Iron Age contexts, except possibly for an El statuette in bronze from twelfth-century Hazor and a depiction of an El- like stick figurine on a miniature chalk altar from tenth- century Gezer, and neither is necessarily Israelite."28 in the Early History of Israel: Toward a Synthesis of Archaeo- logical and Textual Reconstructions," in The Bible and the Pol- itics of Exegesis, ed.

Ahlstrom who called it "an Israelite god figurine" (my italics) and even suggested that it repre- sents "Yahweh or Yahweh-El."29 A closer look at the ar- chaeological picture shows that Ahlstrom was mistaken, as Keel and Hallo have already surmised.30 According to Dever, much of this interpretation can be traced back to Yadin's interest in showing Israelite presence at Hazor. The dating of stratum XI to the twelfth century is proper, but what Yadin and Ahlstrom call a "foundation deposit" is in reality a hoard of LB (thirteenth-century) implements (cf. the hoard of such material at Byblos). Thus these are heirlooms which certainly represent ear- lier, pre-Israelite material culture.31 There are other such bronzes which have mistakenly been placed in the Iron I-II periods. See Negbi's com- pilation of bronze figurines and the Iron Age dates she assigns to each. Among these are the Beth-Shemesh bronze (loc. 135, str. III; Negbi no. 1450); the Harvard Semitic Museum bronze said to have come from Nablus (Negbi no. 1449); the Megiddo standing figurine (loc. 2054, str. V B; Negbi fig. 48, no. 1361); the Megiddo seated figurine (loc. 2048; str. VII-VI; Negbi fig. 59, no. 1453) and the Beth-Shean seated figurine (level V southern temple; Negbi no. 1448). All of these figurines seem to be representative of LB. The Beth-Shemesh bronze was uncritically labeled Iron I by Negbi follow- ing Hansen.32 G. E. Wright has noted that this bronze is out of context, and probably belongs to Stratum IV (= LB).33 Dever has noted that this too is an LB heir- loom.34 The Iron dating of the Harvard Semitic Museum bronze said to have come from Nablus has no founda- tion.

The Teraphim I have attempted to argue elsewhere, along with K. van der Toorn and a growing number of scholars, that the biblical terdpim represent ancestor figurines which were most often used in divination.38 As such they are some- what beyond the purview of a treatment of divine icon- ism. On the other hand, the degree to which the terdpim (and the dead in general) could be referred to as elohifm, makes an investigation of this material appropriate for any full treatment of the aniconic tradition. In addition, it should be kept in mind that anthropoid statues coming from excavations (past and future) may represent terdpim as easily as deities. In the past, documenting the terdpfm in the archaeo- logical record was a difficult undertaking. J. Gray as- sociated the teripim with "the many figurines with the features of Asherah and Astarte found at Palestinian sites." These figurines, suggested Gray, "rank as teri- pim" and were used "in rites of imitative magic to pro- mote fertility."39 (See the discussion below on the pillar 35 Hansen, "A Bronze in the Semitic Museum," 15. 36 See T. J. Lewis, "The Identity and Function of El/Baal Berith," JBL 115 (1996): 418-22. 37 One curious item yet to be fully understood is the four cm long bronze fist from Jerusalem (str. XIV, tenth century). See Y. Shiloh, Excavations at the City of David, vol. 1 (Jerusalem: Institute of Archaeology, 1984), 17, figs. 23-24; pl. 29:2-3; Keel and Uehlinger, Gottinnen, Gotter und Gottessymbole, 152. 38 K. van der Toorn and T.

Gray, I &amp; II Kings (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1964), 745. Gray here is certainly following Albright, who once made a similar claim. See W. F Albright, From the Stone Age to Christianity: Monotheism and the Historical Process (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1957), 311; cf. H. G. May, Material Re- mains of the Megiddo Cult, OIP 26 (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1935), 27. 43</page><page sequence="9">Journal of the American Oriental Society 118.1 (1998) figurines.) Yet there is no explicit evidence linking the terdpim to fertility rituals. Albright asserted that later biblical writers (he did not state which ones) included fer- tility figurines under the general term terapim.40 2 Kings 24:23 associates the terapim with necromancy ('obot, yidd'conim), "idols" (gillulfm), and "abominations" (siq- qusim) [no explicit fertility nuance is specified], but does not suggest that any of these terms are subsumed under the heading teraplm. Similarly, Judg. 18:14, 17, 18, 20 lists the terdapm along with an ephod, a "graven image" (pesel), and a "molten image" (masseka); yet nowhere is terapim used as a general heading for these terms. There is one text which uses terapim as a general heading for idolatry (1 Sam. 15:23), listing it in con- junction with "iniquity" ('dwen), yet there is no explicit mention of fertility in this passage. In concert with Albright's view that the terapim could not be anthropoid in shape,41 we find quite a few scholars suggesting, based on 1 Sam. 19:13-16 as well as the pot- tery masks from Hazor and Akhziv, that the word tera- pim designated a cultic mask of some sort.42 Nevertheless, this theory does not seem likely. As van der Toorn has noted, if we have a cultic mask here, the suffix on the expression mera'asotayw ("at its head") in 1 Sam. 19:13 would seem to be redundant. The covering of the terapim with a beged also makes much more sense if we are talk- ing about a life-size statue rather than simply a head mask. In short, van der Toorn is correct when he asserts that the teraplm here "had more to it than a sculptured head."43 If the terapim are documented in the archaeological record, perhaps we have them in the schematic human figurines from Hazor.44 P. Beck's recent study of these 40 Albright, From the Stone Age to Christianity, 311. 41 Albright (Archaeology and the Religion of Israel, fifth ed. [Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1968], 110) with his bold notion that archaeology could confirm the historicity of the biblical record, based this on the fact that no life-size figures "of com- parable size have ever been found in Palestinian excavations." 42 G. Hoffman and H. Gressmann, "Teraphim: Masken und Winkorakel in Agypten und Vorderasien," ZAW 40 (1922): 75-137; A. Reichert, "Kultmaske" Biblisches Reallexikon, ed. K. Galling (Tiibingen: J. C. B. Mohr, 1977), 195-96. 43 See K. van der Toorn, "The Nature of the Biblical Tera- phim in the Light of the Cuneiform Evidence," CBQ 52 (1990): 206. If Laban's terapim referred to in Genesis 31 were also an- thropoid in shape (especially if they were complete human figures and not masks), they certainly had to be much smaller in size to fit under the saddlebag of Rachel's camel. 44 Suggested in van der Toorn and Lewis, "DInrl terapipm," 777. See P. Beck, "A Note on the 'Schematic Statues' from the Stelae Temple at Hazor," Tel Aviv 17 (1990): 91-95. statues as possible "ancestor idols" with a function "equal to that of stelae as a means of commemorating the dead" gives us more reason why we should not rush to interpret every standing stone as representing a deity.45 Goddesses in Israel's Worship The epigraphic finds at Kuntillet Ajrud and Khirbet el- Qom have stimulated research into the place of Asherah in ancient Israelite religion, heightening a conviction that cultic reconstruction (including the study of ani- conism) must not be restricted to male deities. While the material that follows is far from conclusive with respect to providing a clear example of a goddess, it deserves serious attention and should not be glossed over, as Mettinger does (p. 137). Approximately three thousand female terra-cotta "pil- lar figurines" have so far been found, occuring through- out the country from the tenth to the sixth centuries (note especially the Jerusalem hoard found by Kenyon) in a variety of contexts (burials, domestic, royal palaces, etc.).46 Some of these figurines have fully fashioned 45 Beck, "A Note on the 'Schematic Statues'," 94. 46 This approximate number comes from Dever (personal communication). Ahlstrom (An Archaeological Picture of Iron Age Religions in Ancient Palestine, 22) comments on Ramat Rachel as follows: "Since these figures were found in a royal palace, one cannot maintain, as Aharoni has, that they are expressions of popular religion. They must have been used as expressions of the official, national cult." See the following and their bibliographies: T A.

They have conical bodies; thus scholars have labeled them "pillar figurines." Because the breasts on these figurines are often prominent, connection to fertility or maternity is often suggested. Scholars have interpreted these figurines from both maximalist and minimalist perspectives. Where maxi- malists (e.g., Patai, Hillers, Engle, Dever, Ahlstrom, 'Amr, Hestrin) see an iconic representation of a mother goddess, minimalists (e.g., Pritchard, Barrelet, Smith, Meyers, Bloch-Smith, Hendel) see a votive offering ex- pressing the desire for fertility. Maximalists interpret the conical body, the "pillar" of these figurines, as a symbol (the stylized tree) of Asherah.47 Minimalists emphasize how pillars exhibit an absence of sexual characteristics from the waist down and thus "have been modeled to signify maternal rather than sexual activities."48 To max- imalist scholars we have clear iconography which points to the worship of a great mother goddess and the previ- ous label, "Astarte figurines," has now been replaced by either Dea Nutrix or Asherah.49 Scholars with a more minimalist view tend to treat them as votive offerings, talismans, or tokens associated with sympathetic magic.50 Reasoning that "statues of gods or goddesses tend to be of precious metals or of stone, are usually found in pub- lic shrines as well as or instead of in household shrines, and normally exhibit some symbols of divine identity in headdress, garb, pose, or attached object," Meyers con- cludes: "one should be skeptical about identifying any of these terra-cotta statuettes, or related clay plaques, with goddesses at all, let alone with any specific god- dess such as Ishtar, Anat, or Asherah."51 In general, Meyers' argument is sound. As for mate- rial composition, we do have a late seventh to early sixth century B.C.E. terra-cotta deity with horns attested at Qitmit and thus we should be careful not to put too much weight on material arguments.52 The lack of figu- rines made of precious metals may be due to technolog- ical and/or utilitarian reasons, as well as the accidental character of discovery (see below). With Meyers, I would argue that such figurines represent "the domestic life of 47 See, for example, Hestrin, "Understanding Asherah: Ex- ploring Semitic Iconography," 57. 48 Meyers, Discovering Eve, 162. 49 See note 46. 50 See note 46 and Smith, The Early History of God, 93-94. 51 Meyers, Discovering Eve, 162. 52 I.

They are surely as- sociated with the nurturing of offspring. I would conclude that these figurines are not representations of the god- dess per se; yet they nonetheless may have been thought by the ancients to have derived their efficacy through the goddess. Here I would part ways with Dever, who ar- gues that the "power and presumed efficacy" lying behind the figurines proves that such figurines are "certainly Asherah figurines."54 I would argue that a cultic object (e.g., altars, incense stands) can have power and efficacy derived from a deity without being the equivalent of a divine symbol (as do crucifixes and Torah scrolls). In addition, one need not attribute the efficacy solely to the goddess Asherah. To judge from the literary witness, it is equally plausible that such efficacy could also be attrib- uted to Yahweh who was also seen as a source of fertility and fructification (cf. Hos. 2:10 [Heb.]; 2:8 [Eng.]). Similarly, some scholars have interpreted the so-called female "tambourine" or "cake" figurines as deities while others see them as humans.55 Such figurines occur as early as the tenth century at Tell el-FarCah (biblical Tirzah). The fact that a stone mold was found in the "Cultic Structure" at tenth-century Taanach gives evi- dence that such figurines could be mass produced with cultic rituals in mind.56 It is impossible to tell whether these figurines are holding bread goods and/or musical 53 Meyers, Discovering Eve, 162. At the same time, one should heed K. van der Toorn's warning (review of U. Winter, Frau und Gottin in BO 43 [1986]: 496, 498) that goddesses in the ancient Near East were implored by men as well as women. Thus, while these figurines were most likely used by women, we should not eliminate their appeal to men. 54 Dever, "'Will the Real Israel Please Stand Up?'," 41. 55 Hillers, "The Goddess with the Tambourine: Reflections on an Object from Taanach," Concordia Theological Monthly 41 (1970): 606-19; C.

Our interpretation would once again lean to- ward seeing human figures here, yet these women could be doing tasks (preparing foodstuffs and/or playing mu- sic) of patronage to a male or female deity. One should also include here a discussion of the female plaque figu- rines (e.g., the figurine from Tell Zeror V cist tomb); yet the possibility that we have iconic representations of goddesses here is minimal, especially in light of M. Tad- mor's study showing that these reclining figures are most likely human depictions lacking any divine symbolism.57 In contrast, Tadmor emphasizes that the common LB female figurines (upright, bearing symbols of divinity) are not encountered in Iron Age material culture. The nude female represented on the bottom tier of the tenth century Taanach cult stand represents the strong- est evidence of an anthropomorphic representation of a goddess, probably Asherah due to the iconographic mo- tifs of lions and a pair of ibex. In fact, Hendel calls it "the only clearly identifiable representation of Asherah in Israel."58 This stand has been extensively studied, and while scholars debate the presence of a male deity in tiers one and three of the stand (see below), the presence of a goddess (the nude female holding the lions' ears in tier four and the tree symbol flanked by two ibex in tier two) on this cultic incense stand is not disputed.59 The dating makes it difficult to label this Canaanite or Israel- 57 M.

Mazar prefers to talk of "a rich variety of motifs taken from the Canaanite-Phoenician repertoire."60 Some scholars would also include the female seated figure61 as well as the middle theriomorphic figure62 on Kuntillet Ajrud pithos A (mid-ninth to mid-eighth cen- tury B.C.E.) as representing goddesses, although I think that identifying either of these figures with Asherah is inadvisable. The middle figure, most likely a male Bes- like figure, will be treated immediately below. As for the lyre player, there is no association of Asherah with mu- sic, nor would one expect to find the great mother god- dess off-center, facing away from the central figures. Those who reason that we have Asherah on the throne do so due to the inscription, which mentions "Yahweh of Samaria and his asherah." Yet there is no need to equate the drawings with the inscription, especially if they come from two separate times, as seems likely.63 If the draw- ings and the inscription are contemporaneous and thus represent the same subject matter, how would Dever's "Asherah on the throne" theory account for the presence of three figures? Due to the proliferation of recent articles on textual references to Asherah, this material is well known and there is no need to rehash the data here. The relevant material for a discussion of iconic representations of the goddess in ancient Israel includes the enigmatic "Yah- weh and his asherah" references from Kuntillet Ajrud 60 Mazar, Archaeology of the Land of the Bible, 10,000-586 B.C.E., 380. 61 W.

Schmidt follows a query by Coogan that "in the photograph... the space between the legs seems blank" and concludes that this figure is Asherah due in part to the "absence of a phallus." See "The Aniconic Tradition. On Reading Images and Viewing Texts," 99. Yet, in a recent photograph sent to me courtesy of Z. Meshel, a phallus is clearly there. The space between the legs is not empty. 63 A full critique of Dever's position can be found in Hadley, "Yahweh and 'His Asherah': Archaeological and Textual Evi- dence for the Cult of the Goddess," 245-49. 46</page><page sequence="12">LEWIS: Divine Images and Aniconism in Ancient Israel and Khirbet el-Qom and a reanalysis of the cult object called an asherah in the Hebrew Bible.64 Whereas the evidence for Asherah's presence in this material is debatable, scholars do find in it ample evi- dence for a cult symbol of the goddess. Such a symbol is not easily divorced from the goddess Asherah in its origin; but the question is one of degrees of appropri- ation. Some people for whom Yahweh was a national deity, may nevertheless have worshipped local Asherah deities. Others may have simply appropriated mythic imagery, investing it in a worship of Yahweh without implying the presence of the goddess.65 I would argue that this is analogous to vestigial features documented in the archaeological record.66 We could therefore speak of the retention of mythic imagery (fleshed out in very earthy vocabulary and iconography) devoid of mythic reality. For yet other circles (including certain prophetic and priestly groups and the Deuteronomist but not lim- ited to these groups) worship of Yahweh was exclusive and any reference to goddesses was to be condemned. Theriomorphic and Zoomorphic Representation in Israelite Worship Animal names were used for Canaanite and Israelite deities as well as for construction of personal names.67 Not surprisingly, animals were also used as symbols for deities. In Mesopotamia deities and rulers commonly 64 For an introduction to the vast secondary literature on this material, see the bibliographies in S. A.

First, cultic items may be votive offerings to a 68 See T. J. Lewis, "CT 13.33-34 and Ezekiel 32: Lion- Dragon Myths," JAOS 116 (1996): 28-47. 69 See M. C. A.

Compare also the references to bull worship coming from the polemical pens of the Elohist, Hosea, and the Deuteronomist. 70 There is no explicit reference to Yahweh hunting lions, as is typical in Mesopotamia, perhaps because it would have been deemed too anthropomorphic. Nonetheless, lion imagery for Yahweh can be found in Prov. 30:30; Amos 1:2, 3:8; 1 Kings 20:36; Isa. 31:4; Hos. 5:14, 13:7-8; and Jer. 49:19. On El, cf. the PN Ariel. See Lewis, "CT 13.33-34 and Ezekiel 32," 33-45. On lion imagery associated with Asherah, see Lewis, ibid., n. 132. S. Wiggins, "The Myth of Asherah: Lion Lady and Ser- pent Goddess," UF 23 (1991): 383-94, has correctly challenged many of the props that have been used to support the notion that Asherah is associated with lions and serpents. At the same time, Wiggins' primarily philological approach ends up being too minimalist in light of a growing abundance of iconographic material. In addition to the citations mentioned above, as well as the Lion Lady on the Tanaach cult stand, see Keel and Ueh- linger, Gottinnen, Gotter und Gottessymbole, 25, 75-76, 116 n. 66, 129 n. 79, 239. While Cross prefers to use the epithet "the Lion Lady" to re- fer to Asherah (Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic, 34) he notes that the lion could also be an epithet of Anat, as evidenced by her mention with lions on the El-Khader arrow-heads. Smith, The Early History of God, 19-20, reminds us that there is a significant amount of lion imagery also associated with Astarte and that she too is a candidate for the naked female figure on tier four of the Taanach cult stand. 47</page><page sequence="13">Journal of the American Oriental Society 118.1 (1998) deity rather than representations of a deity in theriomor- phic form. Secondly, while bull and lion figurines are commonly found, it is often difficult to place them in a clear cultic context. About those that do come from such contexts, Mettinger's caution is relevant: "We have to seriously consider the possibility that these were re- garded as postament animals for the deity, who was understood as invisible, standing on the backs of the animals" (p. 137). Such usage could be labelled "empty space aniconism." The best example of a theriomorphic representation of a deity would be from the "Bull Site" published by Mazar.71 Mazar attributed its bronze-bull find to "Isra- elite settlers of the 12th ct. B.C.... dated to the period of the Judges."72 Mazar further commented that "the size of our figurine, the great care taken in its manufacture, and the inlayed eyes that are unusual in simple votive offerings suggest... an actual cult object in itself." Even Coogan, who questions the cultic (public) context of the site, argues for a ritual function of the bull figurine.73 Thus, most scholars see the figurine representing either El, Baal, or Yahweh. At the same time, the above cau- tions keep us from knowing definitively. Another possi- bility would be the bovine depicted on the "Shemacyahu son of CAzaryahu" seal of unknown provenance that Cross dated to the ninth century on epigraphic grounds.74 Lion depictions abound in the archaeological record at numerous sites (e.g., Tell Beit Mirsim, Tell Tacyinat, Tel Taanach, Arad, Kuntillet Ajrud), in almost every period. Yet, even though lion metaphors for gods and 71 A.

The huge lion found at the base of the Arad temple invites such an association, but it may well have been a votive offering.75 Moreover, lions com- monly decorated thrones, thus suggesting their use as a pedestal for the deities. Such an example would be the tree on top of the lion on the Kuntillet Ajrud Pithos A. The Taanach cult stand also indicates that the lion was an an- imal associated with a goddess, but not her representation. A similar conclusion can be reached about the use of horse figurines. Though no scholar has suggested that Yahweh is represented iconographically as a horse, he is, according to several scholars, intimately associated with horse imagery. Ahlstrom has argued that the numer- ous terra-cotta horse figurines with sun disks on their foreheads, as well as several textual references (Ps. 84:12; Hab. 2:15; 3:8), "represent Yahweh's horses" because Yahweh was "associated with horses in his capacity as a solar deity."76 On the top tier of the Taanach cult stand, the quadruped, deemed until recently to be bovine, has been plausibly connected with equines, perhaps associ- ated with Yahweh in an astral role.77 Contrary to recent claims, Yahweh is not likely de- picted in the left standing figure displayed on the Kuntillet Ajrud pithos A (so Gilula, Coogan, McCarter, Schmidt, Dick).78 It is even less likely that Asherah is represented in the right standing figure.79 As noted above, each of these are more properly understood as Bes-like figures commonly used for apotropaic purposes.80 Sim- ilarly, Olyan's proposed linking of Nehushtan (Num. 21:8-9; 2 Kings 18:4) to a cult symbol for the goddess Asherah is, as shown recently by Wiggins, based on insufficient evidence.81 The Nehushtan rather "probably belonged to the traditional repertoire of Yahwistic sym- bols, this emblem signifying Yahweh's power to heal."82 75 So Dever, "'Will the Real Israel Please Stand Up?'," 41. 76 Ahlstrom, An Archaeological Picture of Iron Age Reli- gions in Ancient Palestine, 22-23. 77 See bibliography in note 59. 78 See note 62 above and McCarter, "Aspects of the Religion of the Israelite Monarchy," 146-49. 79 Ibid. 80 Hadley, "Yahweh and 'His Asherah': Archaeological and Textual Evidence for the Cult of the Goddess," 246-47. 81 Olyan, Asherah and the Cult of Yahweh in Israel, 70-71; Wiggins, "The Myth of Asherah: Lion Lady and Serpent God- dess," 386. 82 R.

Non-Israelite examples are discussed in a mushrooming secondary lit- erature on the Lachish ewer (thirteenth century B.C.E.), the numerous pendants coming from Ras Shamra (Ugarit) and Minet el-Beida, and numerous depictions from Egypt.83 Surprisingly, we do not have numerous exam- ples from the Israelite period.

Empty Space Aniconism Mettinger has very successfully described the empty space aniconism associated with the empty cherub throne in the Solomonic temple.89 In his words, The classic ark theology has its center in the notion of the aniconic God. The throne is empty: the place of the image is occupied by the unseen God. The official Jeru- salem cult was imageless in the sense that it lacked a direct symbol for JHWH. The cherub throne with the ark can not be regarded as such a symbol. Nor can Nehush- tan (2 Kgs 18,4). The absence of images is here early a fact .... the official cult was early aniconic: over the cherub throne and ark, the god of Israel was enthroned in unseen majesty. The place usually occupied by the deity is empty.90 Due to restrictions on excavating the Temple Mount, archaeological support has not materialized and is not likely forthcoming. Nonetheless, as most scholars assert, there is little reason to challenge Mettinger's conclu- sions. The primary place where only recently scholars have been looking to document empty space aniconism in the archaeological record is the cult stand from Taa- nach. In a series of stimulating publications, Taylor has suggested that the empty space in tier three of the Taa- nach cult stand "is an iconographic representation of Yahweh of Hosts, the unseen God who resides among the cherubim, the earliest 'representation' of Yahweh known in the archaeological record."91 Taylor's thesis has caught the attention of a growing number of scholars.92 Taylor has reformulated the usual translation of yhwh seba'Ot yose-b hakkerubim (1 Sam. 4:4), "Yahweh of Hosts who is enthroned on the cherubim," to "Yahweh of Hosts who dwells (between) the cherubim" (my ital- ics) in order to fit his thesis.93 The poetry of 2 Sam. 22:11 = Ps. 18:11, as well as 2 Sam. 6:2, gives clear 89 Mettinger, No Graven Image, 139; idem, "YHWH Sa- baoth: The Heavenly King on the Cherubim Throne," 109-38; idem, "Cherubim" in Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible, 362-67. 90 Mettinger, "The Veto on Images and the Aniconic God in Israel," 22, 27. 91 Taylor, Yahweh and the Sun, 30. 92 Mettinger, No Graven Image, 164-65; Hadley, "Yahweh and 'His Asherah': Archaeological and Textual Evidence for the Cult of the Goddess," 252-53; Dever, "'Will the Real Israel Please Stand Up?'," 43. 93 Taylor, Yahweh and the Sun, 29. 49</page><page sequence="15">Journal of the American Oriental Society 118.1 (1998) evidence that Yahweh was envisioned as riding or sitting enthroned on top of the cherubim, not standing between them. The presence of a deity standing on top of a beast of power is amply attested in ancient Near Eastern iconography. However such data should not be pressed when one considers that Asherah could be portrayed riding on lions or, as on the Taanach stand, standing be- tween them. Similarly, when a king or deity sits on a cherub throne (e.g., the Ahiram sarcophagus; the ivory plaque and model from Megiddo) he is both sitting on and between the cherubim at the same time.94 The primary difficulty with Taylor's hypothesis is that it may prove to be too inventive. In light of the similar use of empty space (= fenestration) on numerous cult stands, as well as temple models, it is more likely that the empty space on tier three of the Taanach cult stand had a purely functional and/or artistic purpose.95 We need not interpret every feature of even cultic objects as representational of cultic symbolism. As noted by Met- tinger, who is hesitant to adopt Taylor's thesis, the empty space could reflect the temple entrance (so Hestrin and Keel and Uehlinger) or a place where an object of some sort was set (so Weippert).96 In addition, the Taanach 94 Mettinger, "YHWH Sabaoth: The Heavenly King on the Cherubim Throne," 113-16. 95 See the collection of various cult stands in L. F DeVries, "Cult Stands: A Bewildering Variety of Shapes and Sizes," BAR 13.4 (July-Aug., 1987): 26-37.

Weinberg, "A Moabite Shrine Group," MUSE: Annual of the Museum of Art and Archaeology 12 (1978): 30-48; A.

Based on a comparative analysis of the naoi (attested in Late Bronze Age Canaan, in Iron Age Phoenicia and Cyprus, and in Transjordan), Dever ("Ancient Israelite Religion: How to Rec- oncile the Differing Textual and Artifactual Portraits," 109) con- cludes that "a representation of a deity (or a pair of deities?)" may have originally stood in the doorway of these temple mod- els. If Taylor is correct about Yahweh being invisibly rep- resented in the Taanach cult stand, one could just as easily have Asherah (or some other deity) represented invisibly in these naoi. Yet all of this amounts to speculation. 96 See Mettinger (No Graven Image, 165, n. 131) for bibli- ography. Hestrin ("Understanding Asherah: Exploring Semitic cult stand may have been dedicated to a single female deity (Asherah?) as opposed to a pair of deities, male and female.97 CONCLUSION The Aniconic Traditions (and lack thereof) in Ancient Israel Building upon Mettinger's thorough analysis we can conclude the following about iconic and aniconic tra- ditions in ancient Israel as it is understood against its ancient Near Eastern backdrop. 1. Aniconic traditions (i.e., Mettinger's "de facto ani- conism") are not uniquely Israelite. 2. Cultures can have both aniconic and anthropo- morphic traditions at the same time. 3. The repudiation of divine images is very rare in the ancient Near East apart from Israel. A type of pro- grammatic aniconism is attested in Egyptian Amarna theology, yet it lasts only briefly. Mesopotamian Anu is rarely portrayed in art but this may very well be due to his obscure nature rather than any programmatic ani- conism for which we have no evidence. Only ancient Is- rael developed and sustained a theological programme against representing a deity iconographically. 4. To judge from the literary evidence, Israelite mas- seboth (Mettinger's "material aniconism") were used in a variety of ways with only two clear examples of a massebah representing a divine symbol. As for the ar- chaeological evidence, we do have examples of masse- both in clear cultic contexts from the Iron I and Iron II periods including established religion (cf. Arad, Dan, Megiddo?) as well as the local popular cultus (Bull Site, Lachish, Tell el Farcah). When the masseboth occur in clear cultic contexts, they seem to represent the deity or deities, with our best examples being found at Arad.98 Iconography," 58) has also commented on the space being "probably the entrance to the shrine." 97 This was the thesis of a paper delivered at the 1995 A.S.O.R. annual meeting by M. E. Levin, entitled "A Cult Stand for the Goddess." For the abstract, see ASOR Newsletter, 45.2 (Summer 1995): 28. Now see S. A. Wiggins, "Yahweh: The God of Sun?" JSOT71 (1996): 89-106; J. G. Taylor, "A Response to Steve A. Wiggins, 'Yahweh: The God of Sun?'," JSOT 71 (1996): 107- 19; and S. A. Wiggins, "A Rejoinder to J. Glen Taylor," JSOT 73 (1997): 109-12. 98 It should be noted that the dating and character of the Arad material is much debated and we do not have clear archaeolog- ical reports to help us reconstruct the history of the two (possibly 50</page><page sequence="16">LEWIS: Divine Images and Aniconism in Ancient Israel Yet, if one wanted to adopt a minimalist perspective, even here they could have been seen as markers of the sacred space where one came into contact with the deity or deities (similar to Jacob's use of a massebah in Gen. 28:18-22). It is impossible to describe which individ- ual deities are represented by the masseboth. Thus this "material aniconism" was practiced by certain segments of society at the same time that the Jerusalem cultus was practicing "empty space aniconism" (i.e., the cherubim throne in the Solomonic temple). Eventually empty space aniconism prevails and is reflected in the various prohi- bitions of images found in the Bilderverbot (cf. Exod. 20:3-6,20:23,34:17; Lev. 19:4; Deut. 5:8-10,27:15), the deuteronomistic descriptions of the empty cherub throne, and the parodies against making cult images found in the prophetic corpus (cf. Jer. 10:1-6, 50:2; Isa. 40:18-20, 41:7, 44:9-20, 46:5-7; Hos. 8:4-6, 13:2-3; Mic. 5:12- 13; Ezek. 5:11, 20:7-8, 22:3-4; Hab. 2:18-20) and the Psalter (cf. Pss. 115:3-8, 135:15-18). 5. Yahweh seems never to have been depicted anthro- pomorphically. All of the bronze figurines suggested to date to Iron I are problematic. In theory, Yahweh could have been depicted theriomorphically, yet we have no clear evidence of such. The best candidate, the Bull Site bronze, would seem to point more to El and Baal imag- ery. A massebah could in theory represent Yahweh. As- tral images may have been symbolic of Yahweh in his role as a solar deity. 6. Goddesses (primarily Asheroth) are attested in certain segments of ancient Israelite society and are rep- resented iconographically with anthropomorphic and veg- etative imagery. These conclusions are supported by a growing corpus of literary evidence (the Hebrew Bible, Kuntillet Ajrud; Khirbet el-Qom) that mention the di- vine symbol of the goddess Asherah. 7. "Empty space" aniconism is well attested in the literary traditions regarding the cherub throne in the So- lomonic temple.

Why don't we have bronze cult images preserved? Two options present themselves. Either ancient artisans commonly made such images but we have failed to find them as yet (perhaps they were melted down and reused in antiquity), or for the most part, they did not make such images. Of these, the latter seems more reasonable. In answering why images were not made we can turn to reasons having to do with traditional religious beliefs (see below) or, just as likely, economic and utilitarian reasons. We must remember that new technology sweeps away the old, and bronze artifacts in general are swept away through the technology of the Iron Age. A third and potentially better option would posit a combination of religious and technological reasons. What religious literary traditions contributed to the development of the repudiation of images of Yahweh? According to the literary traditions which seem to reflect lore drawn from historic memories of old,99 theophanies of Yahweh did not lend themselves to physical represen- tations, with fire being the primary mode of manifestation (e.g., the burning bush). Fire is numinous, without a defi- nite shape. The essence of fire would have been lost in any concrete representation. Thus, because such theopha- nies were traditionally described as devoid of fixed shape (smoke, clouds, fire), the convention developed that the deity should have no physical representation. This finds articulation in Deut. 4:12, 15-16, which certainly reflects older lore despite its redactional history: "Then Yahweh spoke to you out of fire, you heard the sound of words, but saw no form, there was only a voice.... Since you saw no form at all... beware lest you act corruptly by making a graven image for yourselves in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female . .."00 Similarly, the name of the deity Yahweh (a verbal form of the verb "to be") does not lend itself to physical representation. How would one concretize such a verbal 99 My approach to the literary traditions would be much more in line with the reasoned views of R. Albertz (A History of Is- raelite Religion in the Old Testament Period, vol. 1 [Louisville: Westminster/John Knox, 1994], viii, 24, 28, 31, et passim), than the position of T. L. Thompson, G. Ahlstrom, and P. R. Davies, themselves critiqued by Dever in "'Will the Real Israel Please Stand Up?', pt. I: Archaeology and Israelite Historiog- raphy," BASOR 297 (1995): 61-80. 100 For the redactional history of Deut. 4, see Dick, "Pro- phetic Parodies Against Making the Cult Image." 51</page><page sequence="17">Journal of the American Oriental Society 118.1 (1998) aspect in iconographic representation? Perhaps concomi- tantly there developed, most likely through Phoenician artistic influence, the oral and literary traditions of the empty cherub throne.'01 Thus, once again, the notion that Yahweh was invisible (i.e., invisibly enthroned above the cherubim which acted as the deity's footstool) was re- inforced in the perception of the priesthood. The dating of the aniconic traditions and the repudi- ation of divine images for Yahweh. The majority of schol- ars date the prohibitions on making cult images late. Thus Dohmen concludes that the legal commandments prohibiting cult images are largely a product of the sixth-century redaction showing the results of deuter- onomistic theology.102 Albertz has recently argued that "the battle against divine images only began with the prophet Hosea ... probably at the end of the eighth cen- tury...."103 Mettinger has agreed to a degree with both of these positions. He acknowledges Dohmen's position when he writes: "The express prohibition of images ... seems to be a late, perhaps even Deuteronomistic prod- uct"; "Deuteronomistic circles bestowed upon it a sta- tus confessionis."04 As for Hoseanic dating, Mettinger previously concluded that "the prohibition [of images] is ... the product of prophetic [Hosea's] polemic against them."'05 His latest work states that "Israelite aniconism seems to be as old as the Solomonic temple and may an- tedate it by centuries."'6 Mettinger suggests that "a text such as 1 Sam. 5:1-5 (Dagon's image with broken head and hands before Yhwh's ark) might well indicate that programmatic aniconism as such is older" than the "Yhwh alone movement."'07 In addition, despite objections to the contrary, the jury is still out on the early dating of passages such as Exod. 20:23-24, 34:14-17.108 The re- 101 Thus Mettinger, No Graven Image, 113.

Halpern ("'Brisker Pipes than Poetry': The Development of Israelite Monotheism," in Judaic Perspectives on Ancient Israel, ed. J. Neusner, B. A. Le- vine, and E. S. Frerichs [Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1987], 87) daction of these passages cannot detain us here. Suffice it to say the dating of programmatic aniconic theology is intimately tied up with one's dating of larger issues. The "uniqueness" question. Finally, it is necessary to comment on the assertion that the aniconic tradition of ancient Israel is unique. Mettinger has done a splendid job in showing that aniconism is at home in several an- cient Near Eastern cultures and "does not constitute one of Israel's differentia specifica [sic]."109 Even if only a handful of the standing stones are divine representa- tions, Mettinger has demonstrated within Braudel's longue duree schema that Israelite aniconism had a venerable West Semitic pedigree.110 At the same time, as regards the male deity Yahweh, we have a sustained aniconic tra- dition which develops into a fully programmatic theo- logy which repudiates the making of the divine image. Here Mettinger is forced to comment that "among an- cient Semitic peoples there is hardly anything of similar dimensions... the express veto on images belongs to Israel's differentia specifica."'l How should we frame these two portrayals in future descriptions of ancient Israelite religion so as to describe both the cultural solidarity that ancient Israel shared with the (West) Semitic world and her radical departure from certain practices? When it comes to the question of the "distinctivess" of a given culture, P. Machinist has writ- ten that we should not be about the business of finding individual "trait lists" to demonstrate that feature X was in culture Y (here ancient Israel) and nowhere else. Rather, he argues, we should inquire how a given cul- ture uses an amalgamation of traits in a configuration which may indeed be unique. In other words: "What, then, is distinctive about each community are the ways in which the ideas were patterned and emphasized. Not individual, pure traits, in short, but configurations of traits becomes the focus of the modern historian, if he wants to understand the distinctiveness of ancient Israel-or of any culture.""2 who writes: "The J 'decalogue' contains an ordinance prohibit- ing the manufacture of molten images of gods... the ordi- nance is tied to the commandment of exclusive devotion (Exod. 34:14-17). The pre-monarchic legislation of Exod. 20:19-23 begins with an injunction against manufacturing (precious?) metal images of gods" (my italics). 109 Mettinger, No Graven Image, 195. 110 Mettinger, No Graven Image, 197. 111 Mettinger, No Graven Image, 196. 112 P. Machinist, "The Question of Distinctiveness in Ancient Israel: An Essay," in Ah Assyria .. : Studies in Assyrian His- tory and Ancient Near Eastern Historiography Presented to 52</page><page sequence="18">LEWIS: Divine Images and Aniconism in Ancient Israel Thus the degree to which ancient Israel magnified some ancient Near Eastern traits while it obliterated oth- ers makes it a "unique" mix. The pervasive "empty space aniconism" of the Yahweh cultus and programmatic ani- conic theology which develops can only be properly un- derstood alongside other concomitant traits which form the larger cultural configuration. I would suggest that these would include, but not be limited to: the extension of monolatrous belief into a concept of "self-conscious monotheism" (using Halper's term) or "the drive toward investiture of exclusive power and eventually exclusive divinity" (using Machinist's phrase), which eventually permeates religious thinking;13 the eventual stripping Hayim Tadmor, ed. M. Cogan and I. Eph'al (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1991), 200. 113 Halpern, "'Brisker Pipes than Poetry'," passim; Machin- ist, "The Question of Distinctiveness in Ancient Israel," 200. In other words, it is not that monotheism is "unique" to Israel, but the fact that monotheism becomes pervasive in the later reli- gion. There were certainly additional features (e.g., political, economic, social) which contributed to the development of monotheism. High on the list would be the xenophobia which emerged when Israel as a marginal group tried to forge an iden- tity over against older, more established Late Bronze societies (cf. Machinist, 210-11). Halpern, ("'Brisker Pipes than Poetry'," 87) also draws mono- theism and aniconism together when he writes: "Even Israel's away of sex and death from the divine;114 and extend- ing the notion that a deity can enter into a treaty with humans into a pervasive "covenant theology.""' When all is said and done one must conclude that Mettinger's No Graven Image is a book of such major significance that it will reshape the way we go about reconstructing ancient Israelite religion, especially as re- gards the need of biblical scholars to rely on archaeol- ogy as much as philology. Granted, it is not the final word on the subject of divine images and the aniconic traditions in ancient Israel and there are non-germane sections which should have been edited out and repub- lished elsewhere. Any future investigation will need to incorporate a full study of the additional items pointed out above. Notwithstanding, our debt to Professor Met- tinger is great indeed. later aniconism, a true hallmark of radical monotheism, has a discernible antecedent in the early period" (my italics). See note 108 above on passages Halpern suggests to document this early period. 114 Smith, The Early History of God, 163-66. 115 In contrast to scholars such as M. Weinfeld, I point out in "The Identity and Function of El/Baal Berith," 404-10, that a deity playing the role of a treaty partner is not unique to Israel, although no other ancient Near Eastern culture developed the concept into a full-blown covenant theology. 53</page></plain_text>
