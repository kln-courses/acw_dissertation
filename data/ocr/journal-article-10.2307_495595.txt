<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Wang Chao-chuin Legend: Configurations of the Classic1 EUGENE EOYANG Indiana University The theme of exile, inescapable in modern literature, particularly in the West2, is not without its analogues in traditional Chinese literature. Su Wu, the Han envoy who was retained and held captive by the Hsiung-nu, who yet survived to return to his country after his release and who served out his remaining years honorably, is but one well-known instance of a hero who spent his life in enforced exile. The story of Wang Chao-chuiin, the beautiful lady of the Han court, under the reign of the Emperor Yiian, is scarcely less celebrated. This study will examine the sources and analogues of the Wang Chao-chiin legend, with primary emphasis on the period up to the T'ang (though references will be made to later exempla), in historical works, in poetry, and in vernacular fiction.3 The ratio- nale for this breakdown is provided by a curiously exact reference at the end of the vernacular version of the Wang Chao-chiin story that appears on a Tunhuang scroll.4 The manuscript alludes to the event as dating from a time "more than eight hundred years ago." As the exile of Wang Chao-chiin occurred in the reign of the Emperor Yiian, (48-32 B.C.5), the Tunhuang scroll can be dated with fair assurance to the ninth century A.D. Of course, the transmogrifications in history and literature after the ninth century are numerous. Among the most notable are the mention in the T'ai-p'ing huan-yii chi Ac + _  by Yueh Shih ~- (930-1007) in the tenth century (published in 976- 983), the T'ai-p'ing yii-lan ; ? ,, compiled by Li Fang 3 ft (925-966) and others (completed in 983), and Ma Chih-yiian's , _rz it (?-c.1321) Han-kung ch'iu i ke of i An earlier version of this paper was presented before a panel on Oral and Vernacular Chinese Literature at the Modern Language Association meeting in December 1978, at New York. 2 One thinks easily of Joyce, Beckett, and Nabokov as three major exiles-concerned with the exilic theme, and exemplifying the life of an exile in their lives and in their careers. Studies on the subject abound, though the two most prominent discussions might be Harry Levin's seminal essay, "Literature and Exile," first published in 1961, and later included in Refractions: Essays in Comparative Literature (New York: Oxford University Press, 1966), pp. 62-81, and George Steiner's musings and meditations that occupy the first chapters of his Extraterritorial: Papers on Literature and the Language Revolution (New York: Atheneum, 1969). STwo recent surveys of the legend were useful in this study: Stanley R.

Of course, many poems in the Ch'iian Sung tz'u . , 1 are set to the title of "Chao-chiin yuan" uj , (Chao-chiin's Lament).6 In November 1978, a new variant appeared: Ts'ao Yu completed a version--at the behest of no less a personage than Chou En-lai--that radically departs from the traditional image of Wang Chao- chiin. Ts'ao Yii portrays Chao-chiin as a courageous intermediary between the Han people and the Hsiung-nu.7 By examining three kinds of texts, one hopes to trace not only the different geneal- ogies of each motif in the story, but also to discover the particular appropriateness of each version to its genre. The accounts in the annals are predictably terse and uncolor- ful; the version by Ts'ai Yung , E in the Ch'in Ts'ao 4 (Principles of the Lute) is as memorable as any, though few followed it; the summary in the Shih-shuo hsin-yii m , scarcely brings in the painter, and makes no mention of his name; the notice in the Hsi-ching tsa-chi n ~i  , on the other hand, seems to concentrate on the decimation of first-rate painters in the capital; the allusions to the legend in the poems of Tu Fu, Li Po, Po Chii-i, Li Shang-yin all stress the motif of the duplicitous painter and the mournful, yet touching image of the mound built for Wang Chao-chiin by her barbarian hosts after her death, a mound which--despite the ravages of the seasons and the inclemency of the climate- remains forever green. Another text to be examined is the Wang Chao-chiin story on the Tunhuang scroll. Marked by often clumsy versifying, full of local color, heightened by dramatic effect, the version gives perhaps the most sympathetic picture of the Shan-yii (or Hsiung-nu chieftain) of all the accounts. The text takes up the story after Wang Chao-chun has left the palace, when she has already settled in the northern region. There are elaborate descriptions of "life among the barbarians" that do not occupy any of the other ver- sions. The motif of the grave-mound that is forever green is retained, but there is no trace of the contrived suicides that mark Ts'ai Yung and Ma Chih-yuian's accounts. This "suicide" is less precipitous, and consists of a pining away unto death. The comparison in this study will be made at three levels: the structural (what segment of the total plot is used); the generic (how the story functions in a particular form); and lexical (what expressions and phrases persist). The object of the study is not only to show the prismatic subtlety of the legend which, when refracted through different angles of perception, yield different values of meaning and color, but also to understand why different portions are more "generically hospitable" to historical prose, classical poetry, or vernacular fiction. Further analyses, enriched with more historical detail for each work would, no doubt, yield critical insights into the contem- porary thrust of the variant, but that enterprise lies beyond the scope of this prelimi- nary effort. The aim of this investigation is to proceed beyond a mere catalogue of examples which touch on one literary motif toward a more meaningful appreciation of the literary uses to which any motif might be put. The legend thus comprises a constant; each version represents the influence of one or more variables--whether generic, historical, or personal. There are, admittedly, methodological pitfalls. It will not always be possible to assume that the same traditional legends exist in the minds of 6 In Japanese, there is the Noh play Shokun, in which Zeami was said to have had a hand; cf. Donald Keene, Twenty Plays of the Noh Theatre (New York: Columbia University Press, 1967), pp. 168-177. 7 First reported by Daily Reports (People's Republic of China), distributed by the Foreign Language Information Service, December 6, 1978. This version has been performed in Beijing, but it was not a success.</page><page sequence="3">EOYANG, Wang Chao-chiin 5 all contributors to the theme-tradition, though there can be no doubt that many of the motifs are very nearly universally shared. The "preference" of one composer of a variant--whether historian, poet, narrator, or dramatist--may scarcely constitute a preference: it may indicate nothing more than independent creation. Finally, it will be often futile, even meaningless, to establish parallels between an imagined reconstruc- tion, conforming to no fixed historical version, and a traditional source. But even here, it will be noteworthy what motifs in the legend are reinforced in the free adaptation of traditional material. The focus of attention will be on the analyses of the reasons behind the differences: it will not be sufficient to merely record the variations. These analyses may be initially speculative, but combined with individual studies of individual authors and their works, they may be building blocks with which to construct an edifice, providing a systematic model that will relate author to author, work to work, in a context of evaluation, a nexus of mutually illumined meaning. In no literature would such an approach be more appropriate than Chinese, since the coherence and the continuity of the Chinese literary tradition exemplifies better than any other T. S. Eliot's dictum that, for a writer, "the whole of the literature of his own country had a simultaneous existence and composes a simultaneous order." The isolation of a single narrative theme is a means of identifying for examination the "simultaneity" of which Eliot speaks. To trace the different motifs is to mark the molecules of meaning in the organism of literature: it will provide us with a specific instance of the configurations of traditional meaning. It may be objected that these "deviations" from a norm do not constitute matter worth examining, that they represent random departures of no great consequence, and that they do not deserve anything more than cursory attention. But this criticism would skirt several important questions: Why are certain story-themes more resilient to change than others? Why the persistent popularity of certain themes over the centuries, despite shifts in perspective, new developments in genre, changes in cultur- al orientation? And finally, why, if the variants are random and arbitrary, are there patterns of conformity and deviation? Studies in thematology have not always gone beyond motif-hunting, mere taxonomies of types and characters. But they may yet be fruitful if they relate to significant human values and aspirations. In the case of Wang Chao-chin we can identify several character roles, each with a different overtone: (A) the Cinderella-figure, involving the rise of a young girl from a poor family to the status of a harem favorite; (B) the proud and haughty beauty, who refuses to bribe the painter; (C) the political hostage, a pawn of power, a role she shares with Helen of Troy; (D) the patriotic heroine, who sacrifices her life and body for the sake of her country, slightly reminiscent of Joan of Arc; (E) the beauty despoiled, with its underlying Freudian ambivalences of horror and fascination, an interest familiar in the fairy tale of the Beauty and the Beast. The richness of the story may reflect its fundamental relevance to several basic human concerns. If we examine the five charac- ter-types outlined here, we see that they highlight five basic instincts: (A) ambition, (B) pride, (C) power, (D) loyalty, (E) sexuality. The Cinderella-motif describes the uses of beauty in achieving one's ambition; the haughty beauty motif reminds one of the pitfalls of pride; the patriotic heroine emphasizes the importance of the individual in exercises of power; the patriotic heroine puts forth the poignance of patriotism, par- ticularly when it involves the sacrifice of a beautiful woman; and the motif of beauty</page><page sequence="4">6 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 4(1982) despoiled responds to sexual fascination with the bestiality in physical attraction. Surely, if literature is a manifestation of what it means to be human, the study of a legend such as the story of Wang Chao-chuin will provide much of literary as well as human interest. Sources and Analogues The earliest mention of Wang Chao-chuin (Wang Ch'iang E 4 ) occurs in the Han-shu, 9:14a: The Hun Shan-yii Chih-chih abandoned and rebelled against the rules of proper conduct and principles of fealty and so has already suffered for his crimes [whereas] Shan-yi Hu- han-hsieh has not forgotten [Our] favors and benefits. He has turned toward and striven to follow the rules of proper conduct and principles of fealty, [and now] has again renewed the rites of [presenting his] congratulations at the [great annual] court. He wishes to guarantee the [border] barriers and to continue [this practice] endlessly, so that the borders and frontiers will eternally be without warlike affairs. Let the year-period be changed to Ching-ning and [let] the [Lady] Awaiting an Imperial Edict in the Lateral Courts, Wang Ch'iang, be granted to the Shan-yi to be his Yen-chih. (Homer H. Dubs translation8) The bones of the story are there: Wang Chao-chfin is given to the Shan-yi as a bond for his continuing fealty and as a means of securing the frontier borders both from outside invaders and, implicitly, from the Shan-yu himself. There is no mention of Wang Chao-chin's family, nor of her relationship to the Emperor, nor of the role played by the painter, Mao Yen-shou. Elsewhere in the Han-shu, a fuller account is given: In the first year of Ching-ning [33 B.C.], the Shan-yi came to court once again. Whereas he accepted clothing, bolts of silk and similar items in the time of the Huang-lung year-period [49 B.C.] he now insisted himself on marrying into the royal family. Emperor Yuan thereupon presented from his seraglio a girl from a good family, named Wang Ch'iang, known as Chao-chin. The Shan-yii was so delighted he signed a treaty that guaranteed the western borders as far as Tunhuang.9 The salient point about this account is the reference to Wang Ch'iang as coming from a good family,  ? +- . This will contrast sharply with the depiction of the Wang family in other sources as poor and destitute. The reference to Tunhuang in the Han- shu text inadvertently anticipates the particular interest the story will have for Tun- huang audiences in the centuries to come. In the same section, recounting the events after the death of Hu-han-hsieh, the text describes his successor marrying Wang Chao- chiin, who in time bears him two daughters (94B:10a). Ts'ai Yung, whose work Ch'in Ts'ao provides the most interesting elaboration up to that point. The qualities of pride and of willfulness emerge clearly in his account. When Hsiang saw Chao-chtin grow up, so well proportioned, so beautiful, he would not permit her to venture outside, and, because she was so extraordinary, he refused all suitors for her. Instead, she was presented to the Emperor Yuan for his seraglio.'0 8 The History of the Former Han Dynasty, by Pan Ku, vol. ii, p. 335. 9 Han-shu (SPPY edition), 948, 6a. 1o Ts'ai Yung, Ch'in Ts'ao (Ts'ung-shu chi-ch'eng edition) (Shanghai: Shang-wu yin-shu kuan, 1937), pp. 23-24.</page><page sequence="5">EOYANG, Wang Chao-chiin 7 However, she does not manage to attract the Emperor's attention, and, according to Ts'ai Yung, "she languished unnoticed for five or six years." Her behavior becomes increasingly haughty and perverse, so that she is even less likely to attract favor: In her heart, Chao-chun was disappointed, and she would not "prettify" her face with cosmetics, so that every time Emperor Yian went to the seraglio, he would pass her by. Only when the Hsiung-nu emissary appears, and the ladies from the seraglio are called forth to add to the festivities, does Wang Chao-chin, out of spite, give a good account of herself: As Chao-chiin's remorse and bitterness had lasted for days, and she had not had a chance to be presented, she now dressed herself up: brilliantly coiffed, beautifully garbed, her face was now radiant. The Emperor inquires with the emissary as to an appropriate gift for the chieftain. The emissary suggests he might particularly appreciate one of the Emperor's ladies. At this juncture, the Emperor asks for volunteers: Emperor Yian thereupon asked the ladies of the seraglio if there were one among them he could confer upon the Shan-yii. Whoever was willing to go he commanded to rise. At that moment, Chao-chiin, with a sigh, went over to the dais, and presented herself with these words: "Your humble servant has had the honor of serving in the rear apartments, but because I am homely and plain, I did not meet with Your Majesty's favor. I earnestly wish that I be the one who is sent." Here, the decision to leave the capital lies clearly with Wang Chao-chuin: she has forced the issue. By volunteering, in response to the Emperor's offer, she has commit- ted him to choosing her as his gift to the barbarian. No painter figures anywhere in the story. What emerges is a portrait of a willful, somewhat perverse, young lady. The Emperor is crestfallen, seeing now how beautiful she is, but he is powerless to retract his commitment; the Shan-yu, when Chao-chuin arrives, is overjoyed, and celebrates with due festivity. Chao-chuin pours out her sorrow in verses of lamentation that, using the metaphor of the bird, makes clear her thwarted ambitions: The autumn trees are lush; Their leaves sere and yellow. A bird stops by to roost, And settles on a mulberry tree. It preens its feathery wings, Until they gleam and glisten. Then it flies up into the clouds- But I remain, left behind.</page><page sequence="6">8 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 4(1982) The ascension to the heavens, the approach to the Son of Heaven, the metaphoric bird and the harem candidate, are perfectly parallel, until the last line, where the analogy-with plaintive finality-breaks down. The remaining verses touch on self- pity; they express the desolation she finds around her and in her heart: The swallows dart back and forth; Far off, the Western tribes gather; The mountains are lofty. The river currents turgid. Oh, father, oh, mother- The road is far, And woe is me: Sick at heart, sore afflicted. But the account does not end there. In the concluding segment, many years are assumed to have passed, and Ts'ai Yung skips forward to the death of the Shan-yfi: Chao-chun had a son called Shih-wei. When Shan-yii died, the son Shih-wei succeeded him. Now, among the barbarians, when the father dies, one takes the mother to wife. Chao-chun asked Shih-wei: "Are you Chinese or barbarian?" Chao-chun thereupon swal- lowed poison, and committed suicide. The Shan-yu [her son] erected a tomb for her. In the steppes, where the grass is white and withered, this tumulus alone is green. The incest motif, the final confrontation between mother and son, is unforgettable. However, there appears little historical basis for the story. Not only does it conflict with the versions in the Han-shu, where Chao-chuin is said to have borne two daugh- ters to Hu-han-hsieh's successor, it also cannot be reconciled to the demands of verisimilitude. Hu-han-hsieh received Wang Chao-chun in 33 B.C.; he died in the second year of Chien-shih R M [31 B.C.] after she had borne him a son (Han Shu 94B:9a). At the time of the putative exchange between Wang Chao-chuin and her son, the son would have been all of two years old. The fifth-century work, the Hou Han-shu f&amp; &amp; by Fan Yeh  , offers a certain corroboration of the Han-shu version: it mentions the selection from the ladies of the yeh-t'ing &lt; r (harem), the summons by the Emperor on the occasion of a banquet at</page><page sequence="7">EOYANG, Wang Chao-chiin 9 the departure of the Shan-yii; the dazzling impression made by Wang Chao-chiun; the regret of the Emperor; Wang Chao-chiin journeying off with the Shan-yuii. Two details of significance are added: first, the Emperor promises to offer the Shan-yii five ladies from the yeh-t'ing, of whom Wang Chao-chuin is one; second, after departing with the Shan-yui, it is reported that she bears him two sons, and that it is her stepson-the offspring of Hu-han-hsieh and a former consort- who wants to take his father's place in the marriage bed. The account mentions the resentment of the years languishing in the side-chambers, but it does not detail the circumstances for her neglect, or for her selection as a gift to the Hsiung-nu. It makes no allusion to the crucial role played by portraits and by portrait-painters. If one assumes that the Shih-shuo hsin-yhi was largely completed in 430, as Richard Mather suggests,"11 then one can date the first appearance of the court-artist motif to the first part of the fifth century. We have already seen that the motif does not figure in the Hou Han-shu, which dates from about the same period. The Shih-shuo hsin-yUi version is typically brief but telling, and one can imagine that it merely notes a variant that had some currency: Since the palace women of the Han Emperor Yuan were numerous, he ordered an artist to make portraits of them, so that whenever he wanted to call one, he could always summon her according to her portrait. The ordinary ones among them all bribed the artist, but Wang Ch'iang, whose face and figure were very beautiful, was resolved not to seek favors by unfair means, and as a result the artist disfigured her appearance in her portrait. Later the Hsiung-nu came on a peace mission, seeking a lovely lady from the Han emperor. The emperor felt that Wang Ch'iang would fulfill the qualifications to go, but after having summoned her for an interview was loathe to let her go. However, her name had already been sent on, and he did not wish to change in mid-course, so in the end she went. 12 (Richard Mather translation) Aside from the insertion of the painter in the selection process, and the reference to one, not five, chosen candidates, the other remarkable difference between this and the Hou Han-shu version is what it leaves out, namely, the sequel of the story relating to Wang Chao-chiin's life with the Hsiung-nu chieftain. The segment recording the fact that she bore children after leaving the Han palace-whether by the chieftain or his successor, whether one boy (as in the Ch'in Ts'ao version), two boys (as in the Hou Han- shu version) or two girls (as in the Han-shu version)-this is totally omitted. Somehow the image of a domesticated Chinese woman bearing her barbarian captor's offspring proves inconvenient in more romanticized renditions. It is clear that the major refer- ence in most allusions in poetry, including those by women in the early 6th century,13 will stress her continuing sorrow, the treachery of the court-artist, Mao Yen-shou, with nary a mention of Wang Chao-chuin's miscegenetic offspring. When we come to the Hsi-ching tsa-chi and the early sixth century, we encounter the " Shih-shuo hsin-yhi: A New Account of the Tales of the World, by Liu I-chl'ing (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1976), p. xxvii. 12 Shih-shuo hsin-yii: A New Account, p. 340 13 See Nienhauser, "Once again, the Authorship of the Hsi-chling tsa-chli (Miscellanies of the Western Capital)," Journal of the American Oriental Society (JAOS), 98.3 (1978), p. 228.</page><page sequence="8">10 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 4(1982) Mao Yen-shou motif firmly established.14 As we have seen, the Shih-shuo hsin-yii account introduced the motif of the duplicitous artist-without, however, naming him. The story stopped at the departure of Wang Chao-chuin from the palace. The Hsi- ching tsa-chi variant adds a few details to the manner of the bribe ("The ladies of the palace all took to bribing the painter: the maximum with a hundred thousand cash, the minimum with fifty thousand"), and appends a last section, specifically on the fate of Mao Yen-shou and his colleagues: The affair was investigated and all the court painters were executed. When their house- holds were searched, it was discovered that they were all enormously wealthy. Among the painters, there was one Mao Yen-shou from Tu-ling, who in his portraits could catch the essence of a person, whether ugly, beautiful, old or young. Ch'en Ch'ang of An-ling, Liu Po, and Kung K'uan were all excellent in their renderings of cows and horses, as well as of winged birds. But for human portraits no one surpassed Yen-shou. Yang Wang from Hsia- tu was also gifted as a painter who was particularly adept as a colorist. Fan Yui, too, was an excellent colorist. They were also executed on the same day. The famous painters in the capital, as a result, became scarce.15 The additional fragment seems by way of appendix and commentary, rather than a radical modification of the story itself; it might provide a footnote to the history of painting during a portion of the Han period, but it doesn't shed much light on Wang Chao-chftin's fate. The venality of painters, however, will leave an indelible mark on tradition, because Ma Chih-yfian's play, a thousand years later, will produce in his characterization of Mao Yen-shou, one of the most venomous villains on the stage. In the poetry of the T'ang period, the legend of Wang Chao-chuin figures in the work of virtually every major poet. In the eighth century, Li Po (701-762) and Tu Fu (712-770) use the theme; they are followed by Po Chui-i (772-846) and Li Shang-yin (813?-858) with variations. Li Po's short quatrain will be quoted often, and the second couplet will figure at a crucial moment in Act Three of Ma Chih-yfian's dramatic version: Chao-chfin brushes off the inlaid saddle, Mounts her steed, tearstains on reddened cheeks. Today, she's a lady in the palace of Han; Tomorrow, a slave-girl in the northern steppes. _L 3E4 i, ~s ~~h s#~ iJ~ti~ 14 See Chang Shou-lin, "Wang Chao-chuin ku-shih yen-pien chih tien-tien ti-ti," Wen-hsiieh nien-pao, 1 (1932), 347-371; for the dating of the Hsi-ching tsa-chi and the Wang Chao-chuin texts contemporaneous with it, see Nienhauser, JAOS, 98.3 (1978). In an extended discussion, Nienhauser writes: "And since this court- artist motif was already cited in poems of the early sixth century, Chang [Shou-lin] concludes that it was the Miscellanies account which probably first recorded it" (p.228). This, however, overlooks the Shih-shuo hsin-yii version which predates the period under discussion (500-525) by at least half a century. 15 Hsi-ching tsa-chi, (Ssu-pu ts'ung-k'an edition), 2:1a.</page><page sequence="9">EOYANG, Wang Chao-chiin 11 The quatrain sets off two of the decisive elements in the legend: the doleful trip into the barbarian regions and the precipitous fall from the heights of serving as imperial concubine to the depths of being a barbarian's handmaiden. The decisive element, the perfidy of the painter, concludes another poem by Li Po on the subject: The Yen-chih, through the long winter, blossoms out in snow; Her delicate beauty is downcast, buried in the desert wastes. In life, too poor to bribe the painter with gold; In death, a green grave-mound to make one grieve.16 The "Yen-chih" reference is a multiple phonetic pun, relating at once to the title of the Hsiung-nu consort [ M R ], the mountain with which she was associated [ ) ],z and the saffron face powder for which the plants in that region supplied the essential ingredients [ BW a ].17 The allusion in the poem is, therefore, triple: botanical, refer- ring to a plant that grows in the north-west regions; geographical, to the mountain on which the plant is found; personal, referring to Wang Chao-chfin as the consort of the Hsiung-nu chieftain. The metonymy-not to say anthropomorphism-of the flower blossoming ironically in snow would be a commonplace if the associations in this context were not so apt. Tu Fu mentions Wang Chao-chiin in at least two poems, one of which renders the motif directly. The "Meditations on Ancient Sites" (Yung-huai ku-chi r H- ' ), there are the usual descriptions of her departure from the palace, as well as to the "green grave-mound" -- t -by now familiar. The meditation roams over the centuries, and Tu Fu concludes: For a thousand years, her lute spoke out in foreign accents, But we have understood clearly her descant on grief.'8 It is a fine set piece, appropriate to reminiscence and to the huai-ku 't A mode. 16 Chiian T'ang shih, 3 (4)/3/3b. 17 "Yen-chih" A i refers to a red and blue flower, which produces a powder JL Th .

It is a poem that shows Tu Fu's compassion at its best; with the last four lines, Tu Fu transforms anecdote into poetry: Face powder, hair ornaments, vie with tears; Dismal country, beset by cold, doom the barren roots. If one says the women of Wu mountain are plain, Why should one find Chao-chuin's village here? The stature of a known heroine is borrowed to elevate one's regard for these pitiable women. The image of the face powder naturally calls up associations with the consort of the barbarians, and the lovely lady of legend. The "barren roots" make more poignant the sight of these women who wear their hair-knots-indicating their virgin- ity-even into old age. The use of the Wang Chao-chuin allusion is-typical of Tu Fu- strongly moral. The beauty of the Imperial Concubine, the propinquity of her village to these humble and homely wood-gatherers, gives one pause: these women are not to be despised, though their lives be lamentable-the allusion to the heroine of legend ennobles their plight. In the latter half of the T'ang, the Wang Chao-chuin legend became more than a commonplace: it took on local color. The perils of being beautiful took on heightened significance, if one is to judge from the many girls who were sent off to barbarian tribes, as the T'ang government sued for peace, using matrimony instead of military force to insure harmonious relations with potential frontier invaders.20 The tragic fate of Yang Kuei-fei, for the country no less than for her, could only have emphasized the dubious blessings of supernal physical beauty. Po Chiu-i wrote typical "finger exercises" on the Wang Chao-chuin story-one reported in 788, when he was only sixteen -that emphasized the pathos of her life in the barbarian steppes. Desert sand full on her face, wind blowing in her hair; Her eyebrows parched black, her face scrubbed raw. Misery, hardship, and gall have taken their toll: Now, she looks no better than her portrait.21 19 See Appendix; Chiu chia chi-chu Tu-shih, 186/13/14; William Hung, Tu Fut, p. 223, Notes, p. 100. 20 Cf.

Po was on his way to take up duties as Governor of Chung-chou in Szechwan (Sichuan). According to Waley, "Po was now getting into a part of China where the inhabitants were not of Chinese origin and were only imperfectly assimilated to Chinese ways... the people spoke a language unintelligible to him . .. and he dismisses them as being more simian than human."22 In such a region, an official of the T'ang government might very well empathize with the historical Wang Chao-chiun venturing into inhos- pitable climes. Po rehearses the legend, repeating motifs now conventional, when- suddenly-he is interrupted by a local elder: Her charms have long since disappeared, But a village in her name remains. Now, in that village an oldtimer appears; He points a finger straight at me and says: "To ignore the warning of the past Is to bequeath calamity on the future." So, to this day, the faces of the girls here Are disfigured with lifelong scars.23 ~~ T9i ~E fik ~. The legend has only the most general applicability: it is alluded to cursorily as a parable on human vanity. The fickleness of fate, and not individual villains, is respon- sible for one's misfortunes. The details of the story are glossed over, and it is unspeci- fied and indiscriminate envy (she was soon the "envy of all": a m r ) that undermines her life and thwarts her ambition. The force of the story can be felt in the "oldtimer's" caution: "To ignore the warning of the past/ Is to bequeath calamity on the future." One can only speculate on the historical circumstances that would have given this poem its special force.24 22 Waley, The Life and Times of Po Chi-i, p. 130. 23 Ch'fian T'ang shih, 7(3)/11/1a-lb; cf.

Here, it is pertinent to mention some of the main charac- teristics of the text. There is a marked emphasis on local geography: the narrator mentions Chiu-ch'iian ~i 5 (some 200 miles east of Tunhuang); Lung-le ft m ; Shih- pao ch'eng li a a, ; Yen-men i PS ; Lun-t'ai M . (west of Tunhuang towards Urumchi). The text combines both prose and verse, a form typical of most if not all the scrolls on which pien-wen were copied. The narration shifts from third person reporting to direct discourse, and some of the set speeches could easily be dramatized. The version begins (though a good portion of the beginning is lost25) With Wang Chao-chuin entering the far northern reaches, describing the desolate prospect around her even as she recounts her tale of woe. The Shan-yii is kind and tries to distract her with elaborate entertainment, but she is inconsolable in her grief. She blames the perfidious painter for her plight, but the text does not identify him by name. Gradually, she pines away, growing more emaciated with each passing day (she makes a few remarks about barbarian cuisine not uncommon among latter-day Chinese). Her dying aria recalls her situation: "I am married off to this desolate place, Where I pass the winter, waiting the dusk of life. I used to hum a tune in the moonlight, Exalted was I in grace and dignity. My complexion won favor, My features resembled Hung-hsien.26 Often I complain in these winter months: I waste away in prolonged illness. My color grows pale day by day; My spirit and energies all dispersed, And my condition is very grave." S- . rI u-" 25 About a third of the way into the scroll, there are these lines: ? 4 i t1 &amp; / IA A T . If one assumes roughly equivalent halves, then it appears likely that more than a quarter of the original text has been lost. 26 "Hung hsien" I  ("Red Thread") figures in a popular T'ang tale, and is, of course, an anachronism in a speech by a heroine of the Han period; for a translation of the story, see E. D. Edwards, Chinese Prose Literature of the T'ang Period (London: Probsthain, 1938), vol. ii, pp.27, 123-127; and The Golden Casket, translated by Wolfgang Bauer and Herbert Franke, English version by Christopher Levenson (Baltimore: Penguin, 1967), pp. 148-155.</page><page sequence="13">EOYANG, Wang Chao-chiin 15 After her demise, it is the Shan-yui who occupies the focus of attention: the narrator tells us that "the Shan-yui took off his imperial robes, donned the mourning clothes, left his hair disheveled, and brought her to a place to which he summoned the mourners. Day and night, he did not leave her side, so none of the tribes dared depart." The funeral is arranged-"according to barbarian, not Chinese, custom," the text tells us- and the preparations are lavish: camel caravans congregate, yak-meat is broiled, sheep are slaughtered, wine flows in abundance. The narrator has a flair for spectacle, and for exotica: The tribes all come in military procession: The prancing bears, the thousand-league horses. Outshining each other, the fine armies come; Cows and sheep are buried alive in droves, And female attendants leap into the pit- Hardly has the ground admitted its victims When, from the nether world, come screams and sobs.7 The Han emperor sends his condolences through an envoy, and the message is couched in appropriately diplomatic language: "Yesterday, everyone came to convey their respects, Today, we too bemoan Ming-fei's [Chao-chuin] passing. That is why I've sent my envoy to make sacrifice, To come from afar to assist you in your need. Although propriety is being observed here, It should not differ too much from etiquette there. Where a Prince is given a thousand rolls of silk, A Princess, then, would get ten bushels of pearls. Although separated from me by mountains and rivers, I frequently took pity on her loneliness. Next spring, I invite you to visit the capital." The finale to the piece is furnished by a solitary tribute on the part of the Han envoy as he sees the green grave-mound far off in the distance, on his way back. Now, this year, this month, on this day, I respectfully make libation of this purest wine, in honor of the Han princess, and to propitiate the departed Wang Chao-chuin. Quintessence of beauty in heaven and on earth, this lady, in all the world unsurpassed in beauty and grace, was betrothed to a vassal, as a result of a portrait, and her marriage brought fealty from the Hsiung-nu chieftain, as surety of faith to ward off invasion. This noble lady, whose dignity and courage is heard of once in five hundred years, her virtue will be seen again only when the Yellow River flows clear .... Alas, she dies among the barbarians, but how could her soul ever forget the capital? How desolate, that grave-mound on the horizon, between heaven and earth, that patch of green hill, forever forlorn! In view of the later versions of the legend that were to become famous, one should note the locale of this final scene. Ma Chih-yuian's play is set in the Han palace, with 27 Eugene Eoyang, Word of Mouth (Ann Arbor: University Microfilms, 1971), pp. 275 et passim.</page><page sequence="14">16 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 4(1982) Wang Chao-chun making a return as a ghost. Her death takes place, not in the barbarian territories, but before she arrives: she asks the chieftain the name of the river they are crossing, and when told that it is the Heilungkiang River (Black Dragon River-the Amur River), she throws herself into its waters. The envoy has been careful to point out that the Heilungkiang is the exact border between the kingdom of Han and the land of the Hsiung-nu. Startled, the Khan is contrite: he takes revenge on Mao Yen- shou, whom he returns to the Han emperor to be executed, thereby repairing any political breaches that might have resulted from his inadvertent "abduction from the seraglio." If there is a "classic" version of the legend, surely it's Ma Chih-yiian's Han-kung ch'iu (Autumn in the Han Palace). Yet, this version differs from its precursors in several respects. Most significant, perhaps, is the modification in the plot that contrives a meeting between the Emperor Yuan and Wang Chao-chuin before she is committed to the barbarian chieftain. Mao Yen-shou's perfidy does not end with his disfiguring her portrait when her father refuses to bribe him: he escapes the Emperor's command to decapitate him, and absconds to the barbarian camp. There he concocts a story about Wang Chao-chun offering herself as a princess to be married off to the khan and the Emperor's subsequent refusal to part with her. However false this account might be to the truth in Ma Chih-yuian's version of the story, it bears some resemblance to Ts'ai Yung's rendition of the legend in the Ch'in Ts'ao, even though that version did not include any Mao Yen-shou character. In the tsa-chii treatment, through a chance encounter, the Emperor comes upon Wang Chao-chun playing the lute; formerly neglected, she now enjoys the Emperor's virtually undivided attention. There is no reason for any act of spite. What Mao Yen-shou tells the khan is false in the story, but true to at least one source for the legend. Ma Chih-yuan's version introduces a second portrait of Wang Chao-chuin-this one presumably faithful to reality- with which Mao induces the Khan into choosing her as the bond, in marriage, of a peace treaty. Given the weakness of the Han armies, and the fecklessness of the court, the Emperor has no choice but to comply with the barbarian demands. Wang Chao-chun nobly offers to go; loyalty to country triumphs over loyalty to lover: her motives are, by contrast to those adduced in Ts'ai Yung's version, noble, not resentful. Her private, personal sacrifice is ennobled as a public act of patriotism. The concession of the Emperor to the demands of the Khan Hu-han-yeh is quite explicitly described in Act Two of Han-kung ch'iu as yielding to force majeur. But the fault, as one minister suggests by way of indirect criticism, is the Emperor's: "Since ancient times, how often has a woman's beauty been the downfall of a country" 8 &amp; iz 4 ' WJ i  ,  . Then, in Act Three, contrary to traditional practice, it is the Emperor, not Wang Chao-chun, who sings the songs of lament; her role is relegated to a brief opening speech, in which she resigns herself bravely to her fate, and to a request for a final libation before she flings herself to her death in the Heilungkiang. In the last Act, before a portrait of Wang Chao-chun (presumably still another accurate portrait), the Emperor dwells on his loss and invokes her presence in a dream. After a brief oneiric appearance, Wang Chao-chun is led away by a Tartar soldier-she is under guard, even in a dream. When a minister reports the death of Wang Chao-chuin, and the arrival of Mao Yen-shou in chains, under the guard of a Tartar envoy, the order is given, once again, for Mao Yen- shou's execution. Justice, in some measure, is carried out. A comparison of the pien-wen and the tsa-chhi versions provides an interesting</page><page sequence="15">EOYANG, Wang Chao-chiin 17 contrast: in the pien-wen version, the focus is on Wang Chao-chun, with the Khan in a supporting role, and the Emperor is not involved in the action at all; in the tsa-chti version, the focus is on the Emperor, with Wang Chao-chuin and the Khan Hu-han-yeh playing supporting roles. None of the previous versions contain the element of ro- mance that dominates the tsa-chi treatment: the Emperor never had a chance to savor concourse with his most beautiful concubine. There is no love's labor lost in these renditions. Ma Chih-yiian's depiction, however, is ambivalent: the personal bond between emperor and concubine seems to transcend earthly affairs, and seems to elevate the relationship, yet this romance distracts the Emperor from the proper devotion to his responsibilities as a ruler. The Chinese audience could hardly escape the overtones of the most famous story of imperial dereliction of duty: T'ang Hsuan- tsung's dalliance with his illustrious concubine Yang Kuei-fei. The line from Ma Chih- yuian about the supernal power of pulchritude-"Since ancient times, how often has a woman's beauty been the downfall of a country" -is a direct derivative of the first line of Po Chui-i's famous "Song of Unending Sorrow": "The Han emperor, inclined toward lust, doted on all-conquering beauty"  ~l fi , fIt ~ . The locale for the pien-wen and the tsa-chi versions are also indicative: the pien-wen takes up the story after Wang Chao-chun's departure from China, when she is travelling through forbidden, inhos- pitable barbarian regions; the tsa-chii version precludes Wang Chao-chtin from leaving the territorial borders of her home country, for she drowns herself at the boundary separating the barbarian territories and the regions of the Han empire. Where the geographic perspective in the pien-wcen is provincial and peripheral, in the tsa-chdti it is decidedly central and mainstream. The audience for the pien-wen might be imagined as dislocated or far-flung Chinese, on the outskirts of civilization at Tunhuang; the audience for the tsa-chfi might be characterized as elitist and cosmopolitan, Chinese in the capital, or sinicized Mongols ruling in the Chinese capital. Conclusion None of the versions examined was composed as a "classic": "it is only by hindsight, and in historical perspective," as T. S. Eliot reminds us, "that a classic can be known as such."28 Yet the reading of each, in the context of the other versions, reveals a dimen- sion, a depth, that gives special meaning to Sainte-Beuve's dictum on "the idea of the classical": he wrote that it "implies continuity and consistency, a tradition that forms a whole, is handed down, and endures."29 What we have attempted here is a textual test of the claim that T. S. Eliot has made for a "classic," and which seems to bear particular relevance to Chinese literature and its emphasis on past contributions: "The existing order," Eliot wrote, in a now famous quote, "is complete before the new work arrives; for order to persist after the supervention of novelty, the whole existing order must be, if ever so slightly, altered; and so the relations, proportions, values of each work of art toward the whole are readjusted; and this is conformity between the old and the new."3?

The poets, on the other hand: Li Po, Tu Fu, and Po Chiu-i, stress her lamentable life and portray the lineaments of doom and misery; Li Shang-yin seems fascinated by the figure of Mao Yen-shou as the gifted, but evil artist; the pien-wen version sympathizes not only with Wang Chao-chuin but with the barbarian chieftain as well. Ma Chih-yiian, however, shows her enjoying an intense romance with the Emperor, before she is dispatched shortly thereafter in a heroic suicide. Ma spares her from the long-suffering decline and protracted death that Wang Chao-chin undergoes in the pien-wen. More recently, Ts'ao Yiu has remarked that Wang Chao-chiun was a "true heroine . . . the greatest figure among ancient Chinese women."3' His own play, Wang Zhaojun, is perhaps most successful in its unforgettably poignant portrait, not of the eponymous heroine, but of Concubine Sun, who has been put "on the shelf" in the imperial apartments for decades, unsummoned, and who now, old and demented, imagines herself still young and fair. To trace the modifications of the Wang Chao-chin story is also to follow the migration of her birthplace and of the areas that identified with her. In the first century work, the Ch'in Ts'ao, she was identified as coming from the region of Ch'i, in northeast Shantung; in Tu Fu's poem, she is associated with K'uei-chou, a village in western Hupei;32 in Po Chii-i's poem, she is associated with a village in Sichuan, north of Kweichou. A brief survey of the terms in the various versions will also indicate a shift in the names of the "barbarians" that figure in the story: Hsiung-nu -ifF in the histories, "khans" i Yi in the dramatic versions; "T'u-chiteh" A IX ("Turks"), "Ch'i- tan"  ~t ("Khitans") in the Tunhuang scroll. The story adapted to the particular invader of the time, whether Hsiung-nu (Hun), "T'u-chieh" (Turk), or Mongol. It flourished in the frontier regions, whether in the southwest or in the northwest. It absorbed the literate in the capital no less. The transformations of meaning indicate something else about the legend: it ap- pears infinitely adaptable, not only to different cultural orientations, but also to a variety of genres. We have encountered it in prose histories, poems, pien-wen, plays. What segment of the story is used depends largely on the perspective of the audience for which it was intended: certainly the Tunhuang rendition is for local consumption, and could not venture very far outside Kansu to attract its audience. Yet, it is not without its qualities, even after one removes this provincial overlay. It may be that what prevents it from being a classic is not merely its regional orientation, but its unclassic plethora of what would be, for later generations, extraneous detail. Spectacle and exotica tend to be ephemeral, and in these instances, the less said the better. One could speculate on the failure of the ingenious version of Ts'ai Yung to take hold of the popular imagination. Its lack of historicity is scarcely an argument to be advanced against it: other versions are no less fictitious. Perhaps, as a dramatic element, it is too abrupt, too simplistic, too spare. It is not easily elaborated, since it depends for its very force on directness and decisiveness. No long arias could accompany this immediate resolution of the situation. 31 In a talk delivered on April 14, 1980 at Indiana University. 32 Ch'ou Chao-ao ttL ?JL  , Tu-shih hsiang-chu f? ~ti~ i , 1915 edition, 15:13b.</page><page sequence="17">EOYANG, Wang Chao-chiin 19 In any event, these ruminations are, no doubt, futile, mere rationalizations after the fact. One looks at new versions with a double perspective, finding something at once perennially surprising and perennially familiar. Appendix From the Ch'in Ts'ao (Principles of the Lute): Wang Chao-chun was a daughter of Wang Hsiang from Ch'i. She was seventeen [sixteen by Western reckoning]. Her complexion was immaculate and she was famous throughout the region. When Hsiang saw Chao-chuin grow up so well-proportioned, so beautiful, he would not permit her to venture outside, and because she was so extraordinary, he refused all suitors for her. Instead, she was presented to the Emperor Yian for his seraglio. But because it was out of the way, she did not attract his attention nor receive his favor: thus she languished unnoticed for five or six years. In her heart, Chao-chun was disappointed, and she would not "prettify" her face with cosmetics, so that every time Emperor Yuian went to the seraglio, he passed her by. In the end, one day, the Shan-yui sent an emissary to pay his respects to the court. Emperor Yuan set out music and song, and ordered the ladies in the seraglio to adorn themselves for presentation. As Chao-chin's remorse and bitterness had lasted for days, and she had not had a chance to be presented, she now dressed herself up: brilliantly coiffed, beautifully garbed, her face was now radiant. Everyone sat in place. The Emperor Yuian spoke to the emissary: "The Shan-yui, what would he care for, what is his pleasure?" The emissary replied: "Exotic treasures, rare objects, all of them he has; his consort, however, is repugnant to look at, and not as attractive as the Chinese women." Emperor Yuan thereupon asked the ladies of the seraglio if there were a woman he could confer upon the Shan-yui. Whoever was willing to go was commanded to rise. At that moment, Chao-chun, sighing, went over to the dais, and presented herself with these words: "Your humble servant has had the honor of serving in the rear apartments, but because I am homely and plain, I did not meet with Your Majesty's favor. I earnestly wish that I be sent." The emissary for the Shan-yui was just then at her side. The Emperor was startled: though filled with regret, he could not retract his offer. Some moments passed. Finally, and with heavy sighs, he said: "I have made a grave mistake, but there is no recourse but to carry out my promise." Chao-chun went to the Hsiung-nu, and the Shan-yii was overjoyed. He thought this a great favor bestowed on him by the kingdom of Han. He asked that wine be brought in, he called for musicians, and he sent his emissary to report to the Chinese emperor, sending along with him twin sets of white jade artifacts, ten teams of fine horses, and varieties of precious stones, collected in the barbarian regions. Chao-chuin regretted that the Emperor had not appreciated her. Her mind was troubled; and her thoughts were of home. Her misery was expressed in an outpouring of lament and longing: The autumn trees are lush; Their leaves sere and yellow, A bird stops by to roost, Settling on a mulberry tree.</page><page sequence="18">20 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 4(1982) It preens its feathery wings, Until they gleam and glisten. Then it flies up into the clouds- But I remained in the women's quarters. Away from the palace, in this wasteland, My health is wasting away; My hopes are overwhelmed; I cannot strengthen my resolve. Although there is food enough, My heart is still unsettled. Here, alone, where am I? Change direction or alter course. The swallows dart back and forth; Far off, the Western tribes gather; The mountains are lofty; The river currents turgid. Oh, father, oh, mother- The road is far, And, woe is me: Sick at heart, sore afflicted. Chao-chuin had a son called Shih-wei. When the Shan-yu died, the son Shih-wei succeeded him. Now, among the barbarians, when the father dies, one takes the mother to wife. Chao-chin asked Shih-wei: "Are you Chinese or barbarian?" Shih-wei replied: "I am more barbarian." Chao-chun thereupon swallowed poison, and commit- ted suicide. The Shan-yui erected a tomb for her. In the steppes, where the grass is white and withered, this tumulus alone is green. From the Hsi-ching tsa-chi (Miscellanies from the Western Capital): Wang Ch'iang There were many women in the rear chambers of the Emperor Yiuan. They were not often seen. So a painter was commissioned to paint their likeness, and the portraits produced were the means by which selections were made. The ladies of the palace all took to bribing the painter: the maximum with a hundred thousand cash, the mini- mum with fifty thousand. Only Wang Ch'iang refused. As a result, she was never summoned. The Hsiung-nu came to court in search of a beautiful lady to serve as Yen-chih (Princess to the Hsiung-nu tribes). Thereupon Chao-chuin (Wang Ch'iang) was of- fered, for she was considered dispensable on the basis of her portrait. When she appeared, in answer to the summons, it was immediately clear that she was the fairest of the ladies in the palace. She was well-versed in court etiquette, and made an altogether elegant impression. The Emperor was crestfallen, but the name had already been sent on. As he always kept his bond with other countries, he could not reverse his decision. And so, the matter was carried out as decreed. The affair was investigated and all the court painters were executed. When their households were searched, it was discovered that they were all enormously wealthy. Among the painters, there was one Mao Yen-shou from Tu-ling, who in his portraits could catch the essence of a person whether ugly, beautiful, old or young. Ch'en Ch'ang of An-ling and Liu Po and Kung K'uan were excellent in their renderings of</page><page sequence="19">EOYANG, Wang Chao-chiin 21 cows and horses, as well as of winged birds. But for human portraits, no one surpassed Yen-shou. Yang Wang from Hsia-tu was also gifted as a painter who was particularly adept as a colorist. Fan Yii also was an excellent colorist. They, too, were executed on the same day. The famous painters in the capital, as a result, became scarce. Li Po: "Wang Chao-chin" (1) Chao-chiuin brushes off the inlaid saddle, Mounts her steed, tears on her reddened cheeks. Today, she's a lady of the palace of Han; Tomorrow, a slave-girl in the northern steppes. (2) The moon over the house of Han, the realm of Ch'in, Casts shifting shadows to see Ming-fei off. Once she has set out on the Jade Pass road: At the horizon, she's gone and will not return. The moon of Han returns, and rises out of the eastern sea, But for Ming-fei, married off, that day will not come. The Yen-chih, through the long winter, blossoms out in snow: Her delicate beauty downcast, buried in the desert wastes. In life, too poor to bribe the painter with gold; In death, a green grave-mound to make one grieve. * * * Tu Fu: "Wood-gatherers" In K'uei-chou, the hair on a woman is half gray: At forty or fifty, she has no husband. Misbegotten misery, marriage and misfortune: A lifetime bound by bitterness, burdened with grief. There's a custom there: men sit and make the women stand; Men manage the household, while women venture out. Eight or nine out of ten are wood-gatherers, Who support their households with the wood they sell. Old ladies, they wear a virgin's hair-knot hanging down; Wild blossoms, mountain flowers clasped by silver brooches: They struggle up the roads to the marketplace, Their lives spent earning bread at the salt mines. Face powder, hair ornaments, vie with tears; Dismal country, beset by cold, doom the barren roots. If one says the women of Wu mountain are plain, Why should one find Chao-chuin's village there? Po Chui-i: "Wang Chao-chin" (1) Desert sand full on the face, wind blowing in her hair; Her eyebrows parched black, her face scrubbed raw.

So it was with such a lovely lady, Born here in this out-of-the-way place. But loveliness is hard to conceal: In no time, she was picked for his Lordship's house. Unique in her beauty, she was soon the envy of all, Until, one day, she was exiled beyond the frontier wall. One would think, with beauty that extraordinary, Who wouldn't-at a glance-be moved to mercy? Still, as things turned out, she had to go, With no help coming from the Most Honored One. If white and black can be thus interchanged, Why even speak of changes in complexion? When she died, her bones were buried in the north: There's no coming back for her homesick soul.
