<plain_text><page sequence="1">earn money. Concerning these women the atelier owner says, "'They are stranger women.... but they are para ile akraba olanlar [ones who have been made kin through money]'" (p. 119). This euphemization of women's work leads to a general undervaluing of female labor, both by the women themselves and by the men who control distribu- tion. Even though women generate income, their work is seen as not real work but as part of their do- mestic duties and obligations. This view also helps women to hold up their image as "good women" who do not go out to work, with all the potential risks of dealing with strangers that this entails. Chapter 8 offers further insight into atelier pro- duction through a case study that demonstrates how an underlying ideology that constructs labor as a means of strengthening group identity has been maintained. The concluding chapter shows how notions of kinship and capitalism can be reconciled by working-class women from the squatter districts of Istanbul, whose cheap, underpaid, and on occa- sion unpaid labor is used for producing surplus value. Although the exploitative nature of women's small-scale commodity production (regardless of whether it takes place in the home or in an atelier) can be readily acknowledged, the author presents a critique of theories of such production that do not take into account the internal mechanisms of local culture. Small-scale commodity production does have exploitative aspects but, White argues, it also has its positive side. Through this type of labor, working-class women participate in reciprocal rela- tions that strengthen their membership in social groups, resulting in a "heightening of solidarity be- tween 'exploiter' and 'exploited'" (p. 155). From this it is but a short step to an argument in favor of the existence of a moral economy within the capi- talist framework. The book has a lucid, reader- friendly style and an abundance of ethnographic detail. Even when the material is not altogether novel (e.g., some of the discussion of family rela- tions adds little to earlier published accounts), White's focus is original, and familiar patterns are explored in new contexts. Since fieldwork was car- ried out among traditional families of rural back- grounds and values, it would perhaps have been in- teresting to explore further both Islamic views on profit making and possible regional and ethnic vari- ations in attitudes to family labor. Nevertheless, the volume as it stands is an important contribution, not only to Turkish and Middle Eastern anthropology, but also to the anthropology of work and gender. AIDS and STDs in Africa: Bridging the Gap be- tween Traditional Healing and Modem Medi- cine. EDWARD C. GREEN. Boulder, CO and Oxford: Westview Press, 1994. xi + 276 pp. photographs, tables, bibliography, index. JOHN M. JANZEN University of Kansas "Ted" Green has participated in and directed a variety of health education and promotion projects across Africa, including water resources, sewage treatment, and projects with related diseases. In- creasingly, his work has dealt with sexually trans- mitted diseases, and most recently with AIDS. This book reports on these projects in Swaziland, Libe- ria, Mozambique, Nigeria, and South Africa, with a focused concern for the possible collaborative role that traditional healers might have with biomedical services in combating AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. The chapters describe the training of healers in relation to these diseases, ex- ploring the healers' knowledge of these diseases and identifying ways in which they have been in- corporated in health education, prevention, and treatment programs. Green's exploration of the case for the inclusion of healers in campaigns for the prevention and treatment of STDs and AIDS goes well beyond his interest in African indigenous knowledge of health and healing, and in the numerical frequency of healers as a source of health care personnel in a field where workers are scarce and training is diffi- cult. His reasoned argument is based on projects in which he has worked on STDs and AIDS, as well as those in which he has studied, trained, and ob- served healers. The first issue in Green's argument is the question of the pattern of transmission and infection of AIDS and other STDs. As has become common knowl- edge in health work, demography, and epidemiol- ogy, the pattern of AIDS infection in Africa is and was from the start overwhelmingly heterosex- ual-quite different from the prevailing early West- ern pattern of spread within the homosexual com- munity. The centerpiece of early Western response- condom distribution-was also applied to Africa by many agencies, with less than impressive results. In a populace where condom use had been largely unknown, viewed with suspicion and ambivalence because of the condom's interference with repro- ductive sexual relations, or rejected outright, con- dom programs have not proven very effective. Is there an alternative? A further issue in Green's argument comes from epidemiological and clinical studies based on the growing realization that HIV positive and AIDS rates are considerably increased through opportun- istic infections resulting from preexisting STDs. Therefore the two types of diseases must be viewed together. Any behavior or predisposition in health services that reduces the level of STD infection will also likely have a significant impact on the reduc- tion of AIDS infection rates and modalities. Green further develops his case with a discussion of the categorization of STDs and AIDS within Afri- can disease causality, combined with the growing (although piecemeal) evidence for at least some ac- tive ingredients in African herbal treatments for STDs. This evidence and the line of reasoning that follows should be taken very seriously by future health education and disease-prevention campaigns. The centerpiece of Green's argument may be summarized as follows. Sexually transmitted dis- eases are generally considered to be part of "Afri- can"-as opposed to European, or "outside"-dis- eases. This dichotomy of "our" versus "others'" diseases is one of the taxonomic profiles commonly seen both in popular representations and in healers' ideas in Africa. The categorization of STDs as "Afri- reviews 489</page><page sequence="2">can" may have to do with the manner in which sex- ual relations and sexual organs are seen, as well as with the ancient placement of sexually related con- cerns within a sphere close to identity. In any case, Green suggests, the categorization of STDs as "Afri- can" goes hand-in-hand with healers' claims to be able to treat these diseases. Such a claim need not be taken literally, although it is a factor that needs to be entertained in planning any campaign. This is because African healers expect, and their publics assume, that an STD will be better treated by a healer than by a clinic because of the alignment of the disease's categorization with the expectation that the healer will know what to do with this "Afri- can" disease. Too many STD and AIDS campaigns have totally ignored the healers' or the public's ex- pectations, opting instead to work around what is already being done. Condom distribution, the most prominent of the treatments coming out of Western health circles, has yet to become fully effective in any known program in Africa. The litmus test for this issue of involving healers in health campaigns may be based on the answers to two related questions. First, if healers' treatments for STDs result at least somewhat in the reduction of infection rates (or in the improvement of health in- dicators), should this information be used as the ba- sis for AIDS prevention and control programs? Sec- ond, if the first question is answered affirmatively, then should the medicines they use be identified and tested with regard to the treatment of (or at least positive effects on) HIV-positive or AIDS sufferers? This book has some of the characteristics of a re- port on numerous disease-prevention and health- promotion projects. Nevertheless, the focused na- ture of the investigation, and the related evidence the author marshals to assess both sides of the ques- tion of the use of healers in health campaigns, makes it valuable for policy debate. The readable prose and vivid case-study format, coupled with the book's reasonable price, should also make this book an asset in courses in international health, medical anthropology, and African Studies. Objects: Signs of Africa. LUC DE HEUSCH, ed. Tervuren, Belgium: Musee royal de I'Afrique centrale, 1995. Charts, figures, photographs, color plates, maps. WYATT MACGAFFEY Haverford College Books commissioned to accompany art exhibi- tions usually group together papers attendant on the theme of the exhibition itself, chosen on curatorial grounds. This collection of essays, although pub- lished on the occasion of the important exhibition, Treasures of Tervuren, differs from the associated book of that name (and from most such books) in that it has a theme of its own-that of securing a new footing for an aesthetic approach to African objects. It is time, declares de Heusch in his intro- duction, to do away with arbitrary distinctions be- tween form and function, and to restore to objects plucked from their context a sense of the meaning they originally had. De Heusch's stricture appears to be directed against art dealers and "a certain type of art history" (p. 10) in which separate chapters on form and function evade the task of relating the two; yet de Heusch mentions none of the many eth- nographers of African art in the United States and Britain who, one would have thought, have already done much to fulfill his objective. But let us not be too competitive; it is a rare pleasure to read a book so lavishly provided with the sort of striking photo- graphs one usually finds only in catalogs, and to have available photographs of objects so well sup- ported by ethnography. Pierre de Maret provides a comprehensive and highly readable account of copper crosses from Katanga. Dunja Hersak summarizes the signifi- cance of colors, stripes, and projections on the se- ductive kifwebe masks of the Songye in eastern Zaire before exploring the enigmas presented by shields from the same area that carry bosses in the form of kifwebe. Pierre Petit explains the Luba fig- ures that show a kneeling woman hearing a bowl: the bowl or calabash contains the white porcelain clay (mpemba) that signifies that the chief or diviner who owns it has been authenticated by the water- dwelling vidye spirits responsible for prosperity and clairvoyance. The female figure represents the (male) owner, described as the "bride" of the spirits, in an idiom widespread throughout West and Cen- tral Africa. Still in Zaire, but this time on the Atlantic coast, Mulinda (the only African contributor) pro- vides by far the best available account of the masks used by the bandunga, members of a sort of police association among the BaWoyo (western Kongo). These masks can only be "read" in association with proverbs indicated by discrete signs on each type of mask. The extraordinary leaf-masks of the Bwaba in Burkina Faso (neighbors of the Dogon), together with the commentary on them derived by Michele Coquet from Bwaba mythology, go far to support de Heusch's contention that to understand such ob- jects "we must start with death and work our way backward to the origins of the world" (p. 1 1). Before the end of the dry season, when the first leaves ap- pear, so do the leaf masks-mysteriously spherical masses that rush through the village to announce the opening of cult of Doo, the first-born of the Sun and the Moon and the central figure in Bwaba cos- mogony. Masks that emerge later in the ritual cycle take on anthropomorphic features, but are also linked to complex ideas about birds, bees, porcu- pines, hornbills, pottery, and smithing. The ritual cycle is clearly and explicitly linked to the indige- nous model of Bwaba social structure, but the masks also "translate as much by their plastic con- ception as by their behavior the different stages of certain cosmogonic events, from the creation of the world to the creation of the human face" (p. 32). Philippe Jespers gives a comparably complex analysis of Komo society masks among the Miny- anka in Mali, but unfortunately makes no reference to the work of Patrick McNaughton, who presents such masks in a very different light. Viviane Baeke shows how, among the Wuli of Cameroon, masks permute with musical instruments, wooden statu- ettes, and clay figurines as the ritual instruments of 490 american ethnologist</page></plain_text>
