<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Feather of Simurgh: The 'Licit Magic' of the Arts in Medieval Islam. By Johann Christoph Burgel. Hagop Kevorkian Series on Near Eastern Art and Civilization. New York University Press: New York, 1988. Pp. xii, 207. Price not given. 0-8147-1102-2. Professor Biirgel's purpose in this intriguing book (based on a series of lectures at New York University) is to investigate 'the interrelation betwen magic and the arts in medieval Islam' (p. 1) and to explore the literary type of the poet\x=req-\ magician in Islamic literature. The parallels drawn between medieval and Romantic uses of this type, however, reveal two basic issues which are never satisfactorily resolved: whether descriptions of art as magic and analogies between the magician's powers and those of the artist are meant literally or figuratively in a culture which accepts the reality of magic, and whether medieval art can be viewed from a post-Romantic perspective without obscuring important differences. In his Introduction Burgel outlines a basic assumption which informs his study, that of a conflict between 'orthodox' Islam, which disapproved of or condemned the arts, and Islamic mysticism, which allowed them to flourish. Such a view derives from a notion of Islam in which there is no room for cultural diversity; moreover, it ignores the vitality of the arts from the very beginning of Islam, a vitality that cannot be explained away by the power of royal patrons to ignore 'religious verdicts' (p. 4), or by mystical tendencies before the fact. Chapter 1 ('The Feather of Simurgh: The Divine and the Arts in Islamic Culture') adduces in support of this basic paradigm statements on the arts in the Qur'an and Hadlth, termed the sources of 'essential' Islam (thus implying that they are not sources for Islamic mysticism as well). Such remarks are, however, notoriously obscure. For instance, the Qur'anic condemnation of poets (26: 225-228) is generally interpreted as directed against those 'false poets' who opposed Islam. Statements from either the Qur'an or the Hadlth cannot be taken out of context: as the commentators make clear, there is an occasion for every revelation and every Prophetic comment. The opposition posited between the negative attitude of 'orthodox' Islam towards the arts and the liberating force of mysticism is also anachronistic, for mysticism was not a prerequisite to the thriving of the arts long prior to its impact. Moreover, the neo-Platonic strains so prominent in Persian poetry in particular were not confined to mysticism (nor did they affect medieval poets in the same way as they did the German or English Romantics). Invoking the concept of the perfect man, Burgel argues that 'in Islamic mysticism the mightiness of the arts, their magic, is no longer to be feared, no longer suspect of being an act of hubris, as soon as the artist is regarded, or presents himself</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS as being, a perfect man' (p. 18); he supports his argument not with examples of poets claiming to have achieved that state but with verses comparing God to a craftsman or artist, citing Ruml's likening of God to a musician, a weaver, a calligrapher, a puppeteer or a painter. Such comparisons, far from being 'anthropomorphic metaphors, which must have sounded abominable to the ears of orthodox theologians' (p. 18), had long been acceptable, if not commonplace, analogies not limited to mysticism but found, for example, in the writings of the Zahirite Ibn Hazm, who like many others used the analogy between an artefact which requires an artist, and creation which requires a creator, as proof of the existence of God. As a citation from the Rasa'il of the Ikhwan al\x=req-\ Safa' (not a mystical but an esoteric work which antedates the influence of mysticism on the arts) makes clear (p. 20), 'the idea of a general correspondence between the macrocosm of the universe and the microcosm of man' does not posit human participation in the divine, but emulation. In Chapter 2 ('On Some Religious, Cultural, and Social Implications of the Occult Sciences in Medieval Islam') Biirgel presents an impressive array of materials dealing with those sciences, in support of the notion (heavily indebted to Spengler) of a 'magical Arabic spirit'. Yet the view stated earlier, 'that a term like "licit magic" implies the background of a worldview pervaded by a belief in the miraculous, a constant expectation of the unusual, a sudden breakthrough, or a "piercing of the habitude" ... an invasion of the invisible, of non-space into space' (p. 23), suggests that such 'breakthroughs' would have been terrifying possibilities to those believing in the supernatural. Ibn Khaldun's refusal to consider Sufi miracles within the category of magic is revealing: prophetic magic stems from divine sources, while the danger of black magic was perceived as all too real. References to magic in the Qur'an and Hadlth reflect such beliefs; the Prophet's talismanic healings are not equated with sihr, but with the baraka of the holy man, whereas his ensorcellement was caused by black magic. Further, to assert that the 'lack of modern technology encouraged a belief in magic' (p. 37), that in pre-modern societies, where existential insecurity led to attempts to control natural phenomena by supernatural means, 'human observation was deceived or led astray', is a value judgement based in a belief in the superiority of modern science, taken as an absolute norm from which other solutions to human or scientific problems are aberrations. Biirgel's account of astrological magic and criticisms of it is lucid, concise, and highly informative; but it should be remembered that Jabir ibn Hayyan was no Sufi (although retrospectively associated with Sufism), and that Hallaj's condemnation for sorcery was held against him by many Sufis. Again, the statement that in 'the image of a Sufi saint or shaykh . . . the features of a mystic merge with those of a pious magician' (p. 47) ignores the distinction between baraka and sihr; Sufi miracles are classed (by 'Attar, for example) as karamat, not as magic. Opposing the figures of Khizr and Faust, Biirgel seeks to emblematize a perceived contrast between Islamic and Western views of magic; but not all eastern magicians 'restricted [themselves] to "licit magic" ' (p. 49), while Europe's negative view of magic antedates its 'ridding itself of the religious magic of the medieval Catholic Church'—witness the condemna</page><page sequence="3">IIO BOOK REVIEWS tion of such figures as Michael Scot, Roger Bacon, and John Dee, who derived much of their knowledge from the Arabic tradition. In Chapter 3 ('The "Licit Magic" of Poetry') Biirgel states that the coming of Islam created a 'serious problem for poetry' (p. 54) until poetic talents were liberated by mysticism, that before this liberation, the poet's position was 'utterly precarious' and 'the only pillar left [for him] to build his mightiness upon was his art or, rather, his technical skill' (p. 55), a view belied by the vigorous development of Arabic poetry, and of the arts, well before any mystical influence. The notion that poetry, speech, or eloquence is magical is a commonplace; but when for example al-Jurjanl in his Asrar al-Balagha speaks of comparisons as being 'filled with some sort of magic', of poetic imagery as resembling idols in its effect, and as transmuting its materials like alchemy, transforming the base to the sublime, evil to good, the qualification is important: this alchemy is only mental, and its effect deceitful, since such transmutations are not true, only apparent. Such selectivity is often seen in Biirgel's use of citations; quoting a passage from Nizam!'s Makbzan al-Asrar in which 'Nizam! depicts himself, and therewith the true poet in general, as being not only a magician, but also a cosmic man and an inspired messenger' (p. 59), he omits from both the citation and the discussion the equal emphasis on the connection between poetry and religion: 'When your speech has become honey do not cheapen it; do not spread the honey of speech before flies . . . Until the Law has brought you fame, beware: do not betroth yourself to poetry. Through the Law your poetry will rise to where your shadow will extend to Gemini. Poetry will guide you to Paradise, and give you rule over the kingdom of meaning' (MA 14:38, 40-2). Similarly, discussing (pp. 60—1) a qastda in which Nizam! terms himself the 'king of nobility' by virtue of his poetry, the second half of the poem, in which he humbles himself before God and implores His forgiveness, is given little weight. Hafiz's allusions to magic (cf. pp. 62—5) are clearly figurative; not only does Hafiz not equate himself, even metaphorically, with the perfect man, but references to inspiration by the Surush or the rich al\x=req-\ qudus, like comparisons of poetry to the water of life, are commonplaces by his time and represent not magic but hyperbole. Such instances point to the danger of taking poetic statements out of both their immediate and their more general context. Turning to 'some rhetorical devices deemed [by whom?] to be involved in the magic aura of poetry,' especially three which 'have to do with transmutation . . . taking a metaphor as reality . . . investing lifeless things with life, or nonhuman beings with human features . . . [and] explaining natural phenomena with causes existing only in the poet's fantasy' (pp. 65-6), Biirgel again cites Jurjani, again with important omissions. Jurjani does not say of Ibn al\x=req-\ Mu'tazz's verse, 'The rose laughs at the narcissus whose eyes/are sick and announce death to those still alive,' that the poet 'has endowed the rose with the faculty of reason and distinction' (p. 67), but the following: 'The laughter of the rose, and every herb and flower which opens, is famous and well known; in this verse [the poet] has attributed a cause for it, and treated the rose as if it could reason and distinguish, so that it reviles the narcissus for the shortness of its duration, the destruction of its glory, and the onset of signs of decay in</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS III it' (Asrar al-Balagba, ed. Ritter, p. 271; my emphasis). Elsewhere, discussing what we would call personification, JurjanI states that its status as majaz derives from the metaphorical attribution of an act to an agent other than its true one; thus attribution of the act of making grow to spring exceeds the bounds of reason 'because attributing the action to other than the Almighty is untrue with respect to rational matters; but it is said by way of interpretation and according to customary usage among people, who attribute what appears to be a cause or is like a cause of the existence of an act to its agent, as if it were an agent' {ibid., p. 356). While the act is true, its attribution to spring is figurative, and is based on analogy. Biirgel briefly treats the question of poetic lying, commenting on the 'slogan' (generally attributed to Aristotle) 'The best poetry is the most untruthful.' To the limitation of the 'poetic lie' to what is possible or fantastic Biirgel attributes the exclusion of 'fairytales' (i.e. fictional narratives) from Arabic poetry, a situation more probably reflecting that poetry's lack of a narrative tradition (despite some attempts to create one), in contrast to Persian, where narrative verse dates from pre-Islamic times. NizamT's prologue to the Sharafnama is cited as a defense of poetic lying; but NizamT himself stresses the need for balance: poetry should be neither all 'historical' and true, nor all 'marvelous' and false, and the marvellous must be made to appear true (the lines containing this statement, which precede those cited by Biirgel [p. 69], are omitted). Biirgel also seeks to connect the 'magic of love' with that of poetry; but the reviving and nourishing powers of LaylT referred to in Majnun's Dtwan arguably should not be equated with sibr (alluded to negatively in the line 'I can never find someone to break her spell' [p. 76]), but with the baraka of a holy person. Similarly, the 'alchemy of love' in VJs u Ramin involves a comparison in which the transformation is apparent, not real, as emphasized by Gurgam's use of comparative particles. Turning to praise of the 'perfect man' (the ideal beloved, the Prophet, the prince) Biirgel, citing a qastda by Manuchihrl praising Mas'ud I of Ghazna (and relying on J. Clinton's translation), ignores the various stylistic strategies which undercut the ostensible panegyric; panegyric statements, moreover, are not 'magical elevations' but normal and acceptable hyperbole which remains in the realm of the possible (if improbable). Praise of the Prophet is another matter, and one cannot question the genuineness of that praise or the identification of the Prophet with the perfect man; but the mi'raj, celebrated by so many Persian poets, was not a magical but a miraculous event. Finally Biirgel turns to 'rhetorical devices and structural techniques apt to enhance the magic aura of the poem' (p. 78): parallelism of members (generally linked with internal rhyme, though this is not noted), tnura'at al-nazir, connections between nastb and madtb, tajnts, repetition, puns, and other devices; but it is difficult (unless one assumes a conscious affiliation with magical incantations) to see why any of these standard techniques should be particularly associated with magic, any more than can takalluf (as in Kamal al-Dln Isfahan!'s poem rhyming in 'snow') be seen as more than a rhetorical tour de force. (In the poem cited by MahsatT the rhyme-word namakT is incorrectly described as a 'phoneme' [p. 79]). Anaphora and repetition are also problematic, if only</page><page sequence="5">IIZ BOOK REVIEWS because they are such universal literary devices; in short, there appears to be no necessary connection between these rhetorical devices and magic. Chapter 4 ('Music: Nourishment of the Soul') discusses writings on the effects of music in various contexts, including its use for healing. Here a crucial text, the chapter on same? from al-Ghazall's IhycC lulum al-dln, which provides a bridge between 'orthodox' and 'mystical' views (GhazalT endorses music precisely because its effect on the soul leads to contemplation of the divine), is inexplicably omitted (as is any detailed treatment of the problem of samac). Recognition of the psychological and emotional power of music, as shown by Biirgel's citations from the Aghant and from philosophical and medical writings, considerably antedates any mystical 'legitimization' of that power. As the Ikhwan al-Safa* observe, the power of music (like that of poetry) stems from its source in number, the organizing principle of the universe. As Biirgel points out (p. 96), the notion of both mental and physical health was based on the principle of balance (i'tidal), a notion which pervades poetic references to music such as those discussed in connection with Nizami's Khusraw u Shirm, and also informs the mystics' use of music in the sama' as a means of harmonizing with the cosmic order. The link with magic is, as Biirgel himself admits (p. 101), superimposed upon medieval views of music by the critic, and reflects a fundamental problem of method: are we to evaluate medieval concepts in their own terms, or impose our own, anachronistic values upon them? Chapter 5 (' "Love on Sight of Pictures": A Case Study in the Magic of the Pictorial Art') links this literary motif with the magical powers ascribed to images. Discussing 'whether or not Islamic art knew the portrait before the [advent of] European influence' (p. 120), Biirgel.seems to associate 'true portraits' with representational art, Islamic portraiture as presenting the typical only ('true portraits' being suppressed by prohibitions of images). Since medieval art (including poetry) was in general concerned more with 'truth' than 'reality', this problem must be dealt with in terms of medieval, not modern, aesthetics. Examples involving the use of painting as story-telling demonstrate the dual aspects of realism and symbolism: those in the tale of Taj al-Muluk and Princess Dunya, for instance, relate both to the personal circumstances of the protagonists and to the truths (which, typically, turn out to be opposites) that they learn from them. To speak of the 'apparent naivete' of such stories (p. 127) is to ignore their truth value, all the stronger precisely because no paraphrasable 'lesson' or 'warning' can be construed from them. The parallel between painting and verbal discourse which such stories illustrate is generally ignored, as in the discussion of Khusraw u Shlrln: for while ShTrin indeed falls in love with Khusraw on seeing his portrait, he has fallen in love with her on hearing a verbal portrait whose effect is equally strong. The function of such portraits, visual or verbal, is arguably not to symbolize 'man's search for the reality that lies behind the image' (p. 135) but to point him towards the truth (as opposed to transient 'reality') which is beyond representation. In Chapter 6 ('The Magic Mirror: On Some Structural Affinities in Islamic Miniature, Calligraphy, and Literature') Biirgel takes up the motif of the mirror so pervasive in Persian poetry, commenting that 'it was not restricted to the mystical sphere. We meet it in secular poetry as well, even though there may</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 113 always be an influence from mystical thought' (p. 139; my emphases). It is doubtful, however, whether the 'most common' of the myriad permutations of this motif is that of the magical mirror which appears in the poems of NizamT, RumI, and Hafiz. The motif of the wine-cup as a mirror reflecting the face of the saqi goes back to early Arabic wine poetry, in which there is no question either of mystical influence or of magical properties. The most provocative use of the motif discussed by Biirgel is that of poetry as mirroring either 'reality' or the 'invisible world'; but the element of 'symmetry' (as Biirgel translates ('tidal) is overstressed, as the very function of the mirror implies difference. Pointing to the structural importance of symmetry in all the arts, Biirgel refers to the 'formal, visual aspects of literature' (p. 142); but these are perhaps not equatable: the formal (or spatial) aspects of literary structures are essentially non-verbal (though reinforced by verbal means), while 'visual' aspects would seem to indicate not merely the shape of a poem on the page, but the power of words to produce images in the mind (especially as most medieval poetry was first heard rather than read). It is arguable that the medieval poets did not conceive of their structures as 'imposed upon the realities represented' (p. 143), but as imitating the numerical and proportional ordering of those realities, thus creating literary microcosms which are themselves signs of the patterns of creation. Patterning is, however, a universal phenomenon, and one must be careful about assigning symbolic (let alone magical) significance to such formal patterns as the bipartite structure of the poetic line or to devices like anaphora, repetition, and tripartite divisions; how they are utilized is all-important. Biirgel's discussion of symmetrical composition in the visual arts is highly illuminating, and he justly takes issue with A. Papadopoulou's emphasis on certain patterns (e.g. the spiral) over others, demonstrating a wide variety of structures; but repetitive patterns in the visual arts, like those in poetry, do not necessarily reflect a connection with magic, any more than do literary dialogues, which are a structural means of representing varied perspectives. Thus Biirgel's thesis that there is a real connection between the arts and 'licit magic', that comparisons of art to magic are more than merely metaphorical, remains unproven. It is a provocative thesis; but the evidence often not only fails to support, but undermines it, and the reliance on impressionistic (and sometimes inaccurate) readings of texts, rather than on careful analysis of their implications, aids in defeating it. The book is, however, invaluable in bringing together many texts not previously joined in concert, and in providing many illuminating insights. It is well produced (apart from the occasional misprint or infelicitous phrase), with the exception of the plates illustrating Biirgel's discussion of the visual arts, which (presumably in an attempt at penny\x=req-\ pinching) are small, murky, and virtually indecipherable. The useful bibliography is not entirely complete; for example, al-Ghazzall is cited in the text but not in the bibliography. Such problems are, however, largely editorial, and do not reflect on the author's unquestionable erudition and scholarship. I predict this will remain a stimulating and controversial work for some time to come. ]. S. Meisami Wolfson College, Oxford</page></plain_text>
