<plain_text><page sequence="1">Uganda Quest. By Ernest Neal. Taplinger Pub- lishing Company New York. 1971. 128pp. $7.95. This book recounts a naturalist's four months in Queen Elizabeth National Park. The author spent his time working out of the Nuffield Unit of Tropical Animal Ecology. His stated objective was to look at some of the problems involved in study- ing the middle-sized carnivores "like genets, civets, servals, and various species of mongoose." His introduction leads one to believe that primary efforts will be directed to the study of nocturnal species. While time is spent with these, most of the book deals with daytime observations. The publisher does the author a disservice on the book jacket. Initially he cites the banded mon- goose as a nocturnal species, and therefore difficult to observe. The author correctly refers to the banded mongoose as a strictly diurnal species on pages 33 and 84. Furthermore, information on the jacket refers to the author's twenty-four pages of wildlife photographs as "some in color," when in fact all are in color. The pictures and subjects reflect the author's skill as a wildlife photographer, but their rendition by the publisher is not of high quality; they are grainy and somewhat unclear or without good resolution on occasion. A glance at the Contents assures one that the author's purpose is to provide the reader with an interesting introduction to the wildlife and habitat of the park, together with an anecdotal coverage of his experiences while in the park. Much material covering the various species of bird, animal, and insect life is provided. The book is not a scientific treatise, nor did the author intend it to be. Scientific names are omitted for most animals and plants mentioned. Observations of animals are occasionally followed by questionable or incorrect inferences. On page 36, slowness or apparent reluctance of hippos to leave their day- time waterhole to graze is suggested as a sign of territoriality. On page 54 the author refers to an elephant's feeding on fragments of moist mud as "probably searching for salts in the ground." A tendency for anthropomorphic analogies is noted. On page 65 the feeding of hyenas on a decaying hippo carcass is portrayed to the reader by their J. Wildl.

Chapter Six provides the reader with some appreciation of the problems faced by an investi- gator in the field studying a little known species. The chapter presents an expansion of field notes and observations by the author on his experiences while studying banded mongooses. The final chapter on interrelationships of the savannah sketches a brief framework of the complexity of the relationships between plants and animals that exist there. The author has accomplished his purpose in pro- viding an introduction to the world of a national park in Africa. This book follows his previous efforts, The Badger, and Woodland Ecology. It provides interesting reading to the layman and perhaps an enjoyable evening to the more sophisticated reader. Lack of pagination on pages 127 and 128, and the lack of a period after Mr (sic) on page 78, were the only typographical errors noted. The bibliography is short, conforms to the style and content of the book, but is not exhaustive with re- spect to wildlife literature on African species.- RICHARD J.
