Science and mathematics programs planned by scholars in the disciplines and scholars in education emphasize skills of observation, measurement, class- ification, and experimentation. The process of inquiry necessitates firsthand experiences with living and non- living things; thus, special kits of equipment and films designed for inquiry have been developed by project directors. The instructional materials center will provide the materials for these new programs. However, the director of a library which is conceived as an instructional materials center has a greater re- sponsibility in helping teachers and curriculum com- mittees use the many available materials, develop organizational patterns, and plan effective strategies of teaching that will provide for new objectives in both the science and mathematics programs. 8 Impact on Instructional Procedures If a text is serving as the curriculum core, the library can provide for individual differences, and it can extend the content of the program. For ex- ample, a test covering a chapter in the mathematics text may indicate that some children need further in- struction while others fully understand the content. Some students may work with the classroom teacher; others may go to the library where such books as Numerals: New Dresses for Old Numbers' by the Adlers, and String, Straightedge, and Shadow2 by Diggins are available; gifted students may view a video-taped program. Later, the teacher will meet with the library group to discuss their findings while the other pupils see a film that reviews content of previous lessons. 1 Adler, Irving and Ruth.

Individualization of instruction is facilitated through use of varied materials in the library. Supplementary books provide more information than could possibly be included in a single science text. Also, trade books provide for different levels of reading ability. In studying life in the sea, for example, one child may read Goudey's Here Come the Dolphins,3 while an- other will find Lauber's more difficult book, The Friendly Dolphins,4 more interesting and challenging. The study might be extended further by Coombs' Deep-Sea World5 and Coggins' Hydrospace, Frontier Beneath the Sea. The library can make an important contribution by keeping the curriculum up-to-date by use of cur- rent books and periodicals. For example, The First Book of Mars,7 by Knight, was a 1966 publication that included pictures of the historic Mariner IV flight completed in 1965. The library should distribute copies of weekly newspapers to the classrooms and make available newspapers from several cities. Peri- odicals, such as Nature Magazine and Natural His- tory, can be made available. Children in the inter- mediate grades can learn to use the Subject Index to Magazines to locate articles pertinent to their study. A materials center also makes it possible to vary group size for learning experiences. For example, sixty children from two classes may view a film or listen to a presentation while a teacher uses an over- head projector. Following this "large group lesson," each teacher may meet with ten children to plan experiments, while another group of twenty view a filmstrip accompanied by a record, and the remaining students locate information in books. When the li- brary provides materials for many levels of ability and interests, independent study programs can be planned. Children can listen to tapes, view films, filmstrips or video tapes, and they can easily operate 8 mm. projectors with cartridge film loops. Modern programs emphasize teaching children how to learn rather than learning specific facts. This ob- jective requires use of many materials. The librar- ian can make teachers and children aware of the 3 Goudey, Alice E. Here Come the Dolphins. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1961. 4 Lauber, Patricia. The Friendly Dolphins.

New procedures will actually create books for the scholar; thus, he must know how to ask questions for the retrieval processes to gather the information he needs. Contribution to the Program The discipline of science is emphasized in the curriculum as a way of knowing the phenomena of the scientific fields of knowledge, the methods of dealing with them, and their history and trends. In new science programs, concept development rather than acquisition of facts, is a major concern. Dis- covery of principles through inquiry is recognized as an integral part of science teaching, and such skills as observing, classifying, and measuring are stressed. The librarian can make an impact by suggesting books and other resources for instruction. Concept Development. Print and nonprint materials can help the learner attain meaningful concepts. The concept of the development of a chicken within an egg illustrates how many experiences can be inte- grated. Children can incubate eggs in the classroom and observe embryonic changes by breaking the eggs on successive days. The sequence of microscopic photographs of the embryo at 12, 21, 24, and 36 hours in the book, A Bird Is Born,8 by Bosiger, will further extend observation. Selsam's The Courtship of Ani- mals9 and Animals as Parents'0 are books giving further information for a more accurate concept. A film, "Life Story of the Hummingbird" (EBF), shows the courtship and nesting of birds as well as the incubation and hatching of eggs. Children would not be able to observe these tiny birds in any other way. Thus, many kinds of experiences are planned by teacher and librarian to build concepts. Understanding the Method of Science. Learning the method of science is best achieved by individual inquiry through manipulating objects, experimenting, formulating questions that can be tested, establish- ing controls, recording data, and summarizing, in- ferring, and applying principles. Children can also learn about the scientific method by reading about the investigations of others, their tools, and their lives. Textbooks seldom report scientific investiga- 8 Bosiger, E., and Guilcher, J. M. A Bird Is Born. New York: Sterling Publishing Co., Inc., 1965. 9 Selsam, Millicent E. The Courtship of Animals.

For example, Kohn stresses the role of the imagination in The Scientific Method"l in writing of the discoveries of Galileo, Harvey, Fermi, and others. Watts, in Archeology, Exploring the Past,'1 records the discovery and identification of one small pot and shows the work of scientists at the site and in the museum. Carthy, in Animals and Their Ways,13 relates human mastery of the environment and scien- tific investigations. Observational methods are presented in many books. In The Crab That Crawled Out of the Past,14 the Milnes include observation and research; Mead's Anthropologists and What They Do"1 describes scien- tific work; Ludovici's The Great Tree of Life"1 illustrates how one scientist builds upon the work of another. Books can also aid in the development of ob- servation and classification skills. The "naming of things" is less important than comparing and noting details in order to identify a leaf, a stone, or a bird. Two books by Selsam, How To Be a Nature De- tective"7 and Benny's Animals and How He Put Them in Order,"1 would be appropriate for the primary grades. City children would find White Patch, A City Sparrow,19 by Earle, a guide for ob- serving birds. Films can aid children's observation. "Birds of the Marshes" (Coronet) might be shown without sound. Then, after discussion, the children would again view the film-this time with narra- tion-receiving guidance in their observation. Neither films, nor books, however, substitute for firsthand experience. Discovery of the principles of simple machines should be made as children them- selves manipulate levers and set up pulleys. Books, such as What Makes it Go?20 by Wyler and Ames, and Now Try This21 by the Schneiders, may be used to supplement classroom exploration. A series of film 11 Kohn, Bernice. The Scientific Method.

Indiscrim- inate-:use of audio-visual material may be time wasting and lead to misconceptions. For example, a recorded song about energy provides strong rhythms and gay melodies; it may entertain children and introduce terminology, but meaning will be derived from other experiences. Such records might be useful in motiva- tion, but demonstration would be more appropriate. Many experiment books lead children to use scien- tific methods; others merely provide a "cookbook approach." Milgrom's book is a good example of one that does not provide answers, but leads the child to his own discoveries. In Adventures With a String, the child is directed: Make the string short. Swing the key. Make the string longer. Swing the key. Which time does the key swing faster?22 The child is then asked: "What else can you find out about a string? Think of what you want to do. See what you can discover." Skill in keeping records and graphing data may also be developed through books. For example, records of the actual space flights could be compared with the books, Project Mercury and Project Apollo,23 by Coombs. Critical Reading. To develop critical reading skills, children need to use many references. Ravielli's The World is Round24 develops the concept of a smoothly spherical planet. It would be interesting for students to compare this book with the reports of the Inter- national Geophysical Year studies showing a slightly pear-shaped earth. Children need to be aware of discrepancies within the text of a book. For example, they might question such events as the quick arrival of birds at the feeder in Holman's Elisabeth, the Bird Watcher.2 Would 10 Earle, Olive L. White Patch, A City Sparrow.

How would the local en- vironment influence the events. Distinction of statements of fact and theory should be one goal of the science program. Wide reading in trade books provides opportunities to identify such statements. Children also need guidance in identify- ing anthropomorphism in science books. In Animals as Parents, Selsam warns young readers that animals ". . .do not have human intelligence or emotions, so we must avoid interpreting their behavior in terms of our own feelings and thoughts."26 Teleological interpretations of the nature of phenomena should be avoided in science materials. Such statements as "Nature is ruthless, and one of her most effective methods of population control is by starvation...."27 ascribes power or purpose to Nature. Many materials are needed to help children become aware of accuracy and authenticity. History of the Discipline. Knowledge of the history of scientific developments is an important aspect of the curriculum. The experiments of Galileo could be duplicated as children read Gregor's Galileo.2 The historical development of man's understanding of time could be encouraged by The Story of Our Calendar,2 by Brindze, and The First Book of Time,30 by Ben- dick. Asimov's book, Words of Science and the His- tory Behind Them,31 exemplifies the kind of book that enriches the science curriculum. Around the World With Darwin32 by Selsam uses actual accounts written by the scientist. Trade books can clarify social problems related to science. Russell's About Saving Wild Life for To- morrow,33 Carlson's Water Fit to Use,34 and This Is Automation35 by Hirsch illustrate books presenting economic, social, and political problems. 26 Selsam, Millicent E.

Water Fit to Development of Science Interests Time should be allocated for the exploration of current science events and individual interests. One objective is to develop students who "behave as scien- tists behave." The librarian who follows the child through his elementary years often is the person most aware of individual interests. To a fifth-grade teacher, new to the school, the librarian said, "Here's a new book on moths for David. He's been interested in moths and butterflies since he was six years old. He knows more about these insects than most of us, and you might have him check this easy book for inaccuracies." Knowing a gifted sixth-grader's interest in math, she ordered Computers! From Sand Table to Electronic Brain,36 by the Vorwalds, to extend his interest. A browsing corner in the library is important for young scientists. Here, reference and generalized science books, such as The Wonderful World of En- ergy37 by Hogben or Sea Horses38 by Hess may be displayed. Children need time to "dip into" many books, periodicals, and encyclopedias. A special library shelf displaying materials related to current events, local environment, or new develop- ments in science could generate student interest. In the fall, a description of banding Monarch butterflies would be interesting as children read Hutchin's Travels of Monarch X.39 More mature readers would find Woodbury's The Frigid World of Cryogenics40 and Hamilton's Century: Secret City of the Snows41 intriguing books that open the door to new worlds. The science curriculum should both preserve and increase the child's curiosity and sense of wonder. The instructional materials center may make its greatest contribution in achieving this purpose. l Use. New York: John Day Co., 1966. 35Hirsch, S. Carl. This Is Automation.
