<plain_text><page sequence="1">Queen Mab: The Inconsistency of Ahasuerus Four years after the printing of Queen Mab (1813), Shelley wrote that the poem "was composed in early youth, and is full of those errors which belong to youth, as far as arrangement of imagery and language and a connected plan, is concerned." ' Quite possibly he had in mind, among other matters, his use of the Wandering Jew in the character of Ahasuerus, a figure whose two functions seem irreconcilable. Shelley used the legend of the Wandering Jew in various works. The figure first appears as Paulo in The Wandering Jew, written in the winter of 1809_1810.2 Here the characterization is exclusively orthodox; that is, Paulo suffers timeless pain but does not become an instrument for the poet's attack upon the conception of a deity which would cause such pain. Although Shelley might possibly have had religious doubts at this time,3 these in no way influenced his 1 Shelley to Mr. Waller, November 22, 1817. (The Complete Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley, ed.

In a shorter poem, "The Wandering Jew's Soliloquy," probably written in 1812,' the speaker begs for death from the " Tyrant of Earth," but he accepts the orthodox account of the Creation and Fall. The difference between Shelley's earlier use of the legend and this is merely one of evaluation of the motivation of the deity rather than of the structure of the legend itself: the pro- tagonist is an eternal wanderer totally subject to the will of his divine persecutor. The figure of the Wandering Jew next appears as the Stranger in The Assassins, a prose fragment which Shelley wrote in 1814,5 the year after the printing of Queen Mab. Although the somewhat in- coherent utterances of the Stranger at the time that Albedir discovers him clearly suggest his identity, the rest of the legend remains un- developed. Shelley in no way committed himself to a kind of con- sistency had he chosen to complete the work. In Alastor a reference to the Wandering Jew (675-681), like the preceding mention of Medea, merely serves the needs of poetic imagery, so that the question of the poet's religious belief does not arise. Finally, what seems to be the figure of the Wandering Jew appears in Hellas, again as Ahasuerus. Describing Ahasuerus to Mahmud, ilassan is careful to point out that there are various reports concerning his origin and identity, and Ahasuerus himself asserts only that he, like Mahmud, is a man; beyond this he lets Mahmud infer what he will.6 Ahasuerus, therefore, remains merely an abstraction in Hellas, the spokesman for an idealistic point of view. In this role he could have been expressly identified with Tiresias perhaps, but hardly with the Wan- dering Jew. It is clear that in these other works Shelley used in two ways figures taken to be the Wandering Jew. In the first the figure is traditional, that is, one punished by a deity, who may or may not be considered unjust but whose existence is not questioned within the context of the work. In the second the figure exists apart from the legend and serves the poet's artistic or thematic purposes; his association with the Wandering Jew is at most suggested, and is used to enrich but 4White, I, 653. 6 Mary Shelley's Journal, ed. Frederick L. Jones (Norman, Oklahoma, 1947), pp. 11, 12, 14, 16. 6 In his Notes on Hellas Shelley wrote, "I have preferred to represent the Jew as disclaiming all pretension, or even belief, in supernatural agency " (Works, in, 57). 398 Modern Language Notes</page><page sequence="3">not to limit the symbolic value of the character. It is the attempt in Queen Mab to fuse these two functions of the figure that failed. Queen Mab's denial of the existence of an anthropomorphic deity logically precedes her evocation of Ahasuerus, who is to demonstrate that if there were such a deity, then he would necessarily be unjust, as "vengeful as almighty" (Queen Mab, VII, 85). Ahasuerus re- verses the terms of traditional belief, for the god that he describes creates in order to satisfy the needs of an essentially evil nature. That the notion of such a deity, or of any anthropomorphic mover of the universe, is fantastic is emphasized by the fact that Ahasuerus, who believes in this deity, is a phantom of " inessential figure " (VII, 71). To this point the character is consistent with the legend, which has been merely adapted to the poet's needs and serves him as a myth. It is at the point-following Ahasuerus's account of the Creation and Fall, the revelation to Moses, the Incarnation, and his own sufferings- at which Ahasuerus reveals his sense of triumph over his persecutor that the figure becomes inconsistent. Though apparently bound by life, he remains, he says, Yet peaceful, and serene, and self-enshrined, Mocking my powerless tyrant's horrible curse With stubborn and unalterable will (VII, 256-8). He becomes an echo of the " virtuous man " appearing earlier in the poem (III, 150-160), who, though imprisoned by the evil king, is actually free and happy. Possibly he prefigures Prometheus as a type of hero,7 but in coming to serve these functions, Ahasuerus ceases to move within the structure of the legend of the Wandering Jew, the essence of whose being is eternal and unqualified suffering. The Wan- dering Jew should seem to suit Shelley's intentions, for, having an air of unreality about him, he was obviously an effective symbol for all those who believe in the anthropomorphic deity of orthodox tradi- tion and to whom for their belief would come only pain and, intel- lectually, a privation of reality. But to have this " inessential figure " triumph over his inessential persecutor is to destroy his original effectiveness. If the figure were supposed to appear in the poem in order to give expression to an idealistic philosophy, much as Ahasuerus does in Hellas, then he could hardly have been specifically identified 7See Carl Grabo, The Magic Plant: The Growth of Shelley's Mind (Chapel Hill, 1936), p. 114; White, I, 293.
