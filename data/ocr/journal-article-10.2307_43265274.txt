VAHDATI Abstract: Petro glyphs are significant for the study of ancient cultures and economic activities as well as for their aesthetic qualities as an artistic expression. The newly discovered petroglyphic site of J orbat to the north of the plain of J ajar m is one of the largest rock-art complexes of Iran. In terms of chronological depth, quantity, and quality of imagery, it is the richest complex in Northeastern Iran. Ranging from late Bronze Age to the ethnographic period, the rock art imagery of J orbat has close parallels both in petroglyphic sites of the Central plateau of Iran and the Central Asian steppes. In this article, the most important images and compositions of the complex are briefly described. Using a comparative approach, an attempt is made to date and occasionally interpret images in their historical- geographical context. Résumé: Les pétroglyphes ont une grande importance tant pour l'étude des cultures et des activités économiques anciennes, que pour leur forme artistique. Le site à pétroglyphes de J orbat, récemment découvert, dans le nord de la plaine de Jajarm, est l'un des plus grands sites d'art rupestre de l'Iran. Du point de vue chronologique, quantitatif et iconographique , il constitue l'ensemble le plus riche dans le nord-est de l'Iran. L'iconographie rupestre de J orbat, qui s'échelonne du Bronze final à l'époque moderne, possède des parallèles proches avec les sites à pétroglyphes du plateau central de l'Iran et ceux des steppes de l'Asie centrale. Les représentations et compositions les plus importantes du site sont brièvement présentées dans cet article. Par une approche comparative, nous tentons de dater et d'interpréter les images dans leur contexte historique et géographique.

INTRODUCTION In 2006, while conducting an archaeological reconnais- sance in the plain of Jajarm and in the basin of Kal-e Shur River to locate prominent archaeological sites for the Iran National Heritage list, we were directed by the peoples of Jorbat village to a concentration of rock-pecked art assemblage at the northern foothills of Kuh-e Owzon (of the eastern exten- sion of Elburz) to the northeast of Jajarm. This area is locally known as Sang Neveshteh or the "inscribed stone". However, we have named the site after Jorbat, the nearest village to the petroglyphic complex (approximately 9 km to the southeast). The petroglyphic site is located at 56° 62" 989' N, 37° 09" 077' E, at an altitude of 1270 m above sea level, and on the bank of a now dried-up water course which is a tributary of Kal-e Shur River (fig. I).1 The site comprises a large scatter of boulders and blocks of stones that under the impact of seismic 1. Our field observation shows that the water table level at the site is rela- tively high, measuring approximately 3-4 meters beneath the riverbed. Accordingly, one may assume that the now dried-up watercourse was once a seasonal or even perennial flow in antiquity.

The ridge itself is made up of a grayish to cream limestone of the Mozdura Formation, equivalent to the Binalud zone (Eastern Elburz sys- tem), dating from the Mesozoic (Jurassic) period. Exposed sur- faces of the stone outcroppings are now covered with a black to dark-brown patina having a thickness of 1-2 mm depending on the time of exposure. Due to the fact that rock carvings of Jorbat, like many petroglyphic complexes in other parts of the world, were created in the open-air, a large number of petroglyphs have been destroyed by cracking and flaking of the stone surfaces or dimmed by lichens, earth, etc. Many images are totally obscured and difficult to discern. Local peoples have also par- ticipated in destroying petroglyphs by imitating old images or carving new designs or inscriptions on the old ones. The petroglyphic complex lies in a hilly terrain within a few kilometers to the north of Miandasht Wildlife Refuge and Protected Area. As a physiographically unique reserve, the Miandasht Wildlife Refuge is composed of vast expanses of flat plains with rolling hilly terrains in the central part and provides habitat for many invaluable wild species. The Kal-e Shur (brackish) river follows to the northern part of the reserve and, with other physiographic features, provides an appropri- ate refuge for wildlife, particularly wild boar (Sus scrofa ), goi- tered gazelle ( Gazella subgutturosa) and the Asiatic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus ).2 From a climatic point of view, the mean annual tempera- ture of 18 degrees centigrade and precipitation of 180 mm have resulted in an arid to semi-arid climate in the region.3 The mountain slopes to the west of the petroglyphic site have vegetation coverage of steppe forest type, dominantly covered with juniper trees (. Juniperus poly carpus) and scrubs (Artemisia aucheri). The rolling terrain and flat plain to the south which form the Miandasht reserve, nowadays under special protec- tion of the Iranian Department of the Environment, consists of desert and kavir ecosystems with xerophyte and halophyte 2.

Haloxylon ) scattered on sand plains as well as tamarisk (Tamarix) along the dried watercourses and large waterholes.4 THE PETROGLYPHS In a preliminary survey of the complex of Jorbat petro- glyphs, we have recorded approximately one-hundred pecked boulders and blocks of stone with several 'layers' of images that have been depicted one upon the other over a period of several thousand years. The actual visual recording of the cor- pus of images was accomplished through drawings and pho- tographs. Drawings were made by the author assisted in the field by Javad Mohamadpour using a simple method of trac- ing the images on thick, transparent plastic sheets. However, a few drawings are photograph based and have been rendered in CorelDRAW software. Images at the complex of Jorbat occur both as panels and motifs; in some instances, they are depicted in close associa- tion and constitute related or unrelated groupings. In others they are individual markings or figures. Except for a few examples, most of animal imagery of Jorbat is shown in profile. In some instances, however, while the animal body is in profile, the face is shown frontally (fig. 4: 21-22). These images are usually pecked, chipped out or Fig. 3 - Image of a wild- goat with long , curved and ribbed horn facing a carnivore ( possibly a wolf). simply incised with a stone and/or a sharp metal tool in a styl- ized or naturalistic style. The images can be divided into six general categories: a) animal images (including both livestock and wild species); b) anthropomorphic images and related ele- ments; c) vegetal designs; d) images of tools and war equip- ments; e) geometric designs (including signs and markings); and f) Persian/Arabic inscriptions. In this preliminary study, we will briefly describe each of these categories and will try to date some of the images that have parallels in the petroglyphic sites of the Central plateau of Iran and Central Asia. a) Animal images, especially those of the protohistoric period, are naturalistic, easy to recognize, including various species of caprids, bovids, and carnivores. Among the wild- animal imagery of Jorbat, wild-goat (Capra aegagrus) or "Persian ibex" with long, elaborately curved and ribbed horns are most common (fig. 3; 4: 1-11, 13-15). In some cases, the horn is so exaggerated that the ration of body to horn is 1/5 (fig. 4: 7-8). Other discernable wild species are wild sheep (Ovis orientalise fig. 4: 6), red deer (Cervus elaphus ; fig. 4: 12) and goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa). Carnivores include Asiatic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus) (fig. 4: 25), grey wolf (Canis lupus) and possibly jackal (Canis aureus) or common fox (Vulpes vulpes). The only recognized reptile is a snake (fig. 4: 19). Except for the red deer, the Miandasht reserve and its northern mountain ranges are approved habitats of almost all of the above mentioned species.5 4. Farhadinia, 2007: 9. 5. Farhadinia, 2007.

Various livestock and household animals including sheep and goat (fig. 4: 20-21), cow or bull (fig. 4: 23-24), horse or mule (fig. 4: 10, 25), dog, and most interestingly, Bactrian camel ( Camelus bactrianus) (fig. 4: 16-17) were recognized in the complex as well. In one instance, a big animal (possibly an elephant?) is depicted with a saddle on the back (fig. 5). The last two animals, the Bactrian camel and the elephant, have scarcely been reported from petroglyphic sites of Central plateau of Iran, but have several times been reported in petro- glyphic complexes of northeastern Iran, from Zaynabiyeh around Mashhad6 and Quch Qal'eh to the east of Bojnord, Central Asia, Mongolia and the Altay region. For images of Bactrian camel in Khorassan and Central Asian petroglyphic complexes,7 as for the Bactrian camel in Jorbat, one important observation is that the animal is shown ridden by a hunter or a warrior. Similar compositions have also been reported in the Late Bronze Age petroglyphs of Tsagaan Salaa/Baga Oigor in Mongolia,8 and indicate the role played by the camels in hunt- ing or warfare in Bronze Age society. b) Anthropomorphic images are numerous in the com- plex of Jorbat and in almost all cases show male figures on horseback or on foot. These males are sometimes shown with one hand raised and the other hand down (fig. 6: 1-3) or with stretched arms (fig. 6: 4-5), in groups dancing with arm(s) resting on the waist (fig. 6: 6), and sometimes represented as standing and ithy phallic figures (fig. 6: 7, 9). In some instances they are mounted on horseback (fig. 6: 11), on Bactrian camel (fig. 4: 17) or standing on foot and carrying a spear or bow. Some panels show males in hunting scene (fig. 6: 10-11), on the battlefield, or in pastures grazing their flocks. Not a single example of a human figure with distinctive garment or cloth- ing was distinguished in Jorbat. The prevailing "loop-headed" creatures, or the figures with "mushroom-shaped" headdress and a "ball-shaped" pouch attached at the waist, reported from most petroglyphic sites of Northern and Central Asia9 are totally absent in the complex. In addition to the anthropomorphic images, motifs related to human figures include images of feet/shoes and hands/ palms in Jorbat. Hand images are made with various tech- niques including deeply engraved silhouette, pecked and incised (fig. 7). Hand-prints have already been reported everywhere from several rock-art complexes on the Iranian Plateau such as Kuh-e Tanbour, Sirjan,10 Lakh Mazar, Birjand;11 Tiran and Posht Kouh-e Khansar, Isfahan; Kocheri valley of Golpayegan; Taymareh in Markazi province,12 and the pictographic complex of Eshkaft-e Ahou in Bastak, Hormuzgan13. Such hand-prints have also been found at the petroglyphic complex of Kalbak- Tash I, Altay14 rock carvings of Upper Indus valley15 and in the rock-paintings of Hazar Sum in Afghanistan16 in the sphere of Central Asia. Taking into account the presence of similar sten- ciled human hands in European Palaeolithic cave art,17 some researchers believe that hand-prints in the Iranian rock-art com- plexes are similarly loaded with certain symbolic meanings.18 Based on examination of production techniques, thickness of patina, and iconographical variations of handprints in the Jorbat complex, we may guess that the oldest images of hands can be ascribed to the protohistoric periods, possibly with (unknown) symbolic meaning. However, several examples (fig. 8) are asso- ciated with Arabic inscriptions ( Soltan Hussein , Hussien AS) and undoubtedly belong to the Middle to Late Islamic period, 6.

Here we have a good example of visual continuity but change of meaning of an image through the ages. Did the 'artists' of the Jorbat complex in the Islamic period understand hand-prints in the same way in which they were viewed by their prehistoric ancestors? Obviously not! In the same way, it is clear that the beliefs behind images from the ethnographic and historic periods can not necessarily be used as a basis for understanding (pre)historic rock art. c) Vegetal designs, usually in the form of trees, scrubs or bushes, are rare in the complex and always associated with zoomorphic images. d) Tools and war equipments are generally shown in com- positions and in association with human figures, but sometimes depicted separately as individual motifs. Most notable weapons are bow (fig. 6: 10), swords (fig. 6: 13), daggers, spears, arrow- heads (fig. 9: 8), shield (?), and even a gun (fig. 4: 25). Some cooking utensils, such as a caldron on a tripod/stool (fig. 6, 12), furniture, a pair of balances (scale), horse gear such as a horse- shoe? (fig. 9: 5) and decorations of a harnessing strap? (fig. 9: 3), two-wheeled carts (finished and unfinished, fig. 6: 15-16), and wheels with 5 and 9 spokes (fig. 9: 15-16) have also been recorded in the complex. Contrary to the abundance of wheels in the Jorbat complex, the representation of wheeled vehicles at this site is very rare; we identified only two examples on a single boulder. These are light, two-wheeled carts with spoked- wheels and a long draught pole extending from the basket of the cart (fig. 6: 15-16). The carts are shown without driver, and while a draught animal is in association with each cart, the ani- mal is not directly connected to the device by straps. If we consider the significance of the invention of wheeled vehicles in Bronze Age society and the changes it brought to transportation as well as hunting and military strategies, then the representation of wheeled vehicles at most Bronze Age petroglyphic sites is not surprising. For example, they have frequently been reported from various petroglyphic complexes Paléorient, vol. 37.2, p. 177-187 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 201 1</page><page sequence="7">A Preliminary Report on a newly discovered Petroglyphic Complex near Jorbat, the Plain of Jajarm, Northeastern Iran 183 Fig. 7 - Jorbat Petroglyphic complex.

VAHDATI e) Geometric designs (including signs and markings) con- stitute a large portion of images of Jorbat and include circles with inside cross, sometimes with markings. These markings include dots or tiny circles in each sector (fig. 9: 13-14), tri- angles and squares (fig. 9: 7), a bowtie-shaped sign (fig. 9: 6), cross-shaped patterns with end circles or three branches at the end of each arm (fig. 9: 1-2), and several other signs, some of which (fig. 9: 17-18) are possibly tamghas used as heraldic symbols by the nomadic nobility of the Middle Ages. Similar signs occur both on local Ilkhanid coinage of Jajarm and the nearby region of Isfarayen23 as well as on several petroglyphic complexes in the Upper Indus Valley such as Shatial Bridge and Thor North24 and many other sites in Central Asia. Geometric patterns have in some instances been used for indicating natu- ral features. In one panel, a row of isosceles triangles is pecked to show the mountain ranges. Among this category of images, circles with interior crosses are very widespread both in Iran25 and in Northern and Central Asia26 and are variously interpreted by different scholars as solar discs,27 wheels28 and unknown symbols. As for the large circles of Jorbat with interior markings in each sector (fig. 9: 11-14), we do not know exactly what they were intended for, but one may assume that they were possibly used to keep track of something. As for the cross-shaped patterns with end circles (fig. 9: 1-2), the author does not know any parallel in petroglyphic complexes of Iran or Central Asia, but a very similar pattern has been found on a stamp seal from Tepe Hissar29 and tenta- tively attributed to period III A (late third millennium BCE). We may guess that the cross-shaped pattern with end circles in Jorbat (fig. 9: 2) is in some ways linked with the pattern of stamp seal of Hissar, but we are unaware of its meaning. f) Persian/Arabic inscriptions including personal names, numeral-dates, poems in Persian or Arabic written in different times with various techniques and scripts. Most of the personal names mention local shepherds and hunters such as "Amirqoli Chopan, Gholam Chopan, Aman-allh Chopan, Shah Ali Sayyad " and other personalities like " Ziya-aldin Mohammad , Abdul Aziz, Mohammad ibn Hessarri " sometimes associated with dates including Senah 912, 885 A.H., etc. Time spent watching the grazing animals in the valley would have encour- aged shepherds and/or hunters of medieval times and later periods to engrave or imitate many of the images and inscrip- tions of the complex. Not a single example of Pahlavi or other pre-Islamic scripts was encountered in the complex. CHRONOLOGY AND STYLE Given the lack of evidence from archaeological excava- tions and the general dearth of publication on Iranian rock art, it is difficult to date many images of the petroglyphic site of Jorbat. However, a general examination of images at the com- plex of Jorbat reveals various styles and techniques that could be attributed to different chronological phases beginning from the Bronze Age up to the ethnographic period. Based on stylistic grounds, typological analysis, technique of production and comparison between degrees of patina in dateable panels with inscriptions and undated examples, we may assume that the oldest images of the complex are dated to Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages (2nd millennium BC). In search of settlement sites related to the petroglyphic complex, we conducted an archaeological survey in the area that resulted to the discovery of a Bronze and Iron Age site in the vicinity of the petroglyphic complex which locally known as Rafteh. It is located approximately 3 km to the east of rock-carvings of which we have collected a bagful of polished grey-black pottery similar to the Grey Ware of Gorgan Plain and a sort of plain fine greenish-buff ware (fig. 10: j, k) and a hand-modeled painted dark-brown or red on buff pottery (fig. 10: f, i) which resembles pottery of the late Namazga VI-Takhirbaj type (ca 1700-1400 BC) and the classic Yaz I painted ware (ca 1500- 1000 BC) in Central Asia. The presence of Central Asian Late Bronze (Namazga VI) and Early Iron Age (Yaz I) pottery in association with the Grey Ware of Gorgan in the plain of Jajarm and near the petro- glyphic complex of Jorbat is of outmost importance and obvi- ously shows that the area under question is a cultural frontier between Central Asia and the plateau of Iran and both the petroglyphic site and the settlement of Rafteh are interface sites in which both traditions of Central Asia and the plain of Gorgan/plateau of Iran exist.30 23.

As for the images of later periods in rock-carvings of Jorbat, taking into account the lack of pre-Islamic scripts at the com- plex, it is difficult to attribute any of the images of Jorbat to the historical period. However, some frontally depicted figures with a certain degree of patina (clearly older than the Medieval images), as well as the presence in the region of several his- torical sites, suggests the possibility of image-pecking at the complex in historical period. Medieval images of Jorbat are easily discernible not only by their matter and technique of execution, but also by their association with various Persian and Arabic scripts. CONCLUSIONS Recent archaeological surveys in Northeastern Iran have brought to light a number of petroglyphic sites such as Kouh-e Dokhtar of Reshm, Damghan,31 the complex of Jorbat, petro- glyphs of Qouch-Qala, Bojnord32 and rock carvings of the plain of Tous, Mashhad.33 However, a general examination of the petroglyphs of Northeastern Iran shows that the petro- glyphic complex of Jorbat is undoubtedly the richest of its kind throughout this region. In terms of style and quality of images, the complex of Jorbat represents a variety of images including both realistic and highly abstract figures produced by different techniques. While the majority of Bronze Age images are shown in sil- houette and in a realistic style, more recent images are usu- ally produced by pecking and incising techniques. In some instances of Bronze Age animal imagery, the arch of the horn or the curve of the body of a running animal is so acutely and naturally rendered that they emulate a realistic painting (fig. 4:13). In other cases, however, images are highly styl- ized and represented with simple lines, ignoring most of the pictorial details. Inspired by the nature of the region, the most common images of Jorbat are almost the same for all periods, depict- ing hunting, herding, and wild species, especially wild goat. Notwithstanding the fact that herding is clearly shown in several panels in Jorbat, the abundance in the petroglyphs of hunting scenes and wild caprids and bovids also affirm the importance of hunting economy in the early societies of the region. It can be postulated that the mountainous terrain to the north and west of Jorbat provided green pasture for flocks as well as the wild ruminants in ancient times. Finally, as referred to above, both pottery and petroglyphs of the region of Jorbat show a certain degree of similarity with Central Asian late Bronze and early Iron Ages tradi- tions. However, why is there not a single example of distinc- tive prehistoric or historic images of Central or Northern Asian petroglyphs - such as the figures with "mushroom-shaped" headdress, "loop-headed" creatures, figures with 'tail' or waist-pack and the "shamanic type images" - in Jorbat? If we accept the art of petroglyphs as 'ritual', then the lack of such distinctive images in Jorbat can perhaps be attributed to differ- ences in religious and symbolic systems of the ethnical groups who created these artistic complexes. suburb of the small town of Sankhast. In this site three different pottery tradition of Central plateau of Iran (Hissar I-II/Sialk III), Gorgan Plain (Caspian Black-on-Red as well as Gorgan Grey Ware Shah Tepe II-III) and Central Asia (grey ware of 3rd millennium and BMAC materials) can be found on the surface. 31.
