This book on meta- morphosis in myth reflects his expertise and has much erudition and acuteness to offer, both on the specific topic and more generally on key theoretical issues of interest to the student of myth. As B. explains in the preface, the book developed as a collection of stud- ies, largely papers given at conferences and as lectures. This composite origin is responsible for a certain rhapsodic quality, which has positive sides as well as The Classical Review vol. 61 no. 1 © The Classical Association 2011; all rights reserved</page><page sequence="2">24 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW weaknesses, and makes it appear at times a series of 'seminars on metamorphosis' rather than a monograph conceived as a unified whole. The book comprises an introduction plus ten chapters. The broader division into two sections, 'Narratives and their Contexts' (chapters 1-5) and 'The Logic of Transformation' (chapters 6-10), divides it into a historicising part, where the theme of metamorphosis is analysed within the frame of genre and historical period, and a more theoretical part, where thematic itineraries are followed. This distinction is however weakened by the array of theoretical ideas (sometimes only tangential to the main discussion) present in the first part and by the wealth of information on authors and individual texts within the second. It is the title of the book, Forms of Astonishment , that provides the best description of what underlies its components: B. is concerned with the sense of wonder, the thambos, that appears to accompany ancient stories of metamorphosis. The Introduction opens with a review of salient moments in the history of representations of metamorphosis: from Ovid and Apuleius to the body and mind opposition that characterises these myths, through the post-medieval world and non-European cultures, to reach metamorphosis in the modern age as an object of scientific discourse and presence in contemporary popular media. The Greek world is a specific case within this ocean of possible fields of enquiry. Among the pro- posed topics are the vocabulary of metamorphosis, the question of the relationship, for the Greeks, between such 'stories' and the perceptions of everyday life, and the link between metamorphosis and religion. What holds together the following chapters is declaredly not a hope for completeness but, again, a focus on 'aston- ishment' as a psychological, cultural and academic category. Metamorphosis can be defined as what brings astonishment to the onlooker, an astonishment scholars should still be able to experience. This introduction is full of interest, but it fails somehow to set a strong structure for what is to come. The five chapters in the first, contextualising section set out to address all genres relevant to this enquiry (Homer, drama, the visual arts, Hellenistic literature, post- Hellenistic texts). This division is useful, as a treatment of mythological themes cannot ignore generic and literary specifics; but perhaps more could have been said about why certain genres respond more than others to this particular mythological element and psychological category. Chapter 1 discusses the Odyssey at length, concentrating on Proteus and Circe. Especially valuable is the first section, in which B. departs from the representation of Athena as phene eidomene and source of thambos for the onlookers to discuss notions of anthropomorphism in Greek religion, and the slippery territory between metaphor, simile and metamorphosis in such instances. Though perhaps predictable, the brevity of B.'s treatment of the Iliad is disappointing (again, it would have been interesting to find a discussion of which aspects of the Iliadic text the near-absence of metamorphosis responds to). Chapter 2 moves to drama, focussing on the Bacchae , the extant tragedy in which metamorphosis plays the greatest role, as well as offering an overview of the Prometheus Bound , Sophocles' Tereus and Euripides' Hecuba , to conclude that tragedy strongly reaffirms a sense of the 'ultimate boundedness, integrity, and centrality of the human form' as opposed to comedy, explored in the following discussion of Birds. Chapter 3 is an instructive and rich journey into visual art and representations of metamorphosis, organised in three patterns: serial illustration, accomplished metamorphosis and hybrid. Chapter 4 is very informative on less well known Hellenistic texts such as the lost metamorphoses collections and narratives, as well as the Argonautica. This chapter and the next are especially diffuse in their</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 25 focus. Chapter 5 centres on post-Hellenistic material, with special attention to Greek authors after Ovid for whom metamorphosis was 'good to think with': Pausanias, Plutarch and Artemidorus in different ways exploit myths of metamorphosis to fulfil their own philosophical agendas. The second section, 'The Logic of Transformation', is partly organised around thematic clusters of myths. Chapter 6, 'Shapes of the Gods', considers the specif- ics of divine metamorphosis, its motivations and practice. Chapter 7 analyses the aetiological myths of metamorphosis into landscape, Chapter 8 metamorphosis into plants and trees. The last two chapters are very different in kind, and offer more theoretical observations. Chapter 9, 'Challenges to the Metamorphic Tradition', considers the point of view of philosophers from the Presocratics to Christian thinkers in their response to such myths and their metaphysical implications; the short final chapter, 'Final Thoughts on Contexts', connects back to Section 1 and aims to offer a conclusion to the whole collection. In these few pages the methodology of the book is again set out and advanced: the importance of context in interpretation, and especially in the interpretation of narratives characterised by thambos, which is a culture-relative category. Myths of metamorphosis all relate the irruption of the divine into the human world and are necessarily set at a remove from the ordinary, the believable, the e very-day; they were, and are, 'ways of articulating, and perhaps even partially coping with, the astonishing strangeness of life's outcomes'. This summary does not do justice to the variety of this study. But there are some problems. First, the variety of material means that sometimes points of interest are not pursued, and depth is sacrificed to variety. Just a few examples of important points made, or questions raised, which invited more discussion: the issue of the 'seriousness' of metamorphic myths, and the extent to which the Greeks 'believed' in their myth (p. 56, a propos Io's transformation in PV, and resurfacing later, but not within a coherent discussion on pp. 192 and 209; this is a crucial ques- tion, and not a new one); the criticism of the idea that metamorphosis should be a regressive fantasy in myth (p. 72, with reference to Aristophanic comedy) and assimilable to the already old-fashioned and debatable 'folk-tale' category (pp. 39^0); the 'motivational pluralism' that is said to characterise the whole of Greek mythology, a key point when discussing metamorphosis in particular, worth saying more about (p. 99); on p. 230, a general remark on how many metamorphic myths involving plants and elements of landscape may resonate in modern beliefs in a holistic model of the living world, which remains a suggestion. Secondly, there is a sense of unevenness in the 'density' of the argument, a shifting focus. Some topics are treated generally and broadly, some others in very close detail whose relevance is not always clear. For example, special attention is paid to iyevero and other terminology of transformation in the original Greek at pp. 111-12 in a discussion of Nicander's Heteroioumena and this text only, for no apparent reason. The same can be said about the engagement with previous literature, which sometimes takes the form of the querelle and lingers excessively over specific authors (e.g. Forbes-Irving, whose adequacy in treating the so-called 'shape-shifters', Proteus, Nereus and the like, is criticised at pp. 168-70). Finally, and as a consequence, there is a question of audience too: at times this book appears to be written with students in mind (summarising stories and introducing authors; reader-friendly abstracts at the beginning of each chapter, and between the two sections), but at other times scholars of myth seem to be the implicit audience (detailed doxography, some picking on individual scholarly</page><page sequence="4">26 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW discussions, e.g. pp. 216-17 on Onians, pp. 222-5 on two articles by Ribichini and Pittaluga). Notwithstanding these points of criticism, which arise from the format and genesis of the book, this is a very competent and fascinating work. Though one would hesitate to recommend it as an exhaustive monograph on the topic to replace its predecessors, it is a useful tool for anyone working on myths of metamorphosis and of great value for students of Greek myth more generally. It is beautifully produced, and the text is usefully complemented by images. The bibliography is very helpful, and so is the index (an indispensable tool for profitable use of a work of this type).
