<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tom Fitzgerald Butler Gallery, Kilkenny 4 November - 2 December 89 The thought provoking sculptural conundrums posed by Limerick sculptor, Tom Fitzgerald, offer a rare synthesis of multi-faceted ideas with a technical mastery of the chosen media. Twenty in- dividual pieces are included in the show, each one utilising elements of stone, wood and metal, plugged, bolted or lashed together, to create subtly plausible and often contradictory ar- rangements. Titles such as, Sweeny's Stele and Vessel for Molly Bloom, suggest associations with Irish mythology, whilst other references to primitive agricultural implements such as the plough in Apparatus No. 12, and the quern in Implement No. 3, point to connections with a Stone Age Celtic past. The title Apparatus, given to many of the works, hints at a further, mechanical aspect to their conception, and there is evidence of Fitzgerald's engineering ability not only in the finish- ed sculpture, but in the impressive group of preliminary sketches, or more precisely working drawings, which are included in the show. Each of the latter contains a diversity of annotated sket- ches, reminiscent of the inventive devices which appear at various stages of evolution in the notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci. These are larded with a mixture of literary quotations, philosophical aphorisms and inscriptions of personal memorabilia, which taken together offer an insight into the artist's ideological standpoint. One of these inscriptions states, " Even though materials of themselves do not possess content, I can see the potential for content within them", and such a Michelangelesque ability to free the potential image from the constrictions of its surroundings, lies at the heart of Fitzgerald's creative endeavour. In a piece entitl- ed, Temple for Molly Bloom No. 1, for example, the face of the Joycean heroine emerges from the back wall of a crumbling marble temple, etched in outline on the surface. Preliminary draw- ings indicate that Fitzgerald considered a free standing figure, in- dependent of the wall, before arriving at this more intimate fu- sion of the two. In a related piece, Temple for Molly Bloom No. 2, a woman's head is paralleled in a more traditional way, with the capital of an Ionic column. Fitzgerald carries the pun a stage further however by reversing the anthropomorphism, and substituting a further column for her ear. Like the Dadaist Duchamp, Fitzgerald is also concerned with the ambiguity of an object's identity, and this is demonstrated ingeniously through a number of works entitled, Implements. At first sight Implement No. 3 looks deceptively like a functional object, whose form has evolved over a long period of time, and whose intrinsic beauty is rooted in its fitness for purpose. Here the large grey limestone mortar and pestle calls to mind an an- cient Celtic quern. It has two eyelets at the top, through which a leather strap is threaded, girding the rim, whilst at the base, two shiny slate discs dangle from the leather thongs which secure the crucible to a rougher limestone base. These external appen- dages suggest a further parallel with an oriental ritual vessel, and remind us of the magical and religious significance attached to such objects in the past. On another level the artist probes the elusive relationship between art and design, art and artifact, beau- ty and utility, but in a perverse way; not 'form following func- tion" - the standard twentieth century design canon - but form suggesting what the function might be. A similar conflict of identity occurs in the case of Implement No. 6, which resembles a spade or hoe. Here a roughly triangular slate blade is affixed by a metal clasp to a dark wooden polished handle. It is suspended from the wall by a dirty, worn piece of cord, and the whole item looks like a well-used agricultural im- plement. Further inspection reveals disconcerting features however, such as a puzzling length of cord, connecting the han- dle to one extremity of the blade. The resulting paradox may be compared to the contradiction posed by the classic Dadaist object, such as Man Ray's Gift (a domestic flat iron with metal tacks brazed onto the face). Tom Fitzgerald, Apparatus No. 1 1 -Receptacle, 1986, Wood, limestone and lead, 1 28 x 1 08 x 38cms. "The need to project an apparent if obscure function will generate the formal logic behind each Implement sculpture This statement by the artist is fundamental both to an understanding of the above, and to Fitzgerald's work as a whole. The concept can perhaps be demonstrated most clearly in his Apparatus No. 10- Communicating Device, an absurd amalgamation of stone, wood and lead, whose limestone r√§chet wheel denies all prac- tical considerations of truth to materials, and yet whose carefully engineered appearance provides it with the convincing aura of mechanical authenticity. In a number of more recent works, such as Implement No. 15 - Claw, Fitzger.ald introduces a bio-mechanical metaphor. A curved, crowbar-shaped object, resembling the arm of a crab, has a pincer at one extremity, and a splayed metal end at the other. It is a clever pun paralleling the natural and man-made lever. In another instance, Apparatus No. 15- Tusk, a walrus's tusk echoes the projections from an anvil-like object; while in Ap- paratus No. 14- Sting, a steeltipped projection like a scorpion's tail, is attached to a stony torso which resembles a windlass. The" exotic, speckly-painted appearance of the tail, suggestive of some venomous insect or crustacean, contrasts strongly with the dull functionality of the machine, whose threat to society is of a dif- ferent order. The air of menace attached to the above piece is not at first</page><page sequence="2">35 so apparent in the small, lantern-like object, Shrine of the Cloud. Here a temple portico is symbolised by a pair of dark limestone columns, mounted on a corbel-bracket, capped by a vertical rec- tangular block. At first sight this piece conforms with the artist's other references to the ritualistic aspects of archaic art. Preliminary sketches suggest that the upper area of the shrine was intended to be shrouded in cloud, and an adjacent newspaper clipping referring to the anniversary of the nuclear attack on Hiroshima, implies that the cloud was atomic. In the event, Fitzgerald has chosen to indicate nuclear fall-out by a shower of metal arrows set into the surface of the object, and pointing downwards. Such overt contemporary reference is rare in Fitzgerald's work however, and on the whole he is concerned with the culture and the artifacts of the past. Even his machines look like cumbersome prototypes of a society still coming to terms with industrialisa- tion. Here I think one must be careful to differentiate between crass archaising, like the tendency to erect pseudo- Victorian street lamps, and a valid artistic concern with addressing one's cultural heritage. In his elusive puns and contradictions, Fitzgerald demonstrates the transforming power of art, not simply in an an- cient, ritualistic elevation of the object into art, but in a provocative Dadaist way. In his catalogue introduction, Paul O'Reilly compares Fitz- gerald's creative method to that of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein: "He assembles an assortment of body parts , collages them together and with the help of a stroke of lightning succeeds in creating his work of art". The result is more alluring than the monster of the Romantic imagination however; it is closer to the elusive object whose progenitors met by chance on a dissecting table in the early part of the century - Lautreamont's sewing machine and umbrella whose unlikely encounter epitomised for the Surrealist, the nature of beauty. What in the end stands out though is the organic unity and coherence of the work, linking Fitzgerald clearly to the quest of many Irish artists of this century: a search for artistic and cultural identity through a set of recurring and identifiable symbols, in this case the domestic implements of rural Ireland. Secondly, the technical assurance and evidence of craftsmanship evident in the construction of the work forges a link with the artistic criteria of the past, and re-opens the debate on the aesthetic relationship between art and craft. Fitzgerald shows that what imitates life can be art. Peter Jordan</page></plain_text>
