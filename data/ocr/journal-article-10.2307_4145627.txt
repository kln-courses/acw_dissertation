<plain_text><page sequence="1">390 REVIEWS ISSA J. BOULLATA (ed.): Literary structures of religious meaning in the Qur'Yn. 393 pp. Richmond, Surrey: Curzon, 2000. This volume, consisting of fifteen articles, impressively sets out to resolve the intricate interplay between literary structures of the Quran and religious meaning embedded in these structures. Not only is emphasis placed upon determining how fittingly literary devices project the religious dimension of the Quran's discourse, but the volume explores aesthetic perception of the holy text. The volume's editor, Issa Boullata, states that not all methods of literary criticism are encompassed in the various analyses and also asserts that issues relating to the historicity and canonical status of the Quran are not the concern of this work; however, it is evident that a number of the articles included in this collection have clear implications for the discussion of the Quran's textual integrity, as we shall see. The first section tackles form, meaning, and textual structure in the Quran, beginning with Sells' study of aural intertextuality in early Meccan revelation. This extends a concept that quranic chapters are not semantically sealed units, applying it to the realm of acoustics. Sells explains that sound functions as the principal instrument cogently conveying the 'spirit' of the text in all its religious connotations; and, correspondingly, that this spirit transcends the strictures of temporality perceived in scriptural language. Sells adds that while classical scholarship expounded upon the doctrine of the Quran's inimitability, scant attention was paid to the subtle interaction between sound and meaning. It must be said, however, that identifying the perceived effect of aural contingencies in these contexts remains a relatively subjective endeavour. Zahniser examines unity and coherence in Medinan chapters of the Quran. This chapter is concerned with characteristic coherence and cohesion underpinning the Quran's themes and meaning. The author reflects upon the concept of thematic coherence in the Quran as developed by figures such as Islahi, Mir and Robinson, circumscribing major transitions and borders in respect of themes of revelation as exemplified in two Medinan chapters: Q.2 and Q.4. The lack of thematic unity perfunctorily assumed of Medinan chapters is re-assessed: the suggestion is that a presumption of unity and coherence in an approach to the lengthy Medinan chapters might yield significant findings. McAuliffe explores the hermeneutic implications of the classical approach to the muhkam-mutashaibih designation of quranic verses with a view to 'constructing bridges between medieval commentaries and contemporary theories'. She presents a fascinating piece of research which skilfully charts the way in which this antithetical mechanism predicated approaches to exegesis of the Quran; correspondingly, she argues that it is pertinent to resort to intratextuality in the endeavour to unravel the language of scripture, especially the professedly ambiguous mutashabih~at and the religious imagery which such verses have the power 'to persuade, to influence, to transform'. It is intriguing to note that scholars who subscribed to the view that the Quran did comprise mutashabihat: verses whose import was unfathomable, implausibly proceeded to offer a plethora of exegetical expositions on the same verses. And thus in many ways a distinction in the designation of verses remained abstract. Welch's in-depth analysis of the formulaic features of the so-called punishment stories propounds the view that these stories were steadily</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 391 developed from a repository of 'key terms, phrases, and formulas'. He argues that the essentially oral nature of these stories along with their being consciously adapted with audience, time, and location in mind, indicates that the boundaries of scripture were seemingly fluid during the Prophet's own lifetime. Such a view does impinge upon the canonical status of the Quran, although Welch suggests that his conclusion 'is not inconsistent with statements in the Quran or with traditional Islamic teachings'. The last two articles in this part are by Rippin and Shahid: Rippin deals with quranic symbolism of personal responsibility as signified by the quranic expression: 'Desiring the face (wajh) of God'. The article places the quranic contribution to religious discourse on monotheism firmly within the confines of the Near East: the imagery conjured up by quranic dicta belongs to the ancient heritage of that region, although such imagery is further shaped by the theological tenets of the new faith. Shahid's contribution takes us back to the realm of mutashabihat. He pursues an intriguing hypothesis regarding the mysterious letters of the Quran (al-huruif al-muqatta'a) and their link with the doctrine of the Quran's inimitability. Shahid premises his argument on his exposition of Q.73. It is somewhat convoluted by his assertion that the Prophet's state of mind influenced the way these mysterious letters were perceived, which leads him to conclude that they were an intrinsic component of revelation, albeit in an unintelligible form. It would seem that such a hypothesis does not relate specifically to the meaningfulness and linguistic marvel of the letters per se, but rather to the supposed reasons for their so-called 'unintelligible' nature. The second section of this volume deals with literary approaches to selected chapters of the Quran. Neuwirth chooses to re-examine the canonization of the Quran with a view to exploring the implications of this process for the text itself. Reflecting upon the thesis of Wansbrough, along with the notion that the religious consciousness of a community looms large in the processes of canonization, Neuwirth examines the historical accounts of the emergence of a textus receptus ne varietur: the resultant 'heterogenous ensemble' and the fact that 'genuine text units had lost their literary integrity' could be used to reconstruct, or at least identify, the nucleus of scripture around which the text crystallizes; this, she suggests, could be resolved by applying self-referentiality and textuality; she uses Surat al-Hiijr to illustrate her postulate. The chapter seemingly exhibits 'organic growth out of a nucleus of preceding texts' and it intimates the emergence of a community. It must be said that just how one ascertains definitively the chronological precedence of the segments of revelation from which the core of the suira is putatively derived is critical to the whole thesis. Mir analyses the theme of irony in Skrat Yisuf as a literary device, and argues that an objective approach to the Quran as literature was effectively impeded by the classical doctrine on I'jiz al-Qur'an: this doctrine was anchored to a theological as opposed to a literary viewpoint, obscuring attempts to clarify the Quran's rhetorical beauty and achieve a greater understanding of its content. Having made the case for the ' organic coherence' of this chapter, the question is posed as to whether the device of irony is a stylistic instrument found in other chapters of the Quran. It is Stirat al-Furqan which forms the basis of Johns's literary 'exploration' of its dynamics and spirituality. He offers a perceptive study of the chapter, taking into account a classical appreciation of the aesthetic nature of the text through the discipline of balagha, highlighting, for example, the dramatic effect of grammatical shift and other rhetorical devices (intriguingly, Johns</page><page sequence="3">392 REVIEWS identifies a strong element of dramatic irony in the chapter). Indeed, also central to Johns's evaluation of the literary power of the chapter is Muqatil Ibn Sulayman's tafsTr which, along with the stra literature, pivotally supplies a framework for referencing verses of scripture. Johns believes that the chapter's reference points are interfaced with the entire quranic canon. The final contribution in this section returns to the theme of the aural dimension of scripture, complementing Sells' opening chapter. However, Hajjaji-Jarrah examines the enchantment of reading Szirat al-'Adiyat and reflects upon the rhetorical impact of the Quran as an 'auditory experience' and the sheer effectiveness of the powerful imagery created by this chapter's verses. She remarks that while early quranic revelation bore similarities in structure to the rhythmic prose or saj', it actually challenged conventions from both literary and theological standpoints: these were conventions revered by the Arabs. Hajjaji-Jarrah argues that it is the orchestration of the dynamics of sound which the suira employs with immense rhetorical effect. The final section of this volume takes literary appreciation of the Quran as its principal theme and begins with an article by Kermani assessing the aesthetic reception of the Quran, specifically during the Prophet's lifetime. Making a convincing point that fascination with and reverence for the holy text were axiomatic in early Muslim interpretations, Kermani argues that this has not been sufficiently reflected in recent academic studies. It is worth noting that much of the material Kermani adduces to illustrate the various arguments might be dismissed as emerging from the subjective processes of projection in salvation history; however, he argues that one needs to consider cultural factors which further substantiate the worth of this source material. Rahman investigates the phenomenon of ellipsis (hadhf) in the Quran, probing Ibn Qutayba's definition of this linguistic feature as exemplified in scripture. He also considers the relationship between hadhf and a developing theory of majaz, proffering an understanding of ellipsis in its early literary context and illustrating how Ibn Qutayba's analysis of hadhf was gradually worked into the texture of arguments on the Quran's inimitability. Rahman examines the importance of a literary device, which, in classical scholarship, distinguished the linguistic superiority of the quranic diction. Al-Sharif al-Radi's contributions to exegesis and the early development of literary approaches to the Quran are reviewed by Ayoub, who sketches the cultural milieu which influenced the theological and literary outlook of this figure. It is the exposition of metaphorical and figurative expressions of the Quran which forms the focus of this study: al-Sharif composed one of the first complete studies of metaphor in the Quran. Ayoub emphasizes the theological tenets which governed al-Sharif's literary analysis, particularly where metaphor is used to obviate the anthropomorphic imagery of scripture. The article also examines an extant volume of al-Sharif's seemingly extensive commentary of mutashabihdt verses entitled Haqa'iq al-ta'wfl ft mutashabih al-tanzfl. Al-Sharif al-Radi also features prominently in Abu-Deeb's discerning study of majaz and metaphorical language of the Quran. This chapter examines the literary theory of majaz as traced in the work of the early Basran philologist Abi 'Ubayda, concluding that in this early work majaz was not linked to a developed concept of metaphor. Abu-Deeb ponders the theological provenance of this term and then proceeds to assess al-Sharif's exposition of majaz and isti'ira as exemplified in both scripture and the prophetic traditions, reviewing his Talkhis al-baydn fJ majiz al-Qur'an and al-Majazat al-nabawiyya. The author astutely reveals how the concept of metaphor was applied by</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 393 al-Sharif to resolve the language of scripture from both literary and theological perspectives. Abu-Deeb countenances the view that an adherence to linguistic conventions established by generations of scholars hindered attempts to harness the potential of' inventiveness and creativity' inherent in the language of the Quran. The final contribution to this volume is by its editor, Boullata, who assesses Sayyid Qutb's literary appreciation of the Quran as outlined in two of his works, al-TaswTr al-fannT f'l-Qur'an and FT zildl al-Qur'an. Boullata probes Qutb's efforts to identify rhetorical devices crucial in prefiguring the spirituality of the Quran's message. Recalling Qutb's dissatisfaction with classical attempts to sense the real compass of the Quran's artistic beauty (the notion here is that i'jaz discussions had seemingly impaired the focus of classical scholarship-this is an argument raised in several of the articles in this volume), Boullata introduces a number of literary devices recognized by Qutb as instruments which convey religious motifs in a vivid and imaginative way. It was this linguistic artistry which was an attraction to the early Arabs; and, examining the language of the Quran through such literary devices and features, it is suggested that the unity and coherence of the text become all the more apparent. It is commendable that the typographical errors are minimal: defintion p. 59; und p. 155. The volume represents a valuable contribution to quranic studies. The accentuation of the critical function of the Quran's literary elements reveals just how effectively literary components projected theological, exegetical, and historical dimensions of the text. Moreover, this selection of articles allows an appreciation of the extent to which the linguistic features and conventions of the Quran inexorably influenced classical Islamic scholarship.
