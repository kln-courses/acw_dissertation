<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ethnobiology and the evolution of the human mind Steven Mithen University of Reading An evolutionary perspective on human thought and behaviour indicates that we should expect to find universal systems of perception, classification, and decision-making regarding the natural world. It is the interaction between these evolved aspects of the human mind, the biodiversity of the natural world, and unique historical, social, and economic contexts within which individuals develop and act that gives rise to cultural diversity. The palaeoanthropological record also indicates that language is a recently evolved phenomenon. This suggests that linguistic approaches in ethnobiology are likely to provide only a partial understanding of how humans perceive, classify, and engage with the natural world. Palaeoanthropologists concerned with human evolution have a cgive and take' rela? tionship with ethnobiology as defined by Roy Ellen (this volume): 'the study of how people of all, and of any, cultural tradition interpret, conceptualize, represent, cope with, utilize, and generally manage their knowledge of those domains of environmen? tal experience which encompass living organisms, and whose scientific study we demarcate as botany, zoology, and ecology'. With regard to 'take', palaeoanthropolo? gists need to draw on the theories and findings of ethnobiology to facilitate the inter? pretation of animal and plant remains recovered from archaeological sites. Such interpretations require inferences about past decision-making, such as about which animals to hunt or which seeds to sow, and hence issues of environmental perception and classification are paramount. These are, of course, difficult if not impossible for palaeoanthropologists to address in an entirely satisfactory manner. Nevertheless, a minimum requirement is that palaeoanthropologists are conversant with relevant issues in ethnobiology and draw on these - as far as is possible - to make informed interpretations of the animal bones and plant remains that they excavate. Making such informed interpretations is quite different from imposing ill-considered ethnographic analogies onto the past, as David Harris illustrates in his paper in this volume. With regard to 'give', palaeoanthropologists need to inform ethnobiologists about the impli? cations of the fossil and artefactual record for the evolution of human mentality, and hence what type of perceptual, classificatory, and decision-making processes we should /.

My concern in this paper is with giving rather than taking. After providing a brief resume of human evolution, I will consider a selection of issues that suggest the likely existence of universal cognitive systems for engaging with the natural world and the significance of non-linguistic approaches in ethnobiology. The fossil and archaeological record for human evolution Human cognition shares a great many features with that of not only other primates but also other mammals in general. My concern, however, is with those features that are distinctively human - those that distinguish us from our closest living relative, the chimpanzee. It was between six and eight million years ago when the Pan and Homo lineages diverged from a common ancestor, with the latter having a single extant species, H. sapiens. Although the fossil record becomes richer year by year, and occa? sionally throws up a surprise such as the discovery of the claimed new species Homo floresiensis in 2003 (Brown et al. 2004), the basic outline of human evolution within the Homo lineage is unlikely to be substantially altered by new discoveries, especially as it is increasingly supported by evolutionary genetics (Jobling, Hurles 8c Tyler- Smith 2004). In essence, there were numerous species of bipedal primate in Africa between six and two million years ago. The fossilized remains display considerable morphological variation, which suggests the past exploitation of a variety of specific niches within the African landscape (Johansen 8c Edgar 1996; Lewin 8c Foley 2003). The hominins have been classified according to three genera, Ardipithecus, Australopithecus, and Homo, with the latter constituted by two purported species, H. habilis and H. rudolfensis. Flaked stone tools are known from at least 2.5 million years ago (Schick 8c Toth 1993), but in the light of the repertoire of tools used by chimpanzees (Whiten et al. 1999) it seems likely that hammer stones, sticks, leaves, and other minimally modified materi? als were used long before flaked stone artefacts appeared. The two species of early Homo prior to 1.8 million years ago are characterized by relatively small teeth and flat faces, along with larger brains than the other hominins, reaching up to 750 cc rather than the 450 cc which is also characteristic of chimpanzees today (Wood 1992). Such brain sizes may be within the range of varia? tion for this grade of hominin without necessarily indicating newly evolved cognitive or linguistic abilities. The key problem we face when assessing the significance of brain size is the rarity of the post-cranial skeletons for the earliest Homo, which might indicate that the relatively large brains are simply a product of large body size rather than encephalization. Indeed, a case has been made for reclassifying H. habilis and H. rudolfensis as australopithecines, and for identifying H. ergaster, appearing by 1.8 million years ago, as the first member of the Homo genus (Wood 8c Collard 1999)- H. ergaster may mark an evolutionary transition to a type of hominin for which behavioural analogies with living non-human primates are of limited value. With a near-fully modern stature and bipedal gait, this species is most likely the first to have dispersed out of Africa (Straus 8c Bar-Yosef 2001). Brain size reached up to 900 cc, although some specimens show the maintenance of relatively small brain capacities - those from the site of Dmanisi in Georgia, for example, are no more than 650 cc (Gabunia et al 2000). The Asian lineage of this species evolved into Homo erectus and /. Roy Anthrop. Inst. (N.S.), S45-S61 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="3">Steven Mithen S47 may have made at least one water crossing, to reach Flores Island by 850,000 years ago (Morwood, O'Sullivan, Aziz &amp; Raza 1998). In Europe, the middle Pleistocene is marked by a succession of hominins that are claimed to constitute at least three species: H. antecessor, H. heidelbergensis, and H. neanderthalenis. These appear to show relative stability in brain size until c.600,000 years ago, after which there was rapid encephalization until a capacity equivalent to, and in some cases exceeding, that of Homo sapiens is attained in the late Pleistocene, 1,200-1,750 cc (Ruff, Trinkaus &amp; Holliday 1997). Stone artefacts appear to increase in technological complexity from Oldowan-like flakes associated with H. antecessor, Acheulian handaxes with H. heidelbergensis, and levallois technology with H. nean- derthalensis. Examples of bone and wooden tools are exceedingly rare, but the discov? ery of the Schoningen spears (Thieme 1997) indicates that this is most likely a consequence of preservation and discovery. Traces of structures and non-utilitarian artefacts are effectively absent (Gamble 1999), with the few ambiguous examples that exist merely serving to emphasize their extreme rarity and unsophisticated nature. The hominin species of Europe may form a single evolving lineage or mutliple dis- persals into that continent of species that evolved in Africa. Within Africa there is evo? lutionary continuity from H. ergaster to H. sapiens (McBrearty &amp; Brooks 2000), with the earliest specimens of the latter dating to c.200,000 years ago (McDougall, Brown &amp; Fleagle 2005; White et al. 2003), a date that effectively coincides with an estimate for the origin of H. sapiens from the study of modern-day genetic diversity (Ingman, Kaess- mann, Paabo &amp; Gyllensten 2000; Jobling, Hurles 8c Tyler-Smith 2004). While H. sapiens specimens in Israel indicate initial dispersal out of Africa around 100,000 years ago (Lahr &amp; Foley 1994), the genetic evidence indicates that it was after 60,000 years ago that major dispersals into Asia and Europe occurred, and that it was these that gave rise to the extant populations today (Ingman, Kaessmann, Paabo 8c Gyllensten 2000). Immediately prior to such dispersals we find evidence in South Africa for new types of material culture, often assumed to reflect the appearance of symbolic thought and language. Most notable are the incised ochre nodules and shell beads from Blombos Cave dating to 70,000 years ago (Henshilwood et al. 2002; Henshilwood, d'Errico, Vanhaeren, van Niekerk &amp; Jacobs 2004), while red ochre is prevalent in Middle Stone Age deposits at South African sites reaching back to 100,000 years ago (Knight, Powers &amp;Wattsi995). The dispersals of H. sapiens out of Africa resulted in the colonization of Australia by at least 30,000 years ago, most probably between 40,000 and 45,000 years ago (O'Connell 8c Allen 2004), and that of Europe by 40,000 years ago (Mellars 2004). The latter is associated with major technological innovations characterized by the Auri- gnacian culture. The Neanderthals may have attempted to imitate the culture of the incoming H. sapiens, although d'Errico and colleagues argue that the Neanderthals independently invented the Upper Palaeolithic-type features of the Chatelperronian industry (d'Errico, Zilhao, Julian, Baffier 8c Pelegrin, 1998). The Neanderthals were either out-competed for resources or were unable to survive the major climatic fluc- tuations of the late Pleistocene (d'Errico 8c Sanchez Goni 2003; Stringer, Barton 8c Finlayson 2000). By 30,000 years ago, the H. sapiens in Europe were engaging in cave painting, carving intricate bone figurines, and making elaborately decorated burials (Gamble 1999). Similarly, the H. sapiens in Australia and Africa were likely to be engaged in both abstract and figurative rock art at this date (Mulvaney 8c Kamminga 1999). /. Roy. Anthrop. Inst. (N.S.), S45-S61 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="4">S48 Steven Mithen The Neanderthals became extinct soon after 30,000 years ago. Precisely when H. erectus in Asia became extinct remains unclear; a similar date to that of the Nean? derthals is likely, although the claimed species H. floresiensis may have survived on Flores island until as late as 14,000 years ago (Morwood et al. 2004). The climatic dete- rioration ofthe last glacial maximum of 20,000 years ago caused H. sapiens to abandon northern landscapes that became polar desert, and those areas in low latitudes that became extremely arid. As global warming began at c.15,000 years ago, H. sapiens re- colonized these landscapes and proceeded to colonize the rest of the world either in the late Pleistocene or early Holocene - the far north, the Americas, and the islands of the Pacific (Mithen 2003). It was only in the Holocene, beginning a mere 11,600 years ago, that agricultural economies developed, initially in the Near East at c.9,000 years ago and then quite independently at several locations elsewhere in the world - including rice farming in China at c.7,000 years ago, that of maize and squash in Central America at c. 6,000 years ago, and domesticated camelids (llamas and alpacas) in the Peruvian Andes by c.5,000 years ago (Mithen 2003; Smith 1995). Farming provided the economic foundation for the development of towns and within a few thousand years the first 'civilizations', within which writing was independently invented. It is within this span of human evolution that I have so briefly summarized that the distinctive properties of the human mind evolved. That evolutionary history has not only provided the potential for the astonishing cultural diversity that we find within the world today, and perhaps even more so in the recent past, but also imposes constraints on the character of thought and behaviour. Understanding both the potential and the constraints is crucial for the development of culturally informed biological knowledge and practices, and suggests that some approaches may be more fruitful than others. In this regard, I will now consider a suite of selected issues from the evolutionary history of humankind that appear especially relevant to ethnobiology. The paradox of genetic unity and cultural diversity A decade ago palaeoanthropologists were debating whether Homo sapiens had a recent African origin or was the product of multi-regional evolution. The accumulation of fossil, archaeological, and genetic evidence has conclusively demonstrated the former to be correct (Jobling, Hurles 8c Tyler-Smith 2004), although this does not preclude inter-breeding between Homo sapiens dispersing from Africa and other species of Homo in Eurasia. The recent origin of Homo sapiens has emphasized the human paradox of an extraordinary degree of cultural diversity underlain by a relatively limited extent of genetic variation. Human genetic diversity is indeed highly con- strained, with significantly greater differences between chimpanzees separated by a few kilometres in Africa than between humans living at the opposite ends of the earth and engaged in quite different lifestyles (Jobling, Hurles 8c Tyler-Smith 2004). The need to reconcile genetic similarity and cultural diversity requires a cognitive anthropology, one that is concerned with how observed behaviour is a product of the interaction between universal properties of the human mind and the unique environ? mental, cultural, and historical settings within which individuals are located (Mithen 1990). Hence ethnobiologists should be immediately biased towards expecting under- lying commonalities in the classification systems of the natural world, which will have various cultural manifestations. /.

Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="5">Steven Mithen S49 Mental modularity and the evolution ofthe mind Throughout our evolutionary history, not just that which I have briefly summarized above but that which extends into far more distant times, our ancestors have had to acquire information and make decisions about the natural world for their survival and reproduction. The principles of natural selection suggest that those individuals who were more able to acquire relevant information and process such information in the most effective manner would have gained reproductive success. In many species, the relevant information for exploiting a very specific niche has simply been encoded within the animal itself through natural selection, so there is effectively no process of learning involved. Our hominin ancestors were, however, generalists and lived in highly variable spatial and temporal environments (deMenocal 1995). Rather than having spe? cific responses to environmental stimuli encoded into their genome, natural selection has provided learning and decision rules to enable behavioural flexibility. The extent to which such rules are of a general-purpose nature and limited in number - such as associative or conditional learning - or numerous and specialized for particular domains of activity, has been a key topic of debate in evolutionary psychology (Carruthers 8c Chamberlain 2000; Mithen 1996; Samuels 1998). While the latter has been favoured by those who argue from first principles of natural selection (e.g. Cosmides 8c Tooby 1994; Pinker 1997), the former appears more in accord with our observances of our closest relative, the chimpanzee, which appears adept at a wide range of activities and able readily to learn new tasks, such as use of computer key- boards (Byrne 1996a). Chimpanzees, however, have relatively small brains with respect to not only modern humans but also the hominins ofthe Middle and Later Pleistocene. They are, therefore, relatively uninformative about the evolution of a specifically human type of intelligence. My own view is that some degree of mental modularity arose during the course of human cognitive evolution that included learning and decision rules tailored by natural selection to interact with the natural world (Mithen 1990; 1996). One key feature of such rules would have been a means of classifying the natural world so as to reduce the information that requires processing when making decisions. Humphrey eloquently summarizes why classification is important: In order to be effective agents in the natural world, animals require the guidance of a 'world model', an internal representation of what the world is like and how it works. This model enables them to predict in advance the characteristics of'recognisable' objects, to anticipate the likely course of events in the environment, and to plan their behaviour accordingly. The role of classification in this context is to help organise sensory experience and to introduce an essential economy into the description of the world. An effective classification system is one which divides up objects in the world into discrete categories according to criteria which make an object's membership of any particular class a relevant datum for guiding behaviour: the objects in any one class may differ in detail but they should share some essential features which give them a common significance for the animal. Such a classification system will reduce the 'thought load' on the animal, expedite new learning, and allow rapid and effi- cient extrapolation from one set of circumstances to another (1984:126-7). A critical time period for the evolution of classificatory systems and other mental modules relating to the natural world in Homo is the Plio-Pleistocene, when the archaeological record indicates significant increases in meat-eating and tool produc? tion (Isaac 1983; 1989; Potts 1988). These behavioural developments are associated with increased brain size, changing dentition, and bipedalism (Aiello 1996; Aiello 8c Wheeler /. Roy. Anthrop. Inst. (N.S.), S45-S61 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="6">S50 Steven Mithen 1995; Wheeler 1991). Identifying cause and effect is difficult, but such anatomical and behavioural developments appear to arise as a package with strong feedback loops and are ultimately related to the change from a forest to a woodland savannah landscape. They appear to culminate in the appearance of Homo ergaster, which some anthro? pologists would designate as the first member of our genus (Wood 8c Collard 1999)- 'Social brain' or 'ecological brain'? Dunbar (1996; 2004) has argued that the expansion of the brain during not only the Plio-Pleistocene but the whole of human evolution relates to the development of a specifically social intelligence, characterizing this theory as the 'social brain hypothe? sis'. His claim is based on a correlation between group size and brain size (as measured by neo-cortex ratio) among extant primates and the absence of any clear association between brain size and foraging behaviour (Aiello 8c Dunbar 1993; Dunbar 1993)- Measures of social complexity in terms of instances of 'deceptive' behaviour also suggest a correlation with brain size (Byrne 1996b) and hence may support the view that encephalization is primarily related to the development of a social intelligence, although this does not necessarily rule out general-purpose abilities. The key feature of social intelligence that Dunbar's work promotes is that of'theory of mind' - the ability to understand that other individuals may have beliefs and desires that are different to one's own, although the definitions and cognitive interpretations of'theory of mind' are complex (Carruthers 8c Smith 1996). One characterization of theory of mind is in terms of'orders of intentionality': if I know what I think, then I am termed as having a single order of intentionality; if I know what someone else thinks, then I have two orders of intentionality; if I know what someone else thinks that a third partly thinks, then I have a third order of intentionality - and so forth. Whereas humans routinely use three or four orders of intentionality in their social life, apes might be limited to two orders at most (Dunbar 2004). Whether chimpanzees have such cognitive abilities remains unclear in spite of a vast quantity of theoretical debate, experimental studies, and field observations devoted or contributing to this issue (e.g. Byrne 8c Whiten 1988; 1992; Povinelli 1993; 1999)- The latest research suggests that some features of theory of mind/multiple orders of inten? tionality may well be present in the chimpanzee mind (Tomasello, Call 8c Hare 2003). Nevertheless, it is unquestionably the case that these are significantly more evolved within the Homo lineage, which partly accounts for the social complexity of our species and is most likely related to the evolution of language (Dunbar 1998; Mithen 1999). There are, however, three key problems with the 'social brain' hypothesis. First, while a correlation between brain and group size may hold within extant primates that have brain sizes up to c.400 cc (although there is some doubt as to whether this is indeed the case - Steele 1996), there is little justification for extrapolating this relationship to the much larger-brained hominins with brain sizes up to 1,750 cc. Even if the initial phase of brain expansion at around two million years ago can be accounted for by the evolution of a social intelligence, there is no reason why the same should apply to the more pronounced period of brain expansion after 600,000 years ago. Second, it seems unlikely that the addition of further levels of intentionality necessarily requires signif? icantly more brain matter: to go from first to second and then to third levels of inten? tionality simply requires a recursive loop so that the same cognitive mechanism, presumably some type of neural network, is repeatedly used. Third, it is not only in their social relationships that modern humans and extinct hominins are/were quite /. Roy. Anthrop. Inst. (N.S.), S45-S61 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="7">Steven Mithen S51 different to living primates: foraging and tool-making are also considerably more complex and are likely to have required the evolution of additional neural networks and hence the expansion of the brain. In the light of these weakness with the 'social brain' hypothesis, it seems more plau? sible to explain the expansion of the human brain as reflecting the development not of a specifically social intelligence but either of multiple intelligences, with each relat? ing to a particular domain of behaviour, or simply of a general-purpose intelligence. The latter appears unlikely in light of the evidence for multiple intelligences/cognitive domains in the modern human mind (e.g. Gardner 1983; 1993; Hirschfeld 8c Gelman 1994) and the arguments for mental modularity from the principles of natural selec? tion (Cosmides 8c Tooby 1994; Pinker 1997). In place of a single general-purpose intelligence, I have proposed elsewhere (Mithen 1996) that there were three isolated cognitive domains in the minds of large brain hominins (i.e. post-Homo habilis) that I described as social, technical, and natural history intelligences, with each being con- stituted by a bundle of interacting mental modules. Our interest here is with natural history intelligence, which might also be charac? terized as 'intuitive biology'. By this I mean stores of information about the natural world, methods of acquiring further information, and methods of processing infor? mation that had become embedded within the hominin genome and did not require learning and/or cultural transmission to acquire. Moreover, these were dedicated to the natural world and quite different to the stores of information and processing methods that were dedicated to interacting with other individuals or manufactur- ing artefacts. Such intuitive biology would have provided hominins with the type of expert folk-botanical and folk-zoological knowledge that is characteristic of recent hunter- gatherers. Here I am particularly thinking about their ability to infer information about animals and plants from signs such as tracks, scats, noises, smells, and broken vegeta- tion (e.g. see Gubser 1965:121, 221-2, 230; Hill 8c Hawkes 1983; Lee 1979: 212-13; Nelson 1973; 1983; Sullivan 1942: 44, 67, for a selection of accounts, and Mithen 1990: chap. 3 for a collation of ethnographic evidence). Of equal interest is the ability to use the sight of one animal or plant, or a change in its behaviour, to inform about future events, as illustrated most effectively by the so-called 'calendar plants' used by the Groote Eylandt islanders (Levitt 1981). As Blurton-Jones and Konner (1976) demonstrated by their study of the !Kung, the knowledge gained by these methods can be at least as accurate in terms of predicting animal whereabouts as that derived from the behavioural ecology of Western scientists. We must, however, make a distinction here between this type of ecological knowl? edge and the use of anthropomorphism. Modern hunter-gatherers make extensive use of the latter, effectively attributing human-like minds to animals, and this can also provide effective predictors of behaviour (e.g. see Gubser 1965; Marks 1976; Silberbauer 1981). More generally they use social knowledge to make sense of the natural world, while also engaging in the converse - natural history knowledge to make sense of the social world - in terms of totemism. Indeed, Kennedy (1992) argues that human beings in general are prone to a compulsive anthropomorphizing, and with modern hunter- gatherers the social and natural worlds appear to have no boundaries. I have argued that this 'cognitive fluidity' has arisen in relatively recent times and is a consequence ofthe evolution of compositional language (Mithen 1996; 2005). Consequently for pre- modern hominins I would expect a natural history intelligence and a social intelligence /. Roy. Anthrop. Inst. (N.S.), S45-S61 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="8">S52 Steven Mithen that are effectively isolated from each other: the natural and social worlds were two distinct entities. Evidence from archaeology, developmental psychology and anthropology The key archaeological evidence to support the proposition of a discrete natural history intelligence (or intuitive biology) evolving relatively early in human evolution is the extraordinary diversity of environments and hence foraging strategies that were adopted by hominins. This is especially the case for those after two million years ago when dispersal - or most likely multiple dispersals - into Eurasia occurred (Straus 8c Bar-Yosef 2001). This was also a period of substantial environmental fluctuation, not just in terms of the major climatic alterations between glacial and inter-glacial stages, but also at a much finer level of temporal resolution. The evidence from the earliest sites outside of Africa, such as Dmanisi in Georgia (1.7 mya), Ubediya in Israel (1.5 mya) and Atapuerca in Europe (0.8 mya), indicates that the earliest dispersals occurred with an Oldowan-like technology effectively the same as had been used since 2.5 million years ago in Africa. The earliest dispersals were not, therefore, driven by technological advancement. While both constraints and opportunities would have arisen from the particular nature of Pleistocene environ? mental history (Mithen 8c Reed 2002), it seems likely that such dispersals were partly a product of new cognitive capacities within the mind of Homo ergaster. These are unlikely to have related to language in the sense that we would ordinarily understand it (Mithen 2005, and see below) and most likely related to enhanced natural history intelligence enabling rapid learning about, and effective decision-making in, new environments. Those individuals who were more able to make effective decisions about which resources to exploit would have gained reproductive advantage. If we follow the logic of evolutionary psychology, this would have been those individuals who had evolved learning and decision mechanisms for extracting the most relevant information from the natural world and then processing it in the most appropriate manner to make deci? sions that enhanced survival and reproduction. The character of those decisions would have been dependent upon the particular context of the individuals: in some cases it may have been those which maximized energetic efficiency, in others those which min- imized risk of predation. Indeed, those individuals who were able to make (meta-)deci- sions about their decision-making process would have gained the most reproductive advantage. Homo ergaster was an ancestor of Homo sapiens. Two lines of evidence from the modern day indicate that an evolved natural history intelligence/intuitive biology was inherited by H. sapiens, and most likely further evolved within the post-R ergaster lineage of this species. Studies by Keil (1989; 1994), Carey (1985; Carey 8c Spelke 1994) and Atran (1990; 1994) indicate that children are born with an innate understanding of the differences between living things and inanimate objects. Keil's work has shown that very young children have a propensity to attribute an essence to different types of living things and to recognize that a change in manifest appearance does not neces? sarily reflect a change in kind. Complementing this evidence from the study of infants is that of anthroplogy in general and ethnobiology in particular. First we can note the apparent propensity to simply observe, discuss, and classify the natural world found amongst people living 'traditional' lifestyles, as I have reviewed for hunter-gatherers elsewhere (Mithen 1990). /. Roy. Anthrop. Inst. (N.S.), S45-S61 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="9">Steven Mithen S53 This, of course, may not be surprising as their livelihoods are dependent upon such knowledge. But what is even more striking is the ease with which this knowledge is acquired and culturally transmitted - human minds appear to be pre-tuned for acquir- ing and processing information about animals and plants such that virtually no active teaching is required (Atran 1990; 1994). Formal training appears to be generally rare among hunter-gatherer societies. When it is reported, it tends to be found within North American groups (e.g. Birket-Smith 8c De Laguna 1938:162; Gubser 1965:109; Ray 1963:106; Tanner 1979: 44). More often, the reference in ethnographies to formal training is a remark that it is lacking. For instance Goodale (1971: 37) stressed the minimal instruction given to young Tiwi for? agers. That which is found relates to the use of specific tools such as fish spears. Simi? larly, the lack of formal education among the !Kung has been emphasized frequently (e.g. Biesele 1976: 307; Blurton-Jones 8c Konner 1976: 338-9; Draper 1976: 211-12; Lee 1979: 236; Marshall 1976: 95-6). That which does exist again relates to very specific activ? ities such as stalking and tracking and does not occur until adolescence. Education via informal teaching using story-telling and song appears to be much more common, although it tends not to be directed towards any specific activity. The importance of learning fron one's own experience and experiment is frequently remarked upon (e.g. Goodale 1971: 40; Gubser 1965: 220; Hassrick 1964: 318-19; Lee 1979: 707-8; Tanner 1979: 44). This appears to be closely related to the observation and mimicry of adults (Blurton-Jones 8c Konner 1976: 339; Hassrick 1964: 318-19). In addition to the evidence from infant development and ethnographic observa? tions regarding knowledge acquisition, a third source of evidence - and perhaps of most significance - is the universally shared principles of ethnobiological classifica? tion: when humans are seen in evolutionary perspective we should not be at all sur- prised that 'there are unmistakable cross-cultural regularities in the structure of folkbiological classification' (Atran 1994: 17; see also Berlin in this volume). Berlin (1992), more specifically, has argued that all cultures utilize a common five-tiered 'taxonomic' hierarchy for classifying plants and animals: kingdom, life-form, inter? mediate, generic, and specific. This results in cultural diversity owing to the engage? ment between such universally held principles of classification, the biodiversity of the natural world, and the historical contexts of human communities. As noted above, effective classification is one of the keys to rapid and effective learn? ing. Those hominin individuals who had to begin classifying from scratch the animals and plants in a new habitat they entered, either via their own dispersal or owing to environmental change, would have been at a severe disadvantage compared to those who had an existing intuitive scheme with which to classify the natural world. The latter would have been able to adapt more rapidly by making more effective foraging decisions. From this evolutionary perspective, we should not be surprised at Berlin's findings and be sympathetic to his interpretation of these as deriving from universally shared principles of ethnobiological classification. Non-linguistic understandings of the natural world The adoption of an evolutionary perspective on the human mind questions the priority that has been given to linguistic approaches in ethnobiology, especially those that involve transcribing spoken words of non-literate cultures into written text for an academic readership. As Roy Ellen describes in his introductory essay to this volume, 'Not only is the written word often inadequate to grasp the precise way in which local /. Roy. Anthrop. Inst. (N.S.), S45-S61 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="10">S54 Steven Mithen peoples perceive their environment, but the vocal and verbal dimension itself is insufficient'. The majority of palaeoanthropologists agree that language as we understand it is a relatively recent means of communication in human evolution, most likely restricted to Homo sapiens and appearing less than 200,000 years ago. By 'language as we under? stand it' I mean a primarily vocal means of communication that can create a poten? tially infinite number of utterances from a finite set of words and by using a suite of grammatical rules. The argument for a recent and single origin of language is based on evidence from the archaeological rather than fossil record. The latter suggests that the vocal and aural apparatus for language was present within pre-modern species, such as Homo heidel- bergensis and Homo neanderthalensis (Arensburg, Schepartz, Tillier, Vandermeersch 8c Rak 1989; Kay, Cartmill 8c Balow 1998; MacLarnon 8c Hewitt 1999; Martinez et al. 2004), while the large brains of these species suggest that sufficient neural capacity was present for language. However, the absence of symbolic behaviour and the immense cultural stability of these species suggests that they lacked a linguistic capacity of the kind that would drive creative thought and cultural change (Carruthers 2002; Mithen 1996; 2005). Proto-language of pre-modern humans Palaeoanthropologists refer to the communication systems of pre-linguistic hominins as 'proto-language'. Views of proto-language range from utterances composed from a limited number of words and lacking any grammatical structure (Bickerton 1996), via utterances that make use of 'proto-grammatical rules' such as 'agent first' (Jackendoff 1999)&gt; to notions of holistic utterances - multi-syllabic phrases with fixed meanings but which were not composed from discrete words (Wray 1998). As we are dealing with at least two million years of human evolution and multiple species and lineages, it is most likely that various forms of proto-language evolved, with that of the earliest hominins being similar to the vocalizations ofthe African apes today (Mithen 2005). The critical argument for this paper is that hominins using proto-language were evidently effective at classifying the natural world, acquiring information about animals and plants, and then making behavioural decisions by the use of dedicated mental modules, as described above. Had they not been able to do so, we would not find evidence for the dispersal out of Africa soon after two million years ago and the successful exploitation of diverse environments. The implication is that perceptual, classificatory, and decision-making systems are not dependent upon language; hence by prioritizing linguistic approaches to ethnobiology, we may be restricting our under? standing of how humans perceive, understand, and communicate about the natural world. The Neanderthals are likely to have been non-linguistic hominins that had a pro- found understanding of the natural world - whether or not one wishes to attribute them with a discrete natural history intelligence (cf. Mithen 1996). They lived in Europe and the Near East between c.250,000 and 28,000 years ago, surviving through the severe climatic fluctuations of the late Pleistocene prior to their extinction. They were big game hunters using stone-tipped spears but their technology appears extremely limited in comparison to that of the Homo sapiens that post-dated them in Europe during the so-called 'Upper Palaeolithic' (Mellars 1996; Stringer 8c Gamble 1983). The relatively unsophisticated character of Neanderthal technology suggests that they /. Roy Anthrop. Inst. (N.S.), S45-S61 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="11">Steven Mithen S55 were more dependent than are modern humans not only upon physiological adapta? tions to glacial environments but also upon natural history intelligence to make for? aging decisions. Elsewhere (Mithen 2005) I have followed Wray by proposing that Neanderthal proto-language was holistic and argued that their vocalizations had a high degree of musicality, making extensive use of variations in melody and rhythm to express emotion and induce emotional states in others. As such, Neanderthal vocal and ges? tural communication should be thought of as proto-music as much as proto-language. While 'messages' would have consisted of arbitrary strings of syllables, Neanderthal utterances probably made extensive use of vocal imitation of natural sounds, especially animal calls, onomatopoeias, and to have involved the phenomenon of sound synaes- thesia, as described by Berlin (2005, and in this volume) and which continues to form a key feature of human language. Also, as Donald (1991) has argued, mimesis is likely to have played a key role in hominin communication. Hmmmmm and the origin of language I have characterized the type of communication system outlined in the previous section as 'Hmmmmm': Holistic, manipulative, multi-modal, musical, mimetic (Mithen 2005). If it was present amongst Neanderthals, then it was also possibly present amongst our immediate ancestors in Africa, a species that some refer to as Homo helmei. The process by which this system evolved into 'language as we know it' was described by Wray (1998; 2000) as 'segmentation'. By this she refers to the division of holistic phrases into separate units, each of which had their own referential meaning and could then be re-combined with units from other utterances to create any infinite array of new utterances. This is the emergence of compositionality, the feature that makes language so much more powerful than any other communication system. Wray suggests that segmentation may have arisen from the recognition of chance associations between the phonetic segments of the holistic utterance and objects or events to which they related (see Bickerton 2003 for a critique). Once recognized, these associations might then have been used in a referential fashion to create the new, linguistic phrases. Support for this idea comes from the use of computer models to simulate the evolution of language (e.g. Batali 2002; Kirby 2000; 2002; Komarova 8c Nowak 2003; Nowak 8c Komarova 2001). The kick-start to segmentation may have been a chance genetic mutation. This may have provided the ability to identify phonetic segments in a holistic utterance, an ability that had previously been absent. Some aspects of language are dependent on the pos? session ofthe specific gene FOXP2, the modern human version of which seems to have appeared in Africa at soon after 200,000 years ago (Enard et al. 2002). So, at the risk of over-simplifying, it is possible that the process of segmentation was dependent upon this gene in some manner that has yet to be discovered. Indeed, it may be significant that those afflicted by a faulty version of the FOXP2 gene have had difficulties not only with grammar, but also with understanding complex sentences and judging whether a sequence such as 'blonterstaping' is a real word (Bishop 2002). These difficulties seem to reflect a problem with the segmentation of what would have sounded to them to be holistic utterances. So perhaps it was only with the chance mutation of the FOXP2 gene to create the modern human version that segmentation became possible. Alter- natively, there may have been other genetic mutations at a similar date that enabled the transition from holistic phrases to compositional language. /. Roy. Anthrop. Inst. (N.S.), S45-S61 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="12">S56 Steven Mithen Once the process of segmentation had begun, we should expect a rapid evolution of grammatical rules. Such rules would have evolved via the process of cultural trans? mission in the manner Kirby (2000) describes, and perhaps through natural selection leading to the appearance of genetically based neural networks that enable more complex grammatical constructions. I have argued (Mithen 2005) that the segmenta? tion of Hmmmmm led to the appearance of the two vocal (and part-gestural) com? munication systems of modern humans: language and music. Their partly shared evolutionary history is evident from the significant overlaps between language and music, while several features of Hmmmmm remain within spoken language. The most notable of these are onomatopoeia, mimicry, and sound synaesthesia, while gesture and body language remain as fundamental aspects of human communication - although we are often entirely unaware of their use and significance (Beattie 2003). Cognitive fluidity, totemism and anthropomorphism While the evolution of compositional language via the segmentation of Hmmmmm would have enhanced communication, it may have also led to a more fundamental change in the character of human thought - the transition from a domain-specific to a cognitively fluid mentality. I have argued elsewhere (Mithen 1996) that cognitive fluidity was a consequence of language: spoken and imaginary utterances acted as conduits for ideas and informa? tion to flow from one intelligence to another, a view supported by Carruthers (2002). He drew on the latest research in neuroscience and psychology to argue that the 'imagined sentences' that we create in our minds allow the outputs from one intelli- gence/module to be combined with those from one or more others, and thereby create new types of conscious thoughts. Carruthers placed considerable emphasis on syntax - an essential part of compositional language. Syntax allows for the multiple embed- ding of adjectives and phrases, the phenomenon of recursiveness. According to Car? ruthers, syntax allows one imaginary sentence generated by one type of cognitive module/intelligence to be embedded into that of another imaginary sentence coming from a different module/intelligence. By so doing, a single imaginary sentence will be created which generates an 'inter-modular' or cognitively fluid thought, one that could not have existed without compositional language. With regard to thought about the natural world, cognitive fluidity allowed this to be integrated with that about the human social world and artefacts. The former allowed the possibility of anthropomorphism - attributing animals with human-like beliefs and desires - and totemism in terms of attributing humans with animal ancestors (Mithen 1996). This type of thinking does not, however, compromise the ability to eval- uate the costs, benefits, and risks of different types of actions relating to animals and plants that enable adaptation to the natural world. This is, after all, a cognitive capac? ity that has a far longer evolutionary history within the human mind than that for anthropomorphic and totemic thinking. Conclusion Homo sapiens is the product of six million years of evolution since the time of the common ancestor we shared with the chimpanzee. That evolutionary history has a pro- found impact on the way we think and behave today, especially with regard to the natural world. Unless we take our evolutionary past into account, we will never get beyond a partial understanding of what it means to be human. I have stressed two impacts of this /. Roy. Anthrop. Inst. (N.S.), S45-S61 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="13">Steven Mithen S57 evolutionary perspective on the study of ethnobiology. First, it is to be expected that whatever their cultural, ecological, or historical context, humans will share a common means for classifying the natural world, this being part of an intuitive biology that is encoded within our genome. Such intuitive biology may have little opportunity to develop for those individuals who grow up with limited contact with the natural world - as with other potential neural capacities, 'use it or lose it' is the message. Nevertheless, the search for underlying shared principles of classification and cognitive engagement with the natural world must be a proper and key feature of ethnobiology. A second lesson from our evolutionary past is that language is a relatively recent means of human communication, one most likely restricted to our species alone and appearing no longer than two hundred thousand years ago. For almost the whole of the six million years of human evolution since the common ancestor, hominins have perceived, classified, interpreted, and made decisions about the natural world in a pre- linguistic mode. Some of those hominins may have had sophisticated communications system of the type I have characterized as Hmmmmm, which made extensive use of onomatopoeia, mimicry, and sound synaesthesia. Traces of these remain within our language (Berlin 2005, and this volume) and music today (Mithen 2005) but 'language as we know it' is likely to play a relatively minor role in the development and cultural transmission of knowledge about the natural world. So while linguistic approaches to ethnobiology are unquestionably important, these will lead to only a partial under? standing of how humans perceive and understand the natural world.

Ethnobiologie et evolution de Pesprit humain Resume Le point de vue evolutionniste sur la pensee et le comportement humains implique que nous pouvons trouver des systemes universels de perception, de classification et de decision concernant l'environnement naturel. C'est l'interaction entre ces aspects evolues de Tesprit humain, la biodiversite naturelle, et les con- textes historiques, sociaux et economiques uniques dans lesquels se developpent les individus qui donne naissance a la diversite culturelle. Les observations paleoanthropologiques indiquent egalement que le langage est une acquisition recente. On peut en deduire que les approches linguistiques de l'ethnobiolo- gie ne pourront donner qu'une vue partielle de la maniere dont les etres humains percoivent, classifient et affrontent leur environnement naturel.
