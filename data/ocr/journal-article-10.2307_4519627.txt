<plain_text><page sequence="1">Stegner, the Environment, and the West by Dan Flores I never met Wallace Stegner, but after reading his biography of John Wesley Powell, Beyond the Hundredth Meridian, I followed him through many another of his books. Eventually my own career intersected modestly with his so that I got to review some of his last works, one of which was The American West as Living Space, a magisterial little essay collection published in 1987. No one has ever synthesized the environmentalist position with respect to western development, it seems to me, more thoughtfully, at a more informed level, or with more graceful language. In memorable Stegnerian cadences and rhythms-a language, incidentally, clearly meant to be spoken aloud as much as read-is a rather complete vision of the American West, its space, and its trajectory through time. Despite its grace of presentation, however, Stegner's vision was tough-minded, steeped in a knowledge of the layer cake of choices that fold together to make up history, and in its sum, amounted to a pretty caustic social criticism. It was a vision, with perhaps only one or two exceptions, that most any moder western environmentalist would nonetheless be proud to endorse. Yet what gave Stegner's vision a power that many environmentalist manifestos lack is that it was a product not just of a far deeper knowledge of history but of harder, more penetrating thinking. History and intelligent thought were the main weapons in Stegner's arsenal, and they gave him at least three key insights into how human societies ought to adapt to living in the American West. Among the most simple yet compelling ideas Stegner addressed was his conviction that the West is, environmentally, a very different place from the rest of the United States, and that aridity is the cause for that difference. It is aridity that accomplishes the seemingly magical transformation of the landscape beyond the hundredth meridian, aridity that has served as the principal challenge to living in the West, aridity (and, I might add, elevation) that has imparted to the modem West its defining identity as the domain of the public lands. This stamp of aridity not only made Stegner aware that the West was, in truth, far more a place than a pioneering process, Stegner's appreciation for aridity worked its way into his aesthetic. He loved what lack of moisture did to topography, air, light, life. The West has desert at its heart, and Stegner seemed so attuned to the principle that his books, at first opening, always seem to have just a hint of dry wind and sagebrush about them. I know Stegner absorbed some of these ideas from Walter Prescott Webb and especially from Webb's 1931 classic, The Great Plains: A Study of Institutions and Environment. Yet unlike Webb and Kansas historian James Malin, who argued over whether aridity was a positive or a negative for the West, Stegner saw aridity simply as fact. But it is all-important fact. Not only has aridity altered history in fascinating ways, most crucially aridity's consequences have forced westerners to address Stegner looks over the Black Rock . . - Desert, probably during the early 1960s.</page><page sequence="2">Montana The Magazine of Western History Autumn 1993 limits, to face the fact that the world is (so to speak) flat and has borders. As with most of his key ideas, Stegner wrote not only well but often about aridity. In one particularly vivid passage, he wrote: Aridity, more than anything else, gives the western landscape its character. It is aridity that gives the air its special dry clarity; aridity that puts brilliance in the light and polishes and enlarges the stars; aridity that leads the grasses to evolve as bunches rather than as turf; aridity that exposes the pigmentation of the raw earth and limits, almost eliminates, the color of chlorophyll; aridity that erodes the earth in cliffs and badlands rather than in softened and vegetated slopes.... The West, Walter Webb said, is a 'semi-desert with a desert heart.' If I prefer to think of it as two long chains of mountain ranges with deserts or semi-deserts in their rain shadow, that is not to deny that the primary unity of the West is a shortage of water. That elemental premise-that it was not any lack of land, the so- called "closed space" argument, but a scarcity of water that defined western history and possibilities- led Stegner to anticipate the kinds of ideas environmental historians have made their careers analyzing. Water, like air and sustenance, is one of the few things the human animal absolutely must have to survive in a place. A place without water and air-Mars, let us say- can be settled by humans, but the requisites for life must be supplied artificially. Most of the West is not quite so dry as Voyager II photographs show Mars to be, but in fact the mountain snowpacks, while they renew themselves every winter, store only so much water for the drylands that surround them. Western aquifers like the vast Ogallala Aquifer, which saturates the gravels beneath the sweep of the central and southern Great Plains, are essentially fossil lakes, many of them as depletable as mine ore. They will one day be done; the earth really is flat. To his credit Stegner realized what all this meant in terms of the larger environmental picture for the West, for adaptation and carrying capacity in particular. He consistently ridiculed the big technological fixes for aridity-the dams that have engineered so many western rivers out of existence ("original sin," Stegner called the process)-and was especially critical of the grandiose plans for diversion projects that promised more water from the Southeast or the Pacific Northwest or even the Yukon to transform the West into something it was not. In some of his last books, Stegner urged a kind of organicist adaptation for western societies. From the idea that because of aridity the West is substantially different from elsewhere follows the argument that the West is more fragile, that its resources must be managed more carefully, that it cannot absorb the levels of environmental modification or human population the rest of the country perhaps can. Stegner, meanwhile, knew firsthand the dangers inherent in the transiency that is such a part of the American character, and this knowledge led him to a second important insight about human adaptation to the western environment. It led him to admire western societies that created unique responses to their local environments. It was Mormon Utah that first focused Stegner on the dialogue between place and culture. It was not until he left Utah that he realized what a unique lifeway had resulted from the interplay of Mormon culture and the ranges and canyons of the intermountain West. Mormon Country was his introductory exploration of that phenomenon, which deepened considerably in Beyond the Hundredth Meridian when he realized that John Wesley Powell's blueprint for a kind of planned, Darwinian adaptation to the West was based largely on Powell's admiration for the Mormon model. In the communally based Mormon towns, Stegner found the growing seed of one distinctive sense of place in the West. That recognition made him look elsewhere for the phenomenon and find and ruminate about other cultures he believed were in the process of going native in the West-the New Mexicans of the mountain villages around Taos and Santa Fe, the ranchers of the Absaroka country in Montana, small cities with flavorful personalities like Missoula, Montana, with its literary and environmental colonies. He certainly did not always applaud the details of the process, as in frantically booming modern Utah, but it always interested him. And in his dissonance over whether he had ever managed to go native himself, he wrote a superb essay about creating a small ranch in the Los Altos Hills outside San Francisco that can serve as a guide to conscious place immersion-or what we would call western bioregionalism today. Because he knew western history as well as he did, Stegner became famous as a literary champion of a third idea that continues to define the West. In the late 1950s, after three decades of agitation by now-famous conservation figures like Aldo Leopold, Bob Marshall, and Arthur Carhart, Congress began to hear testimony on bills to create a wilderness system in the United States. Stegner was by no means the only voice, or even the most important voice, to speak to the necessity of wilderness to American culture. But his 1960 "Wilderness Letter," now a worldwide classic of environmental history, was a galvanizing document. With good reason it has been quoted endlessly as perhaps the single best statement on behalf of wilderness preservation. "I want to speak for the wilderness idea as something that 68</page><page sequence="3">Dan Flores sts tWS5 rEas PoN d ; oM L -w- 3-4 :&lt; ... tt s- - x ; 95WS has helped form our character and that has certainly shaped our history as a people," Stegner wrote. In one sense Stegner's rationale was anthropomorphic: Preserving wilderness was crucial for Americans, he believed, not so much because it set aside habitat or preserved slices of the primeval earth, but because American history has tucked the idea of wilderness close in to the spiritual and mystical kernel of who Americans are. In the process of conquering the continent we in part surrendered our souls to the wild and the natural, and this has given Americans a sense of bigness, a primal sense of ourselves as "a wild species" that few modern peoples retain. Preserving wilderness amounted to a "geography of hope," as Stegner's memorable phrase put it, that humans could retain that sanity of knowing they are nature's children. Echoing Henry David Thoreau, Stegner believed that the wild held out to Americans our last, best hope of being "good animals." More than his awareness of the limits imposed by arid-lands living, or his hope for a bioregional sense of place in the West, it was Stegner's appreciation of wild places and their effects on humans that made him a kind of model westerner. You have to suspect that what Stegner most wanted was to be left alone to read, experience, and write. But the circumstances of his time and his place made it impossible for him to hide in the scholar-writer's life. If he was, as the Sierran recently called him, a "reluctant activist," I think we ought to understand the adjective, yet note how often he set his reluctance aside, and recognize the inspiration his activism has had on many western thinkers and writers of our time. Encouraged by Bernard DeVoto, Stegner began writing environmental essays, usually about wilderness and public lands issues, in the early 1950s and continued to do so throughout his life. His edited volume, This Is Dinosaur, was the first cause- oriented coffee-table book published by the Sierra Club and was a critical factor in the great 1950s battle over western dams and rivers that converted environmentalism into the potent political movement it has been ever since. It is a simple thing to say that Stegner's influence was large, but like the big, elemental ideas he had about the West, there is an irresistible force in simplicity. As has been said of Aldo Leopold, the man grew throughout his life, and what he came to know became our knowledge as well. But as Edward Abbey once observed, writing books and articles isn't enough. Knowledge isn't enough. Like Bernard DeVoto for an earlier generation, like Abbey for a somewhat different cultural subset, Stegner has served and still serves as an apotheosis of environmental activism for writers and even academics whose topic is the West. He married intellectual rigor and literary grace with passion and social commitment, and in his quiet way he promoted those who shared that commitment. If the enemies of environ- mentalism have noticed this, and don't like it, blame Stegner. Good animal that he was, I somehow don't think he would mind. o .E :^ n o Stegner describes this stretch of road from the Canadian border to Chinook, Montana, with the Bears Paw Mountains on the horizon, in The Big Rock Candy Mountain. 69</page></plain_text>
