<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Religion in Africa, Vol. VII, fasc. 3 THE SOTHO NOTION OF THE SUPREME BEING AND THE IMPACT OF THE CHRISTIAN PROCLAMATION 1) BY KLAUS NtiRNBERGER (Berlin) The emerging reappraisal of their religious heritage by African Christians shows that we have entered a new phase in the interaction between African traditional religions and the Christian faith. The inevitable uncertainty created by this search for truth seems to call for a careful definition of concepts. The "Supreme Being" is one of the most crucial in this regard. This paper is an attempt to sort things out for the realm of a specific cultural context, viz. that of the Sotho/Tswana cluster which inhabit a large semicircular area stretch- ing from the Northern, Central and Western Transvaal, Botwana, the Northern Cape, the Orange Free State to Lesotho. These peoples are related to each other to such a degree that a certain amount of gen- eralization seems to be justified within the limits of such a paper. We start with a short summary of the religious context in which the concept of the Supreme Being (Modimo) has to be seen. Unfortunately there is no room here for substantiation of the hypotheses put forward. This we limit to the discussion of the Supreme Being itself in the central part. The last section, on the impact of the Christian proclamation on the concept of Modimo, again has had to be very condensed and generalized. African experience of reality is indivisible. Everything is integrated into a comprehensive whole and as such dependent on everything else. If we are to discover the existential significance of the Supreme Being in the Sotho religion we have to see it in the context of this whole. For the sake of comprehension we will discuss a few of its relevant dimensions. I) Paper prepared for the biennial conference of the African Studies Association of the United Kingdom, Liverpool, September 1974. The initial sections have been considerable condensed for the purpose of publication.</page><page sequence="2">The Sotho Notion of the Supreme Being 175 The first dimension of the Sotho experience of reality is the field of human relationships as they express themselves within the prescribed bounds of the highly institutionalized social frame-work of a small-scale society. In such a society the status and the role of every individual is meticulously defined in any given stage of his life. His social position depends on age, sex, marital status and seniority in relation to the partrilineal order. Obviously these social relationships change in subsequent stages of life - both the life of the individual himself and of other individuals, especially close rel- atives. All these changes are marked by more or less conspicuous rites of passage. In any given stage of his life, however, the individ- ual has to move within the existing structure in such a way that he carefully avoids any disturbance of the balance of power which exists at any given moment according to the requirements of the social order. The second dimension is the dynamistic conception of reality which we find in more or less the same form in all Bantu peoples of South- ern Africa. Reality is experienced in terms of potential or kinetic power. There is an equilibrium of forces at any given moment. But these forces are in constant ebb and flow like the waves of the ocean. Usually the sea is relatively calm. But it can also be in tempestuous and destructive turmoil. The community is constantly alert to maintain or restore the calm by relevant rituals. Human relationships are the pivot of man's intercourse with and control over the forces of reality. Illness, barrenness, drought and other adverse "natural" phenomena are all ascribed to troubled human relationships, especially within the family, whether between its living members or between them and the ancestral spirits. Sorcery is nothing but an extreme case in point, to which we will presently return. Dynamistic power can, however, also be actively employed. This is done by "magic" rites, which are either repetitive and conventional to secure the ongoing processes of life, or extra-ordinary as prescribed by the diviner for special cases. With these rites persons, processes or things are strenghtened, which means that they are charged with dynamistic power. This can happen with various aims in view- confirmatory, productive, protective or therapeutic. The latter two bring us to the negative variation of the use of dynamistic power. Dynamistic power as such is ethically and cosmologically neutral. It is neither good nor bad, profitable nor detrimental. Its use or abuse by human beings is decisive. Malevolent use of dynamistic power is boloi</page><page sequence="3">176 Klaus Niirnberger (sorcery.) Its secrecy and unpredictability makes it the most dreaded negative factor in the life of the Sotho community. All adverse ir- regularities of life, which cannot be dealt with by a restoration of troubled relationships within the kin group, are ascribed to sorcery. The diviner has to discover the source of the evil and prescribe the relevant rites which employ dynamistic power to counter-act the malevolent influence and, if possible, destroy the sorcerer himself. The third dimension of the Sotho experience of reality is the "life- force" of the kinship system. We use the term in spite of its limi- tations for lack of a better alternative. It should be noted however that it is unable to cover the strong legal dimension. Its operational centre is the lineage. For the sake of simplicity we will discuss only the vertical relationship between father and son to show what is at stake. The life of the son is derived from his father in a comprehen- sive way. Sonship is not to be taken in a biological sense although of course it is biological in the majority of cases. The decisive criterion of true sonship is that the son is endowed with the life-force of the lineage through the mediation of the father or his rightful representative. He has to be recognized as son and he has to acknowledge the authorship and authority of the father as a superior representative of the lineage. Once he is integrated into the ongoing lineage he becomes a potential channel of its life-force. This life-force has passed through many generations before it reached the son through the father, just as the bloodstream passes through the artery. Obviously then it is not a private possession. All the members of the lineage, not only those who are still to be born, depend on the vitality of this life-stream, which manifests itself through its forceful perpetuation. For this reason procreation, in conjunction with the relevant rites of passage, is in itself an essential revitalizing ritual in terms of the life-force of the lineage. The flow of the life-force of the lineage is one-directional. For the son his father is the ultimate authority. But the authority of the father is not absolute. He has his own superior in the grandfather. No Sotho man ever really comes of age. Under these circumstances we can understand why the death of a father presents the next of kin with a major crisis. In the first place the fate of the individual con- cerned is at stake. Fulfilled wholesome being is only possible within the ongoing life-stream of the lineage. Death presents the grave danger of falling out of this successive continuity. Once a person no longer "belongs" he is lost. Being lost is manifest in not being re-</page><page sequence="4">The Sotho Notion of the Supreme Being I77 membered, recognized and acknowledged as a superior in the gene- alogy. But a closer look suggests that much more is at stake than the fate of the deceased individual. A father represents the living link in the continuity of the lineage between those before and those after him. Once he falls out of place a major disruption is imminent. It is not merely a matter of the readjustment of social relationships to the new set-up within a family. More important is the need to secure the continuity of the life-stream of the lineage which is of such vital importance if the further links down the chain are not to lose their metaphysical foundation, their basic ethical orientation and their dynamistic enablement. There is, therefore, reason enough for the family to perform an elaborate ritual. This ritual counteracts the destructive power which caused the death and prevents it from spreading to other members of the family; it confirms the right of belonging of the deceased; it ensures his reintegration into the continuity of the lineage; it charges him with an abundance of new dynamistic power so as to enable him to fill his new place. It is significant that in this stage the deceased is completely at the mercy of the surviving next of kin. Should they fail to perform the necessary rites he may become a roaming, homeless spirit. But since these spirits may prove to be immensely troublesome to the living the latter are usually careful not to fail in their duty. But the ancestor spirits (badimo) continue to be dependent on the living members of the family even after these rites have been per- formed. They have to be remembered, recognized, acknowledged as superiors according to their rank. They are as it were kept in their place by the living. This is done by means of libation and sacrifice (go phasa). The living depend on the fact that the ancestors remain in their proper place. Only in this way does the life-force of the lineage reach them. The dead bestow "blessing" on the living as media of this life-force. On the other hand ancestors become immensely troublesome by means of illness, drought etc., if they are no longer given their due. In this way the dependence of the living on the life- force of the lineage finds its negative expression. That ancestors do in fact depend on the living is no contradiction of their transcendent power. A small example may help to explain this phenomenon. Africans experience, as others do, the apparent loss of presence and influence of a person in case of his death. Of course the impact of an important person on the life of his immediate</page><page sequence="5">178 Klaus Niirnberger dependents does not disappear immediately when he dies. His pres- ence and influence is still felt for a considerable time to come. Nevertheless there is a progressive erosion of this immediacy. The Sotho ascribe less existence to the dead than to the living. An ancestor has not more but less existence. He is not less but more dependent on the living. The ritual investment of the dead with dynamistic power seems to be an unconscious move to counteract the apparent loss of vitality, influence and presence of the deceased which is so dan- gerous. Because the living depend on the dead they keep them in a state of influence and authority. But this does not mean that deceased persons are deified in the Western sense of the word. After five or six generations they slowly disappear from memory, are no longer presented with sacrifices or libations (except perhaps in the most general way to provide for all eventualities) and virtually disappear into the unknown abysses of time. Persons who are not recognized as such channels of the life-force, e.g. infants, receive no investment of dynamistic power after their death. They are buried by the women at night without any ritual and soon pass out of existence altogether. The life-force of the lineage thus described seems to be the central religio-ethical entity of the Sotho. In reality it is far more complex than described, including immediate and more distant relatives, the female component of the ancestry etc., but that does not concern us here. It is this entity which is the source of man's "true life" and thus also the ultimate ethical authority. The range of its vitality is the only possible realm of fulfilled existence. It defines man's identity. It confirms his right to be. In it he finds his sense of belonging, his world perspective, his ethical orientation. It is that from which he may under no circumstances be alienated if doubt is not to be cast on the very fundamentals of his being. To fall out of its bounds is tantamount to being lost. It may be impersonal in its essence, but it is experienced only as being incarnate in persons who are known-alive or dead. The ancestors are its most formidable channels and representatives, but they are nothing more than just that: channels and representatives. It is just as vivid in the living members of the lineage. There is no absolute difference between a living father and an ancestor, only a difference in the degree of existence, authority and dynamistic power. The Tswana call any social superior in the complex fabric of the lineage a modimo, not only when he has died. The Pedi do the same with chiefs. Yet the lineage is not a "god" in the sense in which this term is</page><page sequence="6">The Sotho Notion of the Supreme Being 179 generally used. The life-force of the lineage is ontologically no different from all the other powers which make up the dynamist's cosmic order. It is only the most important of them all, because "life and salvation" depend on this one, as distinct from all others. And for that reason it tends to become the centre of the cosmos. All other powers are interpreted and judged in relation to it. If anything adverse happens the reason is always first sought in its vicinity. Nothing could be so disastrous as an abrupt or gradual erosion of its power. But it is man who has to see to it that this does not happen. He has to "charge" the lineage with dynamistic power by means of the correct rituals. It depends as much on man for its continued existence as man depends on it for his well-being. MODIMO-THE POWER BEYOND But now there is a beyond. Not a beyond in the sense of other- worldliness. The Sotho have no knowledge of another world. The ancestors do have another form of being, but they are not out of the world. There is, however, a beyond in relation to the life-force of the lineage, of other lineages, of the tribe as a whole, of all tribes, even in relation to the individual manipulations of the sorcerers. Beyond the universe of powers which are more or less comprehen- sible, more or less subject to human control or influence, reality extends further into the unknown and the unmanageable. It is not a spatial beyond. It is the experience of the limits of man. There are instances in the life of the Sotho in which they are confronted with this beyond. It may be the occurrence of a drought or an epidemic, in which all the explanations and prescriptions of the diviners fail, in which all rituals have been performed, in which nothing is left undone. But all is in vain. The flood of dynamistic power breaks through the dykes of the ritual and causes destruction which can no longer be accounted for. Then, once more, man is reminded of the fact that the realm of his comprehension and influence, including all the ritualistic techniques, including even the very life-force of the lineage itself, is a limited part of a greater whole which stretches into the ineffable beyond. But it is not only the exceptional occurrence, the borderline case of life in which this beyond manifests itself, that matters. Rather, the realm of the reality which is known and which can be controlled, or at least influenced, is itself part and parcel of the greater dynamistic uni- verse, so that the beyond is ever present as the normal background</page><page sequence="7">i80 Klaus Niirnberger of everyday life. The one does not exclude but rather includes the other. Destructive lightning or a death can be ascribed to sorcery, yet in both the ineffable beyond manifests itself. It is this beyond which brings us into the vicinity of what the Sotho notion of the Supreme Being (Modimo) is meant to indicate and which we have to analyse now. Our first observation is that Modimo does not speak. There is no evidence of a revelation of any sort, whether in dreams, oracles, through prophets or in any other way. Modimo extends no claim on the loyalty of man, he gives no commands, he presents no challenge, he offers no blessings of a verbal kind. He is in some sense at the root of reality as a whole as we will presently see, but he is not the foundation or source of man's "true life" in the religious sense of the word. He does not define man's identity and he does not question man's integrity. He does not confirm man's right of exist- ence nor does he cast doubt on it. He offers no ethical guide-lines or instructions, nor does he claim man's responsibility. All these normal aspects of religious experience are connected with the life- force of the lineage represented by the ancestral spirits, but not with the Supreme Being. Neither are the Basotho particularly upset about the silence of Modimo. Obviously he is not expected to speak. This is a first pointer to the existential relevance of Modimo. It must be an experience which by its very nature remains impenetrable to interpretation. Dehnke records exceptional cases where Thobega is said to have spoken 2) particularly after a wrong verdict. 3) But this is a my- thologumenon. It does not occur in practical life. This mytholo- gumenon is in line with the experience of Modimo as the ultimate beyond-which is also a beyond in terms of human error and bribery. 4) Our second observation is a complete absence of any positive reaction of man to the existential experience of Modimo. There is no prayer and no sacrifice directed towards Modimo. There is no shrine and no priesthood. There is no attempt of mediation on the side of the diviner. There is no ritual of any sort, whether in terms of religion or magic. There are no taboos which are unambiguously 2) For the names and personifications of Modimo cf. p. ooo, below. 3) H. Dehnke, Die Verkiindigung von der Rechtfertigung in Kontext des Tswana-Heidentums und des Tswana-Synkretismus (unpublished paper. 1968), 3. 4) Cf. p.ooo, below.</page><page sequence="8">The Sotho Notion of the Supreme Being 181 connected with Modimo himself. Being confronted with Modimo the only possible reaction of man is acquiescence. Acquiescence is a sort of fatalism, but it is limited to the sphere of reality which lies beyond the comprehension and influence of man. It is not absolute. Neither can it be equated with despondency. Normally the Mosotho is confi- dent that sooner or later the unforeseen impact of Modimo will subside. So he just marks time until normal life continues. There are a few traditional, formulated prayers which are meant to be directed to Modimo among the Tswana. 5) But these are exceptional and often legendary. J. T. Brown suggests that the disappearance of direct prayer must have been the result of a strict taboo on the word Modimo.6) But the taboo did not cover the pronoun ona, which is till in use in proper names like Thatayaona. 7) The taboo is also not universal for the Sotho tribes; the absence of prayer is. The Hebrew parallel shows that the taboo on the name of God (Yahweh) does not necessarily need to have this effect. Setiloane explains that it is a sign of respect not to call a person by his name. 8) But a deeper reason seems to be the character of Modimo as the ineffable dynamistic beyond. The absence of prayer and the taboo on the name point to a common root.9) Hiiselbarth claims that in cases of exceptional crisis the Mamabolo pray to Modimo.10) It is very likely that as an act of desperation a people who have a concept for the great beyond, even a name for it, should turn in prayer to this great unknown. But the question is whether they expect to be heard or to receive an answer. Minnig says that the Pedi do not pray to Modimo; in the rain-making rites there is a reference to Kgobeane in a song, but this is not a prayer.ll) In the set of divination bones one represents Modimo, but it does not directly interpret the attitude of Modimo.12) 5) Dehnke, op. cit., 2; E.

There are bad omens, e.g. hail or tornadoes; the Pedi stop all work on the fields for the rest of the day should these occur. 14) But these omens are not unambiguously attributed to Modimo, they are also considered to be signs of the ancestors. 15) Regarding acquiescence the most revealing expressions which can be heard among the Sotho in such instances are the following. Ke Modimo ! ("it is God", which always means: "there is nothing to be done about it.") Modimo o gona, ga re kgone selo ! ("God is there, we cannot do anything !") If the phrase Modimo o gona ! is used alone, it has the connotation of "God is in charge now !" and there is a certain ray of hope that the equilibrium of power will be restored in some way or other. A similar "hope" comes to the fore if the person is a victim of an injustice committed by another person, on whom he cannot revenge himself. Then he would say Modimo o tlo go bona ! which means "God will see you !" in the sense of "God will catch up with you !" This is a sort of curse which invokes the dynamistic power-equilibrium against the culprit. Casalis records another example of the basic attitude over against Modimo: "If anyone is struck dead by lightning, no murmur is heard and tears are suppressed. 'The Lord has killed him' they say, 'he is, doubtless, rejoicing: let us be careful not to disturb his joy.' " 16) The defiant revolt of the heart seems to crash against the wall of the unmanageable in a mixture of irony and fear. Our third observation is that Modimo does not act. He is the "wherefrom" of all dynamistic power, he is at the root of all that comes to pass. But that is no pointer to an action. He is the source of life, but he does not actually give or take life. He is not connected with occurrences within time or historical developments in the Hebrew sense of a "God of history". Modimo denotes an ever present dimension of the Sotho experience of reality. Yet Modimo does not act: it just happens. Dehnke asked an old Tswana diviner, Mongae, what Thobega does. He answered Ga a dire; go a diragala ! ("He does not act, 13) Cf. p. ooo, above. 14) M*nnig, op. cit., 47. 15) Ibid., 58. 16) E. Casalis, The Basutos, or twenty-three years in South Africa. London: James Nisbet I861, 242.</page><page sequence="10">The Sotho Notion of the Supreme Being 183 it happens!" 17) Setiloane uses the impersonal IT for Modimo.1s) On a further question Dehnke's informant said: "If you put seed into the earth, then the earth does not do anything, but the seed germinates !" 19) This does not mean that Modimo is a Deus otiosus. This term is misleading as a description of the existential experience of Modimo. It could suggest that Modimo is able to and expected to act but that he does not do so. It could even suggest that there is no such experience at all and Modimo is merely a mythological figure without basis. Nothing could be further from the truth. Modimo is also not to be confused with the God of the Deists. This type of speculative philosophy is foreign to the Sotho. Modimo is not an invention of intellectuals to satisfy a rational curiosity concerning origins, or to arrive at a unified cosmology. Modimo is beyond human comprehension and manipulation, but he is not beyond experienced reality. Mythology surrounds the notion of the Supreme Being in Africa. But myths are not meant to supply valid and satisfying answers to philosophical questions. They are meant to come to grips with the ineffable by putting into metaphors or stories of the fable type what cannot be expressed in other ways. It is equally wrong to think that the concept is dispensable in practice, i.e. without any loss of existential relevance. If it were, Modimo would not have "withdrawn" into the distance; he would have disappeared altogether. Modimo denotes a comprehensive universe of power which is always potentially present, normally in calm equilibrium (and then you do not need to worry about it), but sometimes also in turmoil. And then you have to see how far your power reaches and where the beyond calls for acquiescence. So the concept is of considerable existential relevance. It may well be that the seemingly infinite capacity for silent suffering amongst Africans is rooted in this concept of the Supreme Being. This applies equally to their readiness to take for granted what seems to be incompre- hensible, unavoidable, unchangeable - the basically fatalistic attitude towards history and nature mentioned earlier. 17) Note his double use of the verb-stem -dir-, negatively for the transitive, positively for the intransitive, negatively for the personal pronoun, derived from the personification of Modimo into Thobega (cf. p. oo9 below), and positively for the impersonal pronoun go (it). 18) Setiloane, op. cit., passim. 19) Dehnke, op. cit., 3.</page><page sequence="11">184 Klaus Niirnberger If Modimo does not act, then he is not to be located within the coordinates of time and space. He is always and everywhere. He is, in some way, connected with the sky (legodimo) and conceived as being above (godimo). But he is equally associated with the bowels of the earth, where man has his origin and to where he returns according to the Sotho mythology. Modimo is not associated with any tribe or nation. He is above them all, like the rain or the sun, which reach everybody, whether friend or foe, whether good or bad. "The thunderbolt, appearing to enter the earth, is interpreted as MODIMO returning to ITSELF ... The spark passes from one pole of the battery to the other. But both poles hold the force which make it pass." 20) The absence of verbal communication and of action within the cooordinates of time and space means that Modimo is not experienced existentially as a person. Further evidence confirms this finding. In the first place Modimo seems to be ethically neutral. In some way he is the cause of everything that happens, whether it is profitable or adverse, and he cannot be blamed for it. In the second place, Modimo is sexually neutral. Within the context of an African culture the mythological concept of Modimo naturally tends to be male, but female connotations are not absent from it. In the third place there are definite linguistic pointers to the effect that Modimo is not a person. Mbnnig deduces from the expression Ke motho wa Kgobe (this is a man of God) that Modimo personifies all moral characteristics desired by man, particularly truthfulness, cleanliness and purity. 21) Setiloane also claims that Modimo preserves justice. 22) Dehnke records instances where Thobega is believed to have spoken after a wrong verdict. 23) But all these cases do not point to a personal Guarantor of justice or ethical norms. Rather, Modimo is the overall dynamistic equilibrium of power, which is infinitely beyond bribery, manipulation, approach and reproach. The expression "man of God" for a particularly reliable and truthful person may be taken in that sense. And since the power concerned always tends to return to equilibrium if disturbed, man reckons with a sort of impersonal "justice" to take effect where human justice fails. But this does not 20) Setiloane, op. cit., 12. 21) Monnig, op. cit., 45. 22) Setiloane, op. cit., 14. 23) Dehnke, op. cit., 3.</page><page sequence="12">The Sotho Notion of the Supreme Being 185 mean that Modimo cannot also "act" in a most arbitrary and "injust" way! Dehnke quotes a praise of Hubeane 24) which starts like this: "He is the scorching light of the sun and the calm light of the moon. He is the jerk of the lightning and the glittering of the stars." The praise- name of Thobega is Thobega-a-phatswa, mogatse wa mmampa! which Dehnke translates as "Thobega of the black and white (clouds), love of the Prime Mother !" The symbol of the thunderclouds, on top glaringly white, below threateningly black, from which the destruc- tion of hail and the blessing of rain flow, indicates the dualism of the concept. Dehnke's informant says concerning Thobega's attitude towards sin: "Law is not the wisdom of men, but if a thief plows he reaps no less than a decent person !" 25) Modimo is a sort of coincidentia oppositorum, which means that he has to be ethically neutral. On the sex of Modimo M6nnig says: " ... he is definitely male." 126) Both Smith and Dehnke know of formulated prayers, however, in which Modimo is addressed as Minme (Mother). 27 That a mythical expression of the source of reality should include motherly characteristics presents no difficulties of comprehension. Modimo's association with the great "abyss" of the earth, from which, according to one mythological strand, man comes and into which he returns, points into the same direction. Casalis gives a different version. 28) According to him Thobega, here conceived as the ancestor of the reigning sovereign (i.e. the tribal God), is invoked and Mmampa, here seen as his wife, makes known his will. Again this shows how the same existential experience can produce a variety of mythologumena, which are no contradiction if they are derived from their common root. Concerning linguistic evidence let me summarise as follows: The root of the word Modimo is derived from the "proto-Bantu" root -dzimu which is very common among Bantu languages. When used for the Supreme Being the word Modimo takes the pronoun ona or wona. Thus it does not belong to the personal mo-ba class of nouns, otherwise it would take the pronoun yena (in Pedi.) The same is true 24) Cf. p. oo9 below. 25) Dehnke, op. cit., 2ff. 26) M6nnig, op cit., 45. 27) Smith, op. cit., 122; Dehnke, op. cit., 2. Cf. also the praise song quoted above. 28) Casalis, op., cit., 248ff.</page><page sequence="13">I86 Klaus Niirnberger for the concord "o" instead of "a." Rather it belongs to the mo-me class of nouns, in which we find concepts like motse (village, home- stead), mollo (fire), moya (breath, wind), more (plant life), molao (law) etc., all of which are impersonal and intangible, to a certain extent power-laden, entities. 29) The same root is, however, used in the personal mo-ba class for the ancestor spirits (badimo). The basic notion of superiority and dynamistic power is the same, but here it is personal and plural, there it is impersonal and singular. Sometimes also the mo-me class is used for the ancestors (medimo). This may be an indication of their relative loss of existence as concrete persons mentioned earlier. In certain neighbouring Bantu tribes like the Venda this is the normal form (midzimu). Christians seem to use the term in a derogatory sense ("idols"). In any case the class is definitely impersonal. For this reason Setiloane uses the pronoun IT for Modimo. 30) The etymology of the root remains uncertain. In the Sotho languages it appears, apart from the instances quoted above, in the le-ma class as ledimo (whirlwind), and as madimo (cannibals, Southern Sotho.) Legodimo (sky) belongs to the same class, but also contains the locative, which appears in godimo (above.) Setiloane says that the latter two concepts converge in the meaning of "numinousness", a concept which he derives from R. Otto. The root dzimu, common amongst Bantu languages, usually points to spirits or their abode. 31) It is certain that a sort of "beyond" or "superior" is implied in all its uses-beyond the normal human power, beyond normal human ethical behaviour, beyond comprehen- sion or manipulation etc., whether in the positive or the negative sense. Some relate the root to the verb stem go dima (penetrate, per- meate, be extremely cunning.) This would again imply the connotation of dynamistic power. A somewhat artificial conjecture combines the locative (above) with the verb stem go lima (extinguish), so that Modimo would turn out to be the place where the ancestor spirits are "extinguished" (viz. when they are forgotten after a couple of generations. 32) The relation between Modimo and the ancestral spirits is extremely vague. Here again it is important to distinguish existential relevance 29) Setiloane, op. cit., 6; Dehnke, op. cit., 2. 30) Setiloane, op. cit., passim. 31) Smith, op. cit., 117ff. 32) The latter quoted by Hiiselbarth, op. cit., 133.</page><page sequence="14">The Sotho Notion of the Supreme Being 187 from mythological expression. There can be no doubt that the real addressees of prayers and sacrifices are the ancestors themselves and not a further authority beyond, to whom they have to forward the supplications. There is also no doubt that they act - benevolently or malevolently - in their own right and power. Nevertheless there is a connection of some sort and it has to be. After all, dynamistic reality is unitarian. The life-stream of the lineage is part and parcel of a greater whole of dynamistic power. If Modimo is the source of all dynamistic power around, then it is obvious that the ancestors are "closer" to Modimo in the sense that more of such power is at their command than at the command of living. This power they are expec- ted to utilize for the benefit of the living offspring. Put into mythological imagery the ancestors then appear as the mediators (batseta) between man and Modimo. Obviously the example of normal social relationships between a minor and a superior (say a commoner and a chief) through the agency of intermediaries lends itself perfectly to such imagery. But we have to realize that this is mythology, not existential experience. Existentially nothing more can be said than that there is some sort of continuity between the power of the ancestors (i.e. of the lineage) and Modimo as the great beyond of all dynamistic power. It is also clear that the ancestors, though they may seem to be omnipotent at times, are themselves dependent on Modimo and "at his mercy" as much as the living. When Modimo becomes existentially relevant, the ancestors are powerless. The notion of the ancestors' mediatorial function between man and Modimo is widespread among Bantu tribes. As we have shown, the underlying existential experience is perfectly well expressed by this imagery, which is derived from the normal social life of any African tribe. For this reason it is not very probable that the notion developed only under the impact of the Christian preaching. What is possible, however, is that the Christian emphasis on the omnipotence of God and the necessity of mediation between God and man through Christ led to a sort of degradation and subordination of the ancestors under Modimo, thus leading to a more definite and conscious resump- tion of an originally very vague notion of little existential significance. 33) It is, however, also very revealing to note that the tendency of ancestors to lose more and more of their existence as 33) I.

This progressive depersonalization in the direction of the Supreme Being is also recorded for East Africa by Mbiti. 34) The fact that Modimo is not existentially experienced as a person does not mean to say that he is not conceived of as a person. We have to note the difference, however, between an existential experience of God which is essentially personal and a mythological personification of an existential experience which is essentially impersonal. Modimo is personified by all tribes under review, often in the direction of demi- gods with human characteristics. He has a variety of names. He has anthropomorphic traits. He may be conceived of as a sort of "creator" of man and the world. He is said to have spoken under certain circumstances etc. But all this does not mean to say that he is essentially a person. Modimo is mythologically personified. And these personifications naturally open the way for the isolated instances in which he is addressed in prayer. But these are secondary develop- ments, the very scarcity of which proves that Africans are not sure of themselves when they act in this way. You do not speak freely if you are not sure that you are being listened to. It is not always possible to distinguish the personifications of Modimo from certain demi-gods, who are either conceived as "son" of Modimo or as the prime ancestor of man, even of a certain royal lineage, thus becoming the god of a tribe. The Bakwena personify Modimo as Hubeane, the Bafurutshe as Thobega, 35) who is again ranked as a demi-god by Schapera, 36) and a royal ancestor and tribal god by Casalis. 37) The Pedi call Modimo Kgobe, the dimin- utive of which (Kgobeane) is said to be his son, who is also called Thobejane by Northern Transvaal tribes. Thobejane appears as a name in the Pedi royal genealogy, while Kgobeane is believed to have developed out of the notion of a prime ancestor or cultic hero. The Mamabolo share with the neighbouring (non-Sotho) Venda and also with the Mamabolo the notion that Khuzwane, now in the role of the creator of all things, left footprints on certain rocks in the north when they were still soft. He is also believed to have had 34) J. S.

The Pedi call Modimo Mmopa batho (moulder of men). They believe that Kgobe created the world, plants and animals, while Kgobeane created man. The nearness to the notion of the prime ancestor is evident, especially since there seems to be no conflict with the notion of Modimo being the creator. But the notion of creation is in itself mythological and as such extremely variable. It is reported of the Pedi, Tswana and Southern Sotho that an answer to any question going beyond the existence of the earth is avoided because it is felt to be meaningless speculation. 39) Casalis records a moving search for the truth about the origin of the earth by individuals, who find no answer to their penetrating questions in the old world-view. Dehnke asked an old diviner whether Thobega found the earth when he came or whether the earth found him when it appeared. His informant maintained categorically that this was a wrong question to ask. It is clear that a myth is not meant to be pressed to yield satisfying answers, but merely expresses the ineffable. Thus Setiloane says: There is no story of creation, not even of the creation of man. If MODIMO is to be designated as Creator, it must be as one who eternally generates both himself and his manifestations... MODIMO is motlhodi, the source, originating in unrecorded time, of the stream of life which flows into indeterminate future and is ever returning to its source. 40) Minnig too asserts that there are many myths of origin but none related to creation. The only myth of origin connected with Modimo is a fable-like story on the origin of death, in which the messenger of death, the lizard, overtook the messenger of life, the chameleon. Both were sent by Modimo. 41) In short, the underlying existential experience of Modimo is the impersonal dynamist "source of reality" while any notion of a creator is either a secondary mythologumenon or Christian influence. 42) To summarize, Modimo denotes the sometimes benevolently, sometimes dangerously close superiority of dynamistic power which 38) Dehnke, op. cit., I; MSnnig, op. cit., 45; Hiselbarth, op. cit., 134. 39) Mannig, op. cit., 47; Dehnke, op. cit., 3; Casalis, op. cit., 238ff. 40) Setiloane, op. cit., II. 41) Casalis, op. cit., 242; Monnig, op. cit., 46; Hiselbarth, op. cit., 135. 42) Cf.

He is the power in all the multiplicity of forces which make up experienced reality. It is, however, mis- leading to apply Western pantheistic or panentheistic terms of reference to this experience. Modimo is an experiential, not a speculative concept. Somehow he is the source of everything that happens or that happens to exist, but only in as far as it becomes existentially relevant. And this relevance becomes operational only in as far as these aspects or dimensions of reality are beyond human expectation, comprehension, manipulation and influence. For this reason there are so many apparent contradictions about Modimo. He can be the Creator, Lord and Bearer of all moral virtues. But he can also be the destructive, almost satanic power, which controls "even in the last resort natural disasters and the wickedness of baloi" (sorcerers) 43) or the one who cheats men of their lives. The powers which Modimo represents are neutral. So the personification of these powers can switch either way, depending on the impact that experienced reality happens to make on man. But why must there be such a concept at all ? The nearest English equivalent to Modimo is "fate" or, with some reservations, "fortune". The word "fate" represents our attempt to come to grips with the un- predictable powers of reality which leave no room for comprehension or control, and which have such an enormous impact on life, even in the technological age. Just think, e.g., of an accident on the way to the beach. To be confronted with the unknown is frightening. A summarizing concept which expresses the undefinable brings psy- chological relief, because it seems to make the ineffable more familiar, less uncanny, easier to bear. It seems to offer a source or reason and this relieves the senselessness of the unpredictable. Once you can name it, you can react to it, even if the only possible reaction is surrender and accommodation. The exclamation Ke Modimo ! has exactly the same emotional quality of relief-in-resignation as the 43) Setiloane, ibid., 13. Setiloane describes Modimo in terms of Rudolf Otto's mysterium tremendum et fascinans. For him Modimo is the source of bomodimo which he translates as "mysterious numinousness". While I almost totally agree with Setiloane's analysis I feel that these terms of reference are not quite adequate, since they seem to suggest a revelation or manifestation of a divinity of some sort. On the other hand Tempels' force vitale is too much connected with "life." Dynamistic power can be "life-force", but it can also be the power of a storm, lightning, a falling three.</page><page sequence="18">The Sotho Notion of the Supreme Being 191 secularized German expression Schicksal! To give it a proper name is a further step in the same direction. It allows man to come to a sort of face to face encounter with the inevitable. At the same time some "archetypal" connotations like "Great Mother" etc., which are not satisfactorily catered for by the ancestors, may be attached to the notion, but without much certainty and stability. Name-giving plays an important role in our psychological penetra- tion and management of experienced reality, especially that which is beyond control. On the other hand precisely this contraction of experienced reality into a name is dangerous. You may invoke the unpredictable and bring disaster on to yourself and your group. It was even forbidden to stare up into the sky. The more aloof Modimo remains, the better. What we have said earlier about the lineage as a religious entity now falls into perspective. The life-force of the lineage is, as it were, the "spine" of the "body" of dynamistic powers which can be known, channelled and balanced in a profitable way. In view of the un- predictable and potentially dangerous quality of dynamistic reality as a whole, nobody dare dislocate this carefully maintained equilib- rium. For this reason the tribe is organized hierarchically and everybody is given his predefined status and role within the community. You take no chances if you are surrounded by a potential threat of chaotic forces. Everybody has to know his place and his limited range of the manipulation of powers. Obviously the most experienced have to be in charge. And obviously too a private manipulation of powers against others or against the group (sorcery) must be the most horrible crime. Due to their more elevated position in the lineage the ancestors have to be the main authority. This is why they play such an important role in the daily routine of the tribe. Beyond their reach the endless ocean of dynamistic reality continues. This is only the more reason to rally together under their leadership and protection. The strong urge for unity of world-view and social coherence so often observed in African cultures seems to be rooted in this experience of being exposed to unpredic- table forces beyond human control, represented by Modimo or his equivalents. It is not pantheistic and very different from its Indian counterpart. It notoriously excludes other groups, especially if they are hostile. It is like a house which keeps the dangerous forces of nature outside and the warmth of the family inside. It is a psycho- logical necessity under such circumstances.</page><page sequence="19">192 Klaus Niirnberger THE IMPACT OF THE CHRISTIAN PROCLAMATION In the first place the Basotho encountered the Christian faith as the life-force of a new community. The identification of "Christian" with "European" in the initial stages of this encounter can hardly be surprising. The Basotho were frightened by this new power. At the same time they were intrigued by it. It seemed to open a new realm of manipulation of dynamistic power hitherto unknown to them. The missionary became the representative and at the same time the door-keeper of this new dimension. Most respected him and his special realm and kept aloof as they had always done over against strangers. Suspicion looms large in Africa - and with good reason! But a growing number was fascinated by the prospects of entering into the new community through the open door of the missionary. Once they entered it could happen that they were drawn into the power sphere of what theologians call the Word of God, the Holy Spirit and the Church. It is not difficult to imagine how the few who came to believe comprehended their new experience. It must have been very similar to what they knew before. Doubtlessly it was conceived in a dynamistic way on the nmodel of traditional thought patterns. And where it was not, it is hard to imagine that it was conceived at all. The old traditions had a lot of secrecy and mystery about them. So the Sotho Christians were hardly disturbed by the fact that there were certain incomprehensible elements in the new way of life and its institutions. They had to be taken for granted without further questions. This was as things were done and without doubt Moruti (teacher, pastor, missionary) knew best what was right. There was a new lineage distinct from others of the same order (the Christian denomination) besowed with a new life-force (Word and Spirit), into which you were integrated by means of a new ritual (Baptism), in which you partook regulary through another new ritual (Holy Communion), in which there was a new hierarchy (Sunday school children, confirmands, youth groups, prayer women, elders, evangelists, pastors, deans, bishops), in which the stages of life were marked by new passage rites (infant baptism, confirmation, the blessing of a marriage, consecration or induction into offices, the Christian funeral), in which there was a new ethical code which you could not transgress without seriously disturbing the balance of power, and so on. This seems to be the root of the legalistic inflexibility of "younger crurches" in Africa. "The dynamistic experience and comprehension</page><page sequence="20">The Sotho Notion of the Supreme Being 193 of reality is not yet broken. The greatest danger is felt to be any kind of chaotic confusion, a danger which can only be kept at bay by means of a defined system of ethics, ritual and hierarchical order - whether of the old tribal or the new denominational type. No wonder then that all the innovations have to be warranted by being derived from the mediators of the new life-force concerned. The use of drums and dancing was considered strictly taboo in our Northern Transvaal congregations (originally they were too deeply associated with heathen connotations), until young missionaries gradually reintroduced them. Now they are greatly enjoyed by old and young alike. The new lineage also had a new ancestry: nearest to the living they were the early missionaries, then some of their predecessors (Luther, Calvin, Zinzendorf, Wesley, Thomas, the saints and apostles). But the prime ancestor overshadowing and enabling all others was Jesus. They came to know him through the Biblical narratives - which were regularly and vividly related in the new community - as they had known their more distant ancestors and heros through legends. His pre-existence and supernatural birth presented no difficulties in the context of tribal thinking: prime ancestors and heroes do have a mysterious mythological origin. Neither did his death or resurrection: ancestors also die and live afterwards in a new, more powerful existence. Of course Christ was man and God at the same time: all ancestors are. But the most important thing about him was that he was the prime source of the life-force of the new lineage. Every living member of the community regularly partook in this life-force through the ritual of the Eucharist, in which Christ's "body and blood" was mysteriously received. His function - to die for the forgiveness of sins - was clouded in mystery, as all sacrificial processes are. But since sin could only be conceived as a disturbance in the relation between a person and another person representing the life-force of the lineage, through a transgression of the rules that keep the powers in balance, familiar thought patterns could easily be made to apply. Forgiveness meant appeasement of the wronged and reintegration into the life-force of the community - a fact which was symbolized by the ritual of reacceptance after church discipline had been exercised. So far there seems to be no difficulty. All aspects could be con- ceived perfectly well within the realm of dynamistic patterns of</page><page sequence="21">194 Klaus Niirnberger experience and comprehension. This does not mean to say that there was no real break and conversion. But this break was an existential, not an intellectual one. There was a conflict between the claim of the traditional lineage and the life-force of the new com- munity for absolute allegiance. And on absolute allegiance depended "true life" or "salvation" both here and there. Believers had to change over from the ancestry of "Adam" to the ancestry of "Christ" (Romans 5). And this is where the difficulty arose. It was a comprehensive break - religiously, ethically, socially. It was not an easy step to take at all. For the first generation of Christians the answer seemed to lie in a forthright rejection of any claim from the side of the old traditions. You could either belong to the lineage of the fathers or to the "new man", Christ. This clear stand entailed a lot of suffering - socially, bodily, psychologically. There was genuine martyrdom among the Sotho. The experience of the new power seemed to be so overwhelm- ing that all temptations were overcome. For the subsequent generations the case was no longer so obvious. They were born as Christians and did not know why they differed from their tribal fellows. Closed Christian communities - especially on mission farms - lost acquaintance with and appreciation of the old traditions to a con- siderable degree. The tribesmen were considered to be uneducated and primitive. Through resettlement, industrialization, urbanization, secularization of education and the revitalization of traditional social authorities by the state, these second and third generation Christians were again confronted with the religion of their forebears, in a new way. Now it was no longer certain to whom they belonged. The Christian way of life continued to be rather foreign in its Western form, while the newly experienced life-force of the lineage and the tribe breathed the atmosphere of Africa. There was no question of going back to the "primitive" and uneducated stage. But it became fascinating enough to call for a reappraisal. The spiritualistic and in- dividualistic interpretation of the Gospel by pietistic missionaries did not do justice to the bodily and social comprehensiveness of the Afri- can experience of reality. Christian community life was too superficial. Rites of passage were too feeble. Healing was secularized and unable to reach into deeper layers of disease in the context of dynamistic experience. The socially destructive force of guilt was not covered by the pietistic form of the Gospel. Christ himself was not as familiar and near as the fathers whom they had known and respected before they died. The outward advantages of education and participation in</page><page sequence="22">The Sotho Notion of the Supreme Being 195 the "modem" way of life were seen to be disassociable from the Christian faith and the congregation of believers, which laid undue restraints on the newly-gained freedom of the individual. Within the new congregations themselves much hypocrisy emerged. So what next ? One way was to return to the bosom of the lineage and the tribe. Thus there are hundreds of "backsliders" in the Sotho community. Or you could try to harmonize the two realms. Many members of our congregations are faithful church-goers on Sunday mornings but at night you also find them in secret vigils where magic rites are performed, or where an "independent" prophet offers his healing powers. Many youths attend confirmation classes and the Sotho initiation school at the same time. A third possibility is pre- sented by the so-called "Independent Church Movement", which offers all sorts of African penetrations of the Christian faith or Christian penetrations of the African religion. And finally, of course, there is still the possibility of seeking the "European" way of life and building on the heritage of the missionary. This is what the intellectual and progressive elite have to a very large extent chosen to do. But there are also simple congregation members of considerable spiritual depth for whom the white missionaries continue to be the only valid mediators of the new life-force. African clergy are believed to be only those who pass on what they have received from the whites and have to struggle for recognition of their own spiritual and theological authority. But what about Modimo? To a certain extent it seems as if the Christian faith could penetrate African religious patterns and replace some of their more immediate aspects without a major change in the existential experience underlying the notion of Modimo. He would retain his basic character as the Source of all dynamistic power, who is infinitely beyond human prediction, comprehension, or influence. Confronted with the will of Modimo man could only accquiesce. There is, however, a certain change of emphasis. When Christian Basotho say Ke Modimo ! in a case of unexpected death it expresses a sort of sigh of relief: "Thank Goodness, we do not have to think in terms of sorcery - God is in charge here!" Nevertheless there continues to be a sort of fatalistic attitude connected with the concept: "Who can resist? Does he not know best? Does he not have his purposes ?" But this is true only to a certain extent. Christ, the "prime ancestor" of the new lineage, was not the ultimate authority. He was</page><page sequence="23">Ig6 Klaus Niirnberger sent by Modimo. The Christian faith added a new dimension to the existential relevance of the concept hitherto unknown to the Sotho. And that was the self-disclosure of Modimo as a person in his claim and his promise. Till then Modimo was a mythological personification of an essentially impersonal experience. Nobody really knew what he could expect from Modimo. But the concept and the content which it denoted was claimed or usurped by a new personal power, which extended an unconditional claim to be acknowledged as the Author, Owner and Lord of reality as a whole, the Source of life and death, the Giver of an absolute Law, which man has to fulfil, the only and final Judge. This God spoke. He defined man's identity as that of the creature of God, meant to be adopted into the privileges and obligations of sonship. He demanded exclusive loyalty. He challenged man as having forfeited his purpose and destination by disobedience. He interpreted the incomprehensible impact of fate as the result of a clash between the will and the actions of the living God on the one hand and the situtions and processes of human existence and cosmic history as a whole on the other. He provided for redemption by sending his Son, Jesus Christ, into the world, and expected man to accept this one and only offer. All these were immediate and personal claims and promises calling for man's reaction and decision. Modimo, as he was known, never did that before. The unknown, ineffable, unmanageable Source of dynamistic reality changed into a majestic paramount chief, who ruled the whole of the universe as his creation and possession and who in his infinite mercy took the trouble to condescend and redeem man on his own level. This address demanded an answer. You had to acknowledge his Lordship. But once you did you were also entitled to address him as your personal Guide and Protector. Modimo became the "Father" who infinitely fulfilled and surpassed every- thing that the word "father" had always meant to the Sotho. That was a novelty unheard of before. From the unknown beyond, which could not be reached by human religious initiative, Modimo moved into the centre of man's devotion, praise, supplication, intercession, obedience, assurance and hope. He was still the great "beyond," but he proved to have a heart. And this heart could be conquered - in fact it wanted to be conquered. The impact of a new personal encounter with Modimo brought an identification between Christ and Modimo to all intents and purposes. The "people of God" was identical with the "flock of Christ" and</page><page sequence="24">The Sotho Notion of the Supreme Being 197 both were seen in contrast to those belonging to the old tribe. With this identification the contrast between the God of the Old and the New Testament disappeared or never emerged. The result was that Christ was conceived as very definitely subordinate and instrumental to the purposes and acts of Modimo. And from here it is but a small step for him to be replaced by other "prophets" and to lose his existential relevance and unique significance altogether. New religious movements both inside and outside the established churches tend to be Hebraistic (to use a term of H. W. Turner). God then becomes the Creator and Law-giver for the small com- munity of the elect who acts through a living prophet. The function of Christ becomes more or less redundant. He may at best have been the prophet for the Whites. The new law, the new way of life, the new ritual, all proclaimed and enacted on behalf of Modimo becomes the centre of religion, a religion which is based on obedience and discipline, but also on the impartation of divine power through the prophet, especially in a therapeutic sense. A similar phenomenon appears in the political movement of Black Awareness, especially in its theological branch. On account of the spiritualistic and individualistic character of missionary piety Modimo continued to be the personal God of the devoted believer or of a religious sect. But the political and social situation gave impetus to a rediscovery of Yahweh, the God of the Old Testament, in a more comprehensive way. He was the God of a whole nation, the God who had entered into a covenant of Shalom (peace and prosperity) with this nation, the God who called, enabled and directed charismatic political leaders, the great Actor behind the scenes of history, the Liberator from oppression, the Giver of the land, the Guarantor of economic prosperity and justice, the social Reformer. The image of Christ as the suffering servant of God, if at all retained, was adapted to Yahweh and changed into the image of the Black Liberator, who was the representative and channel of the life-force of national resurrection and revitalisation. This new theological trend, origi- nating elsewhere, found fertile ground at least in certain circles, especially among the intellectual youth. Where such a vision of God went beyond conscious construction for the sake of political effectiveness and gained religious content it soon had to battle with difficulties. The Whites had rather naively identified themselves with the Israelites as the chosen race in their conquest of the northern parts of the country which traditionally '4</page><page sequence="25">198 Klaus Niirnberger belonged to the Sotho. And since their power proved to be superior ever since-was Yahweh not a God of the Whites after all ? Were the Jews themselves not white ? Was Africa not to return to its own religious roots if it was to conquer the power of the white man ' Or in another possible version: The prophets proclaimed judgment on an idolatrous nation. Were the Basotho not perhaps - on account of the sins of their fathers, or on account of their continuing choice of wrong ways and respect for wrong ultimates - the discarded people, given into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar ? Were they not to fulfil the Law and wait until the wrath of God subsides, until a new deliverance from Egypt, a new return from Babylonic exile would become possible? Alternatively: If you call on this God and there is no meaningful answer, if you fight for your rights and you lose the battle, if you continue to be poor, tossed about, despised, unemployed, miserable for all your piety - what then is the use of prayer and obedience ? Were the fathers not right when they felt that basically Modimo cannot be approached with personal or national concerns and requests, that things just happen and you do not know why, that all you can do is to strengthen the life-force which happens to carry you through immediate necessities and forget about the rest ? Was the original notion of Modimo not after all the most appropriate interpretation of experienced reality on a merciless continent ? There seems to be a close connection between the agnosticism of the intellectual elite and the religious indifference of the disillusioned labourer. THEOLOGICAL EVALUATION The impact of the Christian proclamation on the Sotho religion produced a great variety of possible notions of Modimo. It is relati- vely easy, however, to distinguish four basic types: first, the un- predictable, uncomprehensible, unmanageable Source of experienced reality; second, the Guarantor of a covenant, the Giver of the Law, the impeccable Judge of the community of the elect or of the nations; third, the merciful Father, who institutes as a means of redemption the suffering self-exposure of Christ to the enmity of sinful man; fourth, the personal Source and Channel of the life-force of a new community which is to substitute the old lineage and its ancestry. An existential analysis of the processes of the Christian faith reveals that these four types are in fact stages of discernment in which each subsequent stage claims to be paradoxically identical with</page><page sequence="26">The Sotho Notion of the Supreme Being 199 the former stage. We are here confronted with the dimensions of the existential experience underlying the formulation of the trinitarian doctrine in the early history of the Church: the convenant- God of the Old Testament usurped authorship and authority over against all cosmic powers ("Father"); the God of redemption, manifest in the life and the fate of the man Jesus of Nazareth, claimed to be the final revelation of the God of the Old Testament ("Son" or "Logos"); the God who called, accepted and integrated man into the new humanity through the proclamation of the Gospel and the sacramental enactments had no other theme than what happened in Christ ("Holy Spirit"). The doctrine of the Trinity is an ontological paradox. Partly this is due to outdated Hellenistic patterns of thought. But the underlying existential experience can still be described as a creative identifica- tion of conflicting entities. The Source of daily experienced reality does not seem to be identical with the God of a covenant relationship. The Lawgiver and Judge does not seem to be identical with a God of unconditional love and redemptive recreation of a sinful world. The God who is said to have acted in Christ long ago and far away does not seem to be identical with the God whose claim and self- giving concern we experience here and now in the Word, the sacraments and the community of believers. And yet the Word proclaims them to be one. And wherever faith materializes on ac- count of this proclamation the unity between these elements in spite of the tensions between them becomes an existential reality. But the existing tensions inevitably produce sectarian forms, where the Word does not fully reach its goal. The impersonal God of fate and the personal Creator of history and nature, the God of justice and the God of redemptive love, the God of history, and the God of existential encounter break apart. One dimension is emphasized over against the other. Some dimension may be lost altogether or never be discovered. Throughout its history the Christian faith had to struggle with its own pathological forms. African Christianity is no exception. This is why for all generations faith was considered to be something miraculous, which man on his own cannot achieve, which is the creation and gift of the divine Word itself. But where faith starts to materialize man starts to discover the redemptive action of a merciful God who involves him into the dynamics of his own love right within the horrifying impact of an unpredictable fate or right under the threats of ultimate judgment</page><page sequence="27">200 Klaus Niirnberger and condemnation. And this discovery makes him both hopefully assured and joyfully active in the face of fate and failure, confident that the limits of his comprehension and action are not the bounds of God's concern nor of his redemptive and recreative power. And this too is a possibility which I know to be real in the Sotho Church which I serve.</page></plain_text>
