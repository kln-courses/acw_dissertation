<plain_text><page sequence="1">PAUL G. BEIDLER The Postmodern Sublime: Kant and Tony Smith's Anecdote of the Cube We must endure our thoughts all night, until The bright obvious stands motionless in cold.' In this paper I characterize minimalism as a movement toward the postmodern sublime. My sublime shall be the Kantian one, and to ex- plain my use of the term "postmodern" I invoke Jean-Frangois Lyotard, whose work has inspired much of the present essay. In the afterward to The Postmodern Condition, Lyotard argues that modernist art "presents the fact that the unpre- sentable exists,"2 thereby alluding to the sub- lime. Thus allusion is central to the modernist project: modernism makes "an allusion to the unpresentable by means of visible presenta- tions."3 Postmodernism, "undoubtedly a part of the modern,"4 shares with the modern a reliance on the sublime, but in the postmodern there is no allusion: "The postmodern would be that which, in the modern, puts forward the unpresentable in the presentation itself." The difference, then, is that if modernism alludes to the sublime, postmodernism is itself sublime. In the latter, all links with beauty are severed-the sublime replaces beauty. Such, at least, is the hypothesis that this paper begins to examine. Following Hal Foster and others, I see mini- malism as an historical crux: it seems to exem- plify both the culmination of the modern and the dawn of the postmodern. Foster calls mini- malism "a brisure of (post)modern art, an in- between moment of a paradigm shift."5 But if the minimalism of Robert Morris, Donald Judd, Tony Smith, et al. does have certain obvious affinities to modernism, these affinities do not include an allusion to the unpresentable-mini- malism does not allude. And so it is the "post- modern" aspect of minimalism that will con- cern me here. Because of its proximity to the milieu of modernism and the force of its rebel- lion against it, minimalism is one of the earliest and most poignant developments of postmod- ern art. It is a step, I will argue, toward an authentic artistic realization of the sublime. In 1923 Wallace Stevens wrote what is now his best-known poem, "The Anecdote of the Jar": I placed a jar in Tennessee, And round it was, upon a hill. It made the slovenly wilderness Surround that hill. The wilderness rose up to it, And sprawled around, no longer wild. The jar was round upon the ground And tall and of a port in air. It took dominion everywhere. The jar was gray and bare. It did not give of bird or bush, Like nothing else in Tennessee.6 In the 1960s architect Tony Smith spoke of a similar jar in terms that are different, yet re- lated, to those Stevens employs, and it is this relation that I am concerned with here. His remarks illuminate both Stevens's fascination with the jar and Smith's own well-known fas- cination with the cube, which he has placed among grass and trees in various sculpture gardens: A Bennington earthenware jar ... has subtlety of color, largeness of form, a general suggestion of substance, generosity, is calm and reassuring-qualities that take it beyond pure utility. It continues to nourish us time and time again. We can't see it in a second, we con- tinue to read it. There is something absurd in the fact that you can go back to a cube in this same way.7 Juxtaposed, Stevens's jar and Smith's six-foot steel cube Die illustrate two primary aspects of The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 53:2 Spring 1995</page><page sequence="2">178 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism minimalist art, authority and serenity, that seem to be in conflict within it and which set mini- malism apart from earlier sculpture. Tony Smith has claimed to be "interested in the thing, not in the effects-the pyramids are only geometry, not an effect."8 Immanuel Kant also insisted that beauty must be free of the emotional. As Kant makes clear in the Critique of Judgment (1790), emotions, which he calls "charms," can play no part in a work of beauty, one that is to be appreciated without interest: "charms may be added to beauty as a supple- ment"; "it is in fact only as aliens that they must, indulgently, be granted admittance when taste is still weak and unpracticed, and only insofar as they do not interfere with the beauti- ful form."9 But the fact that Smith's avoidance of charms and emotions seems to echo Kant's aesthetics of beauty does not imply that his sculptures ought to be considered beautiful. Kant would hardly have thought of a six-foot steel cube as "fine art": he would probably have classified it as "mechanical art" if he called it art at all.10 In ?43 of the third Critique Kant writes that "we refrain from calling any- thing art that we can do the moment we know what is to be done" (CJ 170), and this stricture certainly applies to Smith's Die: "I didn't make a drawing; I just picked up the phone and or- dered it," the artist brags.1" The question, of course, is not what Kant would call art but what we call art, and have called it, but my purpose here is to address this problematic from within the third Critique itself: as Frank Stella remarks, "It's art, or it wants to be art, or it asks to be considered as art, and therefore the terms we have for discussing art are probably good enough."'12 And geometry has its effects, whether Smith is interested in them or not. My point is this: though minimalist artists empha- size the object itself rather than the emotions felt by the viewer, the result of this objectified art is simply a different sort of emotion and far from a charming one. As Anna Chave has re- cently shown, minimalism evokes powerful "effects" and "emotions" in its viewers-ef- fects that have ranged from dread to awe to indifference.13 I will argue here that this is because minimalist art is, or aspires to be, sub- lime rather than beautiful, and that it is in its sublimity that minimalism has had the impact and influence that it has. In the third Critique Kant describes the sub- lime as a consequence of the process of appre- hension and comprehension of objects: we apprehend an object of nature by estimating its magnitude mathematically, and we comprehend it by estimating its magnitude imaginatively, by making a subjective determination of its nature. The sublime is the feeling of helplessness that arises when this process is impeded. We appre- hend something that we cannot comprehend because we cannot compare it with anything on the basis of a necessary "basic measure": "comprehension becomes more and more diffi- cult the farther apprehension progresses, and it soon reaches its maximum, namely, the aesthet- ically largest basic measure for an estimation of magnitude" (CJ 108). "We call sublime," Kant writes, "what is absolutely large"; "That is sub- lime in comparison with which everything else is small" (CJ 103, 105). Just as beauty is plea- sure without interest, the sublime is terror with- out threat: it is precisely "the attempt to incur [fear]" (CJ 129). It is the discomfort we feel when we apprehend something, such as a moun- tain or a storm, that is too immense for the mind to categorize. It is "violence to the inner sense" (CJ 106), but though this violence is "objectively contrapurposive" it is "subjec- tively purposive" (CJ 101); it is a "negative pleasure" (CJ 98). This violence to the inner sense is both terrifying and pleasurable: "For he has the feeling that his imagination is inade- quate for exhibiting the idea of a whole, [a feel- ing] in which imagination reaches its maxi- mum, and as it strives to expand that maximum, it sinks back into itself, but consequently comes to feel a liking [that amounts to an] emotion" (CJ 109). The sublime is painful, but its vio- lence is empowering because "to be able even to think of the infinite as a whole indicates a mental power that surpasses any standard of sense" (CJ 111). It is a "mental agitation" (CJ 101): "This agitation (above all at its inception) can be compared with a vibration, i.e., with a rapid alternation of repulsion from, and attrac- tion to, the same object" (CJ 115). There are thus two moments of the sublime, dread and awe, and the sublime is confusing because of this vibration, the virtual simultaneity of these opposing moments. It is possible, therefore, to mistake the sublime for either beauty or ugli- ness, hence the ambiguity of the term's usage,</page><page sequence="3">Beidler The Postmodern Sublime: Kant and Tony Smith's Anecdote of the Cube 179 but the sublime is of an essentially different character from either of these. Comprehension, in normal situations, "cancels the condition of time" by allowing us to grasp "a multiplicity in a unity,"'14 but with the sublime this instan- taneous comprehension becomes impossible. This feeling of frustration is alluring, however, because of the new dimension of time-it is a feeling of endlessness, of eternity. Unlike beauty, the sublime is not an attribute that individual objects can be said to possess inherently: "this liking [for the sublime] is by no means a liking for the object (since that may be formless), but rather a liking for the expan- sion of the imagination itself" (CJ 105).15 Unlike many of his contemporaries, Kant did not see beauty as an objective attribute, but the "univer- sal subjective validity" of a liking of the beauti- ful often leads us to speak of beauty as an attrib- ute, though it "is nothing by itself" (CJ 62, 63). The "true" sublime, by contrast, "must be sought only in the mind of the judging person, not in the natural object the judging of which prompts this mental attunement" (CJ 113). Hence, though neither the sublime nor beauty is an objective quality, it is significantly less erro- neous to objectify beauty than it is the sublime. While beauty is, or might as well be, an attri- bute ("the purposiveness [of beauty] does have its basis in the object and its shape" [CJ 142]), the sublime is an emotion, a state of mind: Thus the vast ocean heaved up by storms cannot be called sublime. The sight of it is horrible; and one must already have filled one's mind with all sorts of ideas if such an intuition is to attune it to a feeling that is itself sublime, inasmuch as the mind is in- duced to abandon sensibility and occupy itself with ideas containing a higher purposiveness. (CJ 99) In appreciating objects of beauty we search for a standard against which beauty can be mea- sured or judged rigorously, but for the sublime we require "a basis merely within ourselves and in the way of thinking that introduces sublimity into our presentation of nature" (CJ 100). Thus the only "thing" that can be said to be sublime is reason itself, or perhaps God. The sublime has been said to have replaced beauty as the fascination of our age,16 and because no work of art can ever really be sub- lime this replacement causes peculiar problems for artists. Since we know a priori that the sub- lime can never be articulated,17 the task of the artist who aims to produce art in an aesthetic of the sublime may appear to be a futile one. To attempt the sublime in art, it would seem, is to lie: such a sublime is necessarily fake, impossi- ble, and artificial.18 This is both because art can never have the magnitude required to pro- duce the feeling of the sublime and because in such art the link between the artist and the viewer is necessarily severed: the viewer (and therefore the artist, too) will be interested less in the art object than in the feelings it produces. But the fact that the sublime cannot be pre- sented becomes irrelevant when art loses inter- est in presentation, as is the case with minimal- ism. I argue that minimalism accepts and even espouses the paradox of the sublime as Lyotard has described it in The Inhuman: The paradox of art "after the sublime" is that it turns towards a thing which does not turn towards the mind, that it wants a thing, or has it in for a thing which wants nothing of it. After the sublime, we find ourselves after the will. ... The Thing is not waiting to be destined, it is not waiting for anything, it does not call on the mind. How can the mind situate itself, get in touch with something that withdraws from every relationship? ... It does not offer itself up to dialogue and dialectic.19 The beautiful object condescends with a Mona Lisa smile-to Schiller beauty is like a child- hood nurse.20 The sublime object turns away, and the result is, or can be, the sublime. Is it now possible for the artist legitimately to produce the sublime instead of beauty? Kant does not say that a work of art cannot inspire an awareness of the sublime-he hints that "the sublime in art is always confined to the condi- tions that [art] must meet to be in harmony with nature" (CJ 98). It would be virtually impossi- ble, however, for anything to be both beautiful and sublime at once: the sublime object may be formless and is necessarily "contrapurposive," hence Jacques Derrida's reminder that "there is no good example, no 'suitable' example of the sublime in the products of human art."'21 Turner described the sublime in his land- and sea- scapes, and Newman absorbed it as metaphor in his vast canvasses of the 1950s,22 but neither actually produced sublime objects in the Kant-</page><page sequence="4">180 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism ian sense-these works cannot evoke dread without a certain penchant for absorption on the part of the viewer. But I want to argue that Tony Smith's cube is a better example of sub- lime art-it relies on such a penchant to a sig- nificantly lesser degree.23 Michael Fried, for whom such work is supposedly "uncompel- ling," uses such words as "obtrusiveness," "ag- gressiveness," "disquieting," and "infectious" to describe the works he insists on deeming "merely interesting," claiming repeatedly that minimalism is "at war" with art.24 Like Fried, Anna Chave condemns minimalism from a modernist avant-garde point of view, drawing attention to its fascist overtones. She rightly points out that minimalist work "achieved what self-identified avant-gardists found increas- ingly difficult: it induced a sharp fission, an intensely negative response."25 Chave surmises that though the public often loathed minimalist work (she cites the case of Serra's Tilted Arc), it detested it for the same reasons that it detested its own miserable existence, but I think it is necessary to remember that the response of the public to minimalism was never purely or sim- ply negative as such. Rosalind Krauss has artic- ulated the "extraordinary beauty" of minimalist works26 and the new museums that are emerg- ing to accommodate them: she even refers to one Judd piece as "startlingly sensuous, almost voluptuous."27 What minimalism "induced," in many cases, and more importantly, what it was often intended to induce and continues to induce, is a Kantian "negative pleasure" (em- phasis mine). Kant writes of the Egyptian pyramids that in order to get the full emotional effect of the pyra- mids one must neither get too close to them nor stay too far away. For if one stays too far away, then the apprehended parts (the stones on top of one another) are presented only obscurely, and hence their presen- tation has no effect on the subject's aesthetic judg- ment; and if one gets too close, then the eye needs some time to complete the apprehension from the base to the peak, but during that time some of the earlier parts are invariably extinguished in the imag- ination before it has apprehended the later ones, and hence the comprehension is never complete. (CJ 108) I want to look at the extent to which this restric- tion of position applies to the viewer of mini- malist artworks, which will show a clear link between these works and the sublimity of Kant's pyramids. Robert Morris, in a seminal article on minimalism called "Notes on Sculp- ture," has sought to define the parameters of minimalist sculpture by citing a famous conver- sation with Tony Smith about his cube: Q: Why didn't you make it larger so that it would loom over the observer? A: I was not making a monument. Q: Then why didn't you make it smaller so that the observer could see over the top? A: I was not making an object.28 Monuments include too much of the space around them, but objects do not utilize this space at all,29 and Smith was after something in between. A colossal work might give the viewer something like the first of the two moments of the sublime, the sense of dread, by making him or her feel small or insignificant, unwelcome or even unsafe, but this was never Smith's inten- tion: A sphere is unnecessarily exclusive; it's the most intense form, turns everything else out. Flat sides allow things to exist outside as well as inside. The sphere is more of a fortress. In military architecture, when things get rough, surfaces are curved. You can move around a cube, get in the shadow, see the planes; it's a social form.30 An object small and stylized enough to be called "charming," on the other hand, could inspire a feeling similar to awe, the second moment, by making the viewer want to cherish or even fondle the piece. The ideal minimalist piece derives its power from its ability to evoke dread and awe alternately or concurrently by both attracting and repelling the viewer at once and utilizing the space around it.31 It does this not so much by offending the viewer's notion of what art should be, like Duchamp's ready- mades did, as by simply being attractive and keeping the viewer at a distance at the same time-in other words, by commanding respect, the "negative pleasure" of the sublime. Mini- malism aims to produce the feeling of the sub- lime, then, paradoxically, not by being huge but by being just the right size, by attaining what Morris calls "non-dominating, non-compressed</page><page sequence="5">Beidler The Postmodern Sublime: Kant and Tony Smith's Anecdote of the Cube 181 presence."32 Though the minimalist piece does not woo with charming decoration or intimi- date with immense size, it is still manipulative, and more intensely so than if it were either an object or a monument. This is because it uses the sublime, the common ground shared by seduction and intimidation, to keep the viewer in place over time. Stella is against the absorp- tion or immersion within the text that many modernist works demand, and the power of his work, like that of the minimalists, derives in part from his need to prohibit this absorption. In an interview Stella said: One could stand in front of any Abstract-Expression- ist work for a long time, and walk back and forth, and inspect the depths of the pigment and the inflec- tion and all the painterly brushwork for hours. But I wouldn't particularly want to do that and also I wouldn't ask anyone to do it in front of my paintings. To go further, I would like to prohibit them from doing that in front of my paintings. That's why I make the paintings the way they are.33 It is partly through this sense of seductive pro- hibition that minimalism creates the postmod- ern sublime. Minimalist art, like the sublime and unlike beauty, is endless, and the experience it fosters, like the sublime, takes place over time. As Kant writes in the Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime (1764), "The sublime moves, the beautiful charms"; "A long duration is sublime."34 In an article titled "The Present Tense of Space," Robert Morris confirms this necessary endlessness of minimalist work: "Now images, the past tense of reality, begin to give way to duration, the present tense of im- mediate spatial experience. Time is in this newer work in a way it never was in past sculp- ture."35 This duration is the sublime, which has been transformed by the minimalists from modernist metaphor to postmodern common- place.36 In condemning what he calls "literal- ist" art, Fried writes: the experience in question persists in time, and the presentment of endlessness that, I have been claim- ing, is central to literalist art and theory is essentially a presentment of endless, or indefinite, duration.... The literalist preoccupation with time-more pre- cisely, with the duration of experience-is, I suggest, paradigmatically theatrical: as though theater con- fronts the beholder, and thereby isolates him, with the endlessness not just of objecthood but of time; or as though the sense which, at bottom, theater ad- dresses is a sense of temporality, of time both passing and to come, simultaneously approaching and reced- ing, as if apprehended in an infinite perspective.37 The piece of minimalist sculpture that both approaches and recedes, teasing the viewer's sensibilities, derives its power by retaining the viewer's attendance as well as his or her atten- tion, as is the case in theater. And so what is created is less a work than a situation of "social forms": as Morris notes, "it is just this distance between object and subject that creates a more extended situation, for physical participation becomes necessary."38 Each piece initiates a drama in which subject and object interact almost as equals. Hence Fried's condemnation of minimalism as "paradigmatically theatrical" does more than compare the minimalist situa- tion with that of the theater: it also accuses these artists of anthropomorphism. "One way of describing what Smith was making," Fried has written, if his cube was to be neither a monument nor an object, "might be something like a surrogate person-that is, a kind of statue"; "a kind of latent or hidden naturalism, indeed anthropomorphism, lies at the core of literalist theory and practice."39 Indeed, Smith's cube is the length of a man's height in all direc- tions,40 and to Fried the minimalist aesthetic is an attempt to make works come alive, to epito- mize their objecthood. By doing so, he argues, they become theatrical and declare war on art by creating art "between the arts. "41 But a cru- cial distinction has to be made here: this theat- ricality is a declaration of war on beauty, not on art. It is a radical attempt at the sublime in art, and if it constitutes a break with the modernist project it is also, as many have noted, its cul- mination. These elements of size, time, and theatri- cality in minimalism can be subsumed under the more general heading of simplicity. Mini- mal art is often symmetrical, but Donald Judd reminds us that the goal is not symmetry so much as simplicity: "I don't have any ideas as to symmetry. My things are symmetrical because as [Stella] said, I wanted to get rid of composi- tional effects, and the obvious way to do it is to</page><page sequence="6">182 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism be symmetrical."42 Robert Morris clarifies this with his doctrine of unitary forms:43 "Sim- plicity of shape does not necessarily equate with simplicity of experience. Unitary forms do not reduce relationships. They order them."44 The viewer of minimalism is given no textures to examine or intricacies or relationships to explore-there is only a presence that presents itself to be felt. Compositional effects create a situation of intimacy between viewer and ob- ject, and also within the work itself, that mini- malists feel is false and violates the integrity of the work. Morris, Stella, and Judd are against the language of textual relationships and con- trasts that modernism used to convey meaning and energy. Minimalism is a manifestation of the renunciation of this language-it is art that is meant to be public, not private. The simple "situations" that Morris and Stella want to cre- ate are chaste, social, public situations like those one might find in a Henry James novel: as Hal Foster has noted, "even as minimalism turned from the object orientation of formalism to the subject orientation of phenomenology, it tended to treat the perceiver as historically innocent, sexually indifferent-as did the insti- tution-critical art that developed out of mini- malism."45 This voyeuristic chastity, the ele- ment of time involved with experiencing these pieces, and their theatrical nature are all mani- festations of the simplicity of the minimalist aesthetic, and it is this simplicity that many formalist critics, in their search for beauty, have found most offensive about it. Kant writes that regularity "does not allow us to be entertained for long by our contemplation of it; instead it bores us" (CJ 93), and Fried takes Kant's claim one clever step further: "Literalist work is often condemned-when it is condemned-for being boring. A tougher charge would be that it is merely interesting."46 But minimalist art must be simple, and this is because, as Kant also notes in the Observations, "the sublime must be simple."47 This notion of the simplicity of the sublime is developed further at a crucial point in the third Critique: "Simplicity (artless pur- posiveness) is, as it were, nature's style in the sublime" (CJ 136). Thus it is "nature's style" that minimalist art imitates by relying solely on what Morris terms "unitary forms." Simplicity, of course, like the chastity that I attribute to minimalism, is related to innocence, and innocence is a quality of minimalism that is rarely commented upon. Kant clarifies this re- lation by describing the way the perfection of beauty can easily be reduced to utter dissimula- tion by a sudden intrusion of the sublime senti- ment, and the relevance of this passage to the minimalist aesthetic and to the experience of minimalism, if we imagine Kant to be describ- ing art objects rather than human beings, is uncanny: We laugh at such simplicity as does not yet know how to dissemble, and yet we also rejoice in the natural simplicity here thwarting that art of dissimula- tion. We were expecting the usual custom, the artifi- cial utterance carefully aimed at creating a beautiful illusion-and lo! there is the uncorrupted innocent nature, which we did not at all expect to find, and which is displayed by someone who also had no intention of doing so. Here the beautiful but false illusion, which usually has great significance in our judgement, is suddenly transformed into nothing, so that, as it were, the rogue within us is exposed; and this is what agitates the mind alternatively in two opposite directions, and is what also gives the body a wholesome shaking. (CJ 206)48 Kant links the sublime with human dignity:49 as Paul Crowther has noted, "we inscribe the dignity of our rational being even on that which overwhelms or threatens to destroy."50 It is dig- nity, the "beguiling nafvete"5' of human nature in the face of humiliation, that minimalism, after all, is after. Wallace Stevens wanted sublime art, and Smith's cube is an example of the sort of thing he wanted. Stevens's poems are not themselves intended as sublime objects as was Mallarme's blank sheet of paper: rather, they are about the sublime. But Stevens is relevant to both mini- malism and the project of sublime art because, like the minimalists, he conceived of traditional beauty as not only turning statues into men but men into statues as well: It is the human that is the alien, The human that has no cousin in the moon. It is the human that demands his speech From beasts or from the incommunicable mass. If there must be a god in the house, let him be one That will not hear us when we speak: a coolness,</page><page sequence="7">Beidler The Postmodern Sublime: Kant and Tony Smith's Anecdote of the Cube 183 A vermilioned nothingness, any stick of the mass Of which we are too distantly a part.52 Minimalism aspires toward this godliness, re- jecting the vulgar anthropomorphism of tradi- tional sculpture that Stevens describes: The statue seems a thing from Schwartz's, a thing Of the dank imagination, much below Our crusted outlines hot and huge with fact, Ugly as an idea, not beautiful As sequels without thought.53 The minimalists, as I have shown, are against art that initiates what Morris calls "intimacy- producing relations"54 between artwork and viewer: Every internal relationship, whether it be set up by a structural division, a rich surface, or what have you, reduces the public, external quality of the object and tends to eliminate the viewer to the degree that these details pull him into an intimate relation with the work and out of the space in which the object exists.55 This public quality, if it is anthropomorphic, is so in a much different and truer sense than Stevens's "thing from Schwartz's." Like the minimalists, Stevens rejected crude anthro- pomorphism in favor not of the angst-ridden modernism that Fried extols but of the purely other, the inhuman: The englistered woman is now seen In an isolation, separate From the human in humanity, A part of the inhuman more, The still inhuman more, and yet, An inhuman of our features, known And unknown, inhuman for a little while, Inhuman for a little, lesser time.56 Stevens wanted sublime art, and Tony Smith's cube is an example of the sort of thing he wanted: Agree: the apple in the orchard, round And red, will not be redder, rounder then Than now. No: nor the ploughman in his bed Be free to sleep there sounder, for the plough And the dew and the ploughman still will best be one. But this gawky plaster will not be here. The stones That will replace it shall be carved, "The Mass Appoints These Marbles Of Itself To Be Itself" No more than that, no subterfuge, No memorable muffing, bare and blunt.57 In his poem "The American Sublime" Stevens seems to yearn for statues not of General Jack- son but that would make us feel what Jackson felt as he posed for the statue: How does one stand To behold the sublime, To confront the mockers, The mickey mockers And plated pairs? When General Jackson Posed for his statue He knew how one feels.58 When Stevens asks "How does one stand / To behold the sublime," is he asking how one ought to comport oneself in the presence of the sublime, or how one can stand the intensity of it? Both are questions we must ask about the sublime, and both are posed by minimalism. Stevens asks for an art with the power and force of his jar in Tennessee-not an art that alludes to the sublime, but one that is sublime. The steel cube has replaced the "gawky plas- ter" in our postmodern "esthetique du mal," as Stevens predicted it would, and we can perhaps now say with Stevens's Crispin that The imagination, here, could not evade In poems of plums, the strict austerity Of one vast, subjugating, final tone.59 PAUL G.

Kant distinguishes between the various sorts of art: "If art merely performs the acts that are required to make a possible object actual, adequately to our cognition of that object, then it is a mechanical art; but if what it intends directly is [to arouse] the feeling of pleasure, then it is called an aesthetic art" (CJ 172). The two categories, how- ever, do not exclude each other as neatly as Kant implies: by "mechanical art," Kant means a useful art, an art with a purpose, but he does not consider (nor could he have) the case in which the purpose of an object is that it function as art. This is the postmodern condition. 11. Lucy R. Lippard, "Homage to the Square," Art in America 55 (1967): 53. 12. Bruce Glaser, "Questions to Stella and Judd," ed. Lucy R.

The sublime may be thought of as the voluntary enslavement of the imagination to reason: "this judging strains the imagination to its limit"; it is "the imagination by its own action depriving itself of its own freedom" (CJ 128, 129). 16.

As Paul de Man writes, "the failure of the articulation becomes the distinguishing characteristic of the sublime." But he takes it further: "The sublime cannot be defined as the failure of the sublime, for this failure deprives it of its identifying principle.

Sublime art would be art that is unpresent- able-in "Cartouches" Derrida reminds us of the two "stillbourn" drawings that are missing from Titus-Carmel's "The Pocket Size Tlingit Coffin" sequence (they were destroyed by the artist) and the paradigmatic coffin itself (Derrida, The Truth in Painting, p. 210). Theodore Gracyk provides an interesting model for understanding how an object can be unpresentable that is relevant here: "No one would go to the trouble of visiting the pyramids unless there were objects present in the objective time-order, but their presence does not guarantee that a visitor will be able to view them as unified in the subjective time-order" (The- odore A. Gracyk, "Sublimity, Ugliness, and Formlessness in Kant's Aesthetic Theory," The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 45 [1986]: 53). One thinks of the hero in Wallace Stevens's "Examination of the Hero in a Time of War": "It is part of his conception / That he be not con- ceived, being real." 22. See Michael Zakian's "Barnett Newman and the Sublime," Arts Magazine 62 (1988): 33-39, in which he shows that Newman's purpose was never to make paintings that were intimidating or frustrating to the viewer. 23. The term "sculpture" here refers to what one might now call "sculpture as such." This qualification has been necessary at least since 1965, when Judd claimed that "The new work obviously resembles sculpture more than it does painting, but it is nearer to painting" (Don Judd, "Specific Objects," Arts Yearbook 8 [1965]: 77). 24.

Rosalind Krauss, "Allusion and Illusion in Donald Judd," Artforum 4 (1966): 24. Elsewhere Krauss notes The synchronic museum-if we can call it that-would forego his- tory in the name of a kind of intensity of experience, an aesthetic charge that is not so much temporal (historic) as it is now radically spatial, the model for which ... was, in fact, Minimalism. It is Mini- malism ... that has reshaped the way we, as late twentieth-century viewers, look at art; the demands we now put on it; our need to experience it along with its interaction with the space in which it exists; our need to have a more cumulative, serial, crescendo towards the intensity of this experience; our need to have more and at a larger scale.

A photograph, of course, would hardly have the effect of an experience with the original, but my point is to pose tacitly the question of whether Smith's six-foot steel cube, once it is described, needs to be seen in order for its</page><page sequence="9">Beidler The Postmodern Sublime: Kant and Tony Smith's Anecdote of the Cube 185 impact to be felt-whether, in fact, seeing the cube might prove anti-climactic, whether this question could be asked of any work of sublime art, and whether this matters. The artists, naturally, would deny that their works could be replaced by diagrams or descriptions: "A diagram is not a painting; it's as simple as that. I can make a painting from a diagram, but can you? Can the public? ... You actually want to see the thing. That's what motivates you to do it in the first place, to see what it's going to look like" (Stella in Glaser, "Questions to Stella and Judd," pp. 161-162). But Rosalind Krauss notes that in Judd's case the strength of the sculptures derives from the fact that grasping the work by means of a list of their physical properties, no matter how complete, is both possible and impossible. They both insist upon and deny the adequacy of such a definition of them- selves, because they are not developed from "assertions" about materials or shapes, assertions, that is, which are given a priori and convert the objects into examples of a theorem or a more general case, but are obviously meant as objects of perception, objects that are to be grasped in the experience of looking at them. (Krauss, "Allusion and Illusion in Donald Judd," pp. 24-25.) The objects are meant to be perceived but derive force from the extent to which this perception may not even be neces- sary. One recalls here that Kant never saw his greatest example of the sublime, the Great Pyramid of Egypt. 29. Indeed, the effect of minimalism, as Rosalind Krauss has pointed out, is often to reduce to mere objects the formalist works with which they share gallery space: "the effect of this experience is to render it impossible to look at the paintings hanging in those few galleries still displaying the permanent collection. Compared to the scale of the Minimalist works, the earlier paintings and sculpture look impossibly tiny and inconsequential, like postcards, and the galleries take on a fussy, crowded, culturally irrelevant look, like so many curio shops" (Krauss, "The Cultural Logic of the Late Capitalist Museum," p. 4). Tony Smith, in a similar vein, has remarked that "All art today is an art of postage stamps. ... I like the way a huge area holds onto a surface in the same way a state does on a map" (Wagstaff, "Talking with Tony Smith," p. 384). 30. Lippard, "Homage to the Square," p. 53. 31. One of the best ways of responding to the threat of photography, of course, is to build space, which could be defined as that which cannot be photographed.

Foster, among others, has pointed this out: "In short, minimalism appears as a historical crux in which the for- malist autonomy of art is at once achieved and broken up, in which the ideal of pure art becomes the reality of just another object among serial others, one thing after another" (Foster, "The Crux of Minimalism," p. 175). 37.

By "unitary forms" Morris means forms that are both whole and singular. Such forms include the simpler regular polyhedrons, for example, but not the more com- plex ones, such as the icosohedron and the dodecahedron: "In the complex regular type there is a weakening of visual- ization as the number of sides increases. ... Complex irregu- lar polyhedrons (for example, crystal formations) if they are complex and irregular enough can frustrate visualiza- tion almost completely, in which case it is difficult to main- tain one is experiencing a gestalt" (Morris, "Notes on Sculpture," pp. 226-227). 44.

Kant, Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime, p. 48. 48. But Nietzsche reduces the sublime to a lie in much the same way. He describes a situation, reminiscent of Cas- par David Friedrich's Monk by the Sea, in which noise of the waves is interrupted suddenly by the "ghostly beauty" of a sailboat (which, of course, is a metaphor for woman). But then he pulls back: "Noble enthusiast, even on the most beautiful sailboat there is a lot of noise, and unfortunately much small and petty noise" (Friedrich Nietzsche, The Gay Science, trans. Walter Kaufmann [New York: Vintage Books, 1974], #60). 49. See the Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime, pp. 60, 67. 50.

Wallace Stevens, "Mr. Burnshaw and the Statue." The claim that the bronze horse of "Mr. Burnshaw and the Statue" is "ugly as an idea" seems strangely consistent with Greenberg's notion that minimalism is merely beautiful as an idea: Greenberg's complaint about minimalist work is that it is merely a "feat of ideation," that it produces no "aesthetic surprise" (Greenberg, "Recentness of Sculp- ture," Minimal Art: A Critical Anthology, ed. G. Battcock, pp. 183-184). To Greenberg, the beauty of minimalism is an abstract beauty that is not actually experienced by the viewer, a private beauty accessible only to those involved in, or somehow privy to, the conception of the work, but the quality that minimalism is after is a public and social one, not a private one, which suggests that Greenberg's question of beauty is irrelevant to it. 54.
