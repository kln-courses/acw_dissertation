It profoundly uses onsite trashing conventional ritual occasions and forms and systems through which social substance is infrastructurally bolstered to force pitiless confrontation with out-there voidness. Listeners composers performers undergoing extreme exertion or even more extreme nonexertion under the unyielding imperative of strenuous rigors meticulously detailed, stringently demanding, random-processually generated, globally undecipherable. Anticulture not alternative culture. Sound you have to hear, that you can't exactly hear; sound that you strain to grasp and that leaves you coming up poignantly empty. Once you know the reality of silence, content is up to you. Existence is not a career opportunity. If you escape from that, what is it, precisely, you are escaping? Nice is not what John Cage is about; what John Cage is about is more like the real-life sense of what you might mean by Serious. Probably John Cage would not have said any of these things, so maybe they're completely wrong.

For music, going is being. For music, not-going is not-being. For a sound, being is being; being is not going; going is not being. The sound of music is the sound of sounds going, not the sounds of sounds being. Listening to sounds being is not music. A music which listens to sounds being is a deeply radical music; that listening to sounds being is cognized as music deeply radicalizes music. Listening to sounds just being sounds is a common and familiar aesthetic experience in almost everyone's life. Listening to sounds just being sounds as a conscious musical artform deeply radicalizes a common and familiar listening-to-sound behavior. Listening to sounds just being sounds as an output of a particular com- poser's recontextualization of sounds just being sounds deeply radicalizes music-compositional behavior as well as deeply radicalizes listening-to- music behavior. In such a radicalized state it becomes possible to imagine recontextualiz- ing musical or nonmusical soundmaking and soundlistening as individual or collective expressive behaviors, or as individual or collective non- expressive behaviors, in which the proprietary category of "composer" is indiscernible, not only as a fact, but as an issue. The extreme radicalism of these results resides in their direct relevance to ineluctable issues of sensemaking, worldmaking, lifemaking in the present moment.

I won- der what issues composing raises, or what issues it addresses. I wonder what motivates composing, in you and in me, such that we devote so much of our time and energy to it, and derive so much of our identity from it. I wonder not only what does underlie the surface of our com- posing behavior, as well as what's on the surface of it, but also what we might find and cultivate as motivations for composing behavior, and what surfaces of it that might. lead us to invent and discover. We, here, today, are composing in the hope of finding something out about our own composing, the issues it raises, the issues it addresses, for us as individuals, and as a community. This saying is one sound in the sound of this space, one behavior in this polyphony of behaviors, in which your presence is a voice also. Think how fundamentally inexpressive art music is, as a medium. Structure is always an alienation of expression. The very purpose of structuring is the alienation of expression. Not necessarily in a negative sense: reflection is alienation too: to engage by distancing, to access by mediation; safety from directness to enable the channels of reception to receive without the paralyzing fear of annihilation, of immolation. Is rationality a description of the real, or a resistance to it? Does rationality make claims about the real, or claims against it? Is rationality in compliance with the real, or in revolt against it? Is rationality explica- tion or is it denial? Is it justification or condemnation? Is the real world that which is rational, or is the rational the attempt to create the real world? Is real equivalent to rational or incompatible with it? If describing accepts, and analyzing rejects, what might composing be, and how can music be imagined without it?

Deconstruction, the most cannibalistic form of thought, is the most perfect expression of and repository for the contemporary jungle- entropic ethos. 3. Fetishizing the machine: in western classical music playing and singing are not projecting imagery of peoplesound (or for that matter god- sound or creaturesound or spiritsound) but powersound-impersoni- fied mechanismsound-the cosmos imaged not as person but as machine, not anthropomorphic but mechanomorphic-the person empowered by appropriating the puissance of the superpersonal Mover, Fabricator, Generator.... 122</page><page sequence="6">Regretting John Cage and Kenneth Gaburo V THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ARTS IN THE DIALOGUE ABOUT EDUCATIONAL REFORM Academe has two equal and opposite problems, both life-threatening, and together virtually terminal: academe cannot survive into the contem- porary world and its contemporary predicaments without coming up with genuinely new ways of thinking, equally, academe (at least in its liberal-arts/humanities aspects) is structurally incapable of either engendering or supporting or even tolerating truly new ways of thinking. (Science is in better shape: its problems are somewhat less purely self- defined; and it is blatantly obvious that those problems cannot even be addressed, let alone "solved," except by developing new ways of thinking (viz. n-dimensional space in current particle physics/cosmology)). In particular, purely verbal thinking has hypertrophied into a fixed ritual game of escalating finesse, ingenuity, and polish, creating formidable and challenging textures without any content of new thinking-as, for example, not only defining new issues, but rethinking what an issue is. This is one reason why technology, especially in the arts, holds so much potential for significant repositioning of purposes, concepts, and issues- although of course that implies as much terminal peril as hopeful promise-but that risk cannot be avoided if a tool is to be made available and freely experimented with on a scale and with a power adequate to making even the slightest real difference in our conceptual/practical schemata. And the much larger domain of which technologically based thinking is only a minuscule part is the area of nonverbal (and paraverbal, and supraverbal) cognition and thought-which people in the arts are most deeply practiced in, of course, but which everyone knows as a native natural language, albeit one which gets obliterated, or, really, indiscernibly backgrounded, by the power and prevalence and-to coin a term-hegemony of verbal language, the overwhelmingly privileged status of verbally defined issues, and the authority of verbal denotation, the exclusive significance of verbal theorizing. It is not inevitable that this stranglehold will be broken-no one says that a culture can't go belly-up (we're always sliding entropywards anyway, which is why cybernetic theory is constantly less an intellectual/expressive/recreational luxury and ever more a desperately grasped lifeline); it is far from probable that a culture so advanced can be so fundamentally reconstructed-but it is equally obvious that the need for the effort to do so is non-negotiable. Consider, in this light, just one issue: consider the evolution of social structures designed to "improve" the status of (human) life on earth 123</page><page sequence="7">Perspectives of New Music (i.e., one's own), which have evolved from paleontological times in terms of strategies which had survival value under those circumstances. For a long time now, the-at least-physical-circumstances under which human life is being pursued have progressively rendered those strategies, those structures, 180 degrees out, counterproductive to produce the effect of "improving" human life, in anyone's terms we know of. So every structure within our (recently metastasizing) social fabric is in need of re-examination and reconstruction, most especially at the seat of self- conscious social reproduction, the school. Of course, it can't be done. Of course, it's foolish and pompous to think of one's work in such global and grandiose terms. But we do have some responsibility in our work, namely, our responsibility. OK, so what is it? What are those strategies, structures, roles? If we don't think about this, then there's hardly any need for a curriculum at all, because there's hardly any reason to be a school.

There are primary and secondary creative activities. depending on the depth of expression elicited from you. A stimulus to creative activity you value for its specificity. The greater its specificity as a stimulus the more potent its capacity to engender and participate in an episode of creative activity associated with it. Stimulus specificity, which liberates ideas in direct ratio to its distinctness, is easily confused with coercive specificity as to literal detail. If a stimulus has the effect in a given episode of creative activity of being coercive as to literal detail to some extent: to that extent, its stimulation is specific, but of something other than pri- mary creative activity. at most, of some form of secondary creative activity. To the extent that a quest for 'correctness' ('compliance') replaces a quest for the maximum awareness of specificity of stimulus in the interest of specificity of response: primary creative activity is unavail- able. That you might value knowing a If psychologically you are able to song or a piece must be that its respond to the specifics of tradi- recollection and recomposition in tional music in notation with the performance creates an expressive liberty of being freely stimulated outlet. Its presence in your aware- at closest range to primary cre- ness is a potential for expressive ative activity: then traditional development within your selfscape. music in performance and tradi- tionally notated music in com- position could already be stimuli to primary creative activity. But, psychologically, you are not. A score to which your response is powerfully specific (in the form of 'ideas') but not coercive is a creative musical medium. in a pro- founder traditional sense. Each must discover which scores are musical media of primary creative activity.
