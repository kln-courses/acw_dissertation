<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ANTIQUITY AND THE EVOLUTION OF THE SAPTAMÃTRIKA WORSHIP IN BENGAL D. K. Ch akr av arty {Calcutta) The origin of the Mother worship may be traced since Prehistoric times after the discovery of the so-called 'Venus' figurines from different parts of the world» The myths and folklores associated with the tools and weapons belonging to the Neolithic economy as well as the utilitarian aspects of these artifacts perhaps reveal the aniconic representations of the Male or Female Divinity. It has been observed in different parts of the world that the poli- shed stone celts those hall-marks of the Neolithic economy are offen distin- guished as cthunder-s tones' and sometimes those are traditionally associated with thunder showers that make the earth fit for agricultural operation and fertile. The axe is associated with the worship of Mother Goddess from very ancient times. In the Megalithic shrines of Northern France the sym- bolic representation of the Mother Goddess holding an axe as carved near the entrance has been noticed. The celebrated Mother Goddess as painted on the Palace Wall at Knossos in Crete also holds a double-axe. It is inter- esting to observe that in the Megalithic burial chambers exposed in Brittanny in France the pointed butt end of an axe lies buried after placing the point towards a ring stone which can perhaps be associated with some fertility rites. The ring stones or mace-heads, as sometimes these are called and which have been collected in large numbers from the field of our study are indirectly connected with the fertility of the soil. By observing the agricultural prac- tices of the primitive tribes in various parts of the world and specially of the South African Bushmen and the Chenchus of the South India it can be presumed that these perforated ring stones have been utilised as weights of the digging sticks to break the clods of earth of the tilling ground. Like the stone axes or celts these perforated ring stones which were intimately connected with the introduction of agriculture and as such considered indispensible to the early agricultural communities were gradually , transformed into cult objects, the early traces of which can be found in the Chalcolithic or Bronze Age« In thè historical period, the various diagrams known as Chakras or Yantras as inven- ted by the worshippers of the íãkta cults as also the different mandala kramos or rituals observed by the Tantric worshippers perhaps bespeak about the con- tinuity of the ancient tradition of venej&amp;tion pf the stone tools and weapons as cult symbols often associated with fertility rites. Among the numerous objects discovered from the Indus Valley sites mention can be made of some perforated circular stone objects which are 17</page><page sequence="2">'Í0 INDIAN HISTORY CONGRESS 1968 considered as the emblem of Y oni by Sir John Marshall and which seem to have been utilised as cult objects during the worship of the Mother-Goddess. The ornamental circular ring stones belonging to the early historical period which have been discovered from the places like Taxila, Rupar, Kausambi, Rajghat and Patna sometimes display some nude female figurines placed in between some animals ; probably their vãhanas and the plants ; some of which are considered as sacred. In Proto-historic times with the introduction of agriculture and gradual urbanization the worship of the Mother Goddess in various forms was firmly established among the communities. Women played a vital role in the then society by their active participation in the agricultural operations and engag- ing themselves in other professions which gave them much social prestige in the society and ultimately some of them were deified. In India specially during the Proto-historic period the worship of the Mother Goddess gained wide currency from very early times. The female figurines associated with the Bulli Culture cannot perhaps be considered as the embodiment of the Mother Goddess although in one instance a child has been found placed in the lap of one of these figurines. Possibly these figurines represent a natural portraiture of the contemporary female folk. The figurines discovered in the Zhob Valley in North Baluchistan are more interesting for our study. These figurines having high smooth foreheads above their starting circular eye-holes, owl-beak nose and grim slit mouth look like grinning skull. Professor Stuart Piggott is of opinion that these figurines seem to be "a grim embodiment of the mother goddess who is also the guardian of the dead - an under world deity concerned alike with the corpse and the seed- corn buried beneath the earth." It may not be improbable that the concep- tion of the iconographie features of the grim looking Chāmuņdā, Chaņdīkā or Kali of later times originated from these grinning figurines from the Zhob Valley* The theriomorphic vases and figurines as unearthed from- the Ha- tappan sites form a class by itself recalling the Egyptian theriomorphism in Which religion "the gods were conceded as living or manifesting themselves on earth in 'theophardes* 'their living images on earth* as ram, dog-headed ape* dog, wolf, jackal, hawk, vulture, ibis, swallow, dove and heron, certain kinds of snakes, uraens, fçog, beatle, grashopper, mantis and several kinds of fish* All the above were regarded as divine powers from the earliest to the latest times." In Indiu anthropomorphism gradually replaced the therio- morphism "thus converting the animals into mere generic symbols, known as vãhanas (vehicles) - a change over which can be interpreted as the triumph of 'man over animal." The half animal and half human icons like Vãràhi and Nãrasimhl as conceived in the Puranic mythology perhaps represent a tran- sitional stage of culture in India when zoomorphism began to fade away and anthropomorphism crept in. The terra-cotta vases in the shapes of birds and</page><page sequence="3">àKcïenï india l3l animals as also the numerous figurines from the Harappan and other Proto- historic and Early Historic sites having beak like noses and pinched faces ori the one hand and such figurines collected during surface explorations from the early historic sites in the Gangetic West Bengal thus reveal this transitional culture and prove about a distant link with the West. The study Qf a few representative seals from the Indus Valley sites has given us some clues regarding the worship of the Mother Goddess which tra* dition was later on imbibed by the successors of the Indus Valley Culture. On a mutilated seal from Harappa as illustrated by Vats in his c Harappa Vol . II (Seal No. 251) seven figures standing in a row has been represented. By observing the hair-styles and the personal ornaments of these figures it has been considered by the archaeologists that these represent female figures which according to them are the earíiest representations of the Saptamãtrikãs. On a terracotta plaque from Mohenjodaro similar number of human figures stand- ing in a row as carved has been noticed, the lower register of which illustrate a vehicle drawn by a goat and driven by a human figure - a little away a re- presentation of a human figure standing within the bifurcated stem of the tree has been shown. [Cf : Ann, R ep, A. S. I., 1924-25, p. 65 pi XXII(a)]* The presence of the Saptamãtrikãs in the act of worshipping the tree-god has perhaps been illustrated in this pjaque. Attention may be drawn to ano- ther seal from Modehenjodaro in this context. [Marshall, Mohenjodaro and Indus Civilisation Vol . Í. pp. 49*5?, pi XII (18).] On this seal the representation of a devotee kneeling down before ail almost nude deity standing iń between the bifurcated stem of the tree has been illustrated, while a ram standing behind the kneeling devotee has been no- ticed. In the lower register seven worshippers wearing short kilt standing in a row has been illustrated. A receptacle almost in identical shape with the actual dish-on-stand as discovered from the Harappan sites has been placed under the tree, possibly to dedicate some offerings to the deity. It may be interesting to point out the similarity of the representation of this seal with that of the Prehistoric painting of seven female figures circling round a nude boy as drawn on the cave walls of Cogul in Spain. Marshal considers these seven figures as seven ministers of the deity while Mackay on the other hand finds in these figures the representation of seven female divinity comparable with the folk deity Śltala and her six sisters. Dhavalikar is of opinion that the seven figurines as represented on the seals and plaques from Indus Valley sites seém to be the earliest prototypes of the Saptamãtrikãs. In Puranic mythology and iconography the cult of the Saptamãtrikãs is fomjd crystalized. While ransacking the Vedic literature Dhavalikar has arrived at the conclusion that the Saptamãtrikãs are associated with the extraction of Soma juice during the Soma sacrifice and the theme reflected in the Indus Valley seals and plaques may possibly reminds us about this incident.</page><page sequence="4">Í3Ž ÍNDIAÑ HISTORY CONGRESS i960 Incidentally attention may be drawn to the scholars to the channel-spouted bowls of black-and-red ware which were unearthed in large numbers during the excavations at Pandu Rajar Dhibi in the Ajay valley in West Bengal. While observing an intact specimen of such a type of bowls from the same site Dr* S. C Mukherjee has drawn our attention to some verses in the Iig Veda viz., verses IX 1. 2 &amp; IX 75.3 where it has been stated " Pajamana Soma S ūktaviivacarsaņirabhi Yonimajohatam Druņa Sadasthamã sadat II" which possibly relates such type of bowls with the drinking (?) or ritualistic offering of Soma juice. However this vessel is interesting from a different point of view to which attention is now being drawn. The inside of the channel spouted bowl mentioned above has been painted with white pigment illustrating seven rows of dashes converging towards the centre. It may not be improbable that these geometric line drawings or dashes consisting of seven rows may perhaps sym- bolically represent the Saptamātrikās whose presence is earnestly solicited by the Vedic flLisis to propitiate Indra; who is very fond of drinking Soma juice. Indra has been often invoked for bringing rain on earth to make it fertile and productive and in later times the rituals associated with the worship of the Indradhvaja (the flag-staff associated with Indra) reminds us about the ancient Vedic practice which was revived by the Chedi King Uparichara Vasu. In our rituals specially during the offerings of oblations to the manes ( Ābbjudājika Srãddhd) before the actual starting of marriage ceremony, Upanayana (sacred thread wearing ceremony) the house plinths or walls are painted with clarified butter illustrating seven vertical rows which is known as Vasudhara. These seven rows possibly denote symbolic representation of the cult of fecundity. In Maharastra it has been observed that such seven lines are still being drawn with red-lead or lime on the keel of the boats, on a boulder by the side of a river bank or on a tree standing on the outskirt of the village and considered as representation of ' Seven-apsarãs 9 whereby the ancient tradition is still con- tinuing. In the early historic period archaeological evidences about the worship of Mother Goddess are forthcoming from the excavations of such sites viz, Pandu Rajar Dhibi* Bangadh, Chadraketugarh* The terracotta figurines from Pandu Rajar Dhibi reveal a form of Mother Goddess having pinched faces like the beaks of the birds, accentuated breasts, splayed hips and de- corated with incised pin-hole decorations and which have got much artistic similarity with those figurines of Mauryan and post-Mauryan times. Prof. K. G. Goswami has kindly drawn our attention to some Mother Goddess figurines as unearthed during the excavations at Bangarh in the district of West Dińajpur. Prof. Goswami is of opinion that possibly these so-called Yakshinïs or Mother Goddess figurines of Sunga style were offered as votive objects or worshipped as cult objects.</page><page sequence="5">ANCIENT INDIA 133 Archaeological explorations conducted near the ancient site of Tāmralipta (modern Tamluk in Midnapur district) have revealed some interesting Mother Goddess figurines belonging to the pre-Mauryan, Mauryan and later times. It has been established that the famous so-called 'oxford figurine* of a Yaksini was originally discovered from this place. The figure as moulded in this terracotta plaque is wearing an elaborate coiffure adorned with five magical hair-pins or ť Vanchachudãs (in the shapes of five weapons; sword, arrow, battle- axe, trident and goad) earrings, necklace, bangles as well as a heavy girdle wherefrom amulets are hanging in suspension. Scholars like E. H. Johnston have placed some suggestions regarding the identification of this figurine which according to them probably represents the ancient Mother Goddess Maya while the fish symbols depicted on one of the amulets symbolises fertility and . the makara on another signifies sexual love. Similar figurines of the Mother Goddess as depicted on the seals and plaques have also recently been brought to light in course of the explorations conducted at such sites like Hari- narãyanpur, Chandraketugarh in the district of 24 Paragaanas. Gradually the concept of the Saptamātrikās developed and found crys- talized during the Kushana Period when "the worship of the female goddess of the form of Reality as so many goddesses found its most tangible expression as the sculptures representing a group of the Saptamātrikās (Seven Divine Mothers) viz, Brahmani, Vaisnavl, Anhikā Parvātī, Indrāni, Kaumārl, Vārāhl, Nārasimhi and Chāmuņdā." These deities prosonify the S aktis or energies of the seven Puraņic gods viz, Brahmā, Visņu, Siva, Kumāra, Varāha, Nrisimha and Yama. Impregnated with the Tantric beliefs these deities were enveloped in the mystic symbolism of Yoga and were also regarded as Saktis of various chakras or nervous centres in the body and designated as the Mãtrikãt. Gradually the number of these deities was increased to 8, 9, 10, 12 and 16 and attributed with new weapons and vãhanasy mostly taken from the scattered groups of auspicious symbols once again revealing an esoteric discipline of thought and meditation. So far no such sculpture depiciting the Saptamā- trikās pertaining to the Kushāņa Period has yet been brought to light in the field of our study. However on the reverse of some of the gold and copper coins issued by the Kushāņas we find impressions of the Goddess Uma or Ambika seated on lion thus revealing one of the forms of the Mãtrikãs. During the Gupta period and thereafter specially during the mediaeval period of the Indian history the worship of the Saptāmatrikās gained much popularity as it is evidenced by the Gangdhar Inscription dated in the Mālava- Vikrama Era 481 or 424 A. D. The life size terracotta head of the Goddess Vārāhl, one of the Saptamātrikās as discovered from the village Panna in Midnapur district attests about the prevalence of the worship of the Saptamā- trikās in Bengal during the Gupta Period. The terra-cotta head of Varahi Wearing a skull cap disclosçs ą keęa sense of solid masses, enlivened through-</page><page sequence="6">134 INDIAN HISTORY CONGRESS 1968 out by motherly feeling engrossed in sublime mysticism which later on inspi- red the sculptors of the Brahmani - BaitaraņI Valley in Orissa particularly of the Jaipur school of Cuttack district where they have found colossal expressions on the chlorite schist easily available, and further moving across the Eastern Seas, the impact and influence of this cultural fusion finds an indelible ex- pression on the temple walls of the South East Asia. Some mutilated terracotta figurines revealing grotesque figures also recovered from Panna can be asso- ciated with the worship of Vārāhl as we understand from the Gangdhar Ins- cription mentioned above that the Mātrikas were encircled by the Dākinls and other grotesque figures. The Jainism too seems to have been much influenced by the cult of the Saptamātrikās as the iconographie features of the seven Šāsanadevīs carved below the J aina Tïrthankaras on the walls of the Navamuni Cave on the Khandagiri Hill, Orissa reveal much iconographie si- milarity with those of the Brahmanical Saptamātrikās. Debala Mitra in her article entitled "Šāsanadevīs in the Khandagiri Caves" (pp. 127-133 Journal of the Asiatic Society , Calcutta Vol. 1, No. 2, 1959) has discussed in details about the iconographie features of these, deities. The presence of different forms of Mātrikās associated with the Saptamã- trikā group; (either alone or associated with group) among the Mediaeval sculptures recovered form various parts of Bengal amply reveals the popular estimation of these deities. In the History of bengal. Vol . I (Ed. by Dr. R. C. Majumdar) and in Bānģālīr Itihãsa (in Bengali) by Dr. Nihar Ranjan Ray brief descriptions of the Saptamātrikā images found in Bengal have been given. Detailed descriptions about the goddess Chāmuņdā analysed with the different Jhyãnas have been discussed by N. K. Bhattasali in his Iconography of Buddhist and Brahmanical Sculptures in the Dacca Museum . From the iconographie details published in the above mentioned publications and also from the observations of the extant specimens of the Saptamātrikās now in the collections of the different museums of West Bengal, it is evident that among all the Mātrikās, the worship of Chāmuņdā or Chāmuņdī gained wide popularity while it was closely followed by the worship of VārāhĪ. The reasons behind this parti- cular predilection for the worship of these deities are unknown to us. How ever it is welì known that during the Pāla rule Buddhism flourished in Ben- gal. In the Nispannavogāvalī , an iconographie text on Buddhist deities com- piled by the great pandit Abhayâkaragupta, we find ten principal deities of the Brahmanical pantheon included in the Buddhist fold. Chāmuņdā and Vārāhl are included in this group. In the Buddhist iconographie texts Vārāhl has been placed over a black owl and she has got four hands. By her two hands she holds a rohita fish and a skull-cup, and by her upper two hands she showers anjali . By her black colour she is associated with the Dhyânï Buddha Akshobhya. Chāmuņdā is of red cologř, and is seated over a dead body. By her lower two hands she holds a katri ąnd a skujl-cup and by her upper two hands she shQwers.</page><page sequence="7">ANCIENT INDIA 135 anjalu She is associated with the Dhyãni Buddha Amitãbha. It may not be im- probable that due to the influence of the Buddhism the worship of Chāmuņdā and Vārāhl spread in different corners of Bengal while some of the images of these deities now preserved in different museums of Bengal once might have adorned the Buddhist shrines and vikāras . Recently some sculptures representing the goddesses Chāmuņdā and Vārāhl having some iconographie peculiarities have been acquired for the State Archaeological Gallery, West Bengal. Stylistically the images can be ascribed to the period ranging between circa 9th to 11th century A. D. during which period the cult of Saptamātrikās flourished in this part of India. The Budd- hist goddess Hârití can perhaps be recognised as one of the forms of the Mā- trikās. An interesting sculpture of his deity displayad in the Dacca Museum and described by N. K. Bhattasali is worth recording. The deity is holding a fish by her upper right hand and in her upper left hand a drinking vessel (i bhringãra ) has been placed. She is holding a child as placed on her lap by her lower hands. Some of the attributes e. g., fish and the skull-cup like vessel (i bhringãra ) held by this deity have much in common with those held by Vārāhl, one of the Saptamātrikās. In Indian art the earliest reference about Hāritī is found in the Gandhara art. The conception of this deity originated from the existing Pre-Buddhist folk deities which ultimately regarded her as 'protector of children' and as such she is found encircled by children in the sculptures. Hāritī has got much similarity with the folk deity Sitala. Another interesting image christened as 'Vasudhärä-Häriti' as acquired fromKushmandi in West Dinajpur district and now being displayed in the State Archaeological Gallery perhaps reveals a syncretistic icon. The deity is seated on lotos in lalitãsana . By her lower left hand she is holding a child and her lower right hand shows varada mudrã. She is holding a sword by her upper right hand while bunches of ear of corns have been placed in her upper left hand. Two chowri bearers are standing on her both sides. In the plthikā representation of a devotee on her right and an owl or peacock has been shown on her left. This deity has many thing in common with the ŠāsanadevI Gāndhāri associa- ted with the Jaina Tlrthankara Vâsupûjya as carved on the wells of Navamuni Cave on the Khandagiri Hill. From the descriptions recorded by Débala Mitra {opciť) it is observed that Gandhari is seated in lalitãsana and has got pea- cock as her vãhana . The deity wzztmgjatamukuta is bedecked with ornaments. She is holding a child with her lower left hand, while her lower right hand is showing abbaya mudrã . By her upper left hand she is holding lakti and a matulmga fruit has been placed in her upper right hand. Srimati Mitra is of opinion that the sculpture of the ŠāsanadevI Gāndhāri as illustrated in the Navamuni Cave reveals much similarity with Kaumari one of the Saptamā- trikās» I* ma7 not be improbable that the image of Vasudhārā-Harit! now</page><page sequence="8">136 INDIAN HISTORY CONGRESS 1968 under discussion reveals a syncretistic icon having much influenced by the Jaina or Buddhist conception. The goddess Chāmuņdā seems to have been originally associated with the vegetation spirit as in the Purascãryarnava, Pt. III (Benares Edition, 1904) pp. 1034-35 it has been recorded that Chāmuņdā has been regarded as the presid- ing deity of the mana- plant Kachu ( Colocasia Indica) regarded as one of the Návapatrikãs (Nine plants) which have got rituatistic association with the autumnal Durga worship in Bengal. Perhaps this links the cult of Chāmuņdā with some non-Aryan beliefs and ritual practices. Mention has been made about the grim looking grotesque female figurines found in the Zhob Valley in Baluchistan. Chāmuņdā is often regarded as Yam! or the Śakti of Yama, the god of death. In the Vâjasanayî S ambita (5, 11) of the Šukla Y aj urve da Manojabā (Manojabas) has been designated as the Śakti of Yama. The des- cription of Manojabā as narrated in th z Muņdakopanisad (1, 2, 4), who is regar- ded as the Śakti of Yama reveals much iconographie similarity with that of Chāmuņdā mentioned in the Purāņas. Another beautiful sculpture stylistically belonging to the circa 10th cen- tury A. D. collected from Sonapur in West Dinajpur and now being displayed in the State Archaeological Gallery, West Bengal, reveals motherly aspect of the deity Gauri who is regarded as one of the sodasa mätrikäs in later icono- graphie texts. The deity is standing flanked by Gaņeša on her right and Kār- tika on her left and has igyana or godhikā as her vāhana. The association of the Mother Goddess with alligators (igunana, godha) as revealed in some early historic ring-stones is of unique importance and interest from the point of view of the developed Śakti cult in India. Godhã plays a prominent part in the mythology of the goddess Chaņdī and Kālaketu in the mediaeval mangalakãvyas of Bengal. The composite sculptures depicting all the Saptamātrikās flanked by the figures of VIrabhadra and Gaņeša are rather rare in this part of India which according to the Matsya P urāna (Bangavasi ed.) ch. 261, verses 38 and 39 are essential adjuncts of the Saptamātrikā group. One such sculpture of octoalloy is now being displayed in the State Archaeological Gallery, West Bengal. It depicts the three seated Mātrikās viz. Vaišņavī, Brahmani and KaumārI placed in between VIrabhadra and Gaņeša. That the images of the Saptamā- trikās still held their enviable position in the minds of the people are evident from the decorative embellishments of the facades of many a brick temples of Gaudtya style where the carved bricks illustrates these deities arranged in panels. A wood-carving belonging to the 19th century A. D. collected from Dacca and now being displayed in the Gurusaday Museum reveals the Saptamā- trikās with their graceful mqvements and subdued emotion which has made this artistic creation full of vitality. The influence and the survival òf the cult pf Saptmātrikās may be traced in thç worship of the folk deities like Qlãi«</page><page sequence="9">ancient india 137 chaņdī or Olābibi associated with her six sisters and who is regarded as one of the variants of Sítala. However some of the folklorists are of opinion that the rituals associated with the worship of these folk deities reveals much Muslim influence. The village deities known as 'Sat Baunī' (Sāt Bhagin! or Seven Sisters) viz, RańkinI, Chamakinî, Sanakinï etc. as are worshipped in some villages in the districts of Birbhum and Bankura have got many similarities with the deities known as Jam mālā (Basali, Chaņdī, Vilāsinī etc.) much ve- nerated in popular mind. Observing the folk rituals it can be presumed that in the folk religion the survival of the cult of the Saptamātrikās may be traced. Thus it is a long story of evolution of the cult of Saptamātrikās beginning with the seven female figurines depicted on the Harappan Seals and plaques modified in the form of seven rows of line drawings painted inside the channel spouted bowls belonging to the Proto-historic phase of Pandu Rajar Dhibi and culminating in the Puraņic iconographie conception of the Mātrikās blended with Tantric rituals and Vajrayâna mysticism. Thus the impact and influence of the cult of Saptamātrikās in the soils of Bengal bespeak about the particular spiritual bent of mind of the Bengali people where the female pan- theon still occupies a dominant position in their rites and religion.
