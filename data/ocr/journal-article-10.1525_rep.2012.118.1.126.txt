<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Seth Lerer Devotion and Defacement:   reading Children’s Marginalia The best reading was on the fly leaves.  —Herman Melville, Redburn “There is scarcely a child,” wrote the American painter Wil- liam Morris Hunt in 1890, “whose first impulse is not to scribble on the wall  or any fresh piece of paper.” He continues, noting how, of the entire avail- able blank spaces in life, the margins of books capture the child’s attention. The child’s scribbling on the margin of his school-books is really worth more to  him than all he gets out of them. To him the margin is the best part of all books,  and he finds in it the soothing influence of a clear sky in a landscape.1 Only a few years after these remarks were written, the children’s author Ken- neth Grahame used them as inspiration for his essay “Marginalia.” This  meandering reflection appeared in the volume Pagan Papers (1895), and,  like many of the contributions in that volume, it celebrates the boundless  freedom of the child. Grahame affirms that all children desire to fill in the  blanks in books, and he recalls his own annotation of his childhood volumes.  Crocodiles and monsters filled his natural histories. Mis-written words filled  his ancient tales. But there were more than illustrations in these spaces. Gra- hame himself would annotate his school texts. Others, he notes, might use  margins for more practical affairs. “Amorous missives” would be passed  between young lovers, scrawled in hymnbooks. Poets would use margins for  composing “superior rhymes” to those on the printed page. At the end of his  essay, Grahame asks, “When shall that true poet arise who, disdaining the  trivialities of text, shall give the world a book of verse consisting entirely of  margin?”2 For modern scholars, some books do consist entirely of margin. Book his- tory as a discipline has emerged over the past twenty years to refocus attentions  abstract  The study of children’s marginalia in manuscripts and printed books enables us to reas- sess traditional assumptions about bibliography, subjectivity, and the literary imagination in the English  and American traditions. Commentaries, signatures, and scribbling defacements—together with fic- tional representations of young people writing in books—illustrate relationships among canonical  authority, playful subversion, commodity value, and archival preservation that all contribute to (and may  critique) our current fascination with book history as a discipline.

The physical appearance of a  volume—paper quality, ink color, layout, binding, and annotations—has come  to be seen as bearing as much meaningful information as the printed text itself.  Book history attends to the reception and the uses of the artifact: what is done  to books as well as what has been done with books.3 If the history of reading  may be, in Anthony Grafton’s words, a “marginal enterprise,” then it has  certainly become a marginal industry.4 A host of recent scholars have  explored the annotations of the famous and the forgettable, looking not  just for insights into individual critical responses but seeking as well a  broader understanding of how marginalia change the status of the book  itself. For H. J. Jackson, the doyenne of marginalianists, there are good and  bad annotators: what she identifies as intelligibility, relevance to the text,  and honesty are qualities that make for, as she puts it, the “many features to  admire in even very ordinary marginalia.” These are marginalia, as Jackson  puts it, “I enjoy.”5  The annotations I explore, by contrast, are sometimes barely legible, tan- talizingly irrelevant to the texts before them, evasive, duplicitous, or just  plain weird. What I enjoy (and mine is a study as much of scholarly pleasure  as it is of historical practice) are annotations that not only illustrate the cul- ture and the motives of the individual writer but also change, irrevocably, the  status of the annotated book as artifact. There is an as-yet-unexplored rela- tionship between the bibliographical challenges and the scholarly exhilara- tion behind marginal discovery. As Hermann Melville (himself an inveterate annotator) recognized in  his novel Redburn, the best reading is invariably on flyleaves. The marks of an  “incorrigible pupil,” the crayon sketches “of wild animals and falling-air cas- tles” are “all part and parcel of the precious book, which go to make up the  sum of its treasure.”6 For the historian of childhood, the margin has long stood as the place of  personal imagination. Medieval manuscripts were filled with scribbles, and  the childish habit of annotating was so entrenched by the mid-fourteenth  century that the scholar Richard de Bury could complain of “those shame- less youths, who as soon as they have learned to form the shapes of letters,  straightway, if they have the opportunity, become unhappy commentators,  and wherever they find an extra margin about the text, furnish it with mon- strous alphabets, or if any other frivolity strikes their fancy, at once their pen  begins to write it.”7 Many medieval manuscripts survive with such frivolities.8  Some of these youths would try their hand at literary criticism, too, though  often with results far from sophisticated. A fifteenth-century manuscript of  Aesop’s Fables has a German schoolboy’s marginal response to the whole  enterprise: “Wie stinkest du.”9 Almost as soon as books were printed, they  were annotated by the young.10 Any visit to an archive will reveal schoolbooks,   Devotion and Defacement: Reading Children’s Marginalia 127 </page> <page sequence="3"> bibles, novels, and poetry collections scrawled over by boys and girls, some  motivated by excitement, some by simple boredom.11 Most modern scholars of these scrawls seem little different in their mien  or methodology from Hunt or Grahame. That children wrote in books and  that their annotations may survive attest, for some, to an eternal common- place: this is something children did and do, whatever time or social world  they live in.12 For others, marginalia evoke identities behind the anonymities  of scribble: children take on a subjectivity long understood as restricted to lit- erate adults. Their annotations illustrate a kind of “intellectual self-awareness”  characteristic of the discipline of writing in one’s own and others’ books.13  Much like the category of childhood itself, children’s writing remains relatively  untextured and untested: as if it were a fact of life rather than a function of  history, as if it were to be something treasured by the antiquary or condemned  by the librarian, as if it were evidence of either brilliance or brutality.14 The child’s hand has always been assessed by adult eyes, and my interest  here lies in not just a chronicle of writing but a history of reading. The same  mark may be seen as meaningful or marring, and for every celebrant of  childhood’s freedom there has been a critic. Book collectors and archivists  have long valued the pristine copy, and many volumes survive in rare book  rooms and private collections washed of any evidence of readership.15 The  modern culture of librarianship—shaped as part of a late nineteenth- and  early twentieth-century ideology of cleanliness and citizenship—decried the  child who messed with books, whether they were on loan or bought.  Consider the materials assembled in a recent exhibition at the Cam- bridge University Library, Marginalia and Other Crimes. Water stains, bird  droppings, rips by mice and dogs—all survive carefully encased in glass, like  ruined leavings from some Pompeian library.16 In the exhibit lie things done  to books by children. Thick black streaks cross a page of a dry history; force- fully repeated circles smear the close of a scholarly text. These are the fili- grees of frustration, marks made to hurt the book or, perhaps, to hurt its  owner. They are strange choices for an exhibition, for they reduce children  to the dogs and mice and birds that mar the books unthinkingly. Is the book  in a child’s hand to be likened to a volume in a dog’s mouth? An exhibition  such as this one tells us little about what children actually do to books, but it  says a great deal about what adults think those children do. How the adult reads the child is thus the centerpiece of my analysis, and  I am interested in those marginalia that provoke scholarly inquiry into an  understanding of the annotator as an imaginative subject. At times, annota- tions chart relationships of authority between child and book: between the  institutions of control and their playful subversion, between the authority of  the canon and the autonomy of the reader. At times, a child’s imaginative  voice emerges in the marginal: prayers and poems, confessions of a self or  128 Representations </page> <page sequence="4"> the ratting-out of others. The margin can become the site of contested liter- ary authority, a place for scholarly, archival, and critical interpretation. It can  become, as well, the source of novelistic narrative, especially (as I suggest  here) in the nineteenth century, when an archival sensibility informs the fic- tional encounter with the past. This is a study, then, of readers as much as of writers, and my central  premise is that children’s writing—whatever we might think of its eternal  impulse—has no undeniably essential quality. There is no single text of  which one can say unequivocally, “This has been written by a child.” Instead,  I hold that children’s writing has its meaning in relationship to adult writing.  And that relationship lies not in age but in tuition. From antiquity until the  early twentieth century, writing was a taught discipline.17 Like rhetoric or  logic, mathematics or social behavior, it was keyed to imitation and repeti- tion. Fragments of parchment and pieces of wood from Hellenistic Egypt are  perhaps the earliest extant examples of young students striving to repeat the  words of writing masters. A wooden tablet from the town of Antinoöpolis,  from about the fifth century AD, has a text, in Greek, “Letters are the great- est beginning of understanding.” Underneath, the teacher has signed his  name, and below that signature a student has attempted to copy the teach- er’s line. Badly spelled and poorly formed, it comes down to us as a mangled  maxim about literacy.18 A millennium and a half later, Frederick Douglass  recalled in his autobiography how he learned to write by copying the letters  between the lines of his young master’s copybook.19  During these fifteen hundred years, writing masters made their livings  training children to model their penmanship on proper forms. “To frame the  childes hand right,” as the sixteenth-century pedagogue Richard Mulcaster  put it, was a goal of literary education.20 But it was, as well, a goal of moral  education. The forming of a “character” meant both the shaping of the letter  and the making of the self, what Jonathan Goldberg has called the “scriptive  reformation of the pedagogic subject.”21 Mulcaster stressed the repetition of  set exercises. The child should eventually learn to control writing in a way  that would make every letter-form identical to its previous inscription. The  student should learn to write so that his writing will “resemble” the exemplars  and that each copy should resemble another. What thus distinguishes tutored  from untutored writing—and what distinguishes the adult from the child—is  the ability to reproduce one’s own hand without variation over time. Adult  writing, like adult signatures, is consistent. Children’s writing is inconsistent. Just as imitation and repetition establish the writer as a student in relation  to pedagogical authority, so too does damage. Readers had long been  instructed, for example, to “mark” bibles: to note, underline, or call attention  in some way to key passages. The English translation of 1560, known as the  Geneva Bible, offers a set of guidelines at its start, “How to take profite by   Devotion and Defacement: Reading Children’s Marginalia 129 </page> <page sequence="5"> reading of the holy Scriptures,” that enjoins the reader to “marke and con- sider” such matters as the text’s coherence, its correspondence with other  portions of the text, and the key features of a given passage’s language.22  Early bibles brim with childish scribbles. Coats of arms on some surviving cop- ies of the King James Bible ripple with squiggles and pen trials. Rosemary  Bodenheimer, in her history of children and the Bible, notes that often boys  and girls “scribbled on the endpapers and title pages but generally treated  the text as inviolably sacral space.”23 Throughout succeeding centuries, bibles  bear the impress of their readers’ hands—so much so that, as recently as  2003, a religious polemicist could observe: “There is a difference between  properly marking a bible as we study and defacing it by careless marking.”24 The anthropologist Michael Taussig has explored the many ways in which  societies mar objects of authority. Defacement, he argues, “is like Enlighten- ment. It brings the inside outside, unearthing knowledge, and revealing mys- tery.”25 The desecration of great public objects, Taussig notes, evokes a kind of  social magic, a way of calling attention to what societies hold sacred. “Deface- ment,” he continues, “works on objects the way jokes work on language, bring- ing out their inherent magic, nowhere more so than when those objects have  become routinized and social, like money or the nation’s flag.”26 Taussig is  interested not so much in simple acts of vandalism—graffiti tags, or broken  windows, or the smears on insignificant possessions—as he is in acts that chal- lenge social norms and representations of power. Dollar bills, or flags, or pub- lic works of art: these are the sites of mystery for Taussig, places where “violence  becomes a key component” of social resistance or personal affront. A book of Chaucer or of Shakespeare, a work of doctrine and belief, a  bible or a textbook, a manual of how to speak or act—these are as much  objects of social value as dollar bills or flags. Annotating, or signing, or mar- ring such volumes brings the inside outside. Such acts enable us to see not  just the public text but also the private response. No book is the same once it  has been marked. Its social function, its textual status, its place in literary his- tory or on library or home shelves has changed irrevocably. It becomes part  of the child’s body, sharing pen or pencil trials or colors that bear the pres- sure of the hand. Not every annotation is intentional defacement. But what  the annotated book becomes, what later readers find in books marred or  manipulated by children, is something very different from what it had been  before.27 I Few medieval books bear the impress of the child’s hand as clearly  as the Canterbury Tales manuscript now held in the Princeton University  Library. Known as the Helmingham Manuscript, it was produced in various  130 Representations </page> <page sequence="6"> stages during the later decades of the fifteenth century before coming into the  possession of the Tollemache family of Helmingham Hall in the sixteenth cen- tury. It is full of marginalia, ranging from infantile unlettered marks; to care- fully scripted signatures; to lists of things, words, dates, and times. Even without  these annotations, the text is in poor shape. The whole of the General Prologue  is missing, and the text of the Canterbury Tales begins about a third of the way  through the Knight’s Tale. The core of the manuscript is a set of vellum pages,  but surrounding it are paper ones, written later. What we may have here is a  damaged volume, reconstructed for personal if not domestic use.28 Domestic use implies use by a household, and Chaucer’s works were a  mainstay of the reading for the early modern gentry and aristocratic child.  Given their instructional value, their thematic attentions to parent-child  relationships, their fascinations with romance, and their overwhelming wit  and playfulness, the Tales played a central role in household reading from  the late fifteenth through the late seventeenth century. Advisory and didac- tic writings of the late middle ages praise Chaucer as an ideal teacher of the  young: “Redeth my chylde / redeth his books alle,” enjoins one poem, widely  circulated in the last decades of the fifteenth century and among the first  books printed by England’s first printer, William Caxton, in the late 1470s.29  By the first decades of the sixteenth century, manuscripts and early  printed copies of the Canterbury Tales were filling family libraries and per- sonal collections. Some of them were well read, but many were neglected.  Family heirlooms piled up on shelves; books may have been purchased more  for the mere status of having rather than reading them. And children came  to play in their parental libraries. On the margins of the Helmingham Manuscript are the records of such  play. For example, at the top of one of the pages of the Tale of Melibee, some- one has scrawled, “Alsabatha carman haue rent a pas a paper,” and at the bot- tom, a different writer has inscribed, “I wyl not.” A page from the Tale of  Griselda has “god the father” scribbled at the bottom, while a page of the Par- son’s Tale has “Franses copper ded play in the chirch ha[re],” scribbled at the  top. The close of the Wife of Bath’s Tale served as scrap paper for alphabetic  pen trials, while at the bottom someone has written, “Jhon hyam ded play  with a knif on hise foryde with the poynte,” and another scribbler has added,  upside down along the margin, “The lord shal not honer shall not spede not”  (fig. 1). These comments, with their awkward spelling and their weird irrele- vance to the texts they orbit, reveal a world of childhood pranks transcribed  onto literary pages. At stake is not just their irrelevance but their transgres- sion. These are remarks of mutilation and subversion. John Hyam plays with  a knife on his forehead; Elisabeth Carman tears a piece of paper; Francis  Cowper plays in the church. These are tales of doing damage, subversions of  reading by the playmates of the boy whose parents owned the book.

Princeton University  Library, MS 100, The Canterbury  Tales, fol.91r, pen trials and  marginalia in the hand of Lionel  Tollemache. Reproduced with  permission. That boy, Lionel Tollemache, learned to form his letters on the margins  of this book.30 Throughout, there are pen trials, alphabets, little squares,  and individual words. On the first page of the Friar’s Tale, he has assayed his  name twice: first, in a thick pen stroke “Lyonel,” then, below it, thinner and  lighter, “Lionel.” Below that, he has arrayed the letters a through p, each one  tried four times in a row, the alphabet reading down in columns. And then,  clearly tired by the whole thing, he writes a large capital A and then, below  that, a strange calligraphic doodle—part letter-forms, part distorted faces  (fig. 2). Lionel’s alphabets show up again, with the comment on John Hyam  (and the bizarre, anthropomorphic doodle again) at the bottom of the page  of the Squire’s Tale. Occasionally, an odd word in one of the poems catches  the childish eye, and finds itself repeated in the margin (for example, the  word “hornchilde” from the Tale of Sir Thopas). At the bottom of another  page, there is a poor attempt at secretarial handwriting, “The man that  sitteth fel.” And finally, along the margins of the Squire’s Tale, in a clean black  ink from a well-cut pen, is the exquisitely written, “Lyonell Tollemache,” and  above it the word “Squyer,” both in a beautiful italic hand (fig. 3).  These are the records of a calligraphic education. Young Lionel would be  learning how to write precisely in the age of Mulcaster, when manuals of  132 Representations </page> <page sequence="8"> figure 2.

He would be learning to frame  his hand right, and the progress of his penmanship enacts the injunctions of  such manuals as A New Booke of Copies, printed in 1574.  To write very fayer, your Penne let be newe, Dish, dash, longe tayle flye, false writing eschewe.31 Throughout the marginalia, dish and dash and long tails fly, until with prac- tice he can form his letters well. Young Lionel would have to learn to form  his letters well, but he would also learn to keep his pen and penknife clean  and in their correct hands. “Your penneknife as stay in leaft hand let rest,”  advised the New Booke. Not so John Hyam, who would inappropriately play  with his knife on his forehead. The student could, the New Booke advises, go  so far as to whet the blade on the “slate or shoo sowle”—but the forehead?  John Hyam fails precisely at this moment of his play—he becomes not just a  bad student but a nonwriter, a misuser of the tools of character. So, too, Elizabeth Carman misuses the materials of script. She “hath rent  a pas a paper.” Whether she has torn it up in anger or disgust, or pressed  down too hard on the sheet and cut through with her quill point, or scraped  too roughly with her penknife to erase a blot, she is a failure at her craft. As  much as the good choice and care of a quill, the choice of paper was a tenet  of good writing. Peter Bales, in his widely read Writing Schoolemaster of 1590,  advised that “it maketh verie much to chuse paper or parchment of the  best.”32 Poor choice leads to poor writing, and poor use of the instruments— whether they be playing with the pen or tearing the paper—leads to poor  development. The story told in writing manuals, like the story limned in Lionel Tolle- mache’s marginalia, is one of personal growth. And in the end, the true mark  of an adult is the well-formed signature. In an early modern England where  the everyday scripts grew out of the secretary, court, and book-hand tradi- tions, an italic signature would show not just a calligraphic but a class accom- plishment. Developing from continental humanist hands, italic came to  embody, in the England of the mid-sixteenth century, professional, noble,  educated, and even royal authority. By the second half of the century, English  nobility was following the example of royal italic and, soon afterwards, the  gentry and commercial classes were aspiring to imitate the nobility by learn- ing the script.33 Italic typeface, as Joseph Lowenstein has shown, still bore the  likeness of these humanist and noble hands, and in the London of the Tudor  era “italic remained the typeface of privilege. In the rhetoric of the English  page, the italic is the master-trope.”34 For Squire Lionel Tollemache, the  134 Representations </page> <page sequence="10"> beautiful italic signature marks both his calligraphic education and his social  growth.  II Read from the margins, the Helmingham Manuscript exemplifies  the early modern afterlife of medieval books. Treasures held by parents  become playthings for the children. Another rich example of this process  comes from a collection of printed quartos in the Cambridge University  Library.35 Containing poetry and drama, chronicle and religious polemic  from the first half of the sixteenth century, these books were, by the end of  that century and the beginning of the seventeenth, in the possession of the  Doe family of Enfield in Middlesex. Now cataloged and covered separately,  they were originally bound together into what bibliographers call a Sammel- band: an assembly of separately printed texts that early booksellers, or own- ers, or collectors put together into a personal anthology.36 It is this  Sammelband that came into the hands of two boys of the Doe family, Robert  and Anthony, who scribbled throughout its margins. Most of their markings  simply record name and ownership: “Robert Doe his Booke”; “this is Ant- ony doe.” Sometimes, the books were shared or given. In the copy of the  Dictes and Sayinges of the Philosophers (the first book bound into their Sammel- band), Robert Doe has written, “Robert Doe was the right houner to this  Booke but now I give it to my well be loued brother Antony Doe 1614.” He  has written this statement two other times in two other places, once dated  1616 and again without a date. An awkwardly written “Robert Doe the y  younger” is dated 1620. Reading through the sequence of the quartos, we  can trace a trajectory of naming and gift giving, with dates running from  the sixteen-teens to the sixteen-thirties.37  These are the stories of possession: name, date, and place. But as we  read them through, we find them oscillating between desecration and devo- tion. The copy of John Heywood’s Play of the Wether, the last item in the Sam- melband, is festooned with pen trials, letters, characters, and caricatures (fig.  4). Children have scrawled across the title page, filled the margins with  squiggles and letters. Of the thirteen volumes originally bound together,  The Play of the Wether does not get the most, but it certainly gets the weirdest  sets of marginalia. On the blank verso of the title page, someone has crudely  drawn a picture of two men hanging from the gallows, dated it 1633, drawn  a line beneath the picture, and then written out the following lines (fig. 5). These to thifes Robed a man At Stratford riding  Devotion and Defacement: Reading Children’s Marginalia 135 </page> <page sequence="11"> To Wickham market For to bye some corne And Caring a Good delle  Of Coine a bout Him Was Robed and Soe be it The legal violence of this scene, in word and image, complements the vigor  of the ink marks in the book—as if the brothers were enacting precisely the  opposite of the injunction from the New Booke of Copies: to eschew dish and  dash and flying tails.  What would have caught the hand and eye in this work in particular?  Like many of the texts in this little collection, it would have been well-suited  to younger readers. Heywood himself, in his role as courtly playwright to  Henry VIII, supervised performances by children (most likely the boys of St.  Paul’s choir school), and there is evidence that The Play of the Wether would  have been performed, at least in part, by boy actors.38 A public memory of  Heywood’s children’s theater may be jogged by the last of the “players  names” on the title page: “Boy the lest that can play.” With its classically  inspired content wedded to colloquial English social satire, it would have  served as an entertaining introduction to the styles of literary politics in ear- lier Tudor England. Moreover, with its dramatic structure of petition, legal  claim, and judgment, it could certainly have stimulated someone to record a  different kind of legal retribution on its empty page. Mery-Report (the gar- rulous vice figure of the play) goes off from Jupiter’s court to survey the  world. I have been, he says, “from hevyn as far as heven is hens” (line 197),  and then he lists all the locales in alliterating groups: from Lovyn, London,  and Lombardy; through Wansworth, Welbeck, and Westchester; to Boston,  Bristow and Berwick; and on and on, until the made-up (and no doubt to  the youthful reader, hilarious) “parish of Butsbery” (lines 198–211).39 In  such a world of divine retribution and playful geography, the account of two  thieves robbing a man at Stratford riding to Wickham market, stands as an  imaginative response to the itinerary of Mery-Report: “The devil himself,  without more leasure, / Could not have gone halfe thus myche, I am sure!”  (lines 212–13). The Play of the Wether stages a world of humorous subversion,  riding on the knife edge of violence, and concluding with the Boy avowing  that, “if any snow come, / When I make my snowballys, ye shall have some”  (lines 1237–38). The volumes of this Sammelband contained not only goads to play but  also injunctions to prayer. Works of rigorous doctrine such as Paul Bush’s  Extirpation of Ignorancy received their share of annotations too: attempts at  copying out references to familiar bible stories, echoes of textbook teaching,  ripples of psalms. In one margin to this book, Anthony Doe writes, “And in  136 Representations </page> <page sequence="12"> figure 4.

Devotion and Defacement: Reading Children’s Marginalia 137 </page> <page sequence="13"> the miste of my house walke.” This line comes from Psalm 101 in the widely  circulated Sternhold-Hopkins Psalter.40 With its simple, metrical translation,  this psalter evolved through a series of editions from 1533 until 1562 (when  it was published by John Day as The Whole Booke of Psalms). From that year  until 1600, the book went through thirty editions, a mainstay of education  for the English young. Its easy rhythms would have offered a good model for  an amateur, and Anthony Doe may have heard it in a fragment he himself  inscribed into the margin of the Extirpation. “O Lord my god I cum to thee  in this my grif and paine now turn to me in my destris and.” This text fits  perfectly into the stanzaic pattern of the Sternhold-Hopkins psalm transla- tions. It can be lineated: O Lord my god I cum to thee In this my grif and paine Now turn to me in my destris  And . . .  There are resonances here to many different psalms (most notably Psalm  30), but there is nothing that corresponds precisely to these lines.41 They  may well be, in fact, a bit of metrical psalmistry of Anthony’s own: a fragment  of a poem, inspired by the literary practice of his time, his place, and his  education. At such a moment, a child’s literary voice emerges from the mar- gins of the book. We see here something different from the scribbles in the  Helmingham Chaucer. For, rather than announcements of playful transgres- sion or failed calligraphic skill, we see an avowal of devotion. Anthony Doe’s  marginalia chart a desire to belong, to repeat the words of belief and, per- haps, to come up with such words of his own. III Repeating the words of belief prompted children throughout his- tory, and the techniques of writing, the habits of literate instruction, and  the ideals of the book itself made the passage to the North American colo- nies from their inception. Half a century after the Doe brothers were scrib- bling in their books, writing masters had established themselves in the  major settlements. Copybooks, well into the late eighteenth century, mimed  the injunctions from Elizabethan time. The Youth’s Instructor, printed in  1757, synthesized a century and a half of cultural and calligraphic dicta: “All  Letter ev’n at Head and Feet must stand; / Bear lightly on thy Pen, and  keep a steady Hand.”42 Writing the straight line carried as much moral  weight in North America as in England, as penmanship became institution- alized as part of the larger education in correctness, care, and cleanliness  that were the social values of the schoolroom.  138 Representations </page> <page sequence="14"> Two changes, however, marked the ideals and the practices of writing in  the colonies. The first was the explicit association of good penmanship and  freedom. Even though writing was a discipline taught to encourage self-con- trol and task completion, it was recognized that it could foster for the child a  means of self-expression. As Jennifer Monaghan puts it, summarizing the  developments in eighteenth-century America, “Once children had practiced  the disciplined aspects of writing, their wish to express themselves emerged  as they heeded the more subversive subtexts of writing instruction in unau- thorized marginal notations in their copy books, in diaries, and in ‘familiar’  letters of their own composition.”43 A second change was the attention to writing instruction for young  women and the “feminization” of good penmanship. Girls on both sides of  the Atlantic were increasingly encouraged, throughout the eighteenth cen- tury, to develop skills in handwriting as part of a broader social education.44  Such skills were seen, in large part, as the natural extension of the ideology  of female manual dexterity. Embroidery, drawing, keyboard playing—all  were the idealized occupations of the girl at leisure. A good hand was an  extension of fair form, and elegance in writing had become, by the mid- eighteenth century, an articulation of the beauty and, ultimately, the mar- riageability of a young woman.45  Writing well in America also contributed to the ideals of citizenship. In  1787, Benjamin Rush argued that “writing a fair and legible hand” was “a  necessary branch of female education,” and he went on to note that in  America “the simplicity of the citizens of a republic” demanded a simplicity  of hand. For boys, penmanship was keyed to commerce and control: a “mer- cantile running hand,” suitable for entries in the ledger. For girls, it was a  skill set for enhancement: personal letters, calling cards, and diaries.46 And yet, the “female pen” was everywhere. The new literacy of the early  republic was, in many ways, a female literacy. More and more women learned  not only how to read but also how to write, and in that writing to express a  distinct sense of self in signatures and selections. John Jenkins’s The Art of  Writing (originally published in 1791) captures these changes.47 Addressed  to both “young gentlemen and ladies,” Jenkins’s book provides a systematic  introduction to good penmanship. All of the basics that have been develop- ing from early copybooks are here (how to sit, how to hold and keep the  pen, how to form letters clearly). The pedagogic impulse of the book is clear,  too, at its close: designed for both “schools and private families,” the book “is  so contrived, that young gentlemen and ladies . . . may immediately become,  not only their own instructors, but instructors of others.” The 1813 reprint  of the book opens with a picture of a young girl, facing left, having just fin- ished writing in her copy book, while overhead a calligraphic inscription  reads: “If you would win a Pen of gold Learn first of all your Pen to hold.” It   Devotion and Defacement: Reading Children’s Marginalia 139 </page> <page sequence="15"> is a simple rhyming adage, but when read together with the text the young  girl has composed, we see embodied here the union of good penmanship  and good faith. “Love God, Obey your Parents, and Improve your time for  Eternity.”  There is a maximal feel to these lines: a universal, almost biblical injunc- tive quality, as if the Ten Commandments were distilled here, not into the  double tablets of the desert, but the double page of the girl’s copybook. But  they evoke, as well, not only old commandments but also more recent  hymns. For Isaac Watts, such sentiments were central to his verse. Perhaps  the best-known educational theorist after John Locke, Watts was also the  most widely read children’s poet of the eighteenth century.48 His Divine  Songs, first printed in 1715, was the single most popular book of children’s  verse ever published, and his Hymns and Spiritual Songs (published from 1707  to 1709) became a staple of the church. They became, too, a staple of the  household, both in Britain and in America, and they survive not just in  printed books, but in quotations, commonplace books, journals, literary par- odies, and amateur poems from the time of Ben Franklin to that of Louisa  May Alcott.  Watts’s hymns and songs brim with exhortations like those found on Jen- kins’s frontispiece. God and parents stand side-by-side as authorities for chil- dren, while the sense of human time is everywhere. Indeed, if Watts’s poetry  teaches anything, it is precisely an awareness of the gulf between the short  time of the life of man or woman and the eternity that stretches forward.  One of his most popular hymns began, “Life is the time to serve the Lord,”  and when it was cataloged and set to music later in the eighteenth and the  nineteenth centuries, it bore the title, “Time and Eternity.”49 A garbled version of this hymn splays across a blank page in a young  woman’s copy of The Holy Bible Abridged (New York, 1792), now in the Prince- ton University Library. The first flyleaves bear the name Rozatta Bedell in an  awkward hand. At first, she seems to practice, “Rozatta Bedell’s Book” at the  top of an empty page. Then, at the bottom, she has written her name twice.  Two pages later, she writes out some lines from Watts’s hymn and beneath  them attempts to sign her name—the first two times so badly that she crosses  them out violently, and then, on the third try, gets it right (fig. 6). Life is the time To serve the Lord The time ensure The great reward Life is the hour That god has given To escape From hell And fly to heaven 140 Representations </page> <page sequence="16"> figure 6. Princeton University  Library, Sinclair Hamilton Collection.  No. 1363s, The Holy Bible Abridged  (New York, 1792), flyleaf ii, in the  hand of Rozatta Bedell. Reproduced  with permission.  These words reproduce the first lines of the first two stanzas of Watts’s hymn.  I do not think that they are so much copies from the text as they are scraps  of memory: bits of the opening of a poem that would, by the early nine- teenth century, have been a staple of the children’s library and a centerpiece  of the church service, where it had been sung to familiar melodies.50 As the  journal American National Preacher put it, in 1843, “We are all familiar with it.  Almost every child can repeat it.”51 Whatever these lines were for Rozatta Bedell, they become for the mod- ern reader a lens through which we read her book. They relocate the bible  stories in hymnal devotion. In a sense, they are a kind of extra moral to the  story, like a bit of exemplary verse tacked on to an Aesopic fable. Like the  scribblings of Lionel Tollemache or the children of the Doe family, Rozatta’s  writing hovers between devotion and defacement: between the expression of  abiding faith and the impatience with the hand that phrases it. As Watts him- self wrote, in the final stanza to this hymn, Then what my thoughts design to do, My hands, with all your might pursue.  Devotion and Defacement: Reading Children’s Marginalia 141 </page> <page sequence="17"> For anybody learning how to write, such lines would resonate not only  with injunctions for good works but also with instruction in good penman- ship. “Keep a steady Hand,” enjoined The Youth’s Instructor, while a contem- porary volume, The American Instructor, also noted that an “industrious  Hand, / Will make this Art your Servant at Command.”52 The modern scholar pages through her book to find, on later flyleaves,  names and dates, a family history recorded in her slowly steadying hand.  “Rozatta Bedell,” she writes at the volume’s close, “was born December 24th  day on Friday between 11 and 12 ocloock in the morning 1804.” There is a  brother, too, Amos Bedell, born August 17 1806, and, on a different leaf,  dead August 30, 1829. There is a Richard and Joseph, a Benjamin Fowler, and  a Rhoda Ann Fowler. Joseph Bedell is dead in 1869, Richard dies in 1867, and  Rhoda Ann Fowler dies in 1879. Like many bibles, this book holds a family  history, and just below the final printed page, beneath the “FINIS,” Rozatta  has entered her new married name: “Rozatta Fowler” (fig. 7). Her abridged  bible shapes a family’s devotion. Its content offers not just moral history but  lives; it is a scripture full of births and deaths, of genealogies and lineages. It  teaches not only how to lead a life but also how the early lives were led. It  prompts its reader to record the names and dates. Its final printed sentence is  a mark of birth: “Six months before Christ, John the Baptist was born, who  was sent to prepare the way for the reception of the Messiah.” And then the  “FINIS,” and Rozatta’s new name, and the statement of her own birth. The  modern scholar cannot read this book without acknowledging the social  practice of book ownership or recognizing that this woman has inscribed her- self into a book of births and deaths, of names and notations. IV The modern scholar comes upon this book much as Mr. Lockwood  comes upon Catherine’s volumes at the start of Emily Brontë’s Wuthering  Heights.53 The novel begins in 1801, as Lockwood recalls how he first came to  the estate, how he took up his tenancy, and how he came to know his landlord,  Heathcliff, and his tragic past. He enters Heathcliff’s house much as an anti- quarian would come upon an old book, pausing “to admire a quantity of gro- tesque carving lavished over the front,” and then “the date ‘1500’ and the name  ‘Hareton Earnshaw’” (4–5). This is the opening moment of what many mod- ern critics have recognized as the novel’s presentation of Lockwood himself as  a reader—our recognition that the narrative is, from the start, already filtered  through a fictional reader’s experience and, furthermore, that the retelling of  that experience depends on the material representation of lived place as  inscribed space.54 Heathcliff’s home is already marked with marginalia.  142 Representations </page> <page sequence="18"> figure 7. Princeton University Library,  Sinclair Hamilton Collection. No. 1363s,  The Holy Bible Abridged (New York, 1792),  110, with the name “Rozatta Fowler.”  Reproduced with permission.  One night, soon afterwards, as angry dogs and foul weather conspire to  keep him at the Heathcliff house, Lockwood goes to bed in one of the guest  rooms and there finds the books of Heathcliff’s old beloved, Catherine.  Placing his candle on a ledge, he sees a few old, mildewed books, along with  writing scratched into the ledge’s paint. “This writing . . . was nothing but a  name repeated in all kinds of characters, large and small—Catherine Earn- shaw; here and there varied to Catherine Heathcliff, and then again to Cathe- rine Linton” (38–39). The names come at him, and he dozes off to find them  “vivid as specters—the air swarmed with Catherines.” Pulling a book down  from the ledge, he finds a “Testament,” with the flyleaf inscription: “Cathe- rine Earnshaw her book” (39). Soon, he is flipping through all of the vol- umes, and “scarcely one chapter had escaped a pen and ink commentary . . .  covering every morsel of blank that the printer had left.” He goes on: Some were detached sentences; other parts took the form of a regular diary,  scrawled in an unformed, childish hand. At the top of an extra page, quite a trea- sure probably when first lighted on, I was greatly amused to behold an excellent  caricature of my friend Joseph, rudely yet powerfully sketched. An immediate inter- est kindled within me for the unknown Catherine, and I began, forthwith, to deci- pher her faded hieroglyphics. (40)  Devotion and Defacement: Reading Children’s Marginalia 143 </page> <page sequence="19"> Lockwood’s discovery is the reader’s as well, as we all see together Cathe- rine’s inscriptions, all read her words on the page, all hear her nascent nar- rative voice as she records events, transcribes her thoughts, evokes emotions,  and reports conversations. For the next few pages of Wuthering Heights, we  are all, in effect, reading another novel, one now written by another woman  decades before this one. Here are Catherine and Heathcliff as youngsters,  along with the servant, Joseph, transcribed into voices of their own. Joseph’s  words are spelled in a kind of “eye dialect” to evoke the sound of his speech,  while Catherine’s brother Hindley barks at them in polysyllables. Here, too,  are other books: the bibles that the elders read, the prayer books that the  children take, and the very book that Lockwood now is reading, inscribed by  the girl: “I reached this book, and a pot of ink from the shelf, and pushed  the house-door ajar to give me light, and I have got the time on with writing  for twenty minutes.” This complex scene peels away layer upon layer of readers and writers,  voices and victims. Dialects clash; tempers flare; books are thrown about,  torn up, or written in. It is a scene of domestic violence told as a story of tex- tual defacement. Catherine and Heathcliff have damaged their volumes—in  Joseph’s words, “Miss Cathy’s riven th’ back off Th’ Helmet uh Salvation, un’  Heathcliff’s pawsed his fit intuh t’ first part uh T’ Broad Way to Destruction!”  We do not simply have the evidence that children wrote in books; we do not  simply have the character of Catherine speaking, in essence, from the past.  What matters here is that both factual and fictional activity centers on dam- aging a book. Catherine’s marginalia turn into novelistic form the social  practices of child marginalia. The child asserts identity by writing in the  book—indeed, Catherine has gone one better by carving her name into the  ledge. Much like the enigmatic scribbles in the Helmingham Manuscript,  Catherine’s marginal annotations show us children at violent play, setting  their willfulness against the stark authority of literature. Much like the Doe  brothers and Rozatta Bedell, she seeks to match the language of the printed  page with her own literary voice. And Mr. Lockwood, interloper in the interlinear, stands for all modern  readers coming to the markings of the past. He enters Heathcliff’s house,  and Brontë’s fiction, precisely at that time when professional archivalists  were replacing the country-house philologists of eighteenth-century dilet- tantism. He walks in through the threshold of professional book scholarship,  a contemporary of figures such as Thomas Frognall Dibdin, the master of  bibliography whose searches of the great collections of the early nineteenth  century grounded book history in its characteristic blend of sentiment and  scholarship. Lockwood approaches Heathcliff’s house as Dibdin enters pri- vate libraries in search of early books—both entries rich with awe and allu- sion. “The very Genius of malignity and mischief seemed to brood on the  144 Representations </page> <page sequence="20"> face of the water,” wrote Dibdin in his Reminiscences, recalling his approach  to Ham House on the River Thames with all the smoke of Milton and the  King James Bible in his rhetoric. And then he enters. “What a library to  enter! . . . Ha! There be gems, in this very wonderful book-paradise worth  the setting.” How like Dibdin is Lockwood, unearthing the bound “treasure”  of the book, finding in scrawled caricatures a set of “faded hieroglyphics”  that he must “decipher.”55  How like he is, as well, to Melville’s Redburn. As the eponymous hero of  this novel flips through old books in his father’s library, he finds its scrawls,  its crayon sketches “part and parcel of the precious book, which go to make  up the sum of its treasure to me.”56 In one of them, an old guide to Liver- pool, Redburn uncovers not an enigmatic mausoleum to the dead, but a  record of his own writing. “Some of the scrawls are my own; as poets do with  their juvenile sonnets, I might write under this horse, ‘Drawn at the age of  three years,’ and under this autograph, ‘Executed at the age of eight.’”  There is, as well, the handiwork of Redburn’s brothers, sisters, and cousins;  there is an inscription by his father; there are memoranda, lists, and annota- tions to the foldout maps within this old guidebook. These fictions of the marginal take on an added physical dimension in  the typographical arrangements of Melville’s and Brontë’s books. The first  editions of both use italics to mark out the marginal from the mainstream.  In Wuthering Heights, Lockwood’s reading breaks itself up between lines of  black dots on the published page. In Redburn, Melville goes even further,  offering elaborate reproductions of the marginalia, lists, and paratexts that  crowd into the guidebooks—at one point fearing that “the printer will not  be able to give a fac-simile” of all the items he has copied out (145). In the  novelistic presentation of the childish and the marginal, typography disjoints  the reader. The broken page effects a break in fictional as well as literary  history—a sense of time laid out not linearly but spatially.57 For both Mr. Lockwood and young Redburn, too, the encounter with  the annotated text is an encounter with the sacred. The guide to Liverpool,  his father’s book, takes on the status of a holy relic: “By my father’s sacred  memory, and all sacred privacies of fond family reminiscences, I will not! I  will not quote thee, old Morocco, before the cold face of the marble- hearted world” (150). For Lockwood, Catherine’s books are coded trea- sures. His word “hieroglyphics” evokes a lexicography bristling with secrecy  and magic, beginning with John Florio’s definition of them as “mystical or  enigmaticall letters” (1598). “These Hieroglyphs,” wrote an anonymous  contributor to Fraser’s Magazine in 1831, “are a true Sacred Writing.” And  poetry, wrote Julius Charles Hare in his widely read collection of aphorisms,  Guesses at Truth (first published in 1828), “is the key to the hieroglyphics of  nature.58  Devotion and Defacement: Reading Children’s Marginalia 145 </page> <page sequence="21"> VThe childish hand offers a kind of sacred writing, a mystery, a  form of devotion and defacement that takes us back to Taussig’s blending  of sacrality and stain. “Defacement works on objects the way jokes work on  language, bringing out their inherent magic.” What happens when the mar- ginal brings out real magic? In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the young student gets, by chance,  a battered textbook and finds in its handwritten additions and corrections a  new magic for the classroom.59 To his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had scribbled all over the pages,  so that the margins were as black as the printed portions. . . . It was really very irri- tating, having to try and decipher the directions under all the stupid scribbles of  the previous owner, who for some reason had taken issue with the order to cut up  the sopophorous bean and had written in the alternative instruction: Crush with the flat side of silver dagger, releases juice better than cutting. Following these and the other revised directions, Harry quickly masters the  potions assignment, as his liquid turns the right color, gives off the right  aroma, and wins the professor’s loud approval. “I just tried a few things writ- ten in the margin,” Harry explains later to his suspicious friends. And later,  left alone, he finds “scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the  same small, cramped handwriting as the instructions . . . This book is the Prop- erty of the Half-Blood Prince.”60  Harry’s previous annotator has defined himself as more than a correc- tor. He presents himself as author. Not just the book, but the marginal  recipes and spells remain his property. “The more Harry pored over the  book, the more he realized how much was in there, . . . also the imagina- tive little jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins, which Harry was sure,  judging by the crossings-out and revisions that the Prince had invented  himself.”61 The margin tempts the reader. But it torments the librarian. The job of  the librarian has always been to keep copies clean—not simply as pristine  objects but as unmarked and thus potentially identical representatives of  what they are. One copy should be as good as another. That is the myth of  print itself: that through the mechanical reproduction of identical copies,  any single copy is as good as any other. The very concept of the public or  school library (as opposed to a rare book archive) is that it contains the same  texts as any other: that it shelves representatives of books, rather than unique  artifacts. A marked up copy of a novel or a textbook simply is no longer the  146 Representations </page> <page sequence="22"> same thing as a clean, printed one. It provides distraction, it predisposes  reading.62  The rise of the library is thus inseparable from the suppression of deface- ment. If there was scarcely a child, for William Morris Hunt in 1890, “whose  first impulse was not to scribble,” then it became the job of children’s librar- ians to control that impulse. The first children’s room in an American public  library also opened in 1890, in Brookline, Massachusetts. The women who  were America’s children’s librarians—Mary Bean of Brookline, Anne Carroll  Moore of the New York Public, and Effie Louise Power of Cleveland—set  standards of social behavior for their patrons. Libraries made citizens. They  taught children how to read but also how to live: quietly, thoughtfully,  respectfully. Many libraries insisted that children wash their hands before  opening books. Many, too, established fines for overdue copies, not only to  pay for library maintenance but also to instill a sense of economic responsi- bility in the young citizen.63 These women were the “guardians” of American children’s literature.64  But they were also guardians of literacy. They radically recalibrated chil- dren’s notions of engagement with the book. By enforcing clean hands, by  punishing personal annotations, by keeping books in circulation, they  detached the book as personal object from the reader. Books were things to  be dipped into; they were things to be shared; they were things to be kept  clean. They were not things to be personalized. When Harry Potter brings  his copy of Advanced Potion Making into the school library, the librarian looks  over his shoulder to see the same scribbles Harry sees. “What have you been  doing to that book, you depraved boy?” she cries, in italics. “It isn’t the library’s,  it’s mine,” replies Harry, distinguishing possession from institutional belong- ing. But the librarian is not assuaged. “‘Despoiled,’ she hissed. ‘Desecrated!  Befouled!’” Hers is a lexicon of defacement, a series of synonyms that are as  much a hex as anything encoded in the margins of his book. But Harry Potter is a tale of marginalia. Its wizardry is but a heightened  form of literacy. Potions and spells demand not just a flair for wands but a  facility with words. The true place of magic in Harry Potter books is not the  forest or the laboratory but the library. Scenes of reading are the moments  of true revelation. Take, for example, the opening sentence of The Half-Blood  Prince: “It was nearing midnight and the Prime Minister was sitting alone in  his office, reading a long memo that was slipping through his brain without  leaving the slightest trace of meaning behind.”65 This is “the other minister,”  the minister of Muggles, reading in his office, and it is clear from the start  that politics itself is something of a form of reading. “The more he attempted  to focus on the print on the page before him, the more clearly the Prime  Minister could see the gloating face of one of his political opponents.” Just   Devotion and Defacement: Reading Children’s Marginalia 147 </page> <page sequence="23"> as Harry, later in the book, will seek to focus on the print and see, instead,  the annotations of the Half-Blood Prince efface the old instructions, so this  all-too-human minister finds someone else emerging from his blurry page.  Throughout, figures rise up between the lines to challenge authority. They  claim possession or deflect attention. They are the “other authors” of the  books we read, much as the characters in Harry Potter must deal with an  “other minister.”  The fantasy of Harry Potter is that, hidden in the margins or between the  lines, there lies magic. Faces emerge from wearisome memoranda; school- books hide scribbles left for knowing eyes to see. The wizards live, in essence,  between the lines of life: how else can we explain a platform nine-and-three- quarters at King’s Cross; how else can we find Number Twelve Grimauld  Place slipped between consecutively numbered houses; how else can we find  Diagon Alley wedged in the interstices of urban brickwork? If wizards live  along the byways of the everyday, they live, too, on the borders of deface- ment. A slip of the wand, and magic becomes mayhem, a girl’s skin bristles  with warts, teeth keep on growing, bones shatter. “Levicorpus,” Harry finds in  the crabbed annotations of the Half-Blood Prince, and he deploys it, acci- dentally suspending his friend Ron from some invisible string. Levicorpus:  raise the body. This spell, a brilliant parody of resurrection, works not just on  the friends and foes of Hogwarts. It works on us, too, as we are held in sus- pense by fiction. These tales of marginality raise questions about social and political  authority. They challenge authorship. And they deflect the reader’s eyes from  center to side. If the child’s impulse is to scribble on a margin, it is an adult  impulse to read and regulate it. Librarians might lament defacements—but  when is it the librarian’s responsibility to record such defacements? This question stands at the heart of what it means to be a scholar of his- torical literature in its material context. It points to the ways in which the  institutions of the book have mediated, if not even conditioned, the schol- arly engagement with the object. And it highlights the place of the physical  book in an age of digital transmission and of the physical archive in an age  of virtual research. But this is not merely a question for the librarian. It is a  question for the novelist, the scholar, and the teacher. Pre- and early-modern  literary study offers critical insight not just into the artifacts of past imagina- tions but into the artifices of our own. On the cusp of digital literacy, when  marginal annotation and physical defacement may disappear altogether, the  study of the book not just as written or printed but as read object compels us  to engage with the physicality of texts, the materiality of writing, the houses  of reading.66 Like Lionel Tollemache’s friend who played with his blade on  his forehead, children hold their books on the knife edge of damage. But,  148 Representations </page> <page sequence="24"> like Mr. Lockwood, we stumble upon the hieroglyphs of boys and girls, and,  if they give us dreams on sodden nights, they provide us, too, with spells for  our scholarly imaginations.

Premodern Western families, he argued, had  no concept of the child as an emotional investment. See L’Enfant et la vie famil- ial sous l’ancien regime (Paris, 1960). These views have been vigorously chal- lenged in the past half century, and many studies have sought to recover not  just a premodern history of childhood, but also a more culturally specific  understanding of the history of the family than Ariès developed.

A good example of this habit is a copy of a 1628 reprinting  of the King James, now in the Huntington Library. Around the royal arms, a child- ish hand has written the motto of the order of the garter, “Hony soit qui mal y  pense,” in thick and blocky letters, along with the motto of the Prince of Wales,  “Dieu et mon droit.” “O lord thou doth” is scrawled across the page below the coat  of arms, while “dieu et mon droit” is badly lettered at the top of the next.

See, too, the injunctions of Isaac Watts in his  Improvement of the Mind (first published in 1741, and frequently reprinted):  “Mark what is new or unknown to you before. . . . [If the author] does not  explain his ideas or prove the positions well, mark the faults or defects, and  endeavour to do better, either in the margin of your book, or rather in some  papers of your own. . . . If the method of a book be irregular, reduce it into  form by a little analysis of your own, or by hints in the margin” (London, 1814),  40–42. 25.

For a brilliant meditation on the many ways in which a book becomes “not a  book,” converted from a “functional” object to a “symbolic” one, potentially a  “symbol, a totem, a fetish,” see Garrett Stewart, “Bookwork as Demediation,”  Critical Inquiry 36 (2010): 410–57. 28. The Helmingham Manuscript is Princeton University Library, MS Princeton  100. For a description of the manuscript and its texts, see John M. Manly and  Edith Rickert, The Text of the Canterbury Tales (Chicago, 1940), 1:256–65. I have  discussed the manuscript in detail in my Chaucer and His Readers: Imagining the  Author in Late-Medieval England (Princeton, 1993), 85–116. My discussion here  develops, qualifies, and corrects this material. 29. See Lerer, Chaucer and His Readers, 85–116. 30. There were at least five Lionel Tollemaches alive in the late sixteenth century.  Manly and Rickert review the provenance of the manuscript, and, based on  identifiable hands, written dates, and the names of the playmates, propose Lio- nel Tollemache IV as the most likely candidate. Manly and Rickert list him as  dying in 1612, but I can find no Lionel Tollemache in the records who died in  this year. Lionel III died in 1575 (a date that does correspond with Manly and  Rickert’s date for this Lionel); his son, Lionel, was born in 1562 and died  between 1617 and 1621. “John Hyam” appears four times in the manuscript;  Lionel Tollemache III (died 1575) left a gold ring to his “cousin John Higham.”  “Alsabatha Carman” appears twice; John Carman of Walsham, died 1556, men- tions a daughter Elizabeth in his will. These would be, therefore, the children  of the generation of Lionel IV, and, based on his dates, we may estimate the  dates of the marginalia as the 1570s.
