<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vladimir Lossky. In the Image and Likeness of God. Pp. 232. (St Vladimir's Seminary Press, I974.) No price given. Modern Western theology and philosophy have largely ignored the phe nomenon of Orthodoxy. This is not altogether surprising, for apart from a few popular publications there is little relevant literature easily available to non-specialists. The publication of this work, however, testifies to growing interest in Orthodoxy amongst English-speaking readers, and also indicates the importance of Lossky as an exponent of it. A translation of A l'Image et a la Ressemblance de Dieu (Aubier-Montaigne, Paris, I967), the book is the third complete volume by Lossky (d. I958) to appear in English. It follows The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church (I957) and The Vision of God (I963). Much ground covered by these earlier volumes is retraced here (some passages are almost verbally identical) and the result, although</page><page sequence="2">I26 RELIGIOUS STUDIES likely to make rather hard reading for those unfamiliar with Orthodox thinking, is an erudite and impressive account, both historical and apolo getical, of its fundamental claim that knowledge of God is possible in human experience. As Lossky tells us, Orthodoxy 'has never made a fine distinction between the realm of theology and that of mysticism ... all truly dogmatic work has a basis in mystical experience... all mystical work is connected to the realm of dogma, in that it expresses or exposes the content of the experience of divine things' (p. 50). Whether he is merely seeking to understand the history of Orthodox thought or whether he is assessing theological judgements, any serious reader of the book will, I think, find much of value in it. Particularly interesting is an account of grace which avoids many of the familiar objections to the notion while remaining, as exposition, in line with a recognizably Christian tradition. On theological grounds, Lossky clearly indicates deficiencies in accounts of Redemption like that of Anselm's Cur Deus Homo? (though his objections are familiar), and he also provides a lucid account of the meaning of 'dogma' and 'tradition' which should be of interest to many at the present stage of Catholic/Non-Catholic debate. There is a fine chapter on Divine kingship which emphasizes one poorly publicized approach to theism, highlighting the idea that creation implies a risk on God's part: '...the God of the Bible reveals himself by his very wrath as he who undertook the risk of creating a universe whose perfection is continually jeopardized by the freedom of those in whom that perfection ought to reach its highest level' (p. 214). In the West, the implications of this have been worked out Christologically by Scotus and Maurice Blondel. Those who would dismiss or ignore these developments out of hand might learn from Lossky at this point. The only real problem with the chapter (see also chapter i, p. I 5) concerns its claim that 'God willed to be the Creator' and to its reference to 'the contingency of his will' conferring a contingent aspect on his work. There seems to be a damaging anthropomorphism here; one, furthermore, that does not appear demanded from a Christian theist. Can he not simply insist that God is the Creator? Perhaps not, but it needs to be argued and Lossky does not attempt to offer enlightenment here, coming dangerously near to making God like a moral agent who is 'good' because he chooses to do something from which he could have refrained. But is it possible to say that God is good at all? Here we confront the question of the knowledge of God, Lossky's main theme. As in his other writings, he recommends a theological tradition beginning with Philo and Clement of Alexandria and concluding with Gregory of Nyssa, Pseudo Dionysius and Gregory Palamas. Philo makes darkness (yvoyos) a way of stating 'the unknowability of the divine essence' and 'the "formless and blind search" of the knowing subject incapable of grasping God' (p. 33). For Clement, man is in darkness when left to himself, and he stands in</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS I27 need of God's self-revelation through the Son who is accepted in a leap of faith as a result of which God is still not known but is apprehended as the unknowable (T6O &amp;yv&amp;CToV Vo0v), the abyss (Pc5os). Because this does not pay adequate attention to the Trinity as 'transcending every relation with the created', it is not, Lossky tells us, a satisfactory stage in the development of thought. Passing through Origen and Evagrius Ponticus who stop short at a 'mysticism of light', we must advance to Gregory of Nyssa and Dionysius and talk of 'ignorance and darkness as a means of knowing the transcendent God' (p. 35). We must insist on the 'non opposition of opposites', that 'The transcendent Deity is celebrated at the same time both as unity and as Trinity. In fact he is not knowable either by us or by any other kind of being, whether as unity or as Trinity' (p. 27). Something beyond knowledge thus emerges: 'a mode of communion with God... If God appears first as light and then as darkness, this means for Gregory that of the divine essence there is no vision, and that union with God is a way surpassing vision or eEopia, going beyond intelligence to where knowledge vanishes and only love remains - or, rather, to where gnosis becomes ayarrn ' (p. 37). We cannot know God 'in his essence', then, and if we must say how we do know him the answer is in the divine energies (Buv'a.eIS). The idea is associated with Gregory Palamas but, according to Lossky, precedes him: 'One can know God positively... one can know him negatively, through ignorance denying to his subject all that pertains to the realm of being, since God is above being, above everything that can be named. The opposition between these two ways, between these two theologies, cannot be resolved by any reconciliation whatsoever, according to Palamas, faithful in this to the thought of the Areopagite' (pp. 52-3). The general problem with this, as with so many accounts of mystical theology, is one of intelligibility. There is, of course, the initial difficulty of claiming a cognitive experience of God. Readers of this journal will already be familiar with a variety of arguments ranged on both sides of the debate. There is, however, a further obscurity raised by Lossky's particular account of how experience of God is to be characterized. As he explains himself, 'we are in the presence of an antinomic theology which proceeds by opposition of contrary but equally true propositions' (p. 5I). The antinomies noted in the passages quoted above are, in other words, not only affirmed as apparent but also as real. They lead to the idea of 'union'. Yet taken in its context, as a strict alternative to knowing, this can only leave us without knowledge at all, which is simply baffling because it appears to evacuate the cognitive element on which the idea of union is based and because it seems unnecessary to the argument in hand. Love may be all-important, as Lossky suggests, but it cannot oppose or exclude knowledge if it is to count as a means of further knowing; nor need it be said to do so. Rather, love may be called an aspect of knowing in that</page><page sequence="4">128 RELIGIOUS STUDIES knowledge in the mystical sense requires the effort of attention. One might go further and suggest that all knowledge is, in effect, a response to God. At any rate, either we know God or we do not. Certainly, knowledge can become more profound; but, for Lossky, union transcends knowledge, cancels it out, as a way of knowing God, which thesis, he says, is 'a necessary dogmatic corrective' to the mysticism of light, summing up the best in the traditions of Alexandria and Cappadocia and preserving an account of the Christian vocation which avoids the danger of making it an esoteric, gnostic intellectualism, something for the few, as well as something that fails to take account of 'the whole man'. Yet this mysticism of light is not necessarily the contrast to some of the things that Lossky admires in the two Gregories and in Dionysius. It is clearly an 'intellectualism', but it is not at all clear that intellectualism is a bad thing, something preserved for the minority or something static and excluding the ideal of union with God as 'an infinite progress of the soul'. 'Intellectualism' can be viewed as a union of subject and object that continually provides new riches for the former without suggesting that the latter is in any sense 'taped', or reduced to the level of a mathematical formula. Thus one is also led to ask why God's 'energies' should be distinguished from his 'essence'. The question has often been raised, and Lossky does not appear to offer any acceptable reason for ignoring it. Yet ignore it he does, and the account he endorses renders God's 'energies ' something other than God or a part of God which lies outside his unknowable essence. For a Christian theology of knowledge of God this seems fatal. If we do not know the essence, how can we affirm it? It is Locke and Berkeley over again. And how can one admit division into God in the light of the Christian claim that God is unity? These remarks are not intended to suggest that Lossky's account of the knowledge of God lacks value. Still less do they entail that the tradition represented by him is unworthy of consideration. Although they might do well to remember The Cloud of Unknowing and St John of the Cross, the Orthodox will probably view what has been said here as illustrative of an obstinately Western mentality - a reply made by Lossky on p. 53. It may well serve to vindicate the currently fashionable view that understanding is culture-relative or, in the case of religion, necessarily related to partici pation in a given language game or games. But the claim to know God is essential to Orthodoxy and one is entitled, therefore, to ask for a more satisfactory discussion of its insistent use of an apparently irreconciliable contradiction, that of'knowing' through 'unknowing', than Lossky provides. The arguments of his present work notwithstanding, one is still led to hope that exponents of Orthodoxy can provide this without compromising the values which their tradition contains.
