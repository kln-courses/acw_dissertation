CHAPTER T. CONFIRMATION OP THE THEORY OF THE DIVU?IT? OF BEA.?TY. Victor Oousin is, it seems to us, en titled to be considered the first of the rigidly rational expositors of the nature of Beauty ; yet either, in him, sensation was not sufficiently strong and clear, or he, like most philosophers of that school, has too strong a penchant for the purely rational processes of investigation. He admits a value to sensation, it is true, and a certain efficiency to intuition; indeed, so far as their theoretical value is concerned, we could find no fault with his position ; while he yet ignores the mystics, because they prefer those faculties to ratiocination, which feebly ' follows and confirms them only. Thus he says, justly enough, "Keflection is a process more or less tardy in the indivi dual and in the race. It is par excellence, the philosophic faculty; it sometimes en genders doubt and skepticism, sometimes convictions, that for being rational, are only the more profound. It constructs systems, it creates artificial logic, and all those formulas which we now use by the force of habit, as if they were natural to us. But spontaneous intuition is the true logic of nature. It presides over the acqui sition of nearly all our cognitions. Child renj the people, three-fourths of the human race, never pass beyond it, and rest there with boundless security." Yet, while throughout his philosophy, he insists on tracing all ideas back to their first prin ciples, and distinctly affirms that God is the principle of principles, he says, with the most absolute misunderstanding of what he terms mysticism?"Mysticism pretends to elevate man directly to God, and does not see that in depriving reason of its power, it really deprives him of that which makes him know God, and puts him in a just communication with God by the inter mediary of eternal and infinite truth." Now, in order to understand fully M. Cousin's philosophy, to accept its truth and make its errors discover their opposed truths, it is necessary to cut down to the root of this matter of knowledge. We ad mit with him, aud claim from those who do not already admit it, the distinctive functions of Reason and Intuition ; but there is no distinction in knowledge?that is the same whether the subject of the former or the latter. But Reason only acts when we Know something on which it may act ; it compares, weighs, and makes logical, a series of truths already discovered by Intuition. But if it be true that know ledge is only elevated and essentially valua ble when it attains to the comprehension of principles, and, as Oousin says, " God is the principle of principles," the mind can only rest in knowing Him, and is only philosophical when it refers to Him as the cause of the truth which it has possessed. But since Intuition always precedes Rea son, it follows that it alone can grasp the idea of God, which Reason can never attain fully, just as the rudder of a ship must follow its prow into port?one must pre cede and the other necessarily remain a certain distance behind ; and the great dis tinction between philosophers will always be, that one class urges the Reason for ward to keep pace with their perception of truth, caring less for the completeness of their demonstrations than for the reach of their thought; while the other, moving more mathematically, and perhaps more safely, will restrain their quick-winged in stitutions to the heavy laboring motions of Reason, considering discovery worthless unless it be followed up by a rational proof of its accuracy. To this latter class be longs M. Oousin, and herein lies his objec-. tion to those whom he terms mystics (who j are in reality those whose intuitions are keener than his, and to whom are evident i certain truths which lie beyond his sphere of thought)?that they " pretend to elevate man directly to God," since tbey go one step further in the research of principles than h? dares, they insisting that the mind may progress even to the absolute percep tion of Deity as the principle of principles ; and that since Spirit must be essentially the,same in all its manifestations, the spirit j of man may take cognizance of the Spirit of God without the intervention of matter, which is the medium of His communica tion to the material sense only. Oonsin insists on an " intermediary," which, lying j between Spirit and matter, must be less elevated than Spirit, and more elevated than matter?what can it be ? He calls it " eter nal and infinite truth," implying thereby - that truth has a substantial medium of mani festation which is not Spirit nor yet mat ter, but by which we, who are material beings, become cognizant of Deity, who is a spiritual being, and beyond which we cannot go. It can only be a more refined quality of matter, and the legitimate deduc tion from M. Cousin's teaching is, that we are purely material, and therefore incapa ble of that unity with God which is neces sary to the perception and full comprehen sion of Him. The mystics, by discarding this intermediary, take the position that there are b?t two forms of existence? matter and spirit, and that by our material natures we take cognizance of the former; and by our spiritual natures, of the latter, * and that the being in material form does not necessitate the abnegation of any spi ritual faculty: that, therefore, we maybe elevated to a sphere in which it is possible to perceive God?or to be in communica tion with Him, and this communication is nothing mor? nor less than what we'term intuition, which every- human being has in different degree. Children, as purest and nearest to Him, have the keenest intuition, a truth to which Wordsworth's ode to im mortality is a better witness than all the philosophies ever written? " Not in entire forgetfalness, And not in utter nakedness, Bat trailing clouds of glory, do we come . . From God, who is our home : Heaven lies about us in our infancy ! Shades of the prison-house begin to close upon the growing Boy. , But he beholds the light, and whence it flows, He sees it In his joy ; The Youth who further from the East Must travel, still is Nature's priest, - And by the vision splendid Is on his way attended ; At length the Han perceives it die away, And fade into the light of common day." "We do not propose to follow out the ' &gt; differences between Cousin and the mystics further than to show, from what we have already said, that in thus misapprehending . H the nature of Humanity and its cognitions, he has also vitiated the analogies by which alone we can learn Deity ; and by material- t izing us, as he has, he has destroyed onr likeness to Him, and thus lost the only ground from which Beauty oan be examin ed.

" Thus, on all sides, on that of meta physics, on that of aesthetics, especially on that of-ethics, we elevate ourselves to the same principle, the common centre, the last foundation of all truth, all beauty, all good ness. ?The true, the beautiful, and the good, are only different revelations of the same being." But let us consider these three "dif ferent revelations " closely?the three dis tinct attributes into which he resolves God. Goodness is the divine Love, an essence, the inner nature of Deity, the origin of all existence, and its motive?Truth is the divine Wisdom, also an essence, and the ? director and organizer of existence, the cause of its system ? but Beauty?it is something which we see, a quality of form, an appearance, and not at all an essence? the two former are causes, the latter is a resuit; and thus M. Cousin's three prin ciples are reduced to two?the Supreme Love and the Supreme Wisdom; and of these, or of one of these, Beauty is the visible effect. It is surely needless to say that, built on such a final analysis of the elements of cognition, M. Cousin's system of philosophy must fall to the ground like ? tripod from which one foot is taken. . The foundation of his error we have point ed out above, in showing that he discards the essentially spiritual nature of Humanity, committing the very error of which he accuses the mystics in the following pas sage:?"Mysticism breaks in some sort , the ladder that elevates us to infinite sub stance; it regards this substance alone, -independently of the truth that manifests .it, and it imagines itself to possess also the pure absolute, puie unity, being in itself. The advantage which mysticism here seeks,' is to give to thought an object wherein there is no mixture, no division, no mul tiplicity, wherein every sensible and human element has entirely disappeared. But in order to obtain this advantage, it must pay the cost of it. It is a very simple means of freeing theodicea from every shade of anthropomorphism ; it is reducing God ' to an abstraction, to the abstraction of being in itself. Being in itself, it is true, is free from all division, but upon the con dition that it have no attribute, no quality, and even that it be deprived of knowledge and intelligence; for intelligence, if ele vated as it might he, always supposes the distinction between the intelligent subject . and the intelligible object. A God from whom absolute unity excludes intelligence is the God of the mystic philosophy." - Now we believe M. Cousin to have gone through th?. very process of reduction - which he ascribes to the mystics. He - assumes that man is, as compared with Deity, a material being, i.e., a being in matter, since he is incapable of compre hending Deity, who is " being in itself " (i. &lt;?., pure spirit not in any way depending on matter for existence), without the inter vention of some intermediary between matter and spirit, which he calls " eternal and infinite truth," and which is the form, not of God, but of this hypothetical inter mediary. God then must be formless, in comprehensible, of a nature of being entire ly removed from that of ours, and to the elevation of which we can never attain; in other words, He is to us an abstraction?a .principle which must descend into an in-' termediary to be understood by us, which must put on a form, having none of its own. But this is not the God whose chil dren we are?not the God of Religion and prayer. Mysticism maintains, on the one hand, that nothing exists or can exist, that has not a form proper to itself?that form is a necessary condition of existence ; and on the other that all Spirit is essentially the same, and that man, being a spirit in his essential existence, is capable of being elevated to the perception of God in his proper form, and ?f that measure of union with him, which the perfect knowledge of Him implies; and that, therefore, no inter mediary can exist. This is the psychology of Christ's teaching?the philosophy of all revealed religion ; and they who deny this to Christianity leave no, distinction between it and Platonism. One of those forms which mysticism demands in the Divine existence is Beauty, and now we may see the reason of M. Cousin's error in making it one of an essentially equal trinity with Truth and Goodness, since he made the three to be only principles intermediate be tween God and human intelligence, but Truth and Goodness we have found are God himself, being Wisdom and Love in action; while Beauty is one of the two great forms in which He appears to us. The pages of the Scriptures abound with indi cations of this relation. "Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name; wor ship the Lord in the beauty of holi ness." Psalms, xxix. 2. "He appointed singers unto the Lord and that should praise the beauty of holiness as they went out before the army." II, Chronicles, xx. 21. " Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined." Ps. i. 2. "And, let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us." Ps. xc. 17. " And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty; for it was perfect throngh my comeliness which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord God." Ezekiel, xvi. 14. " How great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty !" Zechariah, ix. 17. The difficulty with the Gallic philoso pher is, that he is, rationally, a materialist, ? and this, perhaps, without suspecting it, because, even while admitting the exist ence of Deity, and even his intelligence, he has, by placing him on a plane above the possible cognition of mankind, so that we could only know him through the inter mediary which we have discussed, made him a severe abstraction, and confined our investigations and interest to the material existence. It was impossible, from such a point of view, to arrive at the first cause of Beauty, which cause is purely spiritual, and thus out of his range. When, there fore, he had reached the farthest verge of his field of perception, he lost himself in the search for his intermediary, and not daring to follow his intuitions into the un known and trackless abyss before him; seeing the beautiful, and knowing that the good and the true were there, he could no further distinguish between the effect? which Beauty is, and the cause?which Goodness is, and classed them altogether. Yet, in a note to the lecture on Mysticism, M. Cousin says, " The human mind may form to itself an abstract and general idea of being, but this idea has no real object in nature. All being is determinate if it is real; and to be determinate is to .possess certain modes of being, transitory and accidental, or constant and essential. Knowledge of being in itself is then not merely interdicted to the human mind ; it is contrary to the nature of things. At the other extreme of metaphysics is a powerless psychology, which, by fear of a hollow ontology, is condemned to volun tary ignorance. We are not able, say these philosophers?Mr. Dugald Stewart, for example, to attain-being in itself; it is per mitted us to know only phenomena and qualities ; so that, in order not to wander in search of the substance of the soul, they do not dare affirm its spirituality, and de vote themselves to the study of its different faculties. Equal error, equal chimera ! There are no more qualities without being than being without qualities. No being is without its determinations, and reciprocally its determinations are not without it. To consider the determinations of beings, in dependently of the being that possessed them, is no longer to observe ; it is to ab straet, to make an abstraction quite as extravagant as that of being considered independently of its qualities." Here, in the first place, Cousin has admitted too much, in saying that " the human mind may form to itself an abstract and general idea of being," for even "that is impossible. If we have an idea, it is an idea of some thing, and that something has a substance, of which our minds take cognizance, and this substance, the subject of our cognitions, I has always a form ; so? that " abstract</page><page sequence="3">THE CEAY?N'. 99' ideas " are no ideas at all, and this should have been M. Cousin's position, for the ideas which he admits are those of which we have not yet clearly perceived the form? indeterminate, not in reality, but in our vision only?from mystery, not from form lessness* Therefore, when he condemns Mr. Dugald Stewart, for abstracting the deter minations (or forms) of being as equally absurd with those who regard " being con sidered independently of its qualities," he condemns himself also, since he himself, in dividing God from Wisdom and Love, and making Him a principle lying behind those, considers being independently of its quali ties, for God is not the cause of Wisdom and Love, but Wisdom itself and Love itself; but He is the cause of Beauty. Cousin was baffled in his search for the origin of Beauty, because he did not com prehend God?did not know what the "mystics" whom he despised so much, and especially Swedenborg, their chief, would have taught him. He would have learned from them that the spirit of Man is not only capable of unity with God, but that that unity is its normal state, and that He is in us and we in Him (if he had not learned that from Christ before), and that thence we have our wisdom aud our good ness?that there is no bar between spirit and Spirit; and that all the beauty of hu manity is only the fainter radiance of the Divine Beauty which, taking its habitation in us, shines through the earthen vessels of bur materiality. We will not follow the analysis of Cou sin's philosophy further : if he failed at the last step before reaching the grand secret, he has said many things which show that his course was towards that position which we have assumed as the true theory of the beautiful. To have said, as he does, that " God, being the principle of all things, must for this reason be that of perfect beauty," were not much more than others have said, but he goes even further than his pronounced theory, in saying what we now quote : " Moral beauty comprises two distinct elements, equally but diversely beautiful?justice and charity,* respect and love of men. He who expresses in his conduct justice and charity accomplishes the most beautiful of all works ; the good man is, in his way, the greatest of all artists. But what shall we say of. him who is the very substance of justice and the exhaustless source of love? If our moral nature is beautiful, what must be the beauty of its author * * * Let us contem * There is an utter confusion in the theory of our author in the distinction between the sublime and beautiful, which he sometimes, as in this passage, con siders as one, and sometimes divides. We shall con sider this distinction when we come to treat of the Sublime, and shall then recur to Cousin again. plate nature with the eye of the soul as well as with the eye of the body?every where a moral expression will strike us, and the form of things will impress us as symbols of thought. We have said that with man, and with the animal even, the figure is beautiful on account of the expres sion. But when you are on the summit of the Alps, or before the immense Ocean, when you behold the rising or setting of the suu at the beginning or the close of the day, do not these imposing pictures pro duce on you a moral effect ? Do all these grand spectacles appear only for the sake of appearing ? Do not we regard them as manifestations of an admirable power, in telligence, and wisdom? Ajid, thus to speak, is not the face of nature expressive like that of a man? " Form cannot be simply a form, it must be the form of something. Physical beauty is, then, the sign of an internal beauty, which is spiritual and moral beauty; and this is the foundation, the principle, the unity of the beautiful. " All the beauties that we have just enu merated and reduced compose what is called the really beautiful. But above real beauty is a beauty of another order?ideal beauty * * * The ideal continually recedes as we approach it. Its last termination is in the infinite, that is to say in God; or, to speak more correctly, the true and absolute ideal is nothing more than God himself. * * * * * * " Thus God is the principle of the three orders of beauty that we have distinguish ed?physical beauty, intellectual beauty, moral beauty. " In Him also are reunited the two great forms of the beautiful distributed in each of these two orders, to wit?the beautiful and the sublime. God is par excellence the beautiful ; for what object satisfies more all our faculties, our reason, our imagination, and our heart! He offers to reason the highest idea, beyond which it has nothing more to seek ; to imagination the most ravishing contemplation ; to the heart a sovereign object of love. He is, then, per fectly beautiful ; but is he not sublime also in other ways? If He extends the horizon of thought, it is to confound it in the abyss of his greatness. If the soul blooms at the spectacle of his goodness, has it not also reason to be affrighted at the idea of his justice, which is not less present to it? * * * Yes, God is for us at once the type and source of the two great forms of beauty, because He is to us at once an impenetra ble enigma, and still the clearest word that we are able to find for all enigmas." M. Cousin has only attained to vague ideas of the source of the beautiful, and for this we feel that there must bfe'a deeper cause than the imperfections of his' ratio cination?a cause indicated and confirmed, by an appendix to the lectures from which - we have quoted, on French Art, in which; he says, in a comparison between Raphael and Poussin (Nicolo), "No doubt Ra phael elevates the soul ? whatever is beautiful cannot fail to do that; but he touches only the surface, circum pr cordia ludit; he penetrates not deep; moves not the inner fibres of our being: for why? he himself was not so_ moved. He snatches us from earth, and transports us into the serene atmosphere of eternal beauty ; but the mournful side of life, the sublime emo tions of the heart, magnanimity, heroism, in a word, moral grandeur, this he does not express; ,* * * * Poussin belongs to a very different world * * * Like Corneille he is grave and masculine ; he has the sen j timent of the great, and strives to reach it. ! If, above everything, he is an artist, if Ms long career is an assiduous and indefatiga ble study of Beauty, it is preeminently moral beauty that strikes him; and when he re presents historic or Christian scenes,, one feels he is then like the author of the Cid of Cinna. and of Polycuete, in his natural element; * * * * it is on the moral ground that he has a place exalted and apart in the - history of Art." ..... One wonders, after reading that appen dix, rather that he should have said any truth of the beautiful rather than have fallen short so much, and" if he had ever experienced any pure sensations of Beauty:' To analyze Beauty closely, one must have a perception of it, fine to the nicest shades of distinction, and at the same time so clear &lt; and full, that in the mental contemplation of it, he may not feel that it is a vague, in determinate quality, but a particular and defined appearance ; for since sensation is the basis of all investigation, it must be full and satisfactory, or the investigation can never be satisfactory. A mind which has that sensation perfect, however, may, dispense with the power of reasoning to a great extent, and by its glorious fullness of perception of Beauty, pass, by intuitive logic, from it to its cause-?it being in fact to such a mind a simple problem of cause and effect?a sensation being received, to comprehend at once its origin. This, we believe, we shall find in our examination of Ruskin's Theory of Beauty. Ugly Objects.?Constable remarked to a lady, who, looking at an engraving of a house, called it an ugly thing, "No, madam, there is nothing, ugly ; I never saw an ugly thing in my life : for, let the form of an object be as. it may? light, shade, and perfection will always make it beautiful. It is perspective which improves the form of this."</page></plain_text>
