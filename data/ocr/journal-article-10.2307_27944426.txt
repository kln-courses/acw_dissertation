<plain_text><page sequence="1">More Than a Creative Beginning: An Assessment of Gordon Kaufman's In the beginning... Creativity David E. Conner / Pastor, Wheat Ridge, Colorado, United Church of Christ /n the beginning . . . Creativity provides us with a thought-provoking summary of the theology of Gordon D. Kaufman, Professor Emeritus at Harvard and the distinguished author of ten prior books, including Essay on Theological Method (1975; third edition 1995), Theology for a Nuclear Age (1985), and In Face of Mystery (1993).1 To some extent In the beginning. . . Creativity may be viewed as a compact version of the earlier In Face of Mystery, which is about three times as long and treats many of the same topics. Kaufman identifies In the beginning . . . Creativity as "a kind of experiment in thought,"2 but the book does advance a consistent, balanced argument which supports several theological conclusions. The book is therefore eminently useful both for those who need a concise introduction to Kaufman's doctrine of God and for those who wish to know how his thinking has evolved during recent years. In the beginning . . . Creativity consists of a Preface and five chapters, the first of which is a Prologue and the last an Epilogue. The Preface outlines the remainder of the volume, presenting at the outset several of the author's characteristic ideas that God may more profitably be viewed not as a personal being but as "serendipitous creativity"; that human beings are inherently creatures-in context, inescapably located in a network of bio-historical processes; and that theology should be undertaken neither as a quest for apodictic certitude nor as the meticulous interpretation of sacred texts, but as an endeavor in imaginative construction, whose essential purpose is to enable us "to 1 Gordon D.

Kaufman begins by paraphrasing the first verses of the gospel of John: "In the beginning was creativity, and the creativity was with God, and the creativity was God. All things came into being through the mystery of creativity; apart from creativity nothing would have come into being."4 In the first section of Chapter I, Kaufman adroitly analyzes the anthropomorphism of Biblical images of God. The next sections discuss three strands of thought about God (1) popular images of God and the philosophical concepts that have conflicted with them; (2) the ways in which human understandings of subjectivity or experience have influenced ways of thinking about God; and (3) the development of a tradition of "negative theology" as a means of speaking about God. Regarding this third topic, Kaufman includes not only familiar historical examples of the via negativa such as Gregory of Nyssa, Pseudo-Dionysius, John of Damascus, Maimonides, Meister Eckhart, and Nicholas of Cusa, but also the postmodernists Jean-Luc Marion, Emmanuel L vinas, and Jacques Derrida. Kaufman notes pithily that these postmodern critiques radicalize negative theology. They suggest that even in its negations all negative theology is tied to an ontology that presupposes the being of the divine. We seem here, with respect to God, to end up with utter speechlessness. But we should not forget that it has been only through speaking through uttering this enormously complex word "God" and speaking about God, and through speaking in critique of all such speaking that we may be led to this conclusion.5 Kaufman then considers the ways the word "God" have been used in various approaches to the academic study of religion. He concludes that religion scholars have a duty to assist ordinary people as they seek to relate themselves meaningfully to life's ultimate issues. 3 Ibid., XV. 4 Ibid., ix. 5 Ibid., 26.</page><page sequence="3">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 5 Religion scholars have a special obligation to help modern societies exercise that choice [regarding their religious symbols] responsibly. In this book special attention is devoted to the question whether the symbol "God" is today functioning as effectively as it might and should in our modern/postmodern world and a specific proposal to address this problem is presented.6 Chapter One begins with a description of the worldwide ecological crisis, noting that traditional personalistic notions of God as a supreme Being who exercises hegemony over earthly events have done more to aggravate this crisis than to alleviate it. Kaufman then proposes that viewing God not as a supreme Creator but as serendipitous creativity offers a more promising theological alternative, "because it presents creation of novel realities as ongoing processes or events and does not call forth an image of a kind of cosmic person standing outside the world, manipulating it from without."7 Human beings are not merely products of biological evolution but are biohistorical creatures who have been influenced decisively by their cultures and histories as well as by their genetics. Cultures and historical trends are understood as trajectories which take on a life of their own. Such trajectories are the stuff of life but there is no guarantee either of their endurance or of their positive character. Thus, conceiving humans as biohistorical beings who have emerged on one of the countless creative trajectories moving through the cosmos instead of as creatures distinguished from all others as the very image of God, the climax of all creation makes it clear that we humans are indissolubly a part of the created order. In this picture the too-easy human-centeredness, and Christian-centeredness, of traditional Christian thinking is thoroughly undercut.8 Chapter Two provides a closer examination of the concept of God as serendipitous creativity. Here, as in Kaufman's prior work, the 6 Ibid., 32. 7 Ibid., 42. 8 Ibid., 50.</page><page sequence="4">6 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy idea of mystery is paramount. Kaufman states that it is inherently impossible to analyze creativity conclusively and that creativity therefore manifests an inevitable "note of mystery."9 But rather than being a problem, this mysteriousness is fitting. "The metaphor of creativity ... is appropriate for naming God because (1) it preserves and indeed emphasizes the ultimacy of the mystery that God is, even while (2) it connects God directly with the coming into being in time of the new and the novel."10 Theologies which associate God with specific aspects of human life such as personal being, canonical texts, religious experiences, or moral precepts, tend to minimize or overlook aspects of the Sacred which are irrelevant to those theologies and drift all too easily toward idolatry. The recognition that creativity is innately mysterious is a wholesome corrective to various forms of theological absolutism and wishful thinking, and further, it accounts for Kaufman's adjectival use of the word serendipitous. The point is not simply that God is equated with sheer good luck but that the creative trajectories which produce and sustain us are, at bottom, largely unfathomable. Kaufman's use of the term serendipity may be understood as a way of circumventing any endorsement of the type of teleology which envisions the source of creativity as a deliberative divine agent or a purpose-laden, cohesive process. At this point Kaufman acknowledges his debt to Henry Nelson Wieman, who was well known for his proposal that God be understood as creativity or as "creative interchange." Kaufman, though, distances himself from Wieman where Wieman limited his idea of God to the type of creativity which serves specifically as "the source of human good," for, Kaufman observes, creative processes bring not only human good, but destruction and, from our perspective, horrific evils.11 In crucial respects, it is our responsibility, not God's, to ensure that creativity is directed towards healthful, ethical ends. And yet, there is nevertheless a type of grace operative in non-human creativity. Humans did not bring the world into being, and it is not we who sustain it. We did not create the evolutionary process, forever bringing into being new, unforeseeable forms of life. There is a powerful, awe-inspiring 9 Ibid., 55. 10 Ibid., 57-58. 11 Ibid., 60-61.</page><page sequence="5">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 7 creativity manifest in our world and indeed, in ourselves: the new, the novel, the unforeseeable, the previously unheard of, break forth roundabout us and in our midst; and human life continues to be sustained from beyond itself. This serendipitous creativity provides grounds for our hope for the future.12 Chapter Three begins by recalling the book's opening paraphrase of John's Logos theology, but it is clear that Kaufman's notion of serendipitous creativity has little resemblance to John's pr - existent, rational Logos. "The concept of creativity in no way explains how or why new realities have come into being; rather, it simply gives a name to the profoundly mysterious fact that novel realities have come into existence in the course of time."13 Kaufman admits that "mere change" is not what he means by creativity, but rather the creation of the "truly novel."14 Though Kaufman does not explain precisely what he means by true novelty, he does illustrate what he is getting at by describing three broad types of creativity: (1) the initial coming into being of the universe, usually referred to as the "big bang"; (2) the subsequent physical-historical processes that over the eons have eventually produced complexity and life; and (3) the type of creativity that is associated specifically with human beings, which involves the use of mental processes and symbols.15 Kaufman appreciatively describes each of these three at some length, articulating a sense of wonder and awe that borders on reverence. However, he attributes no unity or coherent ontological structure to these forms of creativity, but instead maintains unswervingly that serendipity and mystery are requisite terms reflecting the unavoidable limitations of our knowledge. Serendipity and mystery are not drawbacks, though, but serve rather to deepen our religious sensibility concerning creativity. There will be those who say that in this theology God has really disappeared in the mists of mystery and that true faith in God is thus also gone. To that I reply, true faith in God is not living with a conviction that 12 Ibid., 70. 13 Ibid., 71. 14 Ibid. 15 Ibid., 76-77.</page><page sequence="6">8 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy everything is going to be okay in the end because we know that our heavenly father is taking care of us. It is, rather, acknowledging and accepting the ultimate mystery of things and, precisely in face of that mystery, going out like Abraham (as Hebrews 11:8 puts it) not really knowing where we are going, but nevertheless moving forward creatively and with confidence confidence in the serendipitous creativity that has brought our trajectory and us into being, has continued to sustain the human project with the web of life that surrounds and nurtures us, and has given us a measure of hope for that project here on planet Earth. Since we now see that we are to love and give ourselves and our lives not only to our human neighbors and enemies, but also to the wider orders of life in which we find ourselves, this perspective deepens and widens the radicality of the Christian ethic, and thus the radicality of Christian faith.16 The final chapter of In the beginning . . . Creativity consists of an Epilogue in which Professor Kaufman describes his own intellectual pilgrimage. Two primary concerns are cited the question of how it is feasible to speak meaningfully about God, and our responsibility to foster human behavior that is loving, caring, and ethical, especially insofar as such behavior may be motivated by faith in God or by our understanding of God. Kaufman was reared in a Mennonite home and graduated from Bethel College, a Mennonite institution where Kaufman's father was president. Prior to finishing college, however, Kaufman was drafted into World War Two and served as a conscientious objector in Colorado Springs; Ypsilanti, Michigan; and Gulfport, Mississippi. After the war, Kaufman studied sociology at Northwestern University, where he learned of George Herbert Mead's social theory of mind and self, and also encountered Feuerbach's proposal that belief in God can more accurately be viewed as "an unconscious projection of human characteristics and qualities onto a non-existent external cosmic reality."17 Reflecting on his assigned tasks at a mental hospital in 16 Ibid., 106. 17 Ibid., 111.</page><page sequence="7">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 9 Ypsilanti, Kaufman discovered a partial corroboration for Feuerbach's theory, for the experiences of delusional patients suggested that all human judgments are "relative to the psychological, social, and cultural contexts within which they are made."18 In 1948 Kaufman matriculated at the Yale Divinity School, where neo-orthodox theology was then predominant. After finishing a B.D., Kaufman remained in the Divinity School for a doctorate. His dissertation was entitled "The Problem of Relativism and the Possibility of Metaphysics," a title indicative of issues which Kaufman has continued to find important. Tillich, Collingwood, and Dilthey were major resources for the dissertation. For a time Kaufman found the neo-orthodox orientation persuasive, but by the mid-sixties he had become convinced that neo orthodoxy "simply dodged the major issue of how God's reality was to be understood."19 Following H. Richard Niebuhr's argument that human knowledge and conduct are always circumscribed by whatever symbol systems each person happens to inherit, he acquired an historicist position. From this it follows that all religious convictions are to some extent arbitrary and should be espoused not as objective, universal truths but as confessional choices. The main value of theology is the practical one of furnishing orientation, motivation, and meaning. Both in his denial that one may make conclusive statements about God's metaphysical status and in his opinion that faith functions to undergird not theory but practice, Kaufman is following Kant, whose influence he duly acknowledges.20 It is possible to press the confessionalism of the historicist line of reasoning to the neo-Barthian conclusion of Narrative Theology, which holds that the authority of scripture is simply an undebatable article of faith, the established historic dogma of a type of theology which claims to be impervious to philosophic critique and undisturbed by the ever-developing theories of the natural and social sciences. Kaufman does not follow historicism to this conclusion. Instead, he is quite open to the positive role of science and philosophy in theological construction. Still, on the other hand Kaufman does not accept the methodology of classic theological liberalism, which views the question of God as a relatively well-defined topic that can be investigated 18 Ibid., 111-12. 19 Ibid., 108. 20 Ibid., 109, 113.</page><page sequence="8">10 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy impartially by empirical or rational methods. Instead, theology for Kaufman becomes an endeavor in imaginative construction, by which he means that theology is intrinsically perspectival, creative, and open ended. This does not imply, though, that theology is mere fiction, for there are standards for theological construction. Kaufman affirms that theology must include (1) a sound interpretation of the world as the context of our experience, (2) a concept of God as that which "relativizes and limits the world and all that is in it," and (3) a careful readjustment of each of these first two ideas so that the world and life within it may be discerned theistically, that is, religiously.21 In summary, In the beginning . . . Creativity is an engaging book marked by its originality, cogency, and power. Its theology is carefully argued and may be described as constructive, naturalistic, pluralistic, historicist-postmodern, and practical-ethical. It is liberal in the broad sense that it adopts a scientific, evolutionary worldview and rejects hermeneutical, kerygmatic, or fideistic methods, but not in the classic sense of treating reason and experience as epistemic foundations employed in an attempt to reach conclusions that transcend cultural or historical limitations. Kaufman is not an "empirical theologian" in the sense of self-consciously utilizing the methods of the Chicago School or other empirical theologians.22 Still, though he himself might not put it this way, there is an important sense in which Kaufman's theology is empirical, both generally in its appeal to experiential evidence (as opposed to evidence based on scripture, historic dogma, or a priori reasoning) and specifically in its Wiemanian method of interpreting the data of experience in such a way as to construct a doctrine of God. I find that as a pastor I am sometimes expected to assess the religious relevance or availability of various theological positions. Certainly this issue bears on Gordon Kaufman's theology. From the standpoint of practicing faith, is it really viable to replace John's "In the beginning, God" with Kaufman's "In the beginning, creativity"? Charles Milligan has suggested that the potential values associated with religious ideas can be grouped into four categories: the 21 Ibid., 121-22. 22 Kaufman describes his own misgivings about traditional theological empiricism in In Face of Mystery (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1993), 22-25; and he dismisses the notion that there can be specific types of experience of God as a "category mistake," In the beginning. . . Creativity, 110.</page><page sequence="9">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 11 intellectual, the axiological, the emotional, and the ethical. Obviously these four often overlap. In varying degrees Kaufman explicitly addresses the intellectual, axiological, and ethical ramifications of his concept of God. It is thus of particular interest now to ask about the emotional values that can be gained from Kaufman's perspective. We recall Tillich's observation that in various historic periods the primary function of Christianity has been variously to offer hope and confidence in the face of finitude and death, purpose and meaning in the face of emptiness and meaninglessness, and forgiveness and redemption in the face of guilt and condemnation in a word, courage in the face of despair.24 Though these functions have intellectual, axiological, and ethical dimensions, their most immediate value courage is emotional or spiritual. Similarly, Whitehead famously stated that effective religion moves from the perception of God the Void to God the Enemy, and from God the Enemy to God the Companion.25 Again the primary value is not intellectual or moral; it is related to feelings of kinship, support, and serenity. Conventional theological personalism which Kaufman quite rightly, in my opinion, eschews is typically held to be emotionally valuable because it depicts God as a loving, willing Being who purposefully provides for creatures, hears prayers, forgives sins, and saves souls, all in a rather anthropomorphic, anthropocentric fashion. But Kaufman holds that contemporary Christians are increasingly half hearted or incredulous about the existence of such a God. Based on my own observations, I would agree. No matter how appealing an idea of God may be emotionally, it will not be perceived as authentically valuable if it is regarded as unrealistic. Though indisputably in the United States popular reverence for the conventional Man Upstairs continues to thrive, thoughtful Christians in many churches are increasingly ready to ask theological questions and entertain innovative, unorthodox responses. In the congregation I currently serve, people are willing not merely to tolerate but to give sympathetic attention to notions of God which can be described as naturalistic, pantheistic, non personal, or more-than-personal. 23 C.

Whitehead, Religion in the Making (New York: World Publishing Company, 1960 [Macmillan, 1926]), 16.</page><page sequence="10">12 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy In my view, Kaufman's position is of questionable religious availability not because it jettisons personalism, but because of the preeminent roles it assigns to serendipity and mystery, resulting in a vision of creativity that is unnecessarily restrained in its ability to evoke morale, confidence, devotion, and reverence. Though Kaufman does observe that nature, even apart from human intentions and efforts, has supported and sustained us, there is little basis in his thought to uphold the conviction that non-human or more-than-human creativity can function in specifiable, systemic ways as a meaningful basis for hope. Our ultimate hope, rather, must be in our own efforts, as we deliberately attempt to take advantage of a natural creativity which produces value not systematically but serendipitously. Kaufman's understanding of mystery prohibits even a provisional ontological examination of creativity an examination that might lend itself to a more robust doctrine of "grace within nature," as Bernard Meland called it.26 Kaufman can acknowledge that "mere change is not what we mean by the word 'creativity,'" but he is not willing to delve into any details regarding what differentiates chance variation from the "truly novel."27 In the beginning . . . Creativity does include an appreciative discussion of chaos theory, emergent complexity, autocatalysis, and the "self organizing" tendencies of nature,28 but these ideas are presented as bare, inexplicable facts, by which we can only be mystified even as, at the same time, we are profoundly grateful. Since mystery is a fundamental category for Kaufman, one is tempted to propose that mystery itself could become a point of departure for a more thorough analysis. Brief reflection suggests that there are several identifiable types of mystery. One type would pertain to things that are impossible to know, even in principle. For example, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle holds that at any one instant it is not possible even theoretically to determine both the exact position and the exact momentum of a moving object. A second type of mystery would apply to circumstances which, though determinate, are beyond the range of current knowledge the number of fish in the sea, whether there is life beyond our solar system, or the actual facts of Jesus' birth. A third kind of mystery concerns experiences of what Whitehead called 26 Bernard Meland, "Grace: A Dimension within Nature?" Journal of Religion, 54, (April 1974). 27 Kaufman, In the beginning. . . Creativity, 71. 28 Ibid., 86-100.</page><page sequence="11">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 13 "causal efficacy" feelings that fail the Cartesian tests of clarity and distinctness but massively qualify our existence, such as hunger, sexuality, yearning, joy, pleasure, physical pain, mental anguish, fear. A friend from western Colorado heard one night the cry of a mountain lion in the darkness behind his house; he reported that the hair on the back of his neck stood up even before he could recognize the sound for what it was. There is an ineffability in such events. A fourth type of mystery involves what Meland and others have termed "appreciative awareness." Whitehead spoke of the way Jesus' birth prompted Mary to "ponder these things in her heart." There are friendships that we treasure, issues that ignite our passions, memories that move us to tears. To some degree such experiences are amenable to detached analysis, but their spontaneous power peremptorily overwhelms our ability to remain logically analytical. The point of this digression is to say that exploring different types of mystery might enable Kaufman to speak more fully about why and how it is that God is mysterious. Specifically, if the mystery of God is, even only partially, of the second, third, or fourth type described above, then there might conceivably be modest but important ways of getting behind or beyond utter mystery. One thinks of theologians such as Meland, Bernard Loomer, Harvey Potthoff, and William Dean, who share Kaufman's naturalistic orientation, who are willing to acknowledge and even celebrate mystery as a theological premise, but who also are willing to examine specific structures of creativity as a way of balancing the mystery of God with what can be positively affirmed about God.29 But it seems likely that Kaufman will reply that no typology of mystery can be applicable, since we have no way of knowing even what kinds of mystery might pertain to God. As Kaufman himself says, this 29 See Bernard Meland, Fallible Forms and Symbols (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1976), 28; Bernard Loomer, The Size of God, ed. Wm. Dean and Larry Axel (Macon, Georgia: Mercer University Press, 1987), 26; Harvey H. Potthoff, "The Reality of God," in Potthoff, Selected Papers (Denver: Criterion Press, 1981), 131-48 (first published in The Iliff Review, XXIV [Spring 1967]); and William Dean, The American Spiritual Culture and the Invention of Jazz, Football, and the Movies (New York: Continuum, 2002), chapter 4. One might also mention philosopher John E. Smith's Experience and God (New York: Oxford University Press, 1968), and Donald A. Crosby's Novelty (Lanham, Maryland: Lexington Books, 2005), which, though it is not a work on theology, examines the nature and sources of creativity without relying on detailed metaphysics.</page><page sequence="12">14 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy leaves us in the position of using "creativity" as nothing more than "a name" for "the profoundly mysterious fact that novel realities have come into existence,"30 a position which fails to appreciate that the existence of some sort of whole-making ontological structures is an investigable fact. Of course Kaufman does acknowledge the reality of intentionality and directionality, but only insofar as such phenomena arise in the minds of human beings. With the emergence of historical modes of being that is, humans explicitly purposive (or teleological) patterns appeared in the universe, as human intentions, consciousness, and actions began to become effective. Thus, a cosmic trajectory, which had its origins in what seems to have been mere physical movement or vibration, has (in the instance of human existence) gradually developed increasing directionality, ultimately creating a context within which deliberate purposive action could emerge and flourish.31 The truth, perhaps, is that it is difficult if not impossible to distinguish genuine novelty from mere, random unpredictability when the reality of any non-human form of teleology, final causation, or valuation has been denied or, at least, relegated to the status of impenetrable mystery. I am not advocating, as an alternative to mystery, the na ve kind of teleology that characterizes Paley's watch maker or its present-day counterpart, "intelligent design." There are other options. As James Beilby suggests, it is quite possible that "natural theology has been defeated only in certain maximally ambitious forms. "32 Others have previously observed that Kaufman's thoroughgoing and problematic endorsement of mystery stems from the influence of Kant.33 This continues to be the case for In the beginning . . . Creativity. Kant's critical philosophy abolished the 30 Kaufman, In the beginning. ..

In fact this more or less describes Kaufman's own position. But it is interesting to recognize that there is a quasi-metaphysical stance implied even by the bare Kantian assertions that das Ding an sich does exist as an independent reality and that this thing-in-itself is irretrievably estranged epistemologically from the perceiving subject. As Dean points out, this chasm between subject and object, between phenomena and noumena, implicitly commits Kaufman to a correspondence theory of truth, which, if we deem the correspondence theory untenable, leads in turn to the conclusion that metaphysical and theological beliefs are "trapped behind a wall of ignorance."34 But there are other theories of truth, and some of them would allow Kaufman to remain free as, like Wieman, he so clearly wishes to be from the obligation to endorse any detailed system of metaphysics.35 For example, in William James's Radical Reconstruction of Philosophy, Charlene Haddock Seigfried argues that in radical empiricism "the distinction between phenomena and noumena ultimately collapses into a single world of experience."36 According to Nancy Frankenberry, Seigfried's argument shows that it has been the traditional interpretive distinction between a world of subjective experience and the world of objective reality that has generated contemporary attacks on objectivity and verifiability; that distinction is neatly dissolved in James's radically empirical philosophy.... Therefore, we can stop worrying whether we really grasp the world as it is, or whether we create a world in our own image, answering to our expectations, 34 Dean, "The Persistence of Experience," 74. 35 For example, regarding process theology Kaufman comments, "Doubtless there is much to be learned from Whitehead about contemporary conceptualization of the world, but in my opinion we theologians must do our own work with respect to the question of God, not simply take over someone else's." In Face of Mystery, 46. 36 Charlene Haddock Seigfried, William James's Radical Reconstruction of Philosophy (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1990), 356, quoted by Nancy Frankenberry in a review of Seigfried's book, American Journal of Theology and Philosophy 13 (January 1992), 56.</page><page sequence="14">16 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy for such neat distinctions cannot be maintained in practice.... Seigfried is fully aware that the pragmatists themselves distinguished between old style speculative metaphysics and their own post-Darwinian evolutionary philosophy which employed metaphysical assumptions, assumptions she would rather term "interpretive structures of experience." Apparently "metaphysics" can only mean a systematic explanation of reality from a privileged or ontologically objective standpoint, a dubious enterprise that is better replaced by a systematic method of interpretation in the form of a concrete hermeneutics.37 Clearly the present article is not a suitable place to elaborate a radical empiricist response to Kant and the post-structuralists. I refer here to James, Seigfried, and Frankenberry simply to illustrate that one need not embark on a full-fledged program of "old style speculative metaphysics" in order to go beyond what Kaufman perceives as an intractable veil of indecipherable mystery. It is the obduracy of this mystery that leads to Kaufman's use of the word serendipitous, and it is his use of the word serendipitous that prohibits him from attributing more than a fortuitous integrity, wholeness, or value-producing process to creativity, a.k.a. God. Another way of putting this is to say that Kaufman's acceptance of a Kantian isolation of subject from object radicalizes the imaginative or subjective character of his theology-as-imaginative construction. Imagination is our only choice methodologically, because we have no trustworthy epistemological access to any ultimate theological reality. But I hazard the guess that most believers will hesitate to accept a procedure which suggests that God, while related in some mysterious way to concrete processes, is in the last analysis an imaginative construct. One remembers Freud's adage, "When the wayfarer whistles in the dark, he may be disavowing his timidity, but he does not see any the more clearly for doing so." As Kaufman suggests, popular religion's touching hope that "everything is going to be okay in the end because we know that our heavenly father is taking care of us"38 37 Frankenberry, 56, 57, 59. 38 Kaufman, In the beginning. . . Creativity, 106.</page><page sequence="15">Vol. 29, No. 1, January 2008 17 is a great deal like whistling in the dark. In contrast, Kaufman's God is compellingly realistic in its ethical relevance, and there is no doubt that serendipitous creativity does exist. But, in the end, the question is how we can be sure that Kaufman's own imaginative connection between serendipitous creativity and the redemption of the future really goes much further than an act of hopeful whistling. Though Kaufman dissociates himself from Wieman's humanocentrism by constructing a doctrine of God which focuses primarily on issues of disarmament, peace, and environmental responsibility, he comes very close to Wieman's utilitarian-empirical method of identifying God with a kind of creativity that chiefly serves the interests of human beings. Some may view this as a shortcoming. Others, of course, will find it commendable. In any case, when one steps back to look at Kaufman's theology as a whole, it manifests a nuance, a depth, and a strength of ethical conviction for which we can only be grateful. What is important about In the beginning . . . Creativity is not whether we agree with the book in its entirety. Indeed, one doubts that Professor Kaufman himself would wish that of his readers, for his own theological method heralds not theological unanimity but a pluralism of voices engaged in an ever developing conversation. What is most valuable about this book is rather that, after taking circumspect account of the current theological scene, it employs a straightforward method in the construction of a theological position which is remarkable for its cogency, clarity, candor, and, most of all, for its passionate hope that humanity may yet avoid decimating or destroying life on planet earth. In the beginning. . . Creativity is a benchmark of religious scholarship. In its pages some will find a satisfactory theological stopping place. Others will see it as a theological point of departure. In either case, the book has done its job.</page></plain_text>
