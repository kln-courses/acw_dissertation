Department of Philosophy and Religion, University of Southern Mississippi, Hattiesburg, Mississippi, USA "But because I knew you are not much swayed by names and authorities, I shall endeavour to show you, a little more distinctly, the inconveniences of that anthro- pomorphism, which you have embraced." (Dialogues, p. 160)1 1. Introduction Since at least the time of Xenophanes, the charge of anthropomorphism has been leveled at theistic believers. To the contemporary monotheist Xeno- phanes' observation that Greek polytheistic religions involve questionable conceptions of the gods as very much like human beings, including phys- ical appearance and disreputable behavior, is only too apparent. But critiques based on anthropomorphism can be applied to biblical religion as well, for it is no secret that biblical stories often portray God with characteristics, beha- viors, and motivations that are strikingly, sometimes embarrassingly, like our own. Educated believers have learned to read such passages as picturesque descriptions that are not to be taken literally, seeing the stories through the lense of sophisticated theological concepts of the divine nature. This approach to interpreting the ancient texts continues a process begun in the biblical documents themselves of criticizing and modifying ways of thinking that risk illicitly projecting human traits onto God. It is a significant question for the theist, however, how far this process should go. If we follow Xenophanes in saying that God is "not at all like mortals in body or mind,"2 we would need to trim away not only claims that imply physical attributes but also those that involve applying human psycho- logical traits to God. But if the traits essential to our idea of personal agency were removed entirely, it seems unlikely that the concept of God would retain sufficient content to serve its religious functions. There comes a point where removing anthropomorphic elements can remove everything that seems vital to theistic religion.3 Without the model of human agency, theists can say little</page><page sequence="2">84 DAVID M. HOLLEY of religious significance about God, yet maintaining that model requires the assertion of similarities between the divine and the human that can be called into question as anthropomorphic projections. In what follows I want to suggest that a central strategy of David Hume's attack on theism is to exploit the internal tension within theistic tradition between the urge to say something substantive about the divine nature and the concern to purify the concept of God of unacceptable anthropomorphism. While Hume never denies the existence of God, he repeatedly challenges the viability of comparisons between the divine and the human that would permit conceptions of God determinant enough to yield practical implications about the conduct of life. The God whose existence Hume is prepared to affirm is one who would be stripped of the anthropomorphic baggage that is needed to support recognizable forms of religious practice.4 Hence, by challenging the theist's anthropomorphism Hume can strategically ally himself with an important segment of theistic tradition, yet do so in a way that contributes to the deconstruction of that tradition. Though the idea of anthropomorphism is prominent in Hume's writ- ings on religion,5 it is often passed over quickly by philosophers who are more interested in using these writings as a source book for objections to particular theistic arguments or criticisms of particular theistic claims. Such an approach misses, I think, much of the power and subtlety of Hume's critique. Hume's analysis of monotheism locates a tension between the urge to form anthropomorphic conceptions and the urge to elevate the deity beyond human imagination. On his account these two forces fluctuate in an unstable combination. By raising various problems of meaning and justification, Hume attempts to destabilize the precarious balance, pushing the theist toward conceptions of God that are excessively anthropomorphic or toward concep- tions in which divine-human comparisons have been qualified to the point where the theist's belief is indistinguishable from the atheist's. The theist who attempts to respond to Hume's challenge to state a belief that is cognitively meaningful and empirically justifiable can easily find that, without realizing it, she has been drawn into defending the wrong God. 2. The idea of God A central tenet of classical British empiricism is the claim that all our ideas are derived from experience. Theists such as Locke who accepted this epistemological thesis felt obliged to explain how we could have an idea of God. On Locke's account the idea of God comes about by taking various human characteristics and projecting them to infinity. For example, I am aware of knowledge from my own case. I can imagine an increase in my</page><page sequence="3">THE ROLE OF ANTHROPOMORPHISM IN HUME' S CRITIQUE OF THEISM 85 knowledge, and if I extend the projection to the point of unlimited knowledge, I have formed a conception of one of God's characteristics. While Locke takes it for granted that human bodily characteristics will not apply to God, he explicitly says that our experience of the operations of our own minds forms the basis for any understanding we have of God. It is by joining our ideas of various human characteristics with the idea of infinity that we form the complex idea of God.6 On Locke's account God is like a human agent, yet different from a human agent. Without the likeness Locke would have no basis on his theory of meaning for claiming that we have any understanding of what the term "God" means. At the same time, the projection to infinity of various attributes should produce something very different from anything found in our awareness of human agents. So although the process described begins with the imagina- tion of a being in our image, the qualifications are intended to remove any objectionable anthropomorphism. While we should probably not read Locke as offering a historical account of how the idea of God is formed, but rather a kind of theoretical analysis of the idea, his account emphasizes the role of reason in the process. By contrast Hume's primary burden when he considers the origin of the idea of God is to emphasize the role of the passions in producing this idea.7 In Hume's quasi- historical account in the Natural History of Religion, he claims that the origin of religious belief is to be found, not in a reasoned contemplation of the world, but in a passionate response to an environment that humans find threatening. As Hume puts it, Agitated by hopes and fears of this nature, especially the latter, men scru- tinize, with a trembling curiosity, the course of future causes, and examine the various and contrary events of human life. And in this disordered scene, with eyes disordered and astonished, they see the first obscure traces of divinity. (NHR, p. 28)8 What they see, Hume makes clear, is very much a product of the human imagination. In a state of apprehension about the causes of such vital matters as "life and death, health and sickness, plenty and want" people comfort themselves by conceiving the objects of their concern to be very much like themselves. Hume attributes this to a universal tendency among mankind to conceive all beings like them- selves, and to transfer to every object, those qualities with which they are familiarly acquainted, and of which they are intimately conscious. We find human faces in the moon, armies in the clouds; and by a natural propensity, if not corrected by experience and reflection, ascribe malice or good-will to every thing, that hurts or pleases us. (NHR, p. 29)</page><page sequence="4">86 DAVID M. HOLLEY On Hume's account the tendency toward anthropomorphic projection which leads to polytheistic religions is eventually tempered by the equally human tendency to try to appease the deity thought to have local jurisdiction by means of various flattering magnifications of that god's power or great- ness. Over the time of successive generations the resultant deity comes to be thought of as infinite. The process by which this occurs should not be confused with a reasoned conclusion. Hume says, Whatever strains of panegyric can be invented, are immediately em- braced, without consulting any arguments of phaenomena: It is esteemed a sufficient confirmation of them, that they give us more magnificent ideas of the divine objects of our worship and adoration. (NHR, p. 66) So it is through a combination of a propensity towards anthropomorphic projection and an attempt to gain control through flattery that monotheistic conceptions of deity take shape. This process leads to several problems. First, the attributes of the deity may be described in terms so elevated that they lose their connection with the human characteristics that gave us any compre- hension of them. For example, Hume warns that positing a "magnificent simplicity" can "destroy the intelligent nature of their deity, on which alone any rational worship can be founded" (NHR, p. 43). A second problem arises out of combining magnifications of the deity's power with magnifications of moral attributes. The more powerful the deity is described to be, the less plausible claims to benevolence or goodness become. Since both magnifica- tions arise out of flattery, the worshiper does not dare admit the difficulty. So moral perfections will be attributed to the deity in a way that "belies the inward sentiment" (NHR, p. 67). The first problem identified by Hume arises from the fact that the farther we move from the experiential base which produces the idea of God, the greater the danger that our words are used without understanding. Attempts to transcend the anthropomorphic origin of our ideas can remove what is necessary to give our conception a coherent meaning. For instance, we know what a quality such as intelligence means only by our experience of human intelligence, and if we move to something too remote from human intelli- gence, we don't know what we are talking about. Hume does not belabor this point in the Natural History, but he does describe a kind of tension between getting a comprehensible meaning and maintaining a more elevated concept of deity that produces a fluctuation between monotheism and polytheism. As he sees it, the active imagination of men, uneasy in this abstract conception of objects . . . begins to render them more particular and, and to clothe them in shapes more suitable to its natural comprehension. It represents them to</page><page sequence="5">THE ROLE OF ANTHROPOMORPHISM IN HUME' S CRITIQUE OF THEISM 87 be sensible intelligent beings, like mankind; activated by love and hatred, and flexible by gifts and entreaties, by prayers and sacrifices. Hence the origin of religion: And hence the origin of idolatry or polytheism. (NHR, p. 47) For Hume, the assertion of these tendencies reflects the nature of monotheism, which is rooted in an essentially anthropomorphic approach to reality and retains its religious usefulness, only as long as the deity may still be thought of as like a human being. The urge to imagine an infinitely perfect and purely spiritual being which originates in flattery results in conceptions that are "disproportioned to vulgar comprehension ..." and subject to alteration by the needs of popular religion. So internal to theistic religion is the urge to move beyond anthropomorphism and the pull towards it, and these conflicting urges result in a continual unstable fluctuation in concepts of the divine. The second problem Hume identifies is a difficulty in reconciling the imaginative projection with the full range of experiential data. The nonra- tional process begins with a selective use of the data that eventually results in an idea fairly remote from what a dispassionate look at the evidence could support. When more sophisticated theists assume the task of developing justi- fications of belief in God, the concept they take from the tradition will be much thicker than the evidential base provides reason to accept, and even if this concept can be reconciled with apparently conflicting data, it will contain elements that cannot be empirically grounded. Much of the later discus- sion in the Dialogues is devoted to showing that whatever belief could be given rational support would be shorn of many of the characteristics that the idea of God formed through anthropomorphic projection and magnification produces. Throughout his description of this process Hume continues to emphasize the rationality of belief in an intelligent creator. But this belief is to be sharply distinguished from the conception of God displayed in religious traditions: How the deity is disfigured in our representations of him! How much he is degraded even below the character, which we would naturally in common life ascribe to a man of sense and virtue! (NHR, p. 75) The lesson Hume wishes us to learn is not that we should take care to describe God only in terms which would be understandable as good human traits. Hume thinks there is little basis for applying moral attributes to God at all. What we are intended to see is the folly of relying on a nonrational process of anthropomorphic projection supplemented by flattery to produce any real understanding. Such a process gives license for all sorts of absurd conjectures. If anything can be known about God, it will be on the basis of the "whole frame of nature" which Hume claims in the Natural History of Religion points</page><page sequence="6">88 DAVID M. HOLLEY to an intelligent author. Exactly what nature tells us is a fundamental issue in Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. 3. Language and the divine nature Two of the three main participants in the discussion of natural religion (as well as the narrator) affirm that the existence of God is an obvious truth which is not open to dispute by reasonable people. However, both Philo and Demea, for different reasons, deny that the nature of God is an object of human understanding. Demea accepts a theological mysticism which finds the attributes of God to be incomprehensible and mysterious. As he puts it, The question is not concerning the being but the nature of God. This I affirm from the infirmities of human understanding to be altogether unknown to us. The essence of that supreme mind, his attributes, the manner of existence, the very nature of his duration; these and every particular which regards so divine a Being, are mysterious to men. Finite, weak and blind creatures, we ought to humble ourselves in his august presence, and, conscious of our frailties, adore in silence his infinite perfections, which eye hath not seen, ear hath not heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive them. They are covered in a deep cloud from human curiosity: It is profaneness to attempt penetrating through these sacred obscurities: And next to the impiety of denying his existence is the temerity of prying into his nature and essence, decrees and attributes. {Dialogues, p. 141) In the Dialogues Demea represents the religious urge to flattery of the deity accompanied by a corresponding depreciation of human capacities. He is content to piously affirm the infinite perfection of a "something he knows not what," not only without a concern to understand the nature of that being, but also with a firm confidence that trying to understand reveals an impudent disregard for the limits of the human condition. It is sinful to pry into matters so far above and beyond us. Hume displays a devious irony in placing Demea's apparent orthodoxy next to Philo 's philosophical skepticism. Philo agrees with Demea's assertion of the self-evident nature of the truth that God exists, but his sceptical denial of knowledge of what God is parallels Demia's pious agnosticism. He says, we ought never to imagine that we comprehend the attributes of this divine Being, or to suppose, that his perfections have any analogy or likeness to the perfections of a human creature. Wisdom, thought, design, knowledge; these we justly ascribe to him; because these words are</page><page sequence="7">THE ROLE OF ANTHROPOMORPHISM IN HUME' S CRITIQUE OF THEISM 89 honourable among men, and we have no other language or other concep- tions, by which to express our adoration of him. But let us beware lest we think that our ideas any wise correspond to his perfection, or that his attributes have any resemblance to these qualities among men. He is infinitely superior to our limited view and comprehension; and is more the object of worship in the temple than of disputation in the schools. (Dialogues, p. 142) Philo's theory of equivocal predication in which language about God serves a purely expressive function is presented as an ally to Demea's piety. However, there is reason to think that Hume would have viewed it as subversive of attitudes needed for religious practice. In a 1743 letter Hume denies that God can be the object of any natural passions such as love or gratitude. He says that we could not have any real affection toward a remote ancestor who left us an inheritance because we would know so little about the ancestor. But we know even less about God, since we are not even able, as in the case of the ancestor, to apply the term "human being." If this is so, how is it that believers think themselves to have genuine feelings for God? Hume's answer is that they delude themselves either by thinking of the deity as like themselves or by allowing their passions to confuse them. He says, I am afraid that all Enthusiasts mightily deceive themselves. Hope &amp; Fear perhaps agitate their Breast when they think of the Deity: Or they degrade him into a Resemblance with themselves, &amp; by that means render him more comprehensible. Or they exult with Vanity in esteeming themselves his peculiar Favourites.9 So Philo's theory of expressive predication would appear to undermine the possibility of having the attitudes needed to engage in any religious practice involving genuine feelings toward God in an undeceived and unconfused way. On Hume's view these emotions require one to smuggle in anthropomorphic ideas which the theory renders incoherent. If Philo's scepticism about the divine nature is accepted, can we even affirm the existence of God? What would it mean to assert the existence of a being with an incomprehensible and unknown nature? The answer provided by Philo is essentially that we can use the term "God" as a title for whatever meets the description "cause of the universe." We can use Humean matter-of- fact reasoning to conclude that the universe has a cause, but Philo's position is that we can know next to nothing about its nature. In contrast to Demea's religious motivation for denying human knowledge of the divine, Philo's scepticism is based on central Humean reasons for thinking the limitation of our knowledge to be inescapable. As he puts it,</page><page sequence="8">90 DAVID M. HOLLEY Our ideas reach no farther than our experience: We have no experience of divine attributes and operations: I need not conclude my syllogism: You can draw the inference yourself. And it is a pleasure to me . . . that just reasoning and sound piety here concur in the same conclusions, and both of them establish the adorably mysterious and incomprehensible nature of the supreme Being. (Dialogues, pp. 142-143) Thus, Philo and Demea, strange bedfellows that they are, agree in their denial of any real knowledge of the divine nature. By contrast Cleanthes holds that to affirm the existence of a God whose nature is completely incomprehensible erases any important difference between theists and atheists (a theme taken up by Philo in part XII). Cleanthes is willing to acknowledge that God has many powers and attributes that are beyond human comprehension. However, he argues, if our ideas, so far as they go, be not just and adequate, and correspondent to his real nature, I know not what there is in this subject worth insisting on. Is the name, without any meaning, of such mighty importance? Or how do MYSTICS, who maintain the absolute incomprehensibility of the divine nature differ from sceptics or atheists who assert that the first cause of All is unknown and unintelligible? (Dialogues, p. 158) The sceptics and atheists need not have the slightest qualms, suggests Clean- thes, about affirming the unknown cause and assigning "as many sublime eulogies and unmeaning epithets" as the mystical theists wants.10 The view that Cleanthes expresses here coincides with Hume's own view as well as the views of theists in the empirical tradition of Locke. The theist who accepts the utter incomprehensibility of God's attributes is using words without being able to connect them to the experiential sources needed to render her discourse meaningful. By contrast Cleanthes thinks it crucial to say something about God's nature which at least gives some idea of the reality. He believes it absolutely essential to say that the deity possesses mind or intelligence, and the only way to claim this, he holds, is to assert that God has characteristics which resemble the human mind. He wants nothing of Philo's ironic assignment of all perfections to God solely on the grounds that this is a way of showing respect. His position (and Hume's) is that we have no grounds for genuine respect in relation to something altogether incomprehensible and mysterious.</page><page sequence="9">THE ROLE OF ANTHROPOMORPHISM IN HUME' S CRITIQUE OF THEISM 9 1 4. The argument from design Cleanthes' advocacy of the design argument is a direct response to the Humean challenge to meet the conditions of intelligible discourse with regard to God. However, he thinks he can "kill two birds with one stone." He wants to use the argument to establish both that there is sufficient similarity between God's attributes and human attributes to allow us to form ideas of them and that there are adequate empirical grounds for affirming that a being with these attributes exists. In other words his argument is offered as a solution both to problems of meaning and to problems of justification. We might profitably read Cleanthes' efforts against the backdrop of Hume's earlier discussion of the design argument through his unnamed friend in the Inquiry. There the critique had been that we have no basis for positing any divine characteristics beyond what are needed to account for observable effects, and once we have posited a cause sufficient for those effects, we cannot make any inferences with regard to the activities of the unknown cause. In that discussion our ability to make new inferences in other cases of causal reasoning is attributed to our ability to classify causes as members of some species about which we already have experiential knowledge. The tendency to think we know more about God than we actually do was attributed to a kind of anthropomorphic projection: The great source of our mistake on this subject and of the unbounded license of conjecture which we indulge is that we tacitly consider ourselves as in the place of the Supreme Being and conclude that he will, on every occasion, observe the same conduct which we ourselves in his situation would have embraced as reasonable and eligible. But besides that the ordinary course of nature may convince us that almost everything is regulated by principles and maxims very different from ours - besides this I say, it must evidently appear contrary to all rule of analogy to reason from projects and intentions of men to those of a Being so different and so much Superior. (Inquiry, p. 154)11 Since there is no basis at all for importing human characteristics or motiva- tion, we must content ourselves with admitting that we know virtually nothing about the nature of a cause so remote from our experience. Attempting to say more, savors more of flattery and panegyric than of just reasoning and sound philosophy. All the philosophy, therefore, and all the religion, which is nothing but a species of philosophy, will never carry us beyond the usual cause of experience or give us measures of conduct and behavior different from those furnished by reflections on common life. No new fact can ever</page><page sequence="10">92 DAVID M. HOLLEY be inferred from the religious hypothesis, no event foreseen or foretold, no reward or punishment expected or dreaded, beyond what is already known to practice and observation. {Inquiry, p. 155) Hume was well aware that without the degree of anthropomorphism he rejects, theistic religious practice would collapse. But the verdict on the design argument in the Inquiry is that it furnishes no basis for engaging in the kind of anthropomorphic thinking essential to theistic religion. To attempt to circumvent this restriction the empirical theist would need to establish a sufficiently close analogy between divine agency and human agency. This is precisely the approach taken by Cleanthes in the Dialogues. Cleanthes sets out to show that the kind of being our causal reasoning points to is enough like a human agent to permit us to apply the discourse of human agency. The challenge provided by Philo is to show how we could have knowledge of something which is clearly beyond our experience. Clean- thes responds to this challenge by exhibiting what he regards as a clear and straightforward sequence of reasoning that leads to conclusions about the cause of the universe based on resemblance to small-scale cases of human causation. Accepting the premise that we have no direct experience of the universe's cause, he tries to show that we can nonetheless form some idea about the nature of the cause by reflecting on the kind of effect it has produced. The kind of matter-of-fact reasoning used in science and everyday life is thought by Cleanthes to be adequately suited to this theological task as well, and later he confidently adds that such reasoning furnishes a "sufficient foundation for religion" {Dialogues, p. 169). Cleanthes' argument begins with the claim that the universe can be thought of as a rather large machine or possibly many machines which together compose a great machine. The feature which allows us to think of the universe in machine-like terms is the way various parts are adjusted to achieve what can be recognized as rational ends. We can observe the adjustment referred to both in biological and physical systems where "the curious adapting of means to ends, throughout all nature resembles exactly, though it much exceeds, the productions of human contrivance; of human design thought, wisdom, and intelligence" {Dialogues, p. 143). Using the principle, "Like effects imply like causes," Cleanthes reasons that since the natural world contains orderly systems that are like products of human reason, the cause of these systems must resemble human intelligence. As he puts it, "the Author of nature is somewhat similar to the mind of man; though possessed of much larger faculties proportioned to the grandeur of the work, which he has executed" {Dialogues, p. 143). The sophisticated theist must feel at least a slight cringe at the unabashed confidence with which Cleanthes emphasizes similarities between the divine</page><page sequence="11">THE ROLE OF ANTHROPOMORPHISM IN HUME' S CRITIQUE OF THEISM 93 and the human. To claim that the author of nature is similar to the mind of man, though on a grander scale, seems perilously close to reducing God to a set of concepts and models we feel comfortable with. The theist who hears Cleanthes' conclusion may waver between whether to regard his view as a defense or an attack, for many believers will want to deny with equal conviction the claim that there is much similarity between God and human minds. Hume has his finger, I think, on a central problem for discussing, much less arguing about the truth of theism. If we come to some specific character- ization of the divine nature which allows us to relate the Deity to determinate elements of human experience, we risk buying into an oversimplification. But if we fail to relate the Deity to determinate elements of human experience, we risk using words in a ways that are empty and meaningless. The choice for the theist laid out by Hume in the Dialogues is between the path of Demea, using pious phrases without meaningful content, and the path of Cleanthes, using words with specific meanings, but leading, as Hume tries to show, to an anthropomorphism that is both religiously problematic and philosophically unacceptable. In most of the discussion Philo leaves unchallenged the principle that from similar effects we can infer similar causes. He is at some pains, however, to establish that this kind of reasoning is only reliable when we have an exact similarity. Differences between the objects being compared are occasions for doubt about the causes. Given this challenge, Cleanthes can only defend his inference by overstating the similarity between natural systems and products of human contrivance and the corresponding similarity of their causes. When Cleanthes invokes illustrations intended to suggest the immediacy and naturalness of thinking of the cause of the universe as like human intelli- gence, Demea warns of the danger of bringing God down to the human level. He says, Your insistence . . . drawn from books and languages, being familiar, has I confess so much more force on that account; but is there not some danger too in this very circumstance, and may it not render us presump- tuous by making us imagine we comprehend the Deity, and have some adequate idea of his nature and attributes? . . . &lt; God's &gt; attributes are perfect, but incomprehensible. And this volume of nature contains a great and inexplicable riddle, more than any intelligible discourse. {Dialogues, p. 155) Here Hume uses Demea to make two points. One is that Cleanthes is in danger of taking his theological models too literally. The other is that his compar- isons have been made only at the cost of ignoring significant dissimilarities.</page><page sequence="12">94 DAVID M. HOLLEY When Cleanthes stands his ground in maintaining that the Deity possesses a mind resembling the human mind, Demea presses him about the dangers of anthropomorphism. He asks Cleanthes to consider what it means to describe the deity as similar to the human mind: What is the soul of man? A composition of various faculties, passions, sentiments, ideas; united indeed, into one self or person, but still distinct from each other. When it reasons, the ideas which are the parts of its discourse arrange themselves in a certain form or order; which is preserved entire for a moment, but immediately gives place to another arrangement . . . How is this compatible with that perfect immutability and simplicity, which all true theists ascribe to Deity? (Dialogues, pp. 158-159) We might expect Cleanthes at this point to qualify his claim that the deity is similar to the human mind. But Cleanthes realizes that introducing differences in kind between the divine and the human mind will serve to weaken his claim that the inference he is defending as a sufficient basis for religion gives deter- minate knowledge of the divine nature. So he renounces the traditional divine attributes of immutability and simplicity, suggesting that such attributes are inconsistent with his conception of intelligence. The kind of argument he has defended supports an intelligence that is like human intelligence, not an intelligence of a different kind. When Cleanthes insists on defending his argument by denying funda- mental differences between the divine mind and human minds, Philo attempts to show him the "inconveniences" of his anthropomorphism. One is that we have no ultimate explanation of order. If the divine mind is like a human mind, it is an orderly entity that itself requires explanation. In traditional theology a divine being serves to explain order or change without generating the need for further explanations of the same type. But Cleanthes' anthropomorphic deity will give rise to an infinite regress. Cleanthes has no answer to the problem of the infinite regress other than that he is satisfied with the explanation he has found and has no inclination to go further. Philo, however, points out other consequences of magnifying the analogy between divine and human minds. First, the divine being should be conceived as finite. An infinite mind would be too different from human minds and weaken the analogy. Second, the deity should not be thought of as perfect. Human minds make mistakes and ascribing perfection to the deity would make it unlike those minds. Third, there is no basis for inferring only one mind. Humans often cooperate in large projects, and if the cause is similar, we might expect similar cooperation at the supernatural level. Fourth, if we are really concerned to magnify the similarities, we can posit deities who have</page><page sequence="13">THE ROLE OF ANTHROPOMORPHISM IN HUME' S CRITIQUE OF THEISM 95 bodily form, exist in two sexes, procreate the way humans do, in other words a Greek pantheon. The point here is not that Philo is proposing a serious extension of the analogy. Rather we have a reductio ad absurdum of attempts to take the analogy between nature and human products as the basis for a theological system. Attempts to press the details lead to a ridiculous anthropomorphism. But to disallow these extravagant speculations, we need to acknowledge limits on the analogy that Cleanthes is unwilling to concede because it would weaken his claims about the applicability of our discourse about human agency to the divine. Philo has other objections. He argues that there are principles of order besides mind which might serve as analogical bases for cosmological systems, though such systems are equally tenuous because of a lack of data. Even more devastating, he challenges Cleanthes' principle of inferring like causes from like effects by invoking the Epicurean hypothesis of chance combinations of atoms producing stable systems. But it is only when Philo shows that the data Cleanthes is using furnishes no basis for attributing to the deity moral attributes resembling human virtues that Cleanthes is disturbed. His argument was presented as a sufficient basis for religion, and apparently he had assumed that the intelligent deity argued for would possess something analogous to human goodness. Cleanthes and Demea represent for Hume two alternatives for theistic tradition. The alternative of Demea is to refrain from saying anything deter- minate about the God whose existence is asserted. Such a view Hume finds ultimately indistinguishable from a sceptical position of the kind he can endorse. On the other hand, the alternative of Cleanthes, as a representative of empirical theism, is to try to say something substantive about the kind of being whose existence is asserted. This approach depends on magnifying the analogy between divine and human agency. Traditionally theists who have used such analogies have placed significant controls on extending them, as, for example, Locke's view that the human attributes applied to God are to be imagined as infinite. In the Dialogues Hume shows the tension between trying to hold onto a determinate idea of God in which anthropomorphism is strictly qualified and trying to support the belief on empirical grounds. When Cleanthes tries to make an empirical case for God, he is driven to drop the kinds of qualifications that might weaken his empirical case, but this opens him up to the charge of anthropomorphism from his own tradition, and the unabashedly anthropomorphic deity he argues for gives rise to a range of evidential problems that Philo refers to as "inconveniences." Furthermore, as Cleanthes makes his case, it becomes clear that he cannot come close to fulfilling his promise of exhibiting a type of reasoning that</page><page sequence="14">96 DAVID M. HOLLEY is a sufficient basis for religion. At best he could only hope to estab- lish that there is an intelligent cause of the universe, and such a belief would hardly be enough to sustain religious practice. From Hume's point of view religious beliefs in the full sense require a degree of anthropomorphic projection that goes far beyond what any dispassionate analysis of the data could support. Even the conclusion of an intelligent cause is a product of a propensity in human nature to think teleologically about the universe, though a dispassionate examination of the data itself can only suggest a remote analogy. 5. Hume's challenge Edward Craig has argued that we can gain insight into Hume's whole philo- sophical project by construing his target to be the idea of human beings as made in God's image. Hume's work, he says, aimed at no less than destruction of the doctrine of the image of God, and substituted for it an anthropology which looked not to the divine but the natural world for its comparisons, and to the sciences for its methods.12 Hume's critique of theism might be read as an attack on the doctrine of the divine image from the other side. Not only does theology give no insight into anthropology; anthropological models furnish no basis for substantive claims about the divine nature. Yet as Hume was well aware, an understanding of God that is purged of comparisons between the divine and the human would be insufficient for the functioning of historic theistic religions. In its strongest form Hume's challenge is addressed to the theist who (1) thinks that belief in God needs an empirical justification using objective public data, (2) holds a classical British empiricist theory of meaning, and (3) recognizes compelling religious and philosophical reasons for purifying the concept of God from excessive anthropomorphism. For such an individual the challenge is to state a view of God that contains enough similarities between the divine and the human to be religiously useful, cognitively meaningful, and empirically justifiable, while avoiding the degree of anthropomorphism that is religiously objectionable or excessive in relation to the data. Hume shows that for this kind of theist the balancing act required is unlikely to be successful. Does this sort of challenge still have any force if addressed to con- temporary evidentialist theists? It should be acknowledged, I think, that contemporary views on meaning and justification furnish these theists with considerably more room to maneuver than was available to Cleanthes. For</page><page sequence="15">THE ROLE OF ANTHROPOMORPHISM IN HUME' S CRITIQUE OF THEISM 97 example, the kind of similarity that Hume could demand between an attribute applied to God and its human application seems excessive. We have become much more aware of the possibility of extending our terms to new contexts in which there are connections to earlier meanings, but not the kind of common essence that the British empiricists thought necessary. We have also become aware of the value of speculative models that go beyond the data in ways the empiricist view of justification could not permit. Nevertheless, I think that Hume's critique reveals fundamental difficulties for any program of grounding belief in God in a natural theology appealing to objectively available empirical data. The being who is posited as an explan- ation of something within the natural world will need to be understood by means of analogies with entities used in more ordinary explanations. But any respectable theism must qualify significantly any resemblance it uses in a model for talking about God. If human psychological traits are used within the model, they must be used in a way that negates much of our comprehension of what these traits amount to. But when we put in all of the qualifications, and remove associations from ordinary agency discourse that are inapplicable, it becomes less clear how the divine object explains the natural data. When we say that the universe was produced by something analogous to human agency but qualify the claim enough to remove unac- ceptable anthropomorphism, is there enough substance left to constitute a genuinely informative explanation? Furthermore, even if there is, what is the relevance of that heavily qualified claim about deity for the kind of belief that would be needed to support religious practice? Hume, like the best of critics, shows remarkable insight into the object of his criticism. When he sets his sights on theism, he notices that there is a basic unclarity about the meaning of the claim that God exists. Rather than being a single belief, theism is more accurately regarded as a family of beliefs with more anthropomorphic conceptions at one pole and relatively sparse conceptions at another. In some of these conceptions the analogies between the divine and the human have been removed altogether or qualified in a way that precludes understanding the divine object. Attempts to take any one of these conceptions and identify it with the God who is affirmed in the tradition is subject to objections from within theistic tradition. Taking one of the more anthropomorphic conceptions raises philosophical and religious difficulties, and taking one of those conceptions in which anthropomorphic elements have been removed raises problems of meaning as well as religious significance. Hume's general strategy of exploiting the internal tensions within theism, as well as many of his specific moves, is available to the contemporary critic</page><page sequence="16">98 DAVID M. HOLLEY of attempts to derive God from a dispassionate contemplation of the natural world. Furthermore, the critic who wants to appropriate Hume's approach can form an alliance with those theists who hold that God is not an object of disinterested theoretical reflection. With those theists the critic can affirm that whatever god might be derived from natural theology cannot be a justification of the kind of belief on which religious practice depends. Notes 1 .

For example, Gaskin concludes that Hume accepted what he calls "attenuated deism." J. C. A. Gaskin, Hume's Philosophy of Religion, 2nd ed. (New York: St Martin's Press, 1988). Yandell calls Hume's position "very thin theism." It is so thin that it does not even specify between a single deity and multiple deities. Keith Yandell, Hume's "Inexplicable Mystery" (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1990). I suspect that Hume might have regarded the question of whether he was a theist or an atheist a verbal dispute {Dialogues, p. 218). 5. The idea of anthropomorphism is also prominent in one of Hume's major models: Cicero's De Natura Deorum.

The position of Cleanthes is reminiscent of the remarks of Lysicles in Berkeley's Alciphron who refers to divines who responded to objections by denying that God has attributes such as knowledge, wisdom, goodness in the human sense of these terms.
