Oklahoma Archeological Survey, Archeological Resource Survey Report, Number 27. Norman, 1986. x + 130 pp., figures (some in color), tables, biblio., appendices. $8.50 (paper). Reviewed by Gay le J. Fritz The Oklahoma Archeological Survey has published a detailed examination of 10 rock-art sites in central Oklahoma. In addition to six color plates and 34 black- and-white photographs, the report includes 21 line drawings by artist Sampson. Combined with Neel's descriptive and interpretive text, the study is a thor- ough, aesthetically well-rounded treatment of a fre- quently neglected type of archaeological resource. The authors visited nine rock-art sites in the 24-county Cross Timbers Management Unit, which is one of six biotic districts in the state delineated by the Okla- homa Archeological Survey for purposes of organ- izing archaeological data for research, planning, and preservation. A two-week search for the tenth rock art site on record was unsuccessful, but available in- formation about petroglyphs previously reported at that site is included in the volume. These for the most part are not extensive groupings of figures. Relatively few motifs are present at the eight petroglyph and two pictograph sites, and most design elements are small. Still, each is depicted and throughly described, with attention to the total rock- outcrop formation, general topographic setting, and associated archaeological evidence. One new rock-art style, designated the "Tiger Mountain Petroglyph Style/' is proposed for the pecked hand and foot- prints, circles, zigzags, and anthropomorphic figures at the Handprint site and nearby Table Rock site. The strength of this volume is its detailed coverage of each site. The reader acquires an overall view sel- dom realized in the rock-art literature. The high-qual- ity photographs and drawings are immense contri- butions, but the written descriptions are also clear and well organized. The challenge of interpretation may have been more difficult. Although similar mo- tifs at sites in surrounding states are referenced, no discussion of overall content, stylistic pattern, or lack of pattern is given, so that the rock-art sites are not well placed in regional perspective. The chapter en- titled "Regional Perspective" consists of 13 pages of detailed maps and comprehensive tables outlining the known resources in Kansas, Colorado, New Mex- ico, and Texas, but the single page of text does not relate the symbols at the Oklahoma sites to those reported from surrounding states. Another criticism would be that some chronological interpretations are less than firmly founded. These perceived weaknesses are outweighed by the contribution made by this volume, which is, after all, subtitled an "introductory study." The vulnerability of prehistoric rock art figures is manifested by the scar left after destruction of a petroglyph panel at the Table Rock site. The authors of this report convey a deep sense of appreciation for their data that may result in greater protection of sites such as these, along with additional research needed to help us under- stand them better.</page></plain_text>
