And he set a graven image of Asherah, that he had made, in the house of which the Lord said to David and Solomon his son, "In this House, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever." (2 Kgs 21:7) Excavations at Kuntillet 'Ajrud unearthed Iron Age inscriptions that complicated the interpretation of both goddesses in Judah's Yahwistic cult and the larger relationship of divine femininity to the emergence of monotheism. Fragments of pithoi bore scribal exercises invoking the blessing of "Yahweh and his Asherah."5 The pairing of Yahweh and Asherah was unexpected, regardless of whether the latter term referred to cultic paraphernalia, aforeigngoddess or Yahweh's traditionally sanctioned (or subversive) wife. The oblique semantics of the inscriptions have made scholarly consensus on the meaning of "Asherah" elusive. Most scholars have now recognized, however, that flexible explanations are necessary in order to harmonize the 'Ajrud evidence with the Hebrew Bible's elliptical portrayal of Judean monolatry. The contours of early monotheism are not black and white. Hundreds of pillar figurines surfaced in Judean households of the later Iron Age-a time supposedly marked by pronounced centralization of "state" religion championing a form of Yahwistic monotheism. This conspicuous archaeological testimony represents an important opportunity to dissect the resonance of divine or idealized femininity against the backdrop of larger cultural currents. Whether the figurines allude specifically to Asherah or another goddess is perhaps less important phenomenologically than the exaltation of a maternal ideal. McCarter envisions the hypostatization of Asherah in ancient Israel, suggesting that rather than necessarily signifying an independent deity, the name conveyed a feminine representation of certain attributes of Yahweh or his effective presence.6 This might parallel the feminine hypostasis of Wisdom (Prov 1:20-33; 8-9), whom humans are enjoined to emulate. Any goddess or hypostasis so envisioned echoes the archetype to which the adept aspires. In the ancient Near East, some caution, figurines are as likely to represent the petitioner as the deity.7 Recognition of the archetypal significance surfaced as early as sixty years ago in one scholar's characterization of the reproductive emphasis as "symbolic of womankind in general. "8 An idealization of the Judean woman as a "producer of persons" does seem to crystallize in this artifact (or in the "goddess" if need be). The object itself is small, but it represents something enormous. The maternal images that Frymer-Kensky calls "a visual metaphor, which show in seeable and touchable form that which is most desired" contrast sharply with common curse language that threatens desiccated breasts and infertility.9 Moreover, the prominence of divine petitions for conception is demonstrable in the myriad Near Eastern personal names with etymologies acknowledging the successful plea for the named child (Irme-Dagan "Dagan has heard [a plea for conception]," Igmanni-ili "My god has heard me," and no fewer than twenty-two Shemaiahs "Yahweh has heard," in the Hebrew Bible), the god's magnanimous bequest (Nathaniel "God has given [a child]," Nabu- apal-iddin "Nabu has given an heir"), or divine assistance in childbirth (Jephthah "Let [Divine Name] open [the womb]," Iptatar-lisir "[Divine Name] has loosened [the womb], let [the child] thrive/pass through"). It is not so easy to divorce these cultural idioms of conception, pregnancy and childbirth from the material culture that engendered this quintessence of clay. the figurine type's proliferation and meaning in the late eighth to seventh centuries BCE.10 A common position among scholars of different stripes holds that the pillar figurines were "cultic" in nature. The cultic attribution assumes the use of paraphernalia in ritual, votive or petitionary function. The presumed domain of fertility further evokes the desire for conception, specifically, and social reproduction in the larger ideological sense. The common cultic designation for this artifact class, however, probably does not fully explain its raison d'&amp;tre or the impetus for its proliferation in this place and time. While I do not dismiss the possibility that the figurines served a cultic use, it is important not to limit discussion to the cultic arena or ritual practice. How an object finds use in practice does not always reveal the reasons behind its origin or popularity. As cultural artifacts routinely acquire secondary meaning in particular or historical circumstances," the ideological sphere holds some potential for understanding the intense popularity of the pillar figurines in late Iron II Judah. The Essentials of Pillar Figurines There are two main subtypes of the clay pillar figurine: the handmade type with a finger-pinched face and the type featuring 138 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 67:3 (2004)</page><page sequence="3">a head cast from a mold.12 Both subtypes sport a handmade pillar base without articulated lower appendages or pudenda. Low- hung arms cradle a frequently-exaggerated bosom. The clay fabric of the figurines is generally poor and often ill levigated with surviving grog in the matrix. Fired figurines are usually fragile. The carbonaceous cores and incomplete vitrification indicate an insufficient firing temperature and/or time. While stylistic variations among the cast heads reveal that more than one mold was in circulation, the very use of molds and the general stylistic uniformity of their bases attest to mass production. Observing that the figurines are "very homogeneous in shape," Kletter maintains that "the use of moulds indicates mass manufacture at a rather high technical level and not dispersed, domestic production."13 The still- incomplete petrographic data show, nevertheless, that some figurines from Jerusalem and Tel 'Ira were manufactured from respectively local clays. It is possible that this signifies the existence of regional industries (household or cottage), albeit of a sort inclined to voluminous output. Of course, even regional centers of production may succeed under centralized guidance or through the emulation of popular types. Approximately ninety-six percent of the provenanced pillar figurines (822 of the 854 total specimens), have surfaced within the geographic parameters traditionally ascribed to Judah during the eighth to seventh centuries BCE.14 This figure includes 628 specimens from the Judean mountains, 126 from the Judean Shephelah and 89 from the Negev. The fact that only four percent of all attested figurines emerged at sites outside of Judah suggests that their appearance there is exceptional to the larger pattern. This distribution pattern allows us to deduce that these objects are essentially "Judean figurines." While neighboring polities and peoples may have made use of the pillar figurines, their proliferation within Judah was disproportionately high.15 It is also possible that the objects were not originally a Judean innovation, but cultures may adopt and adapt preexisting styles to use for their own unique purposes.16 The archaeological contexts of the figurines are myriad. They include graves, caves, residences, courtyards, gates, storehouses, streets, cultic areas and contexts suggesting waste deposits, like cisterns and silos.'7 This indicates a wide distribution pattern, which overlapped various spatial and social spheres of life. It is therefore difficult to accept the common contention that the pillar figurines were limited to domestic contexts or individual cults. As to chronological distribution, most archaeologically datable figurines seem to straddle the eighth to seventh centuries BCE, with slightly more originating in eighth-century contexts. Most of these contexts should represent ca. 701 destruction layers and thus indicate a late eighth-century snapshot of a trend that clearly continues well into the seventh century. While a destruction context cannot provide certain knowledge of an in situ artifact's life span a quo, it is unlikely that enough figurines (from the destruction clusters) would predate the destruction strata by more than a generation to skew the general picture of artifact popularity ca. 701. In other words, we may still confidently locate most of the eighth-century specimens in the generation following 722 BCE. The figurines are virtually extinct by the early Persian period, which follows fast on the demise of the Judean polity. It should be noted, however, that many figurines are not datable due to the sizeable number originating from uncontrolled twentieth-century excavations. In the light of the stratigraphic and geographic distribution, then, the pillar figurines represent principally an eighth- to seventh-century Judean phenomenon. Interpreting the Pillar Figurines It is difficult to discuss the pillar figurines without reference to the dea nutrix explanation, which concerns the possible representative connection between the anthropomorphic objects and an identifiable "nurturing" goddess. Many scholars now conventionally assume that the figurines represented Asherah,18 while others allow for the identification with a different goddess or even a conflation of goddesses.19 Dever and Holladay freely use the term "mother goddess" to characterize the objects' divine referent.20 Others demur from the notion that the figurines represent a deity at all 21 and Sasson hedges his bet on "how much divinity stuck" to figurines of this sort.22 *Samaria 2 Tel reimeh2 Tel Far'ah 2 * Shechem 2 Tel Michal Tel Qasileh 2 S Bethel4 Jericho 4 Tel en-Nasl14 cho Gezer 7* Glbeon27 Tel e-Ful4 S Abu Ghosh Ramot " V dJe rklho' *Ashdod / Moza' 6e Jerusalem 405 RamatRahe11Ie * Kh.e-ras Tel Safie / * Beth Lehem S"Azeka 4 , *Tel Goded 5 Tel Erani8 / e - ere ds 9 *Maresha / Lachish 29 '/ *TelHallf2 S.

Court hypocrisy is, of course, always a possible explanation when one finds in royal hands those same objects presumably denied the public. In the case of the pillar figurines, however, the dispersal in Jerusalem alone is such that we must acknowledge that elites did not exercise any monopoly of use. The considerable archaeological evidence supports the notion that the production and circulation of objects typically designated as "fertility figurines" were both temporally and spatially familiar to late Iron II Judah.35 Hadley and others recognize the indebtedness of the pillar figurines to their Bronze Age antecedents, while noting that they may signify the appropriation Pillar Figurine Distribution by Site " Jerusalem 405 " Tell en-Nasbeh 143 O Beer-sheba 43 * Tell Beit Mirsim 37 * Beth-shemesh 30 * Lachish 29 * Gibeon 27 O Arad 23 " Ramot 13 " Ramat Rahel 11 0 Tel Erani 8 " Tel 'Ira 7 " Gezer 7 " Others 65 450 400 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 4 4ZZUere M;1~?;"~ Fg - 'i Almost half of the pillar figurines have been excavated from Jerusalem, with nearby Tell en-Nasbeh in second place.

Indeed, the Jerusalem vicinity appears to have been a production center for the pillar figurines that have regularly been assigned to the domestic sphere of religion. Adapted from Kletter (1996). of the artifact family for a uniquely "Israelite" expression.36 The specimen distribution within Judah (96 percent) forces us to emend "Israelite" to "Judean," but it essentially substantiates the notion of territorially-defined artifact popularity. The posture of the Judean type, with arms cradling protruding breasts, parallels identical posture on thematically kindred Syro-Palestinian figurines with arm-cupped bosoms-although the latter figurines also overtly depict pudenda, which are missing from the Judean type. This parallel in upper-body posture between the Judean pillar figurines and "fertility" figurines with pudenda suggests to many scholars that the emphasis or theme of the Judean type also falls squarely within the sphere of fertility. Conversely, Kletter takes the pillar bases' omission of pudenda as proof that the Judean type did not connote fertility per se.37 The pairing of cradled bosom and emphasized pubic triangle on parallel types, however, suggests that the omission of pudenda on the Judean type is only a variation on an artifact class roundly lionizing fecundity. The Nexus of Fertility and Maternity Although Meyers rightly distinguishes between maternal and sexual emphasis, the fertility argument nevertheless dovetails naturally with maternity in the larger reproductive continuum from conception to birth.38 The Judean pillar figurines' accentuated breasts are suggestive of lactation engorgement in Hadley's view39-which is an interpretation deserving of serious consideration. The obvious resemblance to nursing mothers with recently enlarged (for some, unwieldy) bosoms and the unswelled womb may indicate the post-partum condition, i.e., a successful pregnancy carried to term. Keel and Uehlinger argue that one pillar figurine variant with mother and child from Tell Beit Mirsim recalls the Isis lactans maternity figurine type,40 while Gilbert-Peretz interprets a handful of figurine fragments from the City of David corpus to feature cradled infants.4' Meyers suggests that the Judean variation (the omission of pudenda) was intended to deemphasize stylized anatomical features considered too reminiscent of foreign iconography.42 This may push the envelope a little far, but her acknowledgment of the distinctive variation on the theme of maternity is critically important. If there is something distinctively Judean about the late Iron II appearance of the object, then there too may be something uniquely Judean about its meaning or the reason for its appropriation in that place and time. The ethnoarchaeological literature indeed reveals that the appropriation and modification of cultural objects or symbols often occur in support of a deliberately constructed social agenda. Material Ideologies and Reproductive Politics The usefulness of the fertility concept for interpreting the figurines is questionable according to Zevit, who concludes that, "there is no reason to believe that in Israel, or elsewhere, for that matter, there was a neurotic overconcern with conception and viability."43 A massive body of ethnographic and archaeological literature, however, decisively belies both his implication that concern for viability could not play out visibly on a national level and his blithe dismissal of that concern as neurotic.

Political agendas of social reproduction frequently respond to real and perceived threats to communal existence, and these agendas often imprint themselves into material culture.44 In the case of late Iron II Judah, the threat was real. In recent years, archaeologists have contended that specific ideological positions on, and social attitudes about, gender routinely find expression in cultural artifacts. Political intent to define the nature of femininity informed Mayan artistic representations of women as archetypes of the natural world.45 McCafferty and McCafferty envision competing claims to reproductive identity in the depictions of the Aztec goddess Xochiquetzal, whom they view "as an ideological figurehead for women's roles in contrast to male activities and thus a focus for the negotiation of female power."46 Ancient West Mexican metal bells and rattles invoked fertility and regeneration in rituals described in the Florentine Codex.47 The use of gesture in Minoan bronze figurines expresses not only distinctions in gender, but a cultural ideology of power relations between genders.48 Joyce has analyzed androgynous depictions of women in Classic Mayan monumental art.49 She suggests a semiotic contrivance aimed to bolster an elite ideology in which women assumed a subordinate ritual position through the loss of reproductive identity. Under this interpretation, the ideological propaganda demonstrates that the manipulation of reproductive symbolism underpins efforts to control the social The role of women as producers of future citizens, laborers and soldiers made them pivotal figures in the preservation of kin and cultural identity. Aztec figurines like this one have been interpreted as reflecting the exaltation of the feminine role in reproduction. Brumfiel (1996: fig. 5.1), courtesy of Elizabeth Brumfiel. position and use-value of women. Brumfiel has contrasted the asexual depictions of women in Aztec state ideology with images of women in traditional labor roles as portrayed in figurines and other "common" or "popular" artifacts."5 In order to flesh out the significance of this contrast, she draws on Gailey's ethnographic research in Tonga. Kin/state competition to control the reproductive images of women in Tonga intersects with lineage struggles for independence against state claims to sexual and labor use-rights to their women, as Gailey explains: State ideology may press a sexual/mother identification for women in the larger society; in the kin communities, the very threat to continuity posed by the denial of autonomous, social reproduction can lead to a parallel emphasis on women as bearers of children .... The autonomy of the kin communities is at stake. One of the arenas of struggle therefore becomes how communities are reproduced, and control over biological reproduction necessarily becomes an issue. The injection of political power into community continuity- the crisis of social reproduction in state formation-creates the emphasis on women's role in sexual reproduction, which ordinarily is only a facet of their social identity and status. The control over women's potential as both makers of goods and makers of people becomes an issue in both the state-associated classes and the kin communities. The heightened emphasis on sexuality and fecundity as power in state ideologies is paralleled on the local level, but for 142 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 67:3 (2004)</page><page sequence="7">opposite reasons. Such an explanation avoids the notion of male conspiracy in the subordination of their kinswomen.51 Brumfiel interprets the reproductive emphasis of the Aztec figurines to reflect an active concern for the loss of kin identity in the face of state expropriation.52 In other words, literal survival is perceived at stake in the exaltation of the feminine role in social, and thus communal, reproduction. Their role as producers of persons (citizens, laborers, soldiers), therefore, can position women as pawns or power brokers in pivotal ideological contests to determine the integrity and durability of social/political identity. I do not mean to suggest an exact interpretive analogy between these artifacts from other regions and the Judean pillar figurines. The point is rather to demonstrate the ethnoarchaeological precedent that such artifacts, especially figurines, can be manufactured and distributed to convey ideological positions on the nature of gender, generally, and fertility/maternity, specifically. The circulation of the Judean objects certainly involved an ideological dimension. The maternal symbolism of the Judean figurines, moreover, permits a plausible inference of organized concern for nationalistic social reproduction that is consistent with their mass production and geographic dispersal within largely discrete political borders. This concern transcended the level of the individual household or clan to assume a priority of state. The artifacts, therefore, reflected a specifically Judean preoccupation with social reproduction and, by implication, the survival of national identity. Meyers understands the figurines vis- a-vis the portrait she elsewhere paints of women enduring harsh living and labor conditions in Iron I highland Israel. While I prefer to contextualize the resonance of the Iron IIB-C Judean type within its specific historical period (eighth to seventh centuries), Meyers nevertheless captures the essence of the artifacts with keen precision: "Israelite women were challenged to increase their reproductive role. The appearance of many examples of female pillar figurines thus may provide a witness to the hope of Israelite women that they would nurture many children."53 The fertility/maternity archetype served to convey the ideological significance of women's salient value to Judah as the producers of the persons necessary to replenish the state's human resources in the form of laborers and soldiers, that is, to continue the people's cultural legacy and genealogical integrity.54 This intersects with familial or genealogical legacy as a cultural mainstay. The viability of legitimate heirs is also directly linked to the maintenance of ancestor veneration in the ancient Near East, thus extending the vested interests in genealogy beyond the corporeal life and into the afterlife. "The wife's primary contribution to the family was her sexuality, which was regarded as the exclusive property of her husband, in respect to both its pleasure and its fruit," as Bird writes.55 Material emphasis on fertility, therefore, cannot stand fully divorced from the question of control over that fertility. The Iron Age division of labor did not reduce women to merely sexual laborers, however. Meyers is right to stress that women actively contributed to the larger social fabric in venues that some second-wave feminists might underemphasize.56 But that reality only further exposes the ideological valuation of women as reproductive agents. The pillar figurines portray the fertile archetype, an ideal model of the dutiful Judean woman: wife, mother, the progenitress of Judeans. In this sense, it does not matter whom the figurines reference, because their meaning and intent remain essentially the same within this rubric of reproductive ambition. Any implied divine personality exuding fertility thrives conceptually as the mirror image of the perfect Judean woman, a heavenly alter ego. Along these lines, the divinization, if any, of the figurines only further reinforces their meaning and message in the popular "cultic" realm of ritual practice. Any use of the figurines in petitionary, votive or magical acts likewise reflects actions complementary to the underlying ideology. One outstanding matter, however, concerns the agent(s) responsible for the manufacture and circulation of these objects. As we have seen, sometimes state efforts to define the parameters and duties of gender arise from attempts to control lineages on the local level. When ideologies manifest in the production of cultural artifacts, one often observes ideological factions fighting for control of those artifacts. This is the essence of the position that the pillar figurines signified a popular, nonconformist religion in defiance of the state." There may indeed be good reason to imagine material imprints of lineage disintegration during the late Iron Age II.58 One might propose popular kin resistance to state ideology, wherein the pillar figurines originated as expressions of concern for lineage, rather than state, survival. This would parallel the Aztec artistic resistance articulated by Brumfiel, in which kin groups defied state depictions of women with counter- representations (viz. figurines), asserting the reproductive value of their own women to the kin groups' endurance. An obvious counterpoint to this interpretation recognizes the absence of monumental Judean state art during the period in question. The common aniconic appearance of seventh-century artifacts, like stamp seals, nevertheless admits to the possibility that iconic art itself represented a form of resistance. One might also suggest on ethnoarchaeological grounds that the figurine subtype with handmade, finger-pinched heads represented a form of popular resistance to state-circulated cast figurines. There is evidence, for example, that Africans enslaved in colonial South Carolina preferred to fashion their own crockery as a material symbol of defiance."59 Control over the manufacture of their own vessels could signify an assertion of autonomy even in servitude. I prefer a theory of agency that posits a state ideology at work, however, wherein elites sought to stimulate social reproduction amid the growing geopolitical duress of Assyrian encroachment and a reasonable concern for continued national autonomy. Such an effort would seek to define the very value of women to the state apparatus and the durability of its citizenry. The state, then, may have encouraged or at least tolerated the production and distribution of figurines intended to model NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 67:3 (2004) 143</page><page sequence="8">Jerusalem Lachish Tell en-Nasbeh Beersheba Tel "Ira Beth-shemesh Some figurines discovered at peripheral sites may have originated in the capital, but many were made locally.

The figurines themselves were entrenched cultural objects now appropriated as touchstones for a more programmatic agenda. This theory does not require that the state itself actually manufactured the figurines-only that it promoted an ideology of gender duty and abetted the material expression of that ideology in the "popular" realm with resonant symbols long embedded in the culture's artifactual landscape. "In general, civil/religious ideologies highlight women's role in sexual reproduction as a primary determinant of their social identity .... State ideologies may debase women as less sacred or worthy than men, but at the same time exalt women whose sexual and reproductive potential are controlled by the state class(es)," as Gailey writes.60 The probability of state complicity, or at least toleration, is evident from the mass production and territorially-defined distribution of the figurines. The pillar figurine enjoyed a nationalistic circulation, which does not accord with an ardently enforced prohibition.61 As noted above, nearly half of the provenanced pillar figurines come from Jerusalem and eleven more come from Ramat Rahel. Chemical constituents observed by NAA demonstrate that Jerusalem and its vicinity probably housed the production center(s) for objects excavated in the City of David,62 while petrographic analysis suggests that other sites like Tel 'Ira evidently also boasted production facilities.63 For the City of David corpus, consider also the petrographic data, which render it "impossible to suggest a specific site as their sole manufacturing center, but the uniformity in production methods raises the possibility that such a center existed, perhaps in the region of Judah."64 While it remains possible, therefore, that some figurines discovered at peripheral sites originated in the capital, many were also made locally. This prompts the question of emulation. A typological survey of the head casts by site (e.g., Beersheba, Lachish, Beth-Shemesh, Tell en-Nasbeh, Tel 'Ira and Tell Beit Mirsim) also reveals stylistic, perhaps regional, variation, but many of the molds nevertheless possessed certain features in common, viz. the curled, page-boy-cut hair or headdress. When one compares the headdress styles of head molds by site, it is clear that the variation mentioned still depends upon a single headdress style. It appears, then, that regionally-distinct (if not regionally-manufactured) figurines, in fact, still emulated a prototypical figurine or figurine class so adorned. This would also explain the imitative finger- pinched subtype, which may have proliferated as a knock- off or more easily obtainable substitute. A finger-pinched specimen from Ramat Rahel might complicate this view, however. "These 'pinched-nose' heads were made by or for people who had no access to the moulded heads," Hadley suggests, further explaining that "evidently, the possession of even a crude 'pinched-nose' pillar figurine was deemed to be more important than not possessing one at all."65 Given the distribution patterns of the artifacts, it is probable that the Jerusalem workshop(s) produced or popularized the emulated type(s). This further strengthens the notion that the state was complicit with, or tolerant of, the distribution of the pillar figurines. Lie Back and Think of Judah "Lie back and think of England" went Queen Victoria's apocryphal advice to her daughter on the eve of her wedding. The attribution was false-many consider Lady Hillingdon's journal (also apocryphal) the original source-but the idiomatic hallowing of social reproduction was not lost on an imperial people. This popularized quip resonated in early twentieth- century England as a nationalistic maxim and instrument of misogyny in part because of its reputed monarchic imprimatur. It complemented the ideal of republican motherhood that would find its quintessential American expression in Theodore Roosevelt's equation of maternity with military service to the state.66 During World War II, both Allied and Axis propaganda frequently idealized women as the mothers of soldiers for their nations' causes.67 States have long pressed maternity and sexuality into the discourse of national survival. The nationalized maternal archetype likewise was hardly foreign to Judah's cultural landscape. Meyers presents a detailed analysis of Genesis, which concludes that Eve represented such an archetype, an "everywoman," whose reproductive status par excellence epitomized the Israelite woman's conspicuous preoccupation with maternity and child-rearing.68 Such a narrative icon resonated not only among women, but also throughout the sociopolitical community. Social reproduction is the salient mechanism for the preservation of identity and the survival of community, and as such represented a priority of state as well as family in Iron Age Judah. As the fertility/maternity topos symbolizes national viability (e.g., Hos 9:11-12), note too that the Hebrew idiom "to cleave open a pregnant woman," is near tantamount to genocide (2 Kgs 8:12, 15:16; Amos 1:13; Hos 14:1). The language of kinship (whether real or imagined) is frequently used in the ancient Near East to characterize tribes and polities. This ingrained cultural reflex to use "fictive kinship" terminology also facilitated the political appropriation of familial and maternal metaphors in national epic. Real and perceived threats to national existence further elevated the individual woman's fertility to matters of state. As Meyers explains, "The concern for increasing numbers was also related to the issue of security, that is, of having the manpower necessary for defense of territory .... Population increase thus had a tribal or nationalistic context. The canonical sanctions for human fertility reflect a situation in which the need to become numerous was part of the public or communal consciousness."69 At no time inJudah's history was this consciousness so heightened as in the decades following the fall of Samaria and again after the invasion of Sennacherib, that is the late eighth and seventh centuries BCE-the very same period that witnessed the rise in mass production and circulation of the Judean pillar figurines. This is no coincidence. By the time Sargon II destroyed Samaria and deported the remaining inhabitants of Israel in 722 BCE, most of the Levantine petty states had already fallen victim to Assyrian imperial expansion and concomitant mass deportations.70 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 67:3 (2004) 145</page><page sequence="10">Even if reports from Israelite refugees of Assyrian atrocities did not stimulate concern for national survival after 722 BCE, then the siege of Lachish and her sister cities, graphically depicted in Sennacharib's palace reliefs in Nineveh, surely must have. These reliefs depict Judean women and children being led off into captivity and Judean men tortured and impaled for public viewing. The Assyrian deportation literally devastated the Judean citizenry and Judah in the eighth to seventh centuries found itself embroiled in a cultural crisis in which national survival, the perpetuation of identity and the pressing needs of social reproduction all became urgently intertwined. Photos ? Erich Lessing, courtesy of Art Resource, NY Gone were Hadrach, Arpad, Hamath and Damascus, the principal local powers for more than a century. In the two decades between the destruction of Samaria and Sennacherib's invasion, the citizenry of Judah must have understood the probability that it too faced extinction. If some Israelites escaped deportation to find refuge in Judah, they were positioned to convey firsthand accounts of Assyrian atrocities. Reports of the gathering storm no doubt fueled the same anxiety that some archaeologists envision in military preparations attributed to Hezekiah in anticipation of Sennacherib's arrival. While I do not share the confidence of many scholars that Judah's late eighth-century material expansion was solely a reflection of geopolitical concern for Sennacherib's impending belligerence, I nevertheless deem it difficult to divorce the threat of Assyrian encroachment from the court's consciousness after the fall of Samaria. The long- 146 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 67:3 (2004)</page><page sequence="11">Sexual Expropriation and the Law Kin assertions of their reproductive rights intersect with the ugly, yet frequently glossed-over, historical reality of elite sexual expropriation of women. This could occur "domestically," as in the case of the court's expropriation of Abishag from her subjugated clan (1 Kgs 1:2-4), or in the form of raiding foreign population groups and requisitioning their women of child-bearing potential. This latter grisly reality surfaces in Deut 21:10-14, which concerns certain rights afforded manumitted sexual captives. Slave concubinage was an institution that offered more than one avenue for social reproduction. Widespread conventions of ancient Near Eastern law granted owners virtually unchecked sexual rights over their female slaves. Proprietary rights extended also to any progeny resultant of this relationship. The acquisition of procreant slave women therefore provided a means to produce additional slave laborers. As Westbrook writes: Because she could bear children, the female slave was a special economic asset .... Like its mother, the child would be the property of her owner, no different from the offspring of the owner's herds. If her master himself took his slave-woman as a concubine, his rights over the issue of the union would be those of an owner, not of a father.71 Particularly relevant to social reproduction is the fact that Near Eastern law granted the owner the option of taking his concubine as a wife. This change in status would manumit the new wife, but this act might also have affected the hereditary rights of otherwise illegitimate offspring from her sexual relations with her erstwhile master. Near Eastern codes explicitly deny inheritance rights to the children of freedwomen even were their children also granted their manumission. Illegitimate children could inherit when the father died without legitimate heirs, as in the cases of offspring by prostitutes (Lipit Ishtar [ILL] 27) or free concubines (Middle Assyrian Law [MAL] 41), but it is unknown whether this provision also applied to the freed children of slave concubines.72It is possible that LL 26 provides for a manumitted child of a concubine-turned-wife (betrothed to her owner after the death of his first wife) to share part of the estate with the first wife's legitimate children, but this ambiguously-worded law may only refer to the freed child's use of the property without ownership rights. The formal act of betrothal, however, could theoretically provide a legal basis for the children of a slave-turned-wife by her former master (now husband) to achieve hereditary legitimacy. In other words, the change in marital status might confer genealogical legitimacy on the children of this union in a way that probate benefiting extramarital heirs could not-especially in the absence of legitimate children by a previous marriage. As a result, not only did the acquisition of slave concubines augment labor assets in the form of enslaved children, but it also perhaps boasted the potential through marital manumission to produce legitimate heirs for the Judean free classes. Should the master seek to marry a sexual captive taken in combat, he is obliged to manumit her and permit her a period of mourning for lost family members. Should they divorce, furthermore, the wife does not return to a state of slavery, but rather is released into her own possession, i.e., she remains free.73 The Hittite code (? 194) even permits a father and son to assert sexual rights to the same slave woman, which means that more than one male of the owner's estate could command such services of her. An exception to sexual rights over slaves can be found in a particular instance of debt-slavery,74 Lev 19:20-22, wherein if a creditor sexually abuses a debt-pledged slave married to the debtor, then he will forfeit her back to her husband. We would do well to note, however, that this apparently "humanistic" remedy in fact means that the pledged wife is redeemed as property misappropriated vis-a-vis the stipulations of the pledge agreement. term economic and military build-up that Vaughn envisions75 could still easily have emerged after the resonant atrocities of 722 BCE. The Hebrew Bible's account of the Assyrian invasion portrays Assyrian rhetorical tactics that in fact assume such informed anxiety.76 Standing before besieged Jerusalem, the Rab-shakeh taunts the defenders with recollections of fallen nations: Where were the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where were the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivva? [And] did they save Samaria from me? ... You yourself have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, how they have annihilated them; and can you escape? Were the nations that my predecessors destroyed-Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the Beth-edenites in Telassar-saved by their gods? Where is the king of Hamath? And the king of Arpad? (2 Kgs 18:34; 19:11-13) NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 67:3 (2004) 147</page><page sequence="12">Grayson groups these rhetorical threats with staged murder, rape, mutilation and enslavement under the rubric of psychological warfare.7 In other words, these were visible prolegomena to looming national extinction. Sennacherib's throne reliefs graphically depict Judean women and children being led off into captivity and Judean men tortured and impaled for public viewing. Even if reports from Israelite refugees of Assyrian atrocities did not stimulate concern for national survival after 722, then the siege of Lachish and her sister cities surely must have. In the aftermath of Sennacherib's 701 BCE invasion, Judah reemerged as a desolated nation in more than one respect.78 Assyrian armies had burned out all of the walled cities outside of Jerusalem, destroyed crops necessary for subsistence and expropriated vital agricultural land for Ekronite expansion.79 More gravely, Sennacherib claims to have deported some 200,150 Judeans from their homes as slaves to Assyria.80 While the exact human toll in Sennacherib's boast may be inflated, the archaeological, survey and textual evidence leaves no doubt that the scale of depopulation was massive. I am generally wary of such numbers in propagandistic texts, but a study of similar Assyrian claims of, and documentation for, mass deportationss1 may corroborate Sennacherib's figure.82 The archaeological, survey and textual evidence leaves no doubt that the scale of depopulation was massive. The Assyrian deportation literally devastated the Judean citizenry ifBroshi and Finkelstein's population estimate of 110,000 persons for eighth- century Judah is even remotely correct.83 Yet we know that Judah rebounded if not to its former apex under Hezekiah then as a respectably productive tributary state within the Assyrian hegemonic ambit. During the early to mid-seventh century, the era of Manasseh, Judah found the means to repopulate several of its decimated cities and countryside during a period when the uncertainty of national survival permeated every level of public consciousness. In the midst of the destruction and depopulation of Arpad, Hamath, Damascus and Samaria, eighth-century prophetic oracles proclaimed the coming annihilation of Jerusalem (Isaiah 2-3; Amos 2:4-5; Micah 3-4). Since this theme continued in prophetic invectives during the seventh century (Jer 2-6; 13:15-18:23; Zeph 1:1-2:3), it would be a mistake to underestimate the popular resonance of these threats-especially in light of Judah's eye-witness recollection of Sargon and Sennacherib's devastating campaigns. Public memory of genocide is long lived, especially when the danger persists; this is why Zevit's phrase "neurotic overconcern with conception and viability"s4 is unsettling and belittling. Eighth- to seventh-century Judah found itself embroiled in a cultural crisis in which national survival, the perpetuation of identity and the pressing needs of social reproduction all became urgently intertwined. Itwas within this geopolitical climate of imperial encroachment and the specter of political mortality that Manasseh seems to have overseen a revival ofJudah's human and natural resources. What Halpern describes as a "systematic repopulation ... orchestrated by the court"'85 indeed required an aggressive, comprehensive program of resuscitation to repopulate the country and reclaim its lost territories. Whatever Manasseh's policies may have been, it is clear that they were roundly successful. By the time of Manasseh's death in 642 BCE, Judean cities and arable lands had witnessed a revival, fortresses and public works appeared in the Negev and Benjamin, commodity revenue reappeared to satisfy tributary payments abroad and elite stratification domestically, and Judah's populace reemerged bowed but not broken.86 Manasseh's acquiescence to Assyrian demands bought Judah a half-century of breathing room to reconstitute itself.87 These were the geopolitical circumstances during the late eighth and seventh centuries BCE that served as backdrop for the proliferation of the Judean pillar figurines. This article has outlined cogent reasons to posit an ideological concern for social reproduction behind their mass production and national distribution. The constant threat of Assyrian invasion and deportation provides an informative historical context for the plausibility of both Judah's concern for national survival and motivation for a programmatic ideological response. Frymer- Kensky takes what she views as the pillar figurines' sexual characteristics to "address a desire for-and anxiety about- fertility."88 These words offer a poignant insight into the figurines' purpose and the tragic exigency that fueled their popularity. Artifacts and Meaning The larger artifact family of so-called fertility figurines emerges as early as the Neolithic period in the Near East; it persists through and beyond the Iron Age. These figurines admit to a cross-cultural object of reference, but the referent touchstones are nevertheless tethered to specific ideas in each of those cultures. And in a particular nation or cultural context, that specificity finds purchase in the resonance with individual, family and state experiences. Homogeneity of appearance does not proscribe heterogeneity of meaning. An artifact's principal value owes less to its impersonal reflection of custom or institution than to its personalized origin as an object conceived, manufactured, and infused with meaning by a real, emoting human being.89 It is difficult to imagine that fertility figurines bore identical meaning for families on Late Bronze Age Cyprus and families in Judah in the years 721, 702 or 700 BCE. The Judean pillar figurines as a mass-produced class seem to appear in discrete stratigraphic and geographic contexts. This is a specifically Judean object typologically and aesthetically. Why do they become popular as a type here? Why now? These are pertinent questions in the light of cognitive and ethnoarchaeological research documenting the appropriation and reconstitution of long-standing touchstones of material culture for new ideological purposes and social agendas. It is a mistake to divorce the geopolitical context of Assyrian encroachment from the social and political concerns of late Iron II Judah. National extinction loomed as a palpable, horrific threat. States under duress routinely emphasize social reproduction in their ideological responses to such threats. 148 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 67:3 (2004)</page><page sequence="13">Whether sponsored or tolerated by the state, the proliferation of the pillar figurine amid the Assyrian depopulation campaigns resonated with the pressing interests in maternity and viability. The complicity of the court blurs the assumed distinction between state and popular (or family) religion, insofar as archaeologists cast the pillar figurines as diagnostic determinants of a popular, nonconformist cult. This proposal does not exclude the possibility of such a dichotomy, however. It rather concludes that the distribution of pillar figurines crossed any perceptibly drawn lines between domestic, popular and elite religion. The anthropological reality that artifacts and symbols may accrue diverse meanings over time certainly applies to the so-called fertility figurine class of the Bronze and Iron Age Levant. The late Iron II popularization of the Judean pillar figurines offers a stirring time capsule of one polity's specific ideological appropriation and reconstitution of its material heritage. Notes 1.
