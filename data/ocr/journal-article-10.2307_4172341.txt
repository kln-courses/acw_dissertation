<plain_text><page sequence="1">BROWNING'S HERESIES By C. R. TRAcy The custom is to say that Browning's religion was merely con- ventional. " Browning has a meaning in his twisted sentences" Carlyle once remarked, "but he does not really go into anything, or believe much about it. He accepts conventional values." 1 And Thomas Hardy wrote similarly to Sir Edmund Gosse: The longer I live the more does Browning's character seem the leading puzzle of the nineteenth century. How could smug Christian optimism worthy of a dissenting grocer find a place inside a man who was so vast a seer and feeler when on neutral ground? 2 Browning had been reared by his parents in the Evangelical faith, and throughout his life he retained their simple piety as the core of his spiritual being. Since his mind was essentially reli- gious, much of his best poetry (and also much of his worst) is religious. But he wrote no devotional verse; his gift was not to express himself simply and emotionally, but, as Professor Aber- crombie has said, " to make life argumentatively expound itself "; 3 his religious poetry consequently is always the product of conflict, of the warfare between the heart and the head. In the sixties, when he was resuming a contact with English life which his long sojourn in Italy had broken, he found that the currents of thought were troubled. The Origin of Species (1859), Essays and Reviews (1860), Colenso's Pentateuch (1862), and Renan's Life of Jesus (1863) followed each other in rapid succession, and seemed to sweep away the foundation of old-fashioned religion. Browning not only was aware of this movement but even prided himself a little on being up to date in his thinking; but since he was unwill- ing to abandon his emotional bias towards orthodoxy, he was forced to justify himself to his reason. This effort can be watched in his poetry, and was eventually ruinous to it, for it produced works I William Allingham, A Diary, ed. H. Allingham and D. Radford (London, 1907), p. 205. 2 Printed in T.

Tracy 611 whose dullness makes the head ache even to think of; and as he grew older he floundered deeper and deeper in a little bog of meta- physics of his own devising. His poetry is, nevertheless, the record of his faith. He came to the opinion that doctrine is merely the external apparatus of religion, which at best expresses, and at worst conceals, the spiritual content; for doctrine is of the reason, and, as Sir Henry Jones has brilliantly shown,4 he believed the reason to be wholly unreliable. His mature religion is thus the emotional residue of the faith he had been trained in as a boy, after the acids of rationalism had eaten away most of its intellectual content. When the tragedy occurred at La Saisiaz in 1877-the sudden death of his close friend, Miss Ann Smith-which seems to have upset him almost more than any other experience in his life, he was unable to say more than that . . .he at least believed in Soul, was very sure of God.4a The Bible was no longer a source of comfort to him; even the hope of immortality, which he then set out to prove, rested on the flimsiest sort of argument. So far had he departed from the con- ventional non-conformity of his time. The first signs of this conflict in Browning, however, came much earlier than the sixties. Even as a precocious lad of fourteen he had gone through a religious revolt, induced partly by the in- tolerable sermons of the Rev. George Clayton which he had to sit through, and partly by his discovery of Voltaire and Shelley. Shelley was his " God " 5not only for his poetry but also for his opinions, and Browning "became a professing atheist, and, for two years, a practising vegetarian." 8 The influence of Shelley is apparent in Pauline (1833) and in some of his subsequent poems; and in Pauline, which was written when the heat of this rebellion was cooling but by no means extinct, it is possible to see, through the patchwork of poetical borrowings and boyish posturings, some- thing of the severity of the crisis he had passed through: ,'Browning as a Philosophical and Religious Teacher (Second edition, Glasgow, 1912).

(11. 469-472) Having served to bring him face to face with his own soul for the first time, however, this experience brought him back to the con- viction that his whole being required a reliance on God: But I have always had one lode-star; now, As I look back, I see that I have halted Or hastened as I looked towards that star- A need, a trust, a yearning after God. (11. 292-295) In spite of this statement critics and biographers have been in- clined to put too much emphasis on this period, and to find in it the germ of his mature religious thought.8 Probably Mrs. Orr is right when she says that " it was with him a passing state of moral or imaginative rebellion, and not one of rational doubt." 'I Cer- tainly the atheism and the vegetarianism were abandoned as lightly as they had been assumed. The biographical records that have survived for the ensuing years of Browning's life are sparse, and throw little light on his religious development down to his meeting with Miss Barrett in 1845. Apart from the rather un- graceful account of his experiment with the drama, little informa- tion exists. One source of evidence, however, has not been sufficiently ex- plored. The full story of Browning's acquaintance with Sarah Flower, her sister, Eliza, and through them with their spiritual father and guardian, the Rev. William Johnson Fox-a group which had one of the strongest influences on his young manhood- has been available only since the recent publication of the collected letters of Browning by Dean T. L. Hood. Browning tells it him- self in a letter written in 1848: H Henri-Leon Hovelaque (La Jeunesse de Robert Browning [Paris, 1932], chap. iii) calls, it " pivotal," and tries to trace, through an analysis of Pauline, the growth out of it of his mature philosophy. He confines him- self, however, almost entirely to the autobiographical evidence supplied by the early poems, neglecting the external evidence. As everyone knows, that is an extremely perilous undertaking. 8a Op. cit., p. 40.</page><page sequence="4">C. R.

In 1833, however, a firm friendship grew up, and Fox and Browning were habitually together until the latter's marriage in 1846, and whenever afterwards he was in Eng- land. Eliza belonged to the group of literary friends which Brown- ing frequented, keeping up a correspondence with him until 1845, the year before her death. Sarah married a Mr. Adams in 1834, and apparently withdrew from Browning's circle, for he heard of her death in 1848 only through the newspapers.:" Sarah Flower was the authoress of the hymn, " Nearer, my God, to Thee! ", and, as Professor Griffin has remarked, Browning was responsible for some of the "stony griefs" she sang about.'2 In 1827 she wrote a letter of confession to Fox: You did not ask me to write, and perhaps will be little thankful for what you are like to receive, a regular confession of faith, or rather the want of it, from one whom you little suspect guilty of the heinous sin of unbelief. It reads like half jest: never was I more serious.

It was in answering Robert Browning that my mind refused to bring forward argument, turned recreant, and sided with the enemy."' Browning was one of the " enemy "; but he was evidently a merely contributory cause of her unbelief, for, as she says, her " mind had been wandering a long time." From this letter, then, we know little more than that the fifteen-year-old Browning had somewhere picked up some violent talk that was sufficient to undermine a faith already tottering. Fox himself, for whom later Browning had the warmest friend- ship, was a man of great versatility. He was a leader of the Unitarian movement in England, contributed to the anti-Corn- Law controversy under the name of the " Norwich Weaver Boy," t4 edited the Monthly Repository-a magazine he was trying to wean from its strictly theological interests and direct into literature and public affairs-and was prominent in theatrical circles in London. By his personal attractions he had gathered about him a host of friends from all the walks of life. Macready, the actor, described him as " a gentleman of peculiar appearance, a good physiognomy, and bland and gentle manners," and, after riper acquaintance, wrote again: "I like Mr. Fox very much; he is an original and profound thinker, and most eloquent and ingenious in supporting the penetrating views he takes." 15 Fox was Browning's first help- ful literary critic. He wrote and published in the Monthly Re- pository complimentary reviews of Pauline and Paracelsus as soon as they appeared, and accepted for publication some of Browning's original poetry: Eyes, calm beside thee, A king lived long ago, Porphyria's Lover, Johannes Agricola, and Still ailing, Wind.:6 As a leader of the English Unitarians Fox introduced Brown- ing to a long tradition of free thinking. In 1662 two thousand ministers of the Church of England had refused to accept the Act of -Uniformity, and had been cut off by various penal laws from participation in the intellectual life of the seventeenth and eight- "I M.

Tracy 615 eenth centuries.17 After the greatest rigour of the laws had been relaxed, however, by virtue of their separate position they began to enjoy a certain immunity from the intellectual coercion that bore heavily upon the ministers of the Establishment. Many of them, of course, set up orthodoxies of their own, founding the Non-Con- formist sects; some, however, refused to submit to sectarianism, insisting that the essentials of religion were few and simple, and moved over gradually to a Unitarian position. Although at first they did not understand all the implications-for still they, un- questioningly accepted the authority of the whole Bible-they adhered so consistently to the Protestant doctrine of private judg- ment that there was scarcely a single opinion to which all Uni- tarians would have subscribed. Joseph Priestley was the first who perceived that in order to hold consistently the doctrine of the human nature of Jesus it was necessary to reject certain parts of the Gospels. In the early years of the nineteenth century the Unitarians rose to a position of some prominence, claimirng the allegiance of Coleridge, Hazlitt, and Lamb among others; and by the middle of the century they had succeeded in having abolished the legal disabilities that still hampered them. Meanwhile their theology was becoming more liberal; they bitterly attacked the Calvinistic theology, rejecting the dogmas of original sin, pre- destination, the incarnation, and the atonement. Judging all doc- trines by reason and in the light of experience, they acted as a force for compromise and as a haven for thinkers who were in revolt from the various orthodoxies of the day. Fox himself represents both the openness of mind and the in- creasing radicalness of Unitarian thought. He had been brought up in the Evangelical faith, but he was irked by the puritanicai prejudices of his sect, and he soon began to dislike its whole theo- logical position. Between 1810 and 1812 he abandoned one by one the chief tenets of his early creed-the Trinity, original sin, the pre-existence of Christ, the atonement, and Hell-and became a Unitarian.18 In 1817 he accepted the ministry of Parliament Court Chapel, London, declining " to make any confession of faith 17 Henry Gow, The Unitarians (London, 1928), p. 25.

Unfettered and unlimited freedom he claimed for himself, and would cheerfully concede to all his brethren." '1 Parliament Court Chapel had been founded in 1793 by the Rev. Elhanan Winchester, " an American ex-Baptist preacher and a pioneer of clerical disbelief in the doctrine of Eternal Hell." 20 The second minister, the Rev. William Vidler, added genuine Unitarian principles to the doctrine of religious liberty. During Fox's ministry the chapel was openly associated with the Unitarian body for the first time, and gradually grew more radical. In 1824 the congregation built a new building in Finsbury, and changed its name to South Place Chapel. Fox officiated there until 1852. During his ministry the congregation was introduced to all sorts of religious thought from Hindu phi- losophy to German rationalism, with a freedom that would have raised a storm of protest in an institution less isolated from the main stream of English thought. In 1840 the Rev. Philip Har- wood, the minister coadjutor, gave a series of lectures 21 on the Biblical criticism of D. F. Strauss, the outstanding rationalist of Germany and the exponent of the myth theory in the interpreta- tion of the Gospels,22 whose work was unknown to the English public, except to a few men like John Sterling, Thomas Arnold, and Benjamin Jowett. Although the existing records of the South Place Society do not show that Browning was ever enrolled as a member, the tradition among the oldest members of the society is that " he often attended the Chapel under Fox's ministry." 23 Since he was more than a little in love with Eliza Flower he probably went there with her. 19 Richard and Edward Garnett, The Life of W.

Whilst there is no trace of Robert Browning having been actually a member of the society he often attended the chapel under Fox's minis- try. . . ."</page><page sequence="8">C. R. Tracy 617 Better proof, however, occurs in one of Elizabeth Barrett's letters to him, when, in one of their habitual discussions of religion, Mr. Fox's chapel is mentioned as a place familiar to both of them, and as the outstanding example of its sort of religion.24 Since she had certainly never been there, South Place must have played a considerable part in Browning's life, and must have been the subject of conversation between them. There is a remarkable statement, however, in the Autobiography of Moncure D. Conway, the American Unitarian who later became minister of the chapel, concerning Browning's connection with it. "I believe that the advanced rationalism for which our chapel became distinguished in Mr. Fox's time was primarily due to Robert Browning." After quoting for evidence the letters of Sarah Flower's I have already used, he continues: Mr. Fox had been up to that time a liberal Unitarian, but his opinions had by no means reached the phase indicated in the above letter.25 His rationalism, however, took a new departure a year or two later, and after a careful study of his works and those of Sarah Flower Adams, I am con- vinced that her doubts, or perhaps his efforts to remove them, did away with his faith in a biblical revelation. Thus Robert Browning, as I believe, had something to do with the preparation of my chapel for the freethought which now characterizes it.21 This opinion must be given weight, because it comes from a good authority, yet it is scarcely credible that a boy of fifteen should have had so much influence on a man of forty-one who had already thought long and deeply on religious matters, and who had, by the time of the boy's birth, abandoned most of the orthodox dogmas. Moreover, if Fox had taken a new departure in Biblical criticism at this time, the cause was more likely his reading of German Biblical scholarship, of which an account is to be found in the Monthly Repository for that year (1827).27 Conway forgets also that there was no intimacy between Browning and Fox from 1827 to 1833. In 1827 Browning was at the fever-heat of adolescent rebellion, but by 1833 he had cooled off enough to return to his 24 Letters of Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Barrett (New York and London, 1899), II, 427. 25 As a matter of fact the letter indicates nothing at all about Fox's opinions. 26 Conway, Autobiography, II, 26-28. 27 Series II, i (1827), 633. The article is signed with "K."</page><page sequence="9">618 Browning's Heresies "lode-star." What influence there was must certainly have been in the other direction, and after 1833 Browning was in a forma- tive and receptive mood. The only poem from this period of Browning's life that has any significance for his religious thinking is Johannes Agricola, which was first published in 1836 in the Monthly Repository.28 It is a soliloquy put into the mouth of the founder of the Antinomian sect, which held that there was no necessity of good works for the elect, and that even a life of sin would not damn them. Headed by a quotation from Defoe's Dictionary of All Religions, it looks like a perfect museum-piece. But since it was published in a magazine devoted to liberal theology and at war especially with Calvinism, the conclusion is unavoidable that in it Browning in- tended to satirize the Calvinistic doctrines of election and reproba- tion: I lie where I have always lain, God smiles as he has always smiled; Ere suns and moons could wax and wane, Ere stars were thundergirt, or piled The heavens, God thought oA. me his child; Ordained a life for me, arrayed Its circumstances every one To the minutest; ay, God said This head this hand should rest upon Thus, ere he fashioned star or sun. (11. 11-20) I have God's warrant, could I blend All hideous sins, as in a cup, To drink the mingled venoms up; Secure my nature will convert The draught to blossoming gladness fast: While sweet dews turn to the gourd's hurt, And bloat, and while they bloat it, blast, As from the first its lot was cast. (Ll. 33-40) Twenty-eight years later, in Caliban upon Setebos, Browning re- turned to this theme, and wrote a satire on " natural theologians " who conceived of a God that delighted in inflicting arbitrary cruel- ties on his creatures. In both poems he exalts the moral conscious- ness over dogma. Johannes Agricola is also important for show- ing us an example of Browning's method of referring covertly to a 28 Series II, x (1836), 45. Reprinted in Dramatic Lyrics, 1842, with the title Johannes Agricola in Meditation and under the caption, Madhouse Cell.</page><page sequence="10">C. R. Tracy 619 contemporary subject by means of an ancient prototype of it, and so slightly concealing the point of his weapon. He often uses this method elsewhere, notably in A Death in the Desert and The Pope. As an example of rationalism, however, the poem shows little origi- nality, for its author is merely following in the wake of his men- tors at South Place, who had abandoned Calvinism years before. Nevertheless, it is an index of the influence Unitarian thought was having on his mind. A piece of gossip recorded in one of Miss Barrett's letters shows that Browning had earned a reputation for free thinking. A visiting lady had said she had heard that Mr. Browning " was an infidel . . . more's the pity, when he has such a genius." 29 The astonishment with which this was received by both of them con- trasts oddly with what Browning himself had written in 1835 about Paracelsus: " There are a few precious bold bits here and there, and the drift and scope are awfully radical." 30 This sopho- more of 1835, frightened by his own opinions, was a very different person from the Perseus who gallantly rescued the Andromeda of Wimpole Street in 1846. By that time South Place had passed from his interests, although we do not know precisely when or why,3' and he had drifted into more secular preoccupations. Nevertheless, to conclude that all trace of his early religious life had been obliterated would be a mistake. He was acquiring the exterior of a man of the world in order to shield his sensitive per- sonality, and so his religion was driven underground. His reluc- tance to " speak out " his religious beliefs, and his lack of success when he attempted to do so, are the measure of the intensity of his feelings. Certainly Miss Barrett found him a religious man, and by gentle persuasions tried to overcome his inhibitions. Many of the characteristics of Browning's mature religion can be traced to his contact with South Place, and even those Uni- tarian beliefs he could not accept remained in his mind as the major problems of religious thought. Although it is dangerous to apply the technical language of 29 Letters of Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Barrett, II, 127. 80 Griffin and Minchin, 72. 81.There is an indication in the Diaries of W. C. Macready (II, 76) of a quarrel with Fox in 1840. We may conjecture that Fox was involved in the bitterness Browning felt over the failure of his plays, and that the friendship between them was interrupted then.</page><page sequence="11">620 Browning's Heresies philosophy to so unsystematic and so unlearned a thinker as Browning, his religion can best be described as an idealism, for he valued the Christian story not because it was true to historical fact so much as because it symbolized spiritual reality in a tangible form. As the rationalistic critics proceeded in their attack on the Biblical narrative he took refuge more and more in his idealism, making light of their work on the ground that the truth of Chris- tianity is on a plane beyond the reach of mere historical criticism.32 The important thing for the individual, he said, is not an intellec- tual certainty based on an acceptance of the historical truth of the Bible, but the witness of the heart in Christian experience,-" the idea, the feeling and the love," as he makes one of his characters say: Like you this Christianity or not? It may be false, but will you wish it true? 33 This is his constant rejoinder to the higher criticism. But Brown- ing was an imperfect idealist because he never distinguished an idea from an emotion; in the quotation I have given-" the idea, the feeling and the love "-all the terms appear to be synonymous. One even suspects that he means little more by the word idea than is meant in the colloquialism: "Do you get the idea?" His idealism, then, is an off-shoot of his theory of love decked out in philosophical jargon, and I doubt whether he had more than a superficial knowledge of the meaning of the word as it is used by the Hegelian rationalists of his time. Browning must have picked up somewhere, however, an acquaint- ance with the vocabulary of idealism, and enough of its matter to give his thought the turn it took. In 1835 he affirmed that he "knew neither the German philosophers nor their reflection in Coleridge," 34 and he never acquired sufficient mastery of the lan- guage to see him through German books. Fox and South Place Chapel almost certainly gave him his initiation into idealism. According to Fox the historical parts of religion are mere legends or myths in which truth and falsehood are indiscriminately 32 W. 0.

R. Tracy 621 mingled, but "religion is not to be mixed with this: it is moral truth, resting on moral proof, and cannot fade or waste away." 36 He believed that all religions, including his own, embodied two essential ideas, the idea of God and the idea of immortality.37 The similarity of Browning's views with Fox's is evident, and in the line I have already quoted from La Saisiaz Browning gives as the primary postulates of his religion Fox's two essential ideas: . . .he at least believed in Soul, was very sure of God. Browning never conceived of God in the anthropomorphic terms of the Pentateuch. For him God was a power, a spirit in nature and in man, an abstract idea, or, as Mrs. Orr has said, " far more the Supreme Being of metaphysics than the God of theology." 38 This notion of God is similar to that of the Unitarians, who natur- ally eschewed every suggestion of anthropomorphism. Browning also shared with Unitarianism a tendency towards pantheism, and a pantheism, moreover, which differs from that of Wordsworth and Shelley in that the divine is found more in man than in external nature: Thus he dwells in all, From life's minute beginnings, up at last To man-the consummation of this scheme Of being, the completion of this sphere Of life.39 But since Browning's craving for the human affections could never have been satisfied by a belief in so abstract and remote a deity as this, he centred his faith in Jesus, who is always anthropomorphic: That one Face, far from vanish, rather grows, Or decomposes but to recompose, Become my universe that feels and knows! 40 That Jesus was divine, moreover, he repeatedly affirmed: word " mythus " is used in a specifically theological sense long before any example recorded in the 0.

He made no use of the atonement in his religious thinking, regarding the death of Jesus not as a sacrifice having a mystical efficacy, but as a mere demonstration of the divine love. "The evidence of Divine power" he told Mrs. Orr " is everywhere about us; not so the evidence of Divine love. That love could only reveal itself to the human heart by some supreme act of human tenderness and devotion; that fact, or fancy, of Christ's cross and passion could alone supply such a revela- tion." 42 Of the third person of the Trinity Browning makes no mention. In this, the first article of his faith, Browning was willing to go part way with his Unitarian friends, but he could not give himself up entirely to their cause. On the other of these essential religious ideas, the idea of im- mortality, Mr. Duckworth has recently shown that Browning's opinions were not consistent.43 Nevertheless, whatever immor- tality may be, there is never any doubt of his belief in it. The dying Paracelsus is given a prevision of the world to come: I understand it all. New being waits me; new perceptions must Be born in me before I plunge therein; Which last is Death's affair; and while I speak, Minute by minute he is filling me With power; and while my foot is on the threshold Of boundless life....44 Throughout his life Browning insisted that the future life is a continuation of the earthly life, in which personal identity is preserved: "Balaustion's Adventure, 11. 1918-1922. 42 Orr, Religious Opinions of Robert Browning, loc. cit., p. 879. 43F.

I shall clasp thee again, And with God be the'rest! 4C For Fox, on the contrary, death was utterly the end of the will and activity of the individual. But to satisfy the human desire he recognized for some sort of posthumous life or influence, Fox argued that, since the race is an organism, every constituent human being, however obscure, must have influenced the progress of the race through what it had accomplished before death, and that hence it lives after death inasmuch as it has left its impress on the race during its life. Browning alluded to and rejected an opinion similar to this in La Saisiaz.4 Although Browning disagreed with Fox on the general questiori of immortality, he followed him in his rejection of some of the dogmas connected with the orthodox belief. South Place bitterly attacked the Calvinistic dogmas of original sin and eternal punish- ment. Although Browning seems to be defending the first of these in that "horrible verse," Gold Hair, yet when Moncure Conway accused him of having done so he said Conway "had missed his meaning." 47 Gold Hair is a most difficult and unrewarding puzzle in Browning interpretation, and we may not assume from it that Browning accepted a belief that cannot by any casuistry be made to harmonize with his general views. His scheme of life is uni- versal benevolence, notwithstanding his assertion to Miss Barrett that " the heart is desperately wicked," 4 for he believed that through some mysterious providence even the most apparently wrong action will ultimately make for salvation if the doer throws every energy of his moral being into it.

Browning believed, along with Fox, that human nature is funda- mentally good. Browning's dislike of the dogma of eternal punishment was often reiterated, but it was no more vehemently expressed than that of Fox and the South Place Chapel. In Ecaster-Day he described a Hell that consisted merely in the cessation of spiritual growth. In The Ring and the Book he speaks of Hell as a place "where God unmakes but to remake the soul." 49 In the Inn Album (1875) he delivers, through the mouth of one of his characters, a violent attack on preachers who elaborate glowingly on the pains of Hell: After death, Life: man created new, ingeniously Perfect for a vindictive purpose now That man, first fashioned in beneficence, Was proved a failure.50 In Fears and Scruples (1876) he calls a God who would inflict eternal damnation for merely intellectual sins a monster. Ixion (1883) is his most imaginative treatment of the theme. Ixion, whirling around on his wheel, conquers his pain and sees a rainbow span the dome of Hell. He is being punished because his body, the slave of his soul, betrayed him. But if, instead of dooming him to an eternal life in a suffering body, Zeus had released his soul from his body, he would at once have seen the truth. In judging as he did Zeus has shown himself less wise than a human ruler who tempers justice with mercy, so that a man who loves, turns out to be greater than a Zeus who does not love.5' He calls on mankind to defy the gods, for, even though he may suffer a vindictive punishment at their hands, he is greater than they. This argument is repeated in the Camel Driver (1884), where he says that menr have to punish each other on earth because they cannot see into the heart as God can, but punishment for revenge is futile, and in God a purposeless cruelty. In his religion Browning was continually torn by two conflicting forces, the conservative Non-Conformist emotions surviving from 49 X, 1l. 2131. 50 L1. 1743-1747. 51 Cf.: Christmas Eve, 11. 285-287.</page><page sequence="16">C.

Tracy 625 his boyhood, which gave the fire to his religious imagination, and the radical thought to which he had been introduced at South Place, which was the negative force of his thought, and which, in relation with the former, produced that conflict that is char- acteristic of his religious poetry. The latter was strengthened subsequently by the works of Strauss, Renan, Darwin, Spencer, the positivists, and other authors which he glanced at, leafed over, and perhaps occasionally read through, and by conversation with well informed men like Theodore Parker, Milsand, and Jowett.52 But his attitude underwent little change during these years; in his later poems he repeats the arguments he had struck out long be- fore. His whole position, both emotional and intellectual, had been determined early in his life, the one by the strong influence of a conventional home-training, the other by an exposure to the far from conventional thought at South Place Chapel. University of Alberta. 6 The history of Browning's life-long interest in rationalism cannot be told here, but certain loci in his poems and letters ought to be pointed out. Interest in D. F. Strauss is to be seen in Christmas-Eve and Easter-Day (1850) (See the article by Professor A. W. Crawford in the Methodist Review, CX [1927], 379-382); in Ernest Renan in the Letters to Isa Blagden, ed. A. J. Armstrong, (Waco [Texas], 1923), pp. 100-101, A Death in the Desert, and the Epilogue to Dramatis Personae (1864); in the evolutionists, Darwin and possibly Spencer, in Letters of Robert Browning, ed. T. L. Hood (New Haven, 1933), p. 199, Prince Hohenstiel-Schwangau (1871), Parleying with Furini (1887); and in the positivists in La Saisiaz (1878). I have in preparation an article in which I hope to prove that Caliban upon Setebos is Browning's most complete expression of his ration- alistic interests.</page></plain_text>
