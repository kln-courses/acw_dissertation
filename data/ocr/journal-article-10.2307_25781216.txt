<plain_text><page sequence="1">"DELICATE QUESTIONS": Hermeneutics and Beckett's Watt Jonathan Stuart Boulter This fragility of the outer meaning had a bad effect on Watt, for it caused him to seek for another, for some meaning of what had passed, in the image of how it passed. Samuel Beckett, Watt I I am concerned here with a reading of Samuel Beckett's Watt, a text that signals Beckett's crucial turn into a fully "hermeneutic" mode of writing, a writing, that is, which thematizes, and ultimately parodies, the problematics of interpretation even as it offers itself in protracted seriousness as interpretable object. The process of reading through this thematization ? a process I call metahermeneutics ? ultimately places the reader in specular relation to Watt, ultimately compels the reader to balance his or her hermeneutic desire against the exigencies of Watt's own interpretive praxis. More concretely, this essay is an attempt to account in hermeneutic terms for the anxiety produced in the reading of this text, anxiety that arises in part by the reader's own self-conscious awareness of his/her proximity to the radical "otherness" of Watt, the parodic hermeneut. My method thus is to trace Watt's own processual hermeneutic through three interpretive scenes in order to suggest a number of things. First, by reading die modes of Watt's interpretive praxis against some specifics of Gadamerian theoria, I wish to trace the development of Watt's own hermeneutic, from its initial articulation as a kind of aporetic allegory, to its final status as a resigned acquiescence to the unreadable, the unnamable.1 Second, I am concerned with touching on the implications of Gadamer's notion of understanding as "dialogue" and "appropriation" to a reading of this text. He suggests that understanding occurs only as the interpreter makes his or her own the discourse of that which s/he attempts to understand. I want to suggest that Beckett heightens our awareness of understanding as appropriation through his manipulation of Watt. Beckett compels the reader ? in a process I call "conferred appropriation" ? into close proximity to a deliberately estranged discourse, compelling him to "translate" Watt's already specular language and ultimately to act, in Derrida's sense of 149</page><page sequence="2">the term, as a kind of hermeneutic "supplement" to Watt's refusal of hermeneutics, his "anterior default of a presence" (Derrida 1976, 145). Reading Watt thus is as much about the process of reading itself as it is about making specific interpretations of the meaning of the work. Indeed, I see this paper as a step towards understanding the hermeneutic logic of a text that paradoxically "denies" the logic of interpretation by inscribing ? and parodying ? its own reading en abyme: "But what was this pursuit of meaning, in this indifference to meaning? And to what did it tend? These are delicate questions" (Beckett 1988, 72).2 II The initial and initiatory act of reading in Watt is Watt's attempt to frame the incident with the piano-tuning Galls within a consistent metastructure, that is, within a frame that makes sense of the structure of the Galls' mutterings. The Galls, father and son, have arrived at Knott's house to "choon" the piano. They engage in an esoteric exchange which ends on the following ominous note: The piano is doomed, in my opinion, said the younger. The piano-tuner also, said die elder. The pianist also, said the younger. This was perhaps the principle incident of Watt's early days in Mr. Knott's house. (Beckett 1988, 69) This "principle incident" shares a homology with "all incidents of note proposed to Watt" (Beckett 1988, 69) during his tenure with Knott. The incident of course is not precisely clear either to Watt or his reader; what has occurred during this entirely linguistic exchange (if indeed "exchange" is the word)? It is an incident the semantics, if not semiotics, of which give way in Watt to an emotional response to, or desire for, form: "For the incident of the Galls father and son was followed by others of a similar kind, incidents that is to say of great formal brilliance and indeterminable purport" (Beckett 1988, 71). Any potential meaning is elided as the hermeneutic begins: It resembled them ["all incidents of note"] in the sense that it was not ended when it was past, but continued to unfold, in Watt's head from beginning to end, over and over again, the complex connections of its lights and shadows, the passing from silence to sound and from sound to silence, the stillness before the movement and the stillness after, the quickenings and retardings, the 150</page><page sequence="3">approaches and the separations, all the shifting detail of its march and ordinance, according to the irrevocable caprice of its taking place. It resembled them in the vigour with which it developed a purely plastic content, and gradually lost, in the nice process of its light, its sound, its impacts and its rhythm, all meaning, even the most literal. (Beckett 1988, 69) This is for Watt an initiation into the hermeneutic (of the void). Watt, the man who "had not seen a symbol, nor executed an interpretation, since the age of fourteen, or fifteen" (Beckett 1988, 70), and who has lived among "face values" (Beckett 1988, 70) until now, has stepped precariously into a reading of a kind of deep structure. Here "face value" ? the incident, if we can even locate the incident ? is elided figurally into shape in a conscious process of substitution. This process originates with Watt's complete inability to maintain the crucial dialectic between surface (face) and depth as he reads various incidents. Each element of any reading acts as counterbalance to the other; to lose sight of the surface meaning (or affect) of a given word, theme, symbol, is to plunge headlong into a form of allegory which has as its final effect a complete inability to orient the reading to the "real" from which the reader must orient himself: this process of ill-reading defines Watt's predicament here precisely. Hermeneutics for Watt takes the form of an expression of a desire for mastery over the given event (text), a mastery which removes the event from a context of potential meaningfulness to one in which the reader frames the event from a position of supremacy: any dialogical interplay between text and reader is suppressed in Watt. I here emphasize a particular dynamic of Watt's early reading that few critics care to notice. Most are comfortable suggesting simply that meaning is unavailable to Watt because of a congenital difficulty or philosophical bent (but perhaps they are one and the same?). Few care to notice the mode of his reading in its particular hermeneutical context: And Watt could not accept them [the series of similar incidents] for what they perhaps were, the simple games that time plays with space, now with these toys, and now with these, but was obliged, because of his peculiar character to enquire into what they meant, oh not into what they really meant, his character was not so peculiar as all that, but into what they might be induced to mean, with the help of a little patience, a little ingenuity. (Beckett 1988, 72; my emphasis) 151</page><page sequence="4">Watt, as indicated in the epigram to this essay, seeks not an understanding of the event; he refuses to allow the event to speak its meaning to him. Rather he engages in a species of reading by deferral, or reading by simulacrum: he seeks for some meaning of what had passed, "in the image of how it passed" (Beckett 1988, 70). This particular mode of reading, as mentioned, is predicated in the void: where the particular instance has no particular image, to make sense of it necessarily, it seems, means that one has to speak of it in other images. The narrator defines this hermeneutics of alterity: For the only way one can speak of nothing is to speak of it as though it were something, just as the only way one can speak of God is to speak of him as though he were a man, which to be sure he was, in a sense, for a time, and as the only way one can speak of man, even as anthropologists have realised, is to speak of him as though he were a termite. (Beckett 1988, 79) The aporia, for the reader as for Watt, begins with the narrator's delicate qualification of Watt's success in reading the Galls incident: "But if Watt was sometimes unsuccessful, and sometimes successful, as in the affair of the Galls father and son, in foisting a meaning there where no meaning appeared, he was most often neither the one, nor the other" (Beckett 1988, 74). Watt is neither successful nor unsuccessful, neither the one, nor the other. Beckett presents a (negative?) binary here the interplay of which defines Watt's ? and our ? predicament precisely. It seems rather uncomfortable though perhaps inevitable to assume that as Watt is neither successful nor unsuccessful he lies somewhere in the middling range of success. But is this a correct gauging of the choice? It seems rather more likely that any kind of rigidly logical reading of this ("he was more often neither the one nor the other") leaves us nowhere at all. Beckett opens up, as Paul Davies suggests in The Ideal Real, a new "ontology" where the logical constraints of and on the linguistic fall away or apart into a new sensibility, neither rational, irrational, logical, or absurd. We are in a precarious no man's land in our readings of Beckett's characters' reading where a vertiginous blurring of sense into nonsense, or nonsense into sense, defines our reading posture. And it is within this matrix of hermeneutical difficulty that our reading of Watt's reading appears. We are constrained to follow his laborious, and somewhat disconcerting, descent into interpretation; his interpretive acts, however, seem never to orient themselves to anything 152</page><page sequence="5">tangible. It is the peculiar nature of this text that our tracings of Watt's reading are always already tracings of tracings. By suggesting that these scenes of reading by read en abyme I am acknowledging how often the implications of Beckett's parody of allegory are passed over in the critical reception of this text: the Galls incident is at once a mise-en abyme of the hermeneutics of the entire novel and an anticipation of the critical reception of the text. Beckett perfectly represents in Watt the anxiety of the critic who when confronted with disjunctive form must frame that form in different terms, allegorically. There is thus a certain desperate irony in readings that see Watt as a Christ-figure, Knott as an elided father-figure, or the novel as extended womb-fantasy or a dismantling of the monuments of Western thought. I am proposing here that an alternate reading is to see the text as an allegory of reading, for to do so is to acknowledge how the text activates the reader's own self consciousness as it focuses attention on the (hermeneutic) substance of the text itself. "Straight" allegory articulates itself as a deflection away from the text proper and ultimately stills the text: allegorical frames rarely are self-reflexive. Ill The second scene of reading informed by the specific problematics of (meta)interpretation is Watt's reading, or more precisely, the narrator's description of Watt's reading, of the painting of the fractured circle. The painting has been variously interpreted as a discrete emblem of the relationship between Watt and Knott, as Watt attempts to locate himself (as the separated "dot" in the painting) in the larger order of (Knott's) things. I wish to make sense of Watt's reading of the painting as an interpretation of affect as much as of form. At the moment of Watt's account of the painting, the reader, who receives an image of the painting only through him, begins his or her own interpretation and evaluation of Watt's reading. The painting is described thus: The only other object of note in Erskine's room was a picture, hanging on the wall, from a nail. A circle, obviously described by a compass, and broken at its lowest point, occupied the middle foreground, of this picture. Was it receding? Watt had that impression. In the eastern background appeared a point, or dot. The circumference was black. The point was blue, but blue! The rest was white. (Beckett 1988, 126) 153</page><page sequence="6">Watt's reading of the painting is as complex as it is plodding. It touches on a variety of modes of interpretation, from formal, "historiographic", to a kind of prosopopeia, to allegory that speaks as much to our own readings of this specific text as to Watt's attempt to reach any kind of "semantic succour" in the painting. Watt begins with a formal analysis of parts: "By what means the illusion of movement in space, and it almost seemed in time, was given, Watt could not say. But it was given" (Beckett 1988, 127); he continues by reading the parts prosopopeically: "Watt wondered if they had sighted each other, or were blindly flying thus, harried by some force of merely mechanical mutual attraction, or the playthings of chance" (Beckett 1988, 127) as if, perhaps, by humanizing these abstractions would be to understand them better. Still anthropomorphizing, Watt begins a list of all the "logical" permutations of relations that concludes with one of Watt's few overt displays of emotion in the novel: ...and at the thought that it was perhaps this, a circle and a centre not its centre in search of a centre and its circle respectively, in boundless space, in endless time, then Watt's eyes filled with tears that he could not stem, and they flowed down his fluted cheeks unchecked, in a steady flow, refreshing him greatly. (Beckett 1988, 127) From this moment of expression Watt contemplates the picture at different angles to conclude that its original hanging position is superior. Watt moves to platitudinal conclusions on the "human condition" which I, perhaps perversely, am tempted to read as a savage attack on humanist interpretations of art. Watt here calls upon the artist as the final arbiter of meaning in his nostalgia for origins. This is a supremely comical mockery of the "intentional fallacy": And the thought of the point slipping in from below at last, when it came home at last, or to its new home, and the thought of the breach open below perhaps for ever in vain, these thoughts, to please Watt as they did, required the breach to be below and nowhere else. It is by the nadir that we come, said Watt, and it is by the nadir that we go, whatever that means. And the artist must have felt something of this kind too, for the circle did not turn, as circles will, but sailed steadfast in its white skies, with the patient breach forever below. (Beckett 1988, 128) 154</page><page sequence="7">Watt concludes that all things at the Knott establishment are part of a process; there is no fixity, no surety ? only flux. Watt's conclusion here dovetails nicely with a hermeneutical analysis of text because, as I mentioned, a true hermeneutics emphasizes die processual nature of understanding, precisely as it is a dialogical "fusion of horizons" (Gadamer 1989, 388): the hermeneutic encounter is a dynamic, never fully closed "conversation" (the word is Gadamer's). Understanding is not fixed and rigid, but rather it evolves and builds upon a series of incremental steps, much like Watt's reading of the painting. Watt makes a judgment here regarding Knott that theoretically should lead to a degree of succour. What we notice, however, is that Watt's readings of Knott and his establishment do not end here. Unsatisfied with this particular hermeneutic judgment, Watt blunders logically on. I say "logically" because I read Watt's reading of Knott though the logic of the question that informs our reading of Watt as a whole (thus a question that encompasses Watt's own reading): How does one understand process (or the process of understanding as process) without halting that process, without parcelling out the process in a manner which ceases the forward movement of understanding? Watt is, if we follow the logic of Gadamer's understanding of understanding as process and tracing (or appropriation), inevitably to disrupt the original movement of that event: to appropriate finally is to alter. It is of course impossible to understand process without in some ways halting that process. Watt's difficulties begin ultimately when the logic of this understanding is not fully grasped. A hermeneutics involves the reader's intimate conjunction of interpreter and event (Watt and Knott): for the interpreter to understand event or the discourse of event s/he must in some ways disclose (to) him or herself, as s/he "translates" event/text into his or her own discourse, a gesture which will inevitably disrupt the movement of event/text. The event, as Gadamer suggests, does not exist in splendid isolation: the reader must bring it to him or herself in self-understanding. In Watt's process of reading the painting ? which is ultimately a reading of Knott ? he never does violate Knott's discrete autonomy as "text", never does effect a balance between the separated part and the representational whole of this hermeneutical circle, the painting. Watt's problem is finally a problem of self-understanding; his refusal to place the spectre of Knott in intimate relation to himself is ultimately a refusal of interpretation. Knott cannot, the text suggests, be understood sui generis. 155</page><page sequence="8">IV The crux and capstone of hermeneutical difficulty ? or as I have posited, refusal ? in Watt is, of course, the tangled Knott himself. I am aided by Watt's own characterization of his relationship with Knott in my reading of Watt's refusal to read Knott. Knott's need of Watt is the Other's ethical need of being witnessed: For except, one, not to need, and, two, a witness to his not needing, Knott needed nothing, as far as Watt could see...And Mr. Knott, needing nothing if one, not to need, and two, a witness to his not needing, of himself knew nothing. And so he needed to be witnessed. Not that he might know, no, but that he might not cease. (Beckett 1988, 202) We must remember that it is Watt who articulates these ideas: he himself finds his "conjecture not entirely gratuitous" (Beckett 1988, 202) and defines his responsibility to Knott in what can be read as ethical terms. The narrator asks, anticipating perhaps the reader's question: "what kind of witness was Watt?" (Beckett 1988, 202): A needy witness, an imperfect witness. The better to witness, the worse to witness. That with his need he might witness its absence. That imperfect he might witness it ill. That Mr. Knott might never cease, but ever almost cease. (Beckett 1988, 202-03) Watt, by "witnessing" his text (Knott), keeps that text from ceasing. Watt is, however, called on to "witness" the unwitnessable for Knott is, as the narrator suggests (transcribing Watt's words) protean. Watt catches sight of Knott as he is framed in his "eastern" window: Add to this that the figure of which Watt sometimes caught a glimpse, in the vestibule, in the garden, was seldom the same figure, from one glance to the next, but so various, as far as Watt could make out, in its corpulence, complexion, height and even hair, and of course in its way of moving and of not moving that Watt would never have supposed it was the same, if he had not known that it was Mr. Knott. (Beckett 1988, 146) 156</page><page sequence="9">Knott's figure is essentially polymorphous and polysemous: "For one day Mr. Knott would be tall, fat, pale, and dark, and the next thin, small, flushed and fair, and the next sturdy, middle-sized, yellow and ginger, and the next small, fat, pale, and fair..." (Beckett 1988, 209). He sings in a voice equally capable in "all male registers" (Beckett 1988, 208) in a language "either without meaning, or derived from an idiom with which Watt, a very fair linguist, had no acquaintance" (Beckett 1988, 208): he speaks, finally, in a language "meaningless to Watt's ailing ears" (Beckett 1988, 208). Confronted by this radical "meaninglessness" Watt refuses to attempt to make a "reading" of Knott. Even to suggest Knott's need of summer or winter clothing is, for Watt, "an anthropomorphic insolence" (Beckett 1988, 202); he is, and surely the word "anthropomorphic" recalls this, unwilling to substitute "something" for the nothing of Knott ("For the only way one can speak of nothing is to speak of it as though it were something, just as the only way one can speak of God is to speak of him as though he were a man" [Beckett 1988, 74]). This phrase casts the eye back to Watt's initial articulation of the process of anthropomorphization ? the substitution of something for nothing ? and demonstrates a development in Watt's "mode" of reading. Where earlier "to explain had always been to exorcise, for Watt" (Beckett 1988, 74-5) and where his practice had been to "induce" to meaning ("with a little help of a little patience, a little ingenuity" [Beckett 1988, 72]) that which resisted meaning, here with Knott it seems the free play of the sign(s) is simply acquiesced to. It might be argued that by refusing to witness, Watt, from the premises of his own "conjecture", will cause the death of Knott. And indeed, it is this framework of witnessing the unwitnessable that Watt refuses when he departs the services of Knott: Watt suffered neither from the presence of Mr. Knott, nor from his absence. When he was with him, he was content to be with him, and when he was away from him, he was content to be away from him. Never with relief, never with regret, did he leave him at night, or in the morning come to him again...So that when the time came for Watt to depart, he walked to the gate with the utmost serenity. (Beckett 1988, 207) In my reading of Watt's (non)reading of Knott I am playing on two meanings of the word "witness". Watt is an imperfect "witness" in two senses. Although he does observe (witness) Knott, he eventually simply 157</page><page sequence="10">leaves the establishment, ceasing his witnessing of Knott (he being one of a long line of employee-witnesses). Second, by refusing to "tell" (witness) the full narrative of his experiences, Watt again fails in his witnessing. Watt's final comment on Knott thus is crucial and substantiates my idea that Watt's inability to make sense of Knott is at least in part a refusal to make a fully hermeneutic reading of him: Other traits, other little ways, little ways of passing the little days, Watt remarked in Mr. Knott, and could have told if he had wished, if he had not been tired, so very tired, by all he had told already, tired of adding, tired of subtracting to and from the same old things the same old things. (Beckett 1988, 212) Watt's expression here is similar to that expression (of "Beckett"?) in the Addenda to the novel: "The following precious and illuminating material should be carefully studied. Only fatigue and disgust prevented its incorporation" (Beckett 1988, 247). Fatigue and perhaps disgust prevent Watt from telling fully what he has observed of Knott. The point I wish to suggest here is partly a reaction against prevailing readings of Watt which see him fundamentally as passive victim, either of the mysterious process of Knott's order of things, or of his own mental incapacity. I want to posit that this text, if read carefully through hermeneutic lenses, suggests that Watt too plays a large role in his decline. I do not wish to suggest Beckett's condemnation of Watt (such extratextual musings seem almost perversely out of place) but only another avenue of making sense of Watt's encounter with Knott. Watt does not finally take responsibility for his own readings in the sense that he simply allows the free play of signifiers to take its toll. Watt's experience with Knott is thus one of continual bafflement and puzzlement. This bafflement produces in him a discursive reaction to Knott that speaks more to a desire to retreat from Knott than to understand him. Watt begins to speak in a kind of specialized language which, in my reading, accomplishes two things. Instead of "translating" Knott's discourse ? a discourse which perhaps is beyond Watt's understanding ? Watt turns himself discursively into an analogue of Knott by mirroring the linguistic confusion he hears in Knott's own language; Watt, in perceiving the utter non-self-coincidence of the Other (Knott), dismantles grammatical and syntactical logic, thereby dismantling the articulating self: 158</page><page sequence="11">Dis yb dis, nem owt. Yad la, tin fo trap. Skin, skin, skin. Od su did new taw? On. Taw ot klot knot? On. Tonk ot klat taw? On. Tonk ta kool taw? On. Taw ta kool tonk? Nilb, mun, mud. Tin fo trap, yad.

Niks, niks, niks. Part of nit, al day? Two men, sid by sid.) (Beckett 1988, 166) In our examination of Watt's specular discourse we have to consider the rhetorical effect of the exigencies of "translation" on the reader. In his essay "On the Problem of Self-Understanding" Gadamer notes that understanding can only occur when the discourse of the event/text is "translated" into the interpreter's own discourse. This is a moment initiated by what I have called "tracing": To understand a text is to understand oneself in a kind of dialogue. This contention is confirmed by the fact that the concrete dealing with the text yields understanding only when what is said in the text begins to find expression in the interpreter's own language...One must take up into himself what is said to him in such fashion that it speaks and finds an answer in the words of his own language. (Gadamer 1976, 57) Gadamer articulates here a sense of the constraints of the text upon the interpreter's understanding, an understanding that must initially concretize that text. Of interest to the reader of Beckett's Watt ? if one takes seriously Gadamer's proposition regarding understanding ? is the manner in which the text imposes and impresses itself upon its reader and thus attempts to forge a link, to use Levinas' terminology, between the same and the Other through acts of discourse (Levinas, Totality and Infinity). To understand this text, and specifically to understand Watt's increasingly strange language, is in some ways to be forced to "appropriate", to borrow from Paul Ricoeur's essay "Appropriation", a discourse, to put it plainly, that may resist understanding as it resists reason as the discourse of "madness" (the Other): we are in a very real sense constrained to understand something that may construct itself ex and ab nihilo. If one takes seriously the "meaning to be read" aspect of the aesthetic, however, a translation is inescapable, indeed obligatory: 159</page><page sequence="12">we are compelled by the exigencies of desire for understanding literally to translate Watt's discourse here (as I have done in the above quotation). We "speak" (appropriate) Watt as we translate, just as we speak Watt as we read the text in its entirety.3 These moments of heightened translation are crucial, however, precisely because we are here made fully conscious of this process of conferred appropriation. As we trace the complexities of Watt's discourse we begin to feel the full impact of the strangeness of his thought processes: it is here that Beckett succeeds most masterfully at violating and closing rapidly the discrete distance the reader has from this text: Watt as Other, or the Other's discourse, no longer functions as the alien, the Stranger (again to borrow from Levinas).4 And, of course, a final effect of this process of translation is our heightened awareness of Watt's own failure to translate Knott's discourse, to breach the Other: the reader is compelled to effect what Watt is entirely unable or unwilling to do. Watt's hermeneutic interaction with Knott and Knott's world raises the interpretive questions that will of necessity haunt the reader of the Beckett oeuvre: these are the questions of the limits and boundaries of interpretation. The relationship between Watt and Knott "translates" (as metaphor) into the reader's own interaction with the Beckett text. I do not wish to read Watt entirely as a hermeneutic cautionary tale, but Watt's reading and ultimate refusal of reading should alert the reader of Beckett to the specific problematics of interpretation as they arise in the dialogue or hermeneutical conversation with the Beckett text. Do we read the text allegorically: do we assert that this text really "is" about this or thai? Or do we assert that nothing can be asserted and place the text simply in endless free play? One of the things we notice about Watt's readings is that within them we inevitable hear echoes and see shimmers of modes of reading that have in fact been applied to this specific text, Beckett's Watt. Part of my understanding ? my metahermeneutic understanding ? of this text is that it posits itself, as a kind of allegory of reading, both as mirror and parody of the modes and means of its own decipherment: Beckett's well-known habit of inscribing the text's reading within its own discursive space is, I think, writ parodically large in Watt, and thus any one mode of reading the text, from allegory to a positing of semiotic free-play, is always already inscribed and to a degree neutered or threatened with redundancy. The result is, I think, a text that compels the reader away from asserting a specific hermeneutic even as it makes the reader complicit in the hermeneutic act. And it is finally the reader's task to acknowledge the "logic" of a contradictory, aporetic hermeneutic. Indeed, the text, by inscribing its own reading, collapses 160</page><page sequence="13">the hermeneutic distinction between Watt and the reader, who like Watt must sift through mediating layers of polysemy and who is "thrown" by Watt's estranging discourse into an awareness of this conscious process of reading: but it is finally precisely this awareness of reading that begins to demarcate the ontological gap between Watt and the reader, the reader who by effecting readings impossible for Watt, acts as a kind of specular hermeneutic "supplement", the supplement that works in the excesses of the semiotic void to articulate that void. Notes 1. Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics is important to an "affective" reading of Beckett precisely because it explicitly locates an historical, i.e., actual, reader within the reading dialectic. The historically affected reader is thus one who must engage both the text and the critical reception of the text in the hermeneutical "dialogue". Contrary to the understanding of some of Gadamer's detractors, this appeal to an historically located reader is not an appeal to any essentialist ("metaphysical") notion of autonomous subjectivity. Gadamer's theorizing the exigencies of reading-as-translation, his notions of the continually shifting responsibilities of the reader, his explicitly non metaphysical conception of the "ontology" of text, make it clear that Gadamer's hermeneutics is not a radical form of theological hermeneutics. For lucid and energetic explorations of Gadamer's place within the post structuralist debate on hermeneutics, I refer the reader to Gary Madison's essay "Beyond Seriousness and Frivolity: A Gadamerian Response to Deconstruction" and James Risser's "Reading the Text", both in Gadamer and Hermeneutics. 2. Indeed these are delicate questions that more often than not induce a kind of hermeneutic anxiety in the critic who, when confronted with the complex semiology of the novel, assuage that anxiety through allegorical readings. Thus Michael Robinson in The Long Sonata of the Dead frames Watt at once as a "rationalist" confronted by the void and as a humanized clown or Christ figure. In Abysmal Games in the Novels of Samuel Beckett Angela Moorjani reads the text in a more complex manner yet still allegorically: "thematically the novel's embedded games can be linked to a retrospective testing of the philosophical categories that through the ages have been applied to the human condition" (Moorjani 1982, 84). Moreover, the novel often reduces the critic top extremely local or discrete biographical or allegorical readings. Hence John P. Harrington's attempt to stabilize Watt through a reading of its Irish geography ("The Irish Landscape of Samuel Beckett's Watt"), Gottfried Biittner's imaginative reading of Watt as an extended interuterine fantasy (Samuel Beckett's Novel Watt), and Leslie Hill's emphasis on Knott as an elusive, elided farther-figure whose absence provokes the dispersal of meaning (Beckett's Fiction: In Different Words). 161</page><page sequence="14">3. I take B(eckett)'s proclamation in "Three Dialogues" that "there is nothing to express, nothing with which to express, nothing from which to express, no power to express, no desire to express, together with the obligation to express" (Beckett 1984, 139; my italics) as a starting point for a theorizing of the "obligation" to interpret. Expression ? an author's, a character's ? has as a necessary and ineluctable concomitant the interpretation of that expression by the reader of the text. Beckett peculiar power in Watt is to have thematized this obligation to a degree that perhaps parodies that very obligation. 4. I use the term "specular" to refer to that moment in reading Beckett in which the interpretive stance of reader is "mirrored" by that of a character or narrator. H. Porter Abbott and Hugh Kenner have done some important work in this area. The notion of specularity in Beckett is complicated by the decomposition of subjectivity and thus of the specular subject, i.e., that character which offers himself as mirror to the reader. How do we locate the specular subject in such a text as The Unnamable, in which the entire notion of subjectivity no longer obtains? Works Cited Abbott, H.
