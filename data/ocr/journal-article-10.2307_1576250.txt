<plain_text><page sequence="1">THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE Beyond the Interface: A Phenomenological Vie of Computer Systems Des Ivan Hyb .L JHuman-Computer Interaction" (HCI) is emerging as one of the most important factors in the de- sign of computer systems and the acceptance of computer technology by users. The abbreviation "HCI" sometimes also stands for "Human-Computer Interface." The double mean- ing of HCI is indicative of certain confused understandings of the problem posed by computer technology: the question of interaction is commonly seen as no more than a question of interface. Existing computer interfaces are usually based on the com- bination of keyboard and display. This form of interface is now recognized by most computer users and researchers as an obstacle to interacting with computer technology. Topics of research associated with the interface problem include ap- propriate keyboard and display ergonomics, the selection of an appropriate graphic-interface metaphor, implementation of new devices, and so on. Essentially, interface research is fo- cused on the arrangement of physical contact between hu- mans and the computer, as if the problem of interaction were simply a question of proximity and could be limited to the space occupied by the user and the computer. It is my contention here that the problem of human-com- puter interaction is much broader than the problem of the human-computer interface. It is the thesis of this article that the notion of "interaction" goes well beyond the physical in- terface, beyond the boundary between the user and the tech- nology. The question of interaction should include not only the "interface," but the entire technological device and its design, the context of the device and the user, human prac- tices involving such devices and, most of all, the understand- ing of technology by humans. To draw an analogy, consider a car's braking system. There may be a lag in the reaction of the car caused by a mechani- cal problem in the transmission of the braking action (push- ing the pedal) to the wheels. Or, to provide another example, the steering motion of a car could be inadequately trans- ferred to the road surface due to faulty tire suspension. In both situations, the inappropriate reaction of the car caused by problems out of the driver's reach would negate the effects of any "well-designed" driver-car interface, which would be understood in the limited sense relating to the physical prox- imity of the user and the machine. The notion of interaction must incorporate all aspects af- fecting user-machine relations. Interaction includes the entire (physical) machine, its fundamental design and especially the way humans relate to the technol- ogy. The relationship between hu- mans and technology cannot be considered only on the superficial level of the front end of the ma- chine, but must be considered on the much deeper level of how we understand technology. D.A. Norman has summarized the interaction problem from the user's perspective: ABSTRACT This article analyzes human- technology-world relations- namely, embodiment, hermeneutic and alterity relations-as a means of examining computer technology. Our understanding of computers and human-computer interaction is investigated in detail. In conclu- sion, the author indicates some flaws in current understanding of computer technology and of the technology's position within the hu- man-technology-world continuum. The real problem with the interface is that it is an interface. Interfaces get in the way. I don't want to focus my energies on an interface. I want to focus on my job. My tool should be just something that aids, something that does not get in the way, and above all, something that does not attract attention and energy to itself. When I use my computer, it is in order to get a job done: I don't want to think of myself as using a com- puter, I want to think of myself as doing my job [1]. In other words, the computer should be understood as a utensil that mediates our involvement in a task. Instead, com- puter technology (as it is currently designed) is obstructing and obscuring the purpose of our actions, that is, our involve- ment with the task at hand. To gain some insight into the human-computer interaction problem, I will outline the nature of the relationship between humans and technology in general (in terms of embodiment and hermeneutic relations), then explore the implications for computer technology. This opens a possibility that com- puter technology carries with it a number of fundamental problems, namely, the breakdown of embodiment relations and the subsequent breakdown of hermeneutic relations. The breakdown in these areas leads to an inappropriate un- derstanding of computers based on a perception of the tech- nology in anthropomorphic terms. This presents a major hin- drance in the establishment of valid relations between humans and computers. The alternative is an understanding of computer technology as a tool (in the sense presented by Heidegger and other phenomenologists), as part of the equipmental continuum between humans and the world.

According to the intentionality analysis formulated by Don Ihde, human-tech- nology-world relations include embodi- ment and hermeneutic relations [2]. The notion of embodiment deals with under- standing technology as an extension of intrinsic human dexterity, and can be explained thus: (Human - technology) -- world The parentheses in the description of embodiment relations indicate that tech- nology becomes not only an extension of the body, but an integral part of the self. That is, technology becomes transparent and the focus of perceptual experience is the world. In this way, technology me- diates our experience. Hermeneutic re- lations, on the other hand, involve the role of technology in understanding and interpreting the world: Human -&gt; (technology - world) The brackets in the expression of hermeneutic relations indicate the role of technology in the interpretation of the world through our naked, bodily ex- perience. Here the technology comes forth to become part of the world and the focus of the experience. There are thus two emergent positions in the hu- man-technology-world continuum: that of embodiment relations and that of hermeneutic relations. Both the embodiment and hermen- eutic positions are to be understood as occurring simultaneously and in paral- lel, being part of the same process of the involvement of humans in the world. If we consider the example of using binoculars, the relations would be (I - binoculars) -&gt; world and I-- (binoculars - world). In this instance, while in use, the bin- oculars form an indivisible part of our- selves: they seem to withdraw from our perception and our attention focuses on the subject of our observation. However, at the same time, the binoculars are also an instrument of interpretation of the observed world. Our perception of the world would be very different without the binoculars. The technology of optics brings forward notions that would be hidden if we were reduced to our naked understanding. Nevertheless, technology does not al- ways mediate our involvement with the world. Technology may become an ob- struction in human-technology-world relations by obscuring the world and imposing itself on humans as an au- tonomous entity. Such a situation is cap- tured in the following expression: Human -&gt; technology - (- world) This shows what Ihde calls alterity rela- tions [3], that is, ways of relating to tech- nology as we relate to other humans, other-selves or quasi-others. Alterity means the set of attributes that we inter- pret as human. In alterity relations, technology does not present a link with the world, but rather emerges as a quasi-human entity to which we relate, while the world re- mains in the background as the context. In this instance, we understand the tech- nology as a clearly separate object whose hermeneutic role has ceased to exist. We may use the example of binoculars again. This time, however, suppose the binoculars are defective in some way that makes observation difficult or impos- sible. In this case, the relation to the world (the focus of our involvement) is broken. The binoculars suddenly emerge as a dis-embodied object and we establish a relation with the object rather than with the world. The apparently "in- dependent" behavior of the technology causes us to understand it as an other Certainly there are many variations be- tween the extreme positions of under- standing the technology as totally em- bodied (as quasi-me) and totally separate (as quasi-other). Our purpose here is to examine a special type of technology in terms of the ideas outlined above-to fo- cus on the computer and human-com- puter-world relations. With this aim in mind, we will first investigate the notions of embodiment, hermeneutic and alterity relations in general. Embodiment An understanding of human-technology relations as one of human embodiment of technology allows us to analyze the na- ture of the relationship between hu- mans and objects. To explain the notion of embodiment, let us use the example of a prosthesis. Someone who has lost part of a limb and has had it replaced by a prosthesis (actually put in place of the limb) comes to experience the prosthe- sis as the limb and, ideally, would not perceive the device as separate from his or her body; it would "become" his or her limb. The spatial perception of such a prosthesis would closely correspond to the prior perception of the original limb, even if the prosthesis itself were not an extremely sophisticated device. The disabled person probably refers to the prosthesis, in any practical sense, as his or her "arm" or "leg." The technol- ogy (the prosthesis) has been embodied by its user. The question is whether it is possible to conclude that the same process occurs with objects external to the body, i.e. whether they can be considered prosthe- ses of human abilities. It seems that the notion of embodiment has always been a part of the tacit understanding of people involved in the design of technology. For example, Morgantini writes about the nature of artificial objects: For many centuries, or millennia, man has been making prostheses of the limbs, such as knives, spades, bows and arrows, shelter and clothing, buildings for defense in general, machines for writing, automobiles, and aeromobiles; he therefore cuts more easily, digs, sews, changes places more rapidly and kills from afar [4]. The objects described here as "pros- theses of the limbs" are described as be- longing to the first generation of tech- nologies created by humans. The second generation includes "prostheses of senses. Helped by a more sophisticated technology he has built telephones, tele- vision sets, and machines to reproduce images and sounds" [5]. After the sec- ond generation arrives the third one, the one we face now: "The third generation of objects, the most recent and disquiet- ing, marks the still nebulous and equivo- cal encounter between human and sili- con intelligence" [6]. Indeed, the technologies belonging to this third generation are seen as "prostheses of the mind." Electronic cal- culators, control and regulating devices and computers all belong to this group. The notion of "prostheses of the mind" presents a problem, however, because embodiment relations with this type of technology may be questionable. The notion of technology as prosthesis is still only an approximation of the no- tion of embodiment, that is, of technol- ogy as an integral part of the body. Let us investigate the fundamental nature of embodiment relations. Heidegger dis- cusses objects as equipment. Giving the example of a hammer, he writes: Equipment can genuinely show itself only in dealings cut to its own measure (hammering with a hammer, for ex- 216 Hybs, Beyond the Interface</page><page sequence="3">ample); but in such dealings an entity of this kind is not grasped thematically as an occurring Thing, nor is the equipment structure known as such even in the using. The hammering does not simply have knowledge about the hammer's character as equipment, but it has appropriated this equipment in a way which could not possibly be more suitable. In dealings such as this, where something is put to use, our con- cern subordinates itself to the "in-or- der-to" which is constitutive for the equipment we are employing at the time; the less we just stare at the ham- mer, and more we seize hold of it and use it, the more primordial does our relationship to it become, and the more unveiledly it is encountered as that which it is-as equipment [7]. Our understanding of objects, or equipment, is thus related to practices involving such an object (that is, being "in-order-to," being "ready-to-hand" for a task), rather than its structure, form or appearance. In other words, the overrid- ing notion is that of the task being un- dertaken. Heidegger explains this nature of the primordial (basic) relationship to equip- ment as the "withdrawal" of equipment in use: The ready-to-hand is not grasped theo- retically at all, nor is it itself the sort of thing that circumspection takes proxi- mally as a circumspective theme. The peculiarity of what is proximally ready- to-hand is that, in its readiness-to-hand, it must, as it were, withdraw in order to be ready-to-hand quite authentically. That with which our everyday dealings proximally dwell is not the tools them- selves. On the contrary, that with which we concern ourselves primarily is the work-that which is to be produced at the time; and this is accordingly ready- to-hand, too [8]. By the "withdrawal" of equipment Heidegger refers to the phenomenon of perception of tools at use, which become transparent-that is, as if not perceived at all-unless they are faulty, damaged or do not function as expected [9]. The fo- cus of attention is the task we perform and not the equipment we use. In a way, the equipment can be regarded as an ex- tension of the body and our understand- ing of it is the same as the understanding of the body. The hammer withdraws and is comprehended in the same way as the hand holding it is. In other words, the hammer and the hand become one; the hammer becomes an extension of the body. Merleau-Ponty describes a similar situ- ation: A woman may, without any calculation, keep a safe distance between the feather in her hat and things which might break it off. She feels where the feather is just as we feel where our hand is. If I am in the habit of driving a car, I enter a narrow opening and see that I can "get through" without com- paring the width of the opening with that of the wings, just as I go through a doorway without checking the width of the doorway against that of my body. The hat and the car cease to be objects with a size and volume which is estab- lished by comparison with other ob- jects .... The blind man's stick has ceased to be an object for him, and is no longer perceived for itself; its point becomes an area of sensitivity, extend- ing the scope and radius of touch, and providing a parallel to sight [10]. The feathered hat, the car and the stick in the examples presented by Merleau-Ponty are withdrawn from the focus of the person's attention. The us- ers of these objects are concerned with the task of continuing along their path rather than of being conscious of the objects that they use. Merleau-Ponty describes the nature of the relationship between a person and the objects used by that person in order to complete a task-the objects and their user being mutually transplanted: "To get used to a hat, a car or a stick is to be transplanted into them, or con- versely, to incorporate them into the bulk of our own body" [11]. The word "transplantation" indeed describes the process of embodiment of objects by their users. The embodied objects-the hammer, the hat, the car or the stick-are understood as indivis- ible parts of our body. The naked body's perception is adjusted to incor- porate the objects. This seems to be quite clear in cases of objects directly connected to our bodies, such as clothes, shoes, hand tools and the like. Would it also be possible to understand in this way objects not physically con- nected to human bodies? Let us examine the situation of two tennis players playing a game. In this situation, there is more involved than the naked players dressed in tennis clothes, wearing tennis shoes and hold- ing racquets. Each player's situation also includes the ball, the net, the court and the opponent (not to mention the wider surroundings of the court). The players handle their racquets as skill- fully as they use their own hands. They move around on the soles of their shoes with the same ease that they would have in bare feet-in fact, they probably move more easily because of the prop- erties of the shoes. They watch the ball moving back and forth and are able to play it without any need to calculate the complex trajectories it may follow. They are able to hit the ball with the same precision they would have in touching the tips of their noses with their index fingers. They have a precise "feel" for the size of the court, the obstacle of the net and their positions within this space. It could be argued that the ten- nis players have not only embodied their clothes, shoes and racquets, but also the ball, the net and the court, all of which are included in their bodily perception. The nature of the process of embodi- ment is a matter of forming a habit or "getting used to" a particular object and a kind of manipulation of it. Again, ac- cording to Merleau-Ponty, "habit ex- presses our power of dilating our being- in-the-world, or changing our existence by appropriating fresh instruments" [12]. Merleau-Ponty goes on to explain that the character of the habit of using and manipulating external objects is not any different than the habit of using and manipulating our own bodies: This power of habit is no different from the general one which we exercise over our body: if I am ordered to touch my ear or my knee, I move my hand to my ear or my knee by the shortest route, without having to think of the initial po- sition of my hand, or that of my ear, or the path between them [13]. The concept of embodiment of exter- nal objects is essential to our relation- ship with technology and it is a prerequi- site for the hermeneutic role of technology. Hermeneutic Relations At first glance it may appear that the use of technology simply changes the scale and detail of our understanding of the world. For example, using optical instru- ments such as binoculars or microscopes gives us an opportunity to observe situa- tions that are not accessible to vision without magnification. However, technology not only ampli- fies our "naked" capabilities, it allows us to form a different understanding of the world. Again, with binoculars we may experience something that would be im- possible to experience without them (by simply approaching and looking through the naked eye). The hammer and the practice of hammering allow us to understand the nature of nails and timber in a way that we cannot under different circumstances. Hybs, Beyond the Interface 217</page><page sequence="4">Yet, hermeneutic relations with tech- nology have an even more fundamental significance. Not only can human abili- ties be enhanced and a better under- standing be mediated through technol- ogy, but the essence of technology is, in my view, the revealing of the world. In his essay "The Question Concerning Technology," Heidegger writes: "Tech- nology is therefore no mere means. Technology is a way of revealing. If we give heed to this, then another realm for the essence of technology will open it- self to us. It is the realm of revealing, i.e., of truth" [14]. The "way of revealing" is given by the possibilities and practices involving tech- nology. Heidegger explains by using an example of a dam on the Rhine river: The hydroelectric plant is set into the current of the Rhine. It sets the Rhine to supplying its hydraulic pressure, which then sets the turbines turning. This turning sets those machines in motion whose thrust sets going the electric current for which the long dis- tance power station and its network of cables are set up to dispatch electricity. In the context of interlocking pro- cesses pertaining to the orderly dispo- sition of electrical energy, even the Rhine itself appears to be something at our command. The hydroelectric plant is not built into the Rhine River as was the old wooden bridge that joined bank with bank for hundreds of years. Rather the river is dammed up into the power plant. What the river is now, namely, a water-power supplier, derives from the essence of the power station [15]. Our hermeneutic relations with tech- nology allow us to inscribe the world with metaphor: that is, technology deter- mines our understanding of the world (as all understanding is metaphoric). In the example here, the river is not only (and perhaps no longer) seen as a mere part of the landscape, a home for fish, a food resource or possibly a transport route. A whole new notion (which could not be seen before) is created by the ex- istence of the technology: the river is re- vealed as a power supply. While technology mediates our un- derstanding and interpretation of the world, it also determines the interpreta- tion of the human position within the world and, as such, becomes a means of belonging to the world. This situation is possible due to the existence of embodi- ment and hermeneutic relations. These relations, however, may be incomplete or entirely broken. In such instances, alterity relations come into play. Alterity Relations: Breakdown in Embodiment and Hermeneutic Relations Coming back to the example of the hammer, we see that it lends itself easily to embodiment. It appears to withdraw while we attend to the task at hand, and after we use it, it blends back into the surroundings. Our understanding of the hammer is determined by shared and well-rehearsed practices related to ham- mering. There is no problem and no need to concern ourselves with the ham- mer or the practice of hammering. What happens when the hammer is not a usual hammer, but a hammer with a fault, a hammer that has broken down? Heidegger describes such a situa- tion as follows: When we concern ourselves with some- thing, the entities which are most closely ready-to-hand may be met as something unusable, not properly adapted for the use we decided upon. The tool turns out to be damaged, or the material unsuitable. In each of these cases equipment is here, ready-to- hand. We discover its unusability, how- ever, not by looking at it and establish- ing its properties, but rather by the circumspection of the dealings in which we use it. When its unusability is thus discovered, equipment becomes conspicuous. ... In our concernful dealings, however, we not only come up against unusable things within what is ready-to-hand already: we also find things which are missing-which not only are not "handy" but are not "to hand" at all. Again to miss something in this way amounts to coming across something un-ready-to-hand. When we notice what is un-ready-to-hand, that which is ready-to-hand enters the mode of obtrusiveness [16]. This "obtrusiveness" is characterized by quirky behavior, by something for- eign to established practices, something requiring change of use, something de- fying our experiences and expectations. Because of what we interpret as their flawed behavior (which may appear to be random), such objects remain obtru- sive during use and are not embodied by the user. In Heideggerian terms, they become "present-at-hand." The conse- quence of this situation is the inability to attend to the task in the usual way. A question arises as to how we relate to objects that become obtrusive and distance us from our tasks. Precisely be- cause of their obtrusiveness, such ob- jects may be perceived as similar to other human beings with whom we are involved. Other-selves, or other human beings, likewise have quirky behavior. They follow their own will and therefore do not always conform to established shared practices and our expectations. We cannot use them unless we achieve their consent, and even if we do, we may encounter some resistance. Other hu- man beings, because of their acting at will, behave against our expectations. Objects understood in this way display an illusion of "acting at will," defying our intentions and the purposes we want to impose on them. Our interpretation of such objects becomes more or less anthropomorphic. Clearly, simple objects such as a ham- mer are not likely to break down or cause an interruption of our usual modes of operation. The possibility of failure grows as the complexity of construction or use increases. An automobile, a televi- sion set or tape recorder, a microwave oven, a chemical processing plant or a sophisticated passenger plane may occa- sionally show (sometimes with tragic con- sequences) a "will of its own," an aberra- tion in expected modes of operation. Complex technology is often perceived in anthropomorphic terms as having a tendency to resist and "talk back." The reasons for this obtrusiveness of complex technological objects may lie in defects in their complex structure, but more often the reasons lie in their intri- cate and enigmatic interactions with their users. These involve interfaces that do not lend themselves to embodiment and practices of use that are immediate and engaging. Let us consider again the following expression of alterity relations, or hu- man-technology-world relations in which the mode of interpretation of technology is as a quasi-other: Human -- technology - ( - world) The connection to the world is broken and the world is relegated to a kind of background presence in this relation- ship. The relation excludes the world and the technology comes to be under- stood in anthropomorphic, quasi-hu- man terms. Indeed, the situation has been caused by the breakdown of em- bodiment and, subsequently, of her- meneutic relations. RELATIONS INVOLVING COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY Computers are designed as all-purpose devices that should offer unprecedented utility and flexibility. Yet, they do not 218 Hybs, Beyond the Interface</page><page sequence="5">seem to lend themselves to easy embodi- ment in the way that other equipment does. Computers appear to be machines of an exceptional level of obtrusiveness, and so far it has been difficult for people to establish simple embodiment relations with them. Computers have undoubtedly en- larged the scope of human practices and changed our understanding of the world in many ways. Persistent problems with the technology, however, warrant questions about the appropriateness of basic computer conception and design, as well as the position assumed by com- puters within the human technological landscape. The difficulty seems to stem from what we perceive as the computer's inability to be "ready-to-hand" and to "withdraw." In other words, the com- puter is continuously "present-at-hand" in the Heideggerian sense. This is the situation that some researchers call the "perversity of computers" [ 17]. Embodiment and Computers Embodiment relations involving com- puters are difficult and awkward for the following interrelated reasons: (1) the existence of (and need for) a computer- human interface, (2) the complexity of the technology and (3) the need for programming. For these reasons, the possibility of an effective human-com- puter-world relation (as defined here) is doubtful. The Human-Computer Interface. The question of the human-computer inter- face is the first problem. As Donald A. Norman points out, We have adapted a general-purpose technology to very specialized tasks while still using general tools. Key- boards, simple pointing devices and video displays are not the most appro- priate ways to interact with many of the tasks we do today, but they are all the computer provides [18]. The current interface is the product of an early phase in the evolution of computer technology. The use of elec- tric teletype and typewriters as operator interfaces was a logical choice by pio- neers of computing. The first comput- ing devices were essentially experimen- tal scientific and engineering contraptions, and their parts had to be easily obtainable and replaceable. Hence, electric typewriters were used primarily for their immediate availability through sponsoring organizations. The attention of early computer technology developers was focused on resolving fun- damental problems of electronic calcu- lation rather than on the usability and practicality of the machines. As a consequence, computers re- mained, in fact, laboratory prototypes long after they found their way into the commercial environment. Computer systems were designed and made to or- der according to customer specifications and assembled as unique configura- tions. Until quite recently, only specially trained operators and programmers were able to operate computers. All other users would have to submit their work to this special group. There was no pressure on manufacturers to adapt and rearrange the user-computer interface in any way, since only a limited number of highly trained specialists were initi- ated into the esoteric ways of computer operation. The typewriter [19] has re- mained the essential model for com- puter operation up until the present time, appearing recently in the guise of video display units and detachable key- boards [20]. The typewriter-based de- vice, perhaps adequate for the task of computer operation, is in most applica- tions (such as computer-aided drafting, graphics or design) grossly unsuitable for the task at hand. Furthermore, the real problem is that a "computer interface" should be needed at all. The "interface" with other technolo- gies has a different character. With com- puters there is a dichotomy of purpose for the interface: the interface is needed to handle the operation of the computer it- self, while it is also supposed to allow us to be involved in our task. Compare a pencil with a computer used as a drawing instru- ment. To achieve the same result (a drawn line), all we have to do with the pencil is pick it up and draw, while the computer requires that we complete several steps (and in an awkward and indirect way). The pencil does not have an "interface." Its use is direct and immediate. The pen- cil "withdraws," leaving the user to engage in the task of drawing. Finally, the generality of purpose of the human-computer interface (as well as the generality of purpose of the com- puter itself) is a major obstacle in the es- tablishment of embodiment relations. Dealing with a tool (an "extension of the body") that changes its behavior in time and requires a reinterpretation accord- ing to its immediate use presents a seri- ous problem. Complexity. The second question, that of the complexity of the technology, pre- sents another set of problems for em- bodiment relations. A complete under- standing of the complexity of computer systems is beyond the grasp of any indi- vidual user. The increased level of the unpredictability of responses stemming from high complexity makes it difficult to establish embodiment relations with computer systems. This difficulty be- comes especially prominent when com- puters are interconnected through net- works, which leads to the compounding of difficulties related to individual sys- tems and introduces the problem of deal- ing with remote parts of the network. Another factor contributing to the breakdown of embodiment relations with computer technology is reliability, which becomes more difficult to maintain as the level of complexity grows [21]. The workings of computer systems re- main beyond the full understanding of even highly trained computer specialists. The level of complexity seems to have reached such a degree that computer pro- fessionals are becoming more and more specialized and would find it difficult to gain solid expertise in areas beyond their own. Hardware professionals would prob- ably find it difficult to understand the in- tricacies and interrelatedness of the vari- ety of operating and application software systems, while software specialists could only have a vague idea of the computer functions on the physical level. The ques- tion is where this leaves ordinary users who are supposed to use computers as simple and transparent tools. Programming. The last problem in es- tablishing embodiment relations is pro- grammability and the practice of pro- gramming computers. All computers must be programmed to accomplish a task. Programming is unavoidable on ev- ery level of computer operation. The problem is summarized by Norman: The generality of the machine means we must "set it up" specially for each task, with the set-up changing each time the task changes, or the hardware changes, or something else happens. But I never have to set up my special- ized tools: they come set up, and they stay that way [22]. Hence, in contrast to specialized tools, a universal tool (the computer) requires instructions to perform any- thing at all. The actions involving such a device are mediated by instructions, that Hybs, Beyond the Interface 219</page><page sequence="6">is, by programming. In its most rudi- mentary form the instructions are repre- sented by the act of "setting up." Just as we do not program our special- ized tools, we do not program our bod- ies to perform an action. Programming of computers is in direct contradiction to our bodily experiences. We do not program our bodies to walk or to grab an apple and eat it; we do not program our hands, eyes and other body parts in order to perform the task of hammer- ing. Tools that lend themselves to em- bodiment do not need any program- ming. The need for programming constitutes a serious hindrance in the establishment of embodiment relations with the equipment we use. It is the cause of a time lag between our (bodily) action and its effect. The continuous need for programming prevents us from perceiving the computer as withdrawing and allowing us to focus on our task. Moreover, there seems to be a conflict between the directness of bodily experi- ence and programming (of computers and other machines) that leads to a dis- ruption of embodiment relations and the development of alterity relations instead. The act of programming is reminiscent of passing instructions to another person in order to delegate a task. As a conse- quence, computers are seen as agents performing on our behalf, as quasi-oth- ers in the anthropomorphic sense. It may seem that advanced software packages are designed in such a way that they do not need any programming and are therefore "user friendly." There are two objections to this argument. First, any program must be installed. Installa- tion itself is an act of programming. Sec- ond, the "user interface" constitutes yet another level of programming above the existing programming language. For ex- ample, the metaphorical "desktop" used by many interface systems (e.g., Xerox STAR, Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows) as a means of operating per- sonal computers still requires the user to point and choose from options menu, even to complete the most banal opera- tion. This process, of course, also repre- sents a programming action in its most rudimentary form. Hermeneutic Relations Involving Computers The embodiment of an object and that object's consequent withdrawal allow humans to interpret the world from a new, technology-mediated perspective. A breakdown of embodiment relations causes the object to become obtrusive and effectively block or disturb our rela- tion to the world. To draw an analogy, let us consider the example of the bin- oculars. In this instance, suppose the binoculars are poorly designed: they are ill-fitting, heavy or require special han- dling. Although their function might be (technically) intact, embodiment rela- tions would be affected and our powers of observation and understanding di- minished. The reasons for the break- down of embodiment relations with computers, namely the problems stem- ming from the human-computer inter- face, the complexity of computers and the need for programming, were dis- cussed earlier. As attempts to establish embodiment relations with computers are disrupted for reasons inherent in the computer technology, hermeneutic relations are also affected. Nonetheless, hermeneutic relations can be altered even when embodiment relations have not been affected at all. Let us use the example of the binoculars once more. This time, the binoculars are a perfect device without any embodi- ment problems whatsoever. Yet, the lenses show a peculiar distortion. Or, in an extreme case, the view they offer has been substituted by an image. A situa- tion may arise in which we interpret what we see as "the world" while, in fact, we are observing a simulation or a dis- tortion. In this case, the world is not present in the relation and has been substituted by a virtual world. It is this virtuality that deforms hermeneutic rela- tions by misconstructing the world. By misconstruction we should understand not only a blatant mis-presentation or substitution of the world, but also a me- diated and incomplete (and therefore impoverished) presentation. In both situations, we may be led to interpret the virtual as the true and complete re- flection of reality. Similarly, computers do not mediate our liaison with the world directly. Rather, they allow us to contact com- puter "data storage," where data are sup- posedly "true" representations of reality. In fact, data in data storage are just enti- ties planted there and affected by the act of programming. Let us apply Ihde's descriptions of embodiment and hermeneutic relations to computer technology. Embodiment and hermeneutic relations with comput- ers are different than others in that they include a link to a virtual world. We can express the embodiment relations as (Human - computer) -- virtual world; the hermeneutic relations as Human -* (computer - virtual world). To complete the set we must include a description of the relationship between the virtual world and the real world: world -&gt; simulation -4 virtual world Computer technology is promoted as a tool, yet it contradicts our practice with other tools that directly mediate our ex- perience of the world. Hermeneutic re- lations with computers are deformed by the nature of the computer technology, and not only as a result of the disruption of embodiment relations. Alterity Relations: The Anthropomorphism of Computers As a result of broken embodiment and hermeneutic relations, our relations with computers are showing a propen- sity for strong and complicated forms of alterity. Alterity relations emerge when equipment becomes "present-at-hand" [23], that is, when the objects we use be- come the focus of attention. The series of brackets in the following description exemplifies the tacit "background" pres- ence of the world, while the primary re- lation appears between the human and the computer: Human -&gt; computer - ( - virtual world) - {( - world)} These exceptional alterity relations lead to anthropomorphic perceptions of the technology, that is, to an under- standing of computers as quasi-others. The nature of these alterity relations is based on an understanding of an object as an "autonomous being" having a "will" or "life" of its own. As Ihde puts it, "there is the sense of interacting with something else than me" [24]. Alterity relations may take on differ- ent appearances. The behavior of com- puters can be interpreted as that of "dis- obedience." In some situations the computer may be understood as a tech- nological "competitor" or "collabora- tor," or it may be seen merely as a fasci- nating object displaying apparently "independent" behavior. However, the perception of comput- 220 Hybs, Beyond the Interface</page><page sequence="7">ers as quasi-others is also a result of both the practice of instructing and the need to instruct the machine to execute com- plex sequences of operations while the user who instructs remains unable to in- tervene in the process or understand the inner workings of the device during the execution. Due to the multilayered nature of computer software, the major- ity of the internal functioning of the computer is hidden from its operators. Lengthy sequences of hierarchically or- ganized program instructions with con- ditional jumps and branchings of execu- tion according to changing conditions lead to frequent surprises about the pro- gram-run outcome. The situation is akin to asking another human being to per- form an activity on our behalf: it may seem that the computer somehow acted "on its own." Finally, yet another factor contribut- ing to computer alterity relations is problematic hermeneutic relations. The virtuality inherent in (pre-programmed) computer simulations causes the per- ception of seemingly intelligent behav- ior on the part of computers. According to Ihde, the effect of this situation may be an interpretation of reality based on the computer's mode of presentation, which resembles the reactions of an- other human being: Alterity relations may be noted to emerge in a wide range of computer technologies that, while failing quite strongly to mimic bodily incarnations, nevertheless display a quasi-otherness within the limits of linguistics and, more particularly, of logical behaviors [25]. The effects that alterity relations are having on computer technology and its role within the human-technology-world continuum are difficult to assess at this stage. However, one potentially harmful impact of alterity relations is a possible loss of the benefits of computer technol- ogy (the computer as tool, as equip- ment) once the understanding of the computer as technology shifts to an un- derstanding of the computer as "other." Ihde notes that The computer is one of the stronger examples of a technology which may be positioned within alterity relations. But its otherness remains a quasi-other- ness, and its genuine usefulness still belongs to the borders of its hermen- eutic capacities. Yet in spite of this, the tendency to fantasize its quasi-other- ness into an authentic otherness is per- vasive.... Were the technofact to be genuinely an other, it would both be and not be a technology [26]. Computer Past-Computer Future? The prevailing understanding of the computer is based on the "mainframe" metaphor of a computer as a centralized, general-purpose resource [27]. The ma- chine is configured around the central processor, whose use is granted in turns to users competing for the resource through individual interfaces (such as keyboards, displays, pointing devices and graphic input devices). The system is completed by storage devices, a central- ized file server and output devices (print- ers, plotters, etc.) shared by all users. This configuration has its roots in the early experimental days of computing and has not changed much over the years. It also epitomizes the problems posed by the defective embodiment and hermeneutic relations and emerging alterity relations discussed earlier. The development of computers was driven by technical considerations and advances, while little thought was di- rected toward understanding the posi- tion of this technology within the hu- man-technology-world continuum. The implicit problems were perceived, but not clearly recognized and identified. They became increasingly discernible with the increased number of computer users, notably after the introduction of personal computers. It became impera- tive to ameliorate the way computers were operated. The initial way to operate the com- puter was to type a series of obscure commands and receive equally obscure computer feedback. Although this situa- tion suited the exclusive group of com- puter professionals, it was largely unac- ceptable to the broader group of users. With the advent of personal computing, in order to increase market penetration, manufacturers searched for improve- ments in the usability of computers for the wider public. Initially developed by Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) and mass-popularized by the Apple computer, the metaphor of the "desktop" was intended to make com- puters more "friendly" (note the anthro- pomorphic notion here) and easier to use. The change consisted primarily of the transformation of typed instructions to graphic symbols and "menus" requir- ing only a point-and-choose action by the user. This interface was an undeni- able success and allowed access to com- puter technology by many people who would not have used it otherwise. Unfor- tunately, the desktop metaphor was not without problems and certainly is still far removed from the ideal of effective embodiment relations presented here. The perception of awkwardness re- mained a main feature of computer op- eration. In order to improve the situation, computer developers aimed for a more direct type of interface resulting in the so-called "pen-based systems" recently introduced (as overviewed by Evans [28]). Metaphors such as "electronic ink" and "smart paper," among others, are now being put forward. A pen-based form of operation supposedly eliminates the indirectness of the mouse action, al- lowing handwritten input and thereby removing the need for the keyboard and changing the computer interface into a kind of a "writing tablet." The pen-based systems resulted in a new generation of computing device, the "digital personal assistant." Apple's widely publicized "Newton" and other gadgets of a similar type are examples of such devices. Here computer technol- ogy ceases to pretend to be "a tool" and becomes "an assistant." The anthropo- morphic understanding of technology is no longer tacit, but advertised. Another significant proposal is the concept of "ubiquitous computing" [29]. Proponents of this idea would have most computer hardware "disap- pear" from the user's sight, leaving only an interface device (pen-based, presum- ably) in direct contact with the user. In addition, users would have unlimited (wireless) communication with all parts of the system at their disposal. Providing the technical problems will be resolved, this development certainly enhances the possibility of improvement in relations between the computer and its user. Advances in computer technology can also be seen as limited to the continuing miniaturization and improvement of hardware parameters and the decrease of relative cost through advances in manufacturing, while the concept and the understanding of the technology re- main unchanged. This trend has been evident since the beginning of electronic computing. The relative size of proces- sor and storage hardware is shrinking, leaving the human-computer interface as the more significant and, finally, the only part of the overall system visible to the user. The miniaturization of elec- tronic components has allowed a consid- erable increase in computer capacity Hybs, Beyond the Interface 221</page><page sequence="8">and drastic reduction in size. This devel- opment resulted in the emergence of personal computing, which supposedly democratized computing and put com- puter power at everyone's fingertips. In reality, allowing multitudes of people to experience this "revolution" meant fur- ther entrenchment of the mainframe metaphor, an ever-widening spread of flawed design and a reinforcement of the perception of computing as an eso- teric and privileged activity. Millions of people had a first-hand opportunity to experience computer obtrusiveness. Unfortunately, in spite of the tech- nology's development, the essential problems inherent in computers and in the discipline of computing seem unre- solved. Broken embodiment and her- meneutic relations have resulted in strong alterity relations between humans and computers, effectively hindering the user's engagement in the task at hand. The solution to the question is still seen in terms of performance improvements that remain within existing computer de- sign, while little attention is paid to the understanding of the computer's place within human activities and the rel- evance of the fundamental design of the computer. A new understanding should go well beyond the interface and our es- tablished concept of the computer. From Computing to the Task The concept of the computer as it stands at present-that of a general pur- pose machine-may be of limited poten- tial. It is my view that humans do not need a general piece of equipment al- lowing for the performance of a broad range of different tasks. I believe that our actions, optimally, are direct and specific, and that in order to execute such actions we need specific tools that we can adopt as extensions of our bod- ies. We need tools that do not obscure the task at hand by their own apparent "behavior." We need to relate to the world directly and with immediacy, as we would if we were equipped with no more than our (naked) dexterity. Computer technology, because of its fundamental design, is probably incapable of with- drawing (in the Heideggerian sense) and letting us concern ourselves with our tasks with immediacy. Technology fosters human capabili- ties as extensions of bodies and is a tool for hermeneutic understanding at the same time. Computers, thanks to their fundamental conceptual design, suffer a breakdown in embodiment relations and apparently fail the hermeneutic role of technology as well. Mediating be- tween human beings and the virtuality of representations, computers do not di- rectly reveal the world to us, but disclose predetermined simulations. They do not offer us the comfort of immersing our- selves in our activity, but stand between us and our tasks. It is not the task at hand we attend to, it is computing. As a result, computers evoke (potentially harmful) anthropomorphic notions of quasi-otherness. The present design of computers seems to suit only a narrow audience of specialists in various fields, who, while pursuing their specific goals, do not per- ceive the awkwardness of computer use as a major obstacle. As long as the exist- ing concept of the computer remains unchanged, the utility of computer tech- nology to the wider public appears ques- tionable, despite efforts to ameliorate the situation through incremental im- provements. An appropriate use of computer tech- nology as equipment within our prac- tices would require a fundamental re- thinking of the essential understanding of computers and their design. We should examine the possibilities of radi- cally different metaphors for human in- volvement with this technology. It does not seem likely that the existing notion of computers as universal devices can be reconciled with the notion of tools (ready at hand for a task) and with basic conditions of human practices. The mo- tivation in human practices is the task, not the operation of equipment; the motivation for the use of computers is not computing itself. In most situations, computers should vanish as stand-alone devices of a generalist nature. Instead, they should move into other equipment. They should cease to exist as ends and become means; that is, the computer machinery should perish as a general- purpose device and become a general- purpose element of more specialized tools. Perhaps only then may we return from computing to our immediate task at hand.

Since the human-computer interface is still pre- dominantly typewriter-based, in the best traditions of the first experimental computing machinery, it is interesting to investigate the origins of typewriters as well. The first usable typewriter was constructed by an American inventor, Christopher Latham Sholes, in 1868. He made an agreement with E. Remington and Sons, gunsmiths, of Ilion, New York, to manufacture the first 1,000 of the ma- chines. The first typewriters were placed on the market in 1874. The Sholes typewriter offered a feasible solution to the problem of the keyboard. All previous attempts to build a typewriter failed, principally due to cumbersome keyboards-mostly reminiscent of the piano-and other awkward ar- rangements. Sholes first organized his keyboard in alphabetical order, but found very quickly that the mechanism had a tendency to jam when the typist reached a speed exceeding even a very slow pace. After extensive experimentation, Sholes arrived at a solution: the letters were configured in an ar- rangement that made for the most laborious typing possible in order to slow the typist down, thus pre- venting the mechanism from jamming. Promotions for the new keyboard stated that it had been de- 222 Hybs, Beyond the Interface</page><page sequence="9">signed according to scientific research and would increase speed and efficiency. This, of course, con- stituted what may be one of the biggest confidence tricks in the history of design. Yet, this notorious "QWERTY" keyboard arrangement is still surviving virtually unchanged. See B. Bliven, The Wonderful Writing Machine (New York: Random House, 1954). 20. It is interesting to note that, although the tech- nology was available for some time and video dis- plays were used in very early computer develop- ments, keyboards remained attached to the video display to form a "quasi-typewriter." It was only a quite recent "discovery" that the keyboard does not have to be attached to the display. 21. The questionable reliability of the computer is not only a matter of its being prone to total break- downs, but also stems from other "minor" prob- lems, such as variable response times and inconsis- tencies in the execution of software programs. 22.
