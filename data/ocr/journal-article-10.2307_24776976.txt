<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Smallest World Theatre By Benjamin Bennett 1. We shall be concerned in the following with two things, a poem and a technique of interpretation. The latter, for which we claim no originality, involves nothing more than the consistent application to the poem of the question: not only, what does a word or phrase mean? but what does it mean that the particular word or phrase is spoken? What specific change is brought about in the basic poetic situation by the utterance of each distinct step in the poem's development? This type of question is perfectly normal in the interpretation of drama where the idea of "poetic situation" is usually not at all unclear, since the poetic situation is imaged in something like a real situation on the stage. But in the case of lyric poetry matters tend not</page><page sequence="2">54 The Smallest World Theatre to be so simple. The poet can, if he wishes, describe very clearly the situa tion in which he imagines himself, and if the speaking persona is also clearly defined, then we are sometimes able to read a lyric poem as though it were a small play. What we shall attempt to do in the present essay is show that essentially this technique of reading is rather more widely applicable than one would ordinarily suppose. With regard to the particular poet we have in mind, Hugo von Hof mannsthal, our point will be that even in the early lyrics, the guiding genius is essentially dramatic in character, and that this applies not only to the persona-poems and little dramas classified as "Gestalten" in the 1911 edi tion,1 and not only to those of the "Gedichte" in which, by means of am biguity, mood-evocation and musical effects, a distinct sense of kinesis is produced, but even to what is probably the most direct and lapidary of Hofmannsthal's lyric utterances, if also, precisely for this reason, an obscure one, the little poem entitled REISELIED Wasser stürzt, uns zu verschlingen, Rollt der Fels, uns zu erschlagen, Kommen schon auf starken Schwingen Vögel her, uns fortzutragen. Aber unten liegt ein Land, Früchte spiegelnd ohne Ende In den alterslosen Seen. Marmorstirn und Brunnenrand Steigt aus blumigem Gelände, Und die leichten Winde wehn.2 Our point, as suggested by our title, will be that this poem is in reality a miniature teatro del mundo. What disturbs us first of all, however, is that the sense of peril evoked in the opening lines is not satisfactorily explained. There is a suggestion, as at the end of Mignon's song in Wilhelm Meister, of rough, mountainous ter rain,3 but no really visualizable scene or action is presented. It is perhaps possible for the sight of a boiling mountain stream to awaken in us momen tarily a sense of the precariousness of our own existence, but this is not sufficient to justify the locution "uns zu verschlingen." In "Mignon," we must recall, the images of "Drachen," "Fels" and "Flut" are preceded by two 1Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Die Gedichte und kleinen Dramen (Leipzig, 1911). 2The text is from Hofmannsthal, Gedichte und lyrische Dramen, ed.

The sense of danger is thus here felt to arise from the actual situation, and this is not the case in Hofmannsthal's first line for which no scene whatever has been set. In fact, if we desire a parallel in Goethe, I think it makes at least as much sense to recall the famous image: Der Wassersturz, das Felsenriff durchbrausend, Ihn schau ich an mit wachsendem Entzücken. Von Sturz zu Sturzen wälzt er jetzt in tausend, Dann abertausend Ströme sich ergiessend. {Faust II, 4716-19) It is true that "Entzücken" is not part of the mood at this point in the "Reiselied," but if we interpret Goethe's image as Hofmannsthal himself did—"Wie der wesenlose Regenbogen spannt sich unsere Seele über den unaufhaltsamen Sturz des Daseins" (PII 83)—then the idea of "verschlingen" at least begins to make sense, since "the irresistible downward plunge of existence" is by definition something that threatens to swallow us up. And yet this is not really enough to explain the sense of danger in Hof mannsthal's poem either, because there is no clear basis in the text, as there is in Goethe's, for the application of a kind of metaphysical psychology. In order to understand where this sense of danger comes from, in order to understand specifically how the speaker of the poem is endangered, we must understand what that speaker is doing in that he speaks, we must ask what it means that the opening lines of the poem are spoken, and the answer to this question hinges on the use of the word "uns."4 2. When the word "we" or "us" occurs in a poem, the reader will ordinarily assume that its range of reference, unless specifically limited by the context, includes himself, which implies (since presumably anyone at all can read the poem) that the word ultimately refers to the whole of humanity. The word "we" in poetry therefore lays a specific emphasis upon the communicability of what is being said. It embodies the assumption or the conviction that the poet's experience or knowledge is shared by the reader, and for this reason great care is required in using it. From the point of view of poetry, com munication may never be taken for granted but is always a problem, be cause the poet has more to communicate and therefore places greater demands upon language than other men. One may, with Lord Chandos, have a feeling of "das ganze Dasein als eine grosse Einheit" (PII 10), but it is quite another matter to communicate this feeling adequately, and the use of the 4This word has not interested the poem's critics as much as it ought to. Werner Derungs, Form und Weltbild der Gedichte Hugo von Hofmannsthals in ihrer Entwick lung (1960), does not even seem to notice it (cf. p. 153); and Herbert Lehnert, Struktur und Sprachmagie: Zur Methode der Lyrik-Interpretation (1966), says that "der Ton liegt nicht auf einem ausgesetzten Einsamen, und das allein ist die Funktion des Wortes 'uns'" (p. 97). But it goes without saying that the function of a word in a good poem can never be merely not to emphasize something.</page><page sequence="4">56 The Smallest World Theatre word "we" as a short-cut to such communication, the simple assumption that the reader will understand one's inmost soul, is quite generally character istic of bad poetry. And in fact, if we take "Die gesammelten Gedichte" of 19115 as a base for our argument, I think we can assert that Hofmannsthal is very careful indeed in his use of the word "wir." Outside of the "Reiselied"—and the second song "Im Grünen zu singen,"6 where it is limited to the two lovers— this word or some form of it occurs frequently enough, in "Weltgeheimnis," "Ballade des äusseren Lebens," "Terzinen II, III" and "Ein Traum von grosser Magie"; but in none of these poems, provided we may assume that the "Terzinen I-III" are meant to be read together as a cycle, does it occur at the very beginning. In all of these instances a clear and compelling mood is established before the word "wir" is uttered, and this mood serves as a justification for the "wir";7 it is our participation, with the poet, in the poem's mood, that makes communication possible, or at least the idea of communi cation. This is not the case in the "Reiselied," however, and it is therefore by no means obvious why in this poem, which, like the poem "Erlebnis," or for that matter like Goethe's "Mignon," seems clearly to present us with a kind of dream-experience, Hofmannsthal does not use the same first-person singular as in "Erlebnis," "Gute Stunde," "Dein Antlitz...," "Manche frei lich ..." and "Ein Traum von grosser Magie." The curious thing about the word "uns" as it first occurs in the "Reiselied" is that it seems to have neither a specific nor a general reference. It is introduced so abruptly, without any preparation, that we at least do not immediately and naturally regard it as referring to the whole of humanity including ourselves. And while it is perhaps true that on the basis of the poem as a whole we can imagine the "uns" as a small party of travelers in the mountains8 (although this idea, once again, does not really sort well with the fantastic or oneiric images of "verschlingen" and of huge man-carrying birds), still, we must keep in mind that we are dealing here with the poem's first line, with a stage of development at which the poem as a whole is not yet there.® Hofmannsthal is very careful with his opening lines, and to "ex 5The edition mentioned in note 1. We need not consider the section "Prologe und Trauerreden" since the "wir," when it occurs there, refers to a reasonably well-defined group of people. 6The second of the poems printed by Steiner as "Drei kleine Lieder" (GLD 23-24). 7On the importance of "Stimmung" see Hofmannsthal's early essay "Poesie und Leben" (esp. PI 306-7). On Hofmannsthal's specific mistrust of the word "wir" see the same essay (PI 303). 8L. W. Forster, in his brilliant essay on "Hofmannsthal's Art of Lyric Concentration," German Studies: Presented to Walter Horace Bruford (1962), pp. 218-234, says very simply, "The idea of a journey through the mountains is conveyed by Hofmannsthal through the title, through the simple use of the pronoun 'uns,' and through the contrast with the following stanzas" (p. 228). This is fine as far as it goes, but does not explain, for example, why Hofmannsthal changed the title to make it less specific. On the earlier titles, "Alpenübergang" and "Alpenstrasse nach Italien," see Eugene M. Weber, "A Chronology of Hofmannsthal's Poems," Euphorion, 63 (1969), 284-328, esp. p. 321. 9For a more theoretical justification of this idea, along with application to other poems, see my essay "An Aspect of Meaning."</page><page sequence="5">The Smallest World Theatre 57 plain" such lines on the basis of the poem as a whole is often to miss an important subtlety. In the first line of "Terzinen I: Über Vergänglichkeit," for example, which reads, "Noch spür ich ihren Atem auf den Wangen," the word "ihren," on the basis of the line that follows, can be seen to mean "their" and to refer to "diese nahen Tage"; but in that first line as we read it by itself, the impression of "her" is actually much stronger, and the re sulting suggestion of a love-affair just terminated adds a significant dimension to the rest. Or in "Manche freilich ...," when we read, "Manche freilich müssen drunten sterben,/Wo die schweren Ruder der Schiffe streifen," the first thing that occurs to us is that the "many" are those who die in the sea, or allegorically, in the universal chaotic element (cf. "Bei den Wurzeln des verworrenen Lebens"); the "streifen" of oars, after all, is a motion over the surface of the water. It is only by contrast with those others who "wohnen bei dem Steuer droben," specifically by the opposition "Steuer"/"Ruder," that the image of galley-slaves in the ship's bowels is suggested. Simply to identify the "uns" as a small party of travelers, therefore, would be an unjustifiable interpretive short-cut. We must come to grips with that opening line as an opening line, which means we must understand that while it is not easy, as we have said, to regard the "uns" as referring to all men including ourselves, still it is necessary that we do so, for there is no alternative. If the poem were in the past tense, suggesting narration, a specific interpretation of the "uns" would obviously be called for, but in the text as it stands we must read the word as having its conventional general reference which includes the reader. And yet, once again, there is no justification for such a general "uns." What the poet is doing here, in other words—and with this we come finally to our main question—is not referring to a communicable experience but rather arbitrarily asserting the communicability of the experience he is about to express. Or to put it more generally, the use of the word "uns" here embodies the arbitrary assertion that there is such a thing as communicable experi ence, that our existence is not entirely contained within our transient in dividuality, that there is something in us which, like the rainbow, arches "über den unaufhaltsamen Sturz des Daseins," that each individual's share of the universe is "mehr als dieses Lebens/Schlanke Flamme oder schmale Leier." Communication, after all, cannot occur, the word "uns" is meaningless, if there is not such a thing as humanity in the generic and eternal sense which at once includes and surpasses our transient individual existence, if we do not all somehow participate in the universal being of man. The important point here, however, is that this universal humanity within which communication can happen is not taken for granted or referred to at the beginning of the "Reiselied," but rather asserted arbitrarily in the face of something that then reveals itself as danger, and by now I think it is clear that precisely this arbitrary assertion of communicability is what brings about the sense of danger in the poem's first section. If we could somehow commit ourselves unreflectingly to "the irresistible downward plunge of existence," if we did not insist on thinking of our existence as having a more than-individual and eternal aspect, then existence would not appear funda mentally dangerous to us. We would be, as we imagine animals are, entirely</page><page sequence="6">58 The Smallest World Theatre reconciled to our transience.10 The animal fears certain particular things instinctively, but it does not fear death as such; the sight of a cascading mountain stream, for example, does not remind it of its mortality. Or as Yeats says, "Nor dread nor hope attend/A dying animal;/A man awaits his end/Dreading and hoping all." Dread and hope go together, for there would be no dread, the world would not be dangerous, if we did not hope, if we did not strive somehow to realize our eternal being, the "uns" which at once includes and outlasts each individual. The basic pattern in the first section of the "Reiselied" is thus the same as that in "Der Jüngling und die Spinne" (GLD 37-39).11 A vision of super-individual being—"Ich bin von einem solchen grossen Leben/Um rahmt"—leads immediately and necessarily to a confrontation with death, with "hässliche Gewalt," with the fundamental dangerousness of existence. Or we think of Das kleine Welttheater, in particular the speech of the artisan, whose striving to realize in manifest form the "Ein Wesen" (GLD 306) of all possible human existence also involves him in the struggle with a dark, destructive power which, as in the "Reiselied," has the nature of water. Or we think of "Der Wahnsinnige," who understands more fully and deeply than any of the other figures that his being is not limited by his empirical individuality—"Ich bin schon kaum mehr hier!" (GLD 315)— and can therefore be protected from a correspondingly overwhelming knowl edge of "Das Übel" (GLD 314) only by purest lunacy, by a perfected form of that blindness to reality which is already present in "Das Mädchen," but which in her, if the song has any prophetic meaning, can only be tem porary. Once again, man is the creature who for no obvious reason is not content to be merely a creature but demands more of existence, asserts his more-than-individual being, therefore fears death, and in effect creates the dangers among which he lives; or as Yeats concludes, "Man has created death." And what this means in particular, once again, is that it is the speaking of the word "uns" by the poet that brings about the atmosphere and symbolism of danger in the "Reiselied." 3. Let us now take a closer look at the text. We must begin by recognizing that the opening section can be read in two entirely different ways, de pending on how seriously we take the inversions in lines two and three. Given the sense of compressed significance in the language, it is easy enough to regard these not as inversions at all, but as ellipses: "Rollt der Fels" for "Es rollt der Fels," "Kommen schon" for "Es kommen schon," in which case the section becomes a series of three direct statements. But it is also 10C/. Nietzsche's discussion of forgetfulness at the beginning of Vom Nutzen und Nachteil der Historie für das Leben. On the importance of this essay for Hofmannsthal, see Paul Requadt, "Sprachverleugnung und Mantelsymbolik im Werke Hofmannsthals," Deutsche Vierteljahrsschrift für Literaturwissenschaft und Geistesgeschichte, 29 (1955), 255-283, esp. pp. 256ff. nThe reader should keep in mind that those works upon which we shall rely most heavily for comparative insights, "Der Jüngling und die Spinne," "Der Kaiser von China spricht," Der Kaiser und die Hexe and Das kleine Welttheater, were all worked on or concluded not more than a year or so prior to the composition of the "Reiselied."</page><page sequence="7">The Smallest World Theatre 59 possible to read "Rollt der Fels" as a condition, with "Kommen schon" as the result, in which case the birds are no longer part of the danger but an agency by which we are removed from danger.12 The ambiguity in the syntax thus resolves into an ambiguity in the symbol of the birds, threat or rescue, and we shall come back to this below. No matter which way we understand the syntax, however, we can still observe that each of the three clauses is composed of the same tripartite succession of elements: first a statement (or condition) concerning nature or a natural event, "Wasser stürzt," "Rollt der Fels," "Kommen schon auf starken Schwingen/Vögel her"; then the word "uns"; and finally an infinitive expressing a purpose of which "uns" is the object, "zu verschlingen," "zu erschlagen," "fortzutragen." The meaning of this pattern is clear enough from what we have already said. Nature may in some sense exist separate from us (initial statement), but it is only by virtue of our arbitrary, more than-natural assertion of ourselves in the midst of nature (like the "uns" placed in the middle of each clause) that nature takes on purpose (closing infinitive), and this purpose, to destroy or control us, is revealed to us as danger, a danger to that metaphysical being, "uns," which we have asserted. Once again, it is important here that we follow the language as it unfolds, rather than regard it as a static representation of its meaning. The interpretation of the syntactic pattern at which we have arrived by this method is then borne out by the content of the images as well. We have conceded that the words "Wasser stürzt" can be taken to refer to a mountain stream or cascade, but in view of what we have said about first lines in Hofmannsthal it is also important to recognize that these words in themselves, considered not as a description but as a simple statement, express a general truth about nature: water, after all, does fall. They suggest, moreover, the idea of nature as mere helpless and purposeless flux, a "Sturz des Daseins," and on the basis of this idea the conclusion "uns zu ver schlingen" becomes perfectly intelligible, since if nature as such is mere flux or watery chaos, it follows that the tendency of nature with respect to the human mind—of which the very existence is an articulation of experienced flux into unchanging structure, "Und was in schwankender Erscheinung schwebt,/Befestiget mit dauernden Gedanken"—must be to obliterate it, to swallow it up. We now find that we have achieved quite a good sense for what we have called above "the poetic situation," for the opening words of the poem may now be said to represent the awakening of the human mind in a nature as yet entirely unaffected by its presence. The very speaking of those words, the saying that "Wasser stürzt," which apparently describes nature as watery chaos, is also already an act of articulation, already re duces absolute flux to an intelligible pattern or natural law, thus already asserts man's separateness or dominion relative to nature, and so logically I2Dornheim says that as in a number of ancient huge-bird myths, "so werden auch im Gedicht Hofmannsthals die Reisenden durch Vögel aus der hohen, chaotischen und feindlichen Urlandschaft entführt in das 'untere' Land" (p. 52). But this is clearly going too far. Not only is the idea of needing birds to carry us down a bit odd, but the poem specifically says "Aber." The statement, "birds come to carry us off, but down there is a land," does not suggest our being carried toward that land. One aspect of the birds' meaning is certainly rescue, but not in the sense Dornheim insists on.</page><page sequence="8">60 The Smallest World Theatre anticipates the assertive or hopeful "uns" and the fear of obliteration. The first line of the poem thus becomes a kind of dramatic enactment of the birth of mankind and of nature's assumption of her original purpose, to obliterate mankind. But the original purpose of nature, that purpose which primeval chaos assumes by virtue of man's appearance, can never actually be carried out, for purpose implies directedness, thus a kind of order, and the very ex istence of purpose (even the purpose of obliterating man) is therefore es sentially a human phenomenon, provided we continue to understand man, "uns," as the assertion of articulated order in the midst of a nature which would otherwise be totally unified flux or chaos. This quasi-Kantian idea of man is also expressed distortedly in the lunatic's idea of "Ordnen" (GLD 315); and in connection with Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre (a book which by way of Mignon's song belongs in the intellectual vicinity of the "Reiselied" anyway), Hofmannsthal says in an early note: "Form das Erhaltende; Welt = in Formen gefangenes, gerettetes Chaos" (A 127). It is fairly clear that at least one of the things Hofmannsthal has in mind here is the uncle's speech in Book VI of Meister, which begins: "Das ganze Weltwesen liegt vor uns wie ein grosser Steinbruch vor dem Baumeister,"13 and the parallel indicates that what Hofmannsthal means by "Form" is the form imposed on things by human intellect and creativity. But what the uncle calls "Ele ment"14 Hofmannsthal calls "Chaos" and implies thereby that the very existence of the world depends on human articulation; there is no such thing as a world except by virtue of man's intellectual and verbal self assertion. Everything that in any way partakes of form testifies to the crea tive presence of man, and this applies even to those forces which tend to destroy us, for they too have the effect of giving shape to existence. On the day before the note quoted above, Hofmannsthal has another long note on "Leben und sich ausleben nur im Kampf mit den widerstrebenden Mächten" (A 127). Once again, therefore, the original purpose assumed by nature, to obliter ate us utterly, simply cannot be achieved, for the very existence of purpose is the existence of man. Even if the wheel of time (suggested by the "rolling" of a huge rock) moves inexorably toward our destruction, still there are huge birds already on their way to rescue us. The meaning of this bird symbol becomes clearer from an epigram of Hofmannsthal's: DICHTER UND GEGENWART "Wir sind dein Flügel, o Zeit, und halten dich über dem Chaos. Aber, verworrene Zeit, tragende Kralle wir auch?" "Tröstet euch, dies ist von je. Und schaudert euch, dass ihr erwählt seid—: Schaudernde waren mir stets Flügel und Kralle wie ihr." (GLD 88)15 l3Goethes Werke, ed. Erich Trunz, Hamburger Ausgabe, VII (1962), 405. "Ibid. 15This epigram and the one quoted below were composed less than a week after the "Reiselied" (Weber, "Chronology," p. 321). It is therefore not in the least far-fetched, incidentally, to suppose that in the "Reiselied," as in the epigrams, Hofmannsthal is exploring the nature and effect of poetic speaking, not merely describing a trip.</page><page sequence="9">The Smallest World Theatre 61 The bird of time is thus borne aloft over chaos by human articulation in the form of poetry. And if it seems strange that the poet of the "Reiselied," who after all belongs to the "uns," should be imaged as the thing carried rather than the claw that carries, we have only to look at yet another epigram: DICHTKUNST Fürchterlich ist diese Kunst! Ich spinn aus dem Leib mir den Faden, Und dieser Faden zugleich ist auch mein Weg durch die Luft. (GLD 89) In this context, therefore, carrier and carried are one and the same. We are borne aloft over the "Sturz des Daseins" by our own articulating ac tivity which has now itself become an integral part of nature as we experi ence it. The symbol of the birds, at least in its aspect of rescue, thus has exactly the same source as the atmosphere of danger; it is brought into ex istence by the act of speaking the poem's opening lines. It is also possible, however, as we have seen, to regard the birds not as rescuers but as part of the danger, and in fact, if we read the first section of the poem in this way, we discover in it a distinct intimation of the image of Prometheus bound: the idea of watery flux (Oceanus and the nymphs in Aeschylus' play), the image of a huge rock (like the one to which Prometheus is chained) and the birds of prey (corresponding to Zeus' eagles) are all present. Furthermore, if we may assume that Hofmannsthal's idea of the Promethean is at least influenced by Nietzsche's, then part of the meaning of this intimation is "die dem titanisch strebenden Individuum gebotene Notwendigkeit des Frevels" which Nietzsche explains as follows: Bei dem heroischen Drange des Einzelnen ins Allgemeine, bei dem Versuche, über den Bann der Individuation hinauszuschreiten und das Eine Weltwesen selbst sein zu wollen, erleidet er an sich den in den Dingen verborgenen Urwiderspruch, d.h. er frevelt und leidet.16 And making certain allowances for the tone, this passage reads very much like what we have already said about the "Reiselied." By striving beyond the limits of his individual existence, by asserting himself in opposition to the "Sturz des Daseins," by articulating into order, thus violating ("Frevel") the original and essential unity of all things, man brings about for himself a dangerous world in which he is doomed to suffer. "War ich Tier, o war ich stumm,/unter unbenannten Dingen/ungekränkt dahin zu leben./Welcher Geist der Hölle hiess dich,/zur Gefährtin mir des Denkens/fürchterliche Kunst zu geben?" (DIU 376), says Sigismund to Clotald in Das Leben ein Traum. This is the same "dread art" spoken of in the epigram "Dichtkunst," an art to which, as soon as we begin to practise it, as soon as we say "uns," we are as utterly committed as the spider is to her web, an art which thus be "Nietzsche, Die Geburt der Tragödie, Kröners Taschenausgabe Bd. 70 (1955), p. 96 (ch. 10). With reference to Nietzsche's "das Eine Weltwesen," incidentally, compare the words of the artisan, "Ein Wesen ists, woran wir uns entzücken!" (GLD 306). For the significance Hofmannsthal himself attached to this line, see A 213, 225.</page><page sequence="10">62 The Smallest World Theatre comes our very being and from the standpoint of which nature must reveal itself as opposition and danger. Even on the basis of such a reading, however, even if we regard all three of the main images of the first section as belonging to the feeling of danger, the ambiguity of the bird-symbol still makes itself felt, for there is a suggestion of salvation or resolution inherent in the progression of the images. In particu lar, whereas the words "Wasser stürzt" express a general truth and can be taken as describing original, unarticulated chaos, the rolling of the huge rock presupposes a nature which has already as it were solidified and taken on form, and in which the danger is no longer that we will be utterly obliterated, but that we will be struck down at a particular place in the world; and the birds, then, in their turn, represent a nature which has been not only articulated but animated. The progression water-huge rock-birds of prey thus reflects the organization of chaos and its awakening into life, which process is described frequently in Hofmannsthal's notes as the function of poetry in the world.17 The very shape in which the danger appears therefore progressively reflects the presence of man in nature, the influence of that articulating consciousness which speaks the poem, and it follows once again that the original purpose with which our presence endows nature, to destroy us, cannot be carried out, because in the very process of seeking to destroy us, nature assumes a form which confirms human existence. Hence the final phrase "uns fortzutragen," which no longer necessarily im plies obliteration or death. Like Prometheus, we no longer really die at all, since our life is realized in the animatedness of the whole world. Our death is now merely the flow of life from one place to another, as in "Terzinen II" where the little girls "wissen, dass das Leben jetzt aus ihren/Schlaftrunknen Gliedern still hinüberfliesst/In Bäum und Gras...." 4. Arbitrary human self-assertion as expressed in the act of speaking thus brings about the dangerousness of nature, which is then realized as the animation of nature, and this in turn accomplishes the eternity of human being. Our being is now no longer limited by our individuality but is woven into the very fabric of things, and the word "uns" now takes on a real and universal meaning. This, incidentally, enables us to understand very clearly the opening of Das kleine Welttheater. "Der Dichter" tells us, in the play's first words, that he has just risen from his bath, that he has just stepped forth out of the water, and what he does now—from his vantage point on the bridge, thus lifted above the water by human contrivance, as in the epigram time is lifted above chaos by poetic articulation—is look back upon the fluvial landscape and discover that it is positively bursting with the activity, the adventures, battles and idylls, of anthropomorphic spirits. As in the "Reiselied," that is, man articulates "Chaos" into "Welt" by de taching himself from the primeval watery element, and immediately finds himself confronted with a nature which is animated by human existence. 17"Magie ... Gabe, das Chaos durch Liebe zu beleben" (A 124), or the idea of "Dichter ein umgekehrter Midas" (A 93). "Liebe" is not explicit in the "Reiselied," but the awakening of chaos or mere material into life is clearly part of what happens.</page><page sequence="11">The Smallest World Theatre 63 Man the speaker, once again, automatically calls forth nature as opposi tion and danger, but this opposition is itself a confirmation of human ex istence, so that man and nature are not really opposed after all, but eternally in accord. The original act of speaking which is the "Reiselied" therefore implies directly not only the danger-images of the quatrain, but once this danger has run its course, the paradisal vision of the first tercet as well. Nature now bears fruit which is reflected endlessly in ageless waters. The dynamic articulation of speaking is now realized as the unchanging articu latedness of reflection and the primeval element, water, now represents not nature as flux but the agency of reflection, which is the human mind; chaos has been "rescued" in intellectual form. Nature as flux merely changes', only by way of reflection, the human intellectual articulation of chaotic unity into eternal shape, does nature achieve being and bear fruit. This idea is developed further in the last tercet by the suggested image of a fountain with a marble statue of man, eternal thinking man ("Marmorj//rn"), at its center, around which the flower-garden of nature arranges itself, whereby we are also reminded of "Der Kaiser von China spricht," though in this poem the image is qualified by a humorous irony. The symbol of the fountain, finally, also suggests the idea of water rising rather than falling, thus the idea of a complete transformation of nature. But even though this vision of nature transfigured or paradise regained is a direct consequence of human being as represented by the act of speaking the poem, still we may not actually dwell in -that happy land.18 As in dividuals we are still mortal, still in danger, and this is as it must be because it is only through the phenomenon of danger and dread, then realized as the human animation of things, that we become aware of, hence meaning fully participate in the ultimate eternal unity of nature and man. In "Ad me ipsum" there are two occurrences of the idea of "Tyche: die Welt, die das Individuum von sich entfernen will, um es zu sich zu bringen" (A 218, cf. A 222), and the idea of "entfernen" is necessary here; we cannot be united with the world except by being separated from it. Or we think of Der Kaiser und die Hexe, where the emperor is obliged to break free from the excessively intimate union with nature represented by his attachment to the witch. Or we think of "Der Jüngling und die Spinne," where the youth, in order to realize his initial ecstatic vision, must affirm that "Die Welt besitzt sich selber" (GLD 38),19 a world of brute force, danger and death. Or to look at it another way, if nature were no longer dangerous, if we lived in that "land down there," we would no longer be able to envision it as from a mountain peak, we would not know it in such a way as to be able to continue articulating it; if the unity of man and nature were ever totally realized, then the word "uns," which distinguishes man and brings him into being, would become unspeakable, and nature would once again be 18On "Prae-existenz" and "Existenz" in these images, see Richard Exner, Hugo von Hofmannsthals "Lebenslied" (1964), p. 130. The interesting thing here is that existence seems to precede pre-existence, which corroborates the argument in my article "Chandos and His Neighbors," forthcoming in Deutsche Vierteljahrssclirift fiir Literaturwissenschaft und Geistesgeschichte. 19Another significant line.

A 214, 220.</page><page sequence="12">64 The Smallest World Theatre absolutely unified, unarticulated, unreflected, inhuman, thus mere chaos.20 Hence the image of transfigured nature as "down there" in the distance. It does not exist except in that we, each one of us, like Prometheus, are sacrificed upon the cliffs that overhang it. To the extent that we live in it, it becomes what the land "unten" is in ancient myth, the land of the dead. And yet at the same time the image of the wind in the last tercet, not a visual but a tactile sensation, implies our actual presence in the imagined landscape. While it is true, on one hand, that the ultimate unity of nature and man must be paid for by our fear of death, still, on the other hand, by definition, we do actually live in transfigured nature; it is, after all, the world of man. And this knowledge, moreover, that our being is eternally reflected in the being of all things, appears before us not merely as the author's opinion but as a symbolic vision arising directly and necessarily from the act of speaking the poem. The actual breezes of paradise are therefore an integral part of the poem considered as drama, as the unfolding of a poetic situation which originates in the character of the act by which the poem comes into being. But the landscape in the last tercet is also somewhat different from that in the one preceding. The fruits, representing fulfilment, are replaced by flowers, representing the transient stage of beauty; the description of the fountain with the statue is obviously fragmentary, thus suggesting the image of marble fragments jutting from the meadow, not a fountain but the ruins of a fountain; the word "Gelände" refers ordinarily not to the whole of a country (cf. "Land") but rather to some particular kind of terrain; and the "light winds" suggest insubstantiality more than eternity. We have already seen that the idea of transience as opposed to changeléssness, of the particular or individual as opposed to totality, is necessary here. As soon as we imagine ourselves participating directly in our vision of eternal human being, we falsify that vision, since our actual presence in eternity, if it were possible, would exclude the component of "Tyche" or separation or danger without which transfigured nature simply cannot happen. The fruit thus eludes our grasp as soon as we reach for it; we live in the midst of transfigured nature but can never wholly enjoy it, and the myth of Tantalus, suggested specifi cally by fruit hanging over water in an "underworld," is perhaps not at all irrelevant here. Our actually entering the vision, as in the last tercet, changes the character of the vision in the direction of transience, and thus falsifies it as a vision of eternity. Our overcoming of the fear of death turns out to have been effected by those "blind hopes" the eternal artist has filled us with.21 Though in this poem we do not go quite so far as the emperor Porphyrogenitus, still it is no less true that as soon as our communion with nature begins to become too perfect, it also ceases to be wholly desirable. And yet, once again, not only the bird-symbol but everything in the "Reiselied" partakes of a fundamental ambiguity, the "Grundproblem: Wer den und Sein" (A 226). For it is precisely our insistence upon experiencing eternity, our insistence upon being as expressed in the word "uns," which, in that it necessarily confuses our vision and returns us to the images of 20For the idea of pre-existence or paradise as temptation, as a constant danger, see my "Chandos and His Neighbors." 21 Aeschylus, Prometheus Bound, 1. 252.</page><page sequence="13">The Smallest World Theatre 65 becoming in the last tercet, also constitutes the Promethean sacrifice that makes our eternal being possible in the first place. The qualification of the vision at the end of the poem represents the uncertainty and suffering we must take upon ourselves, the danger we must expose ourselves to, in order to achieve our being. It represents, as the quatrain does, those Alps we must always cross, and always be in the process of crossing, in order to reach the eternal Italy of our realized union with nature. The act of speaking by which we assert ourselves necessarily leads to a vision of eternal human being which we cannot help but attempt to realize: we want to feel those breezes. In doing so, however, we lose hold of the true vision and are once again faced with our individual endangeredness, which losing-hold is in turn the sacrifice that makes eternity possible, so that the cycle is complete. The act of speaking which brings about this situation is thus at once both the assertion of our being and the Promethean suffering that establishes our being. What is visualized in the last tercet is therefore the situation that arises whenever we speak: we find ourselves in the midst of transfigured nature, but only at the price of experiencing it as transience. Our existence is a Reise, a constant moving on, even though we always are at our destination. And all of this, once again, is not stated in the poem as a fact, but grows for us out of the language considered as a developing action. 5. It is of more than incidental interest, finally, that there is a passage in Schopenhauer which Hofmannsthal definitely knew and which suggests ex actly the feeling for nature expressed in the "Reiselied." Schopenhauer re marks that es ist so auffallend, wie besonders die Pflanzenwelt zur ästhetischen Betrachtung auffordert und sich gleichsam derselben aufdringt, dass man sagen möchte, dieses Entgegenkommen stände damit in Verbindung, dass diese organischen Wesen nicht selbst, wie die tierischen Leiber, un mittelbares Objekt der Erkenntnis [i.e. the body of a sentient being] sind, daher sie des fremden verständigen Individuums bedürfen, um aus der Welt des blinden Wollens [cf. "Chaos"] in die der Vorstellung [cf. "Welt"] einzutreten, weshalb sie gleichsam nach diesem Eintritt sich sehnten, um wenigstens mittelbar zu erlangen, was ihnen unmittelbar versagbist.22 The idea of a kind of desire even on the part of insentient nature to partici pate somehow in human existence of course corresponds very closely to the idea of articulated nature as an answer to, thus somehow a part of assertive human being. 22Schopenhauer, Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung I (§39), ed. Max Frischeisen Köhler, in Schopenhauers sämtliche Werke (1928), II, 236. In a footnote Schopenhauer here quotes a passage from Augustine, De Civitate Dei, XI, Ch. 27, which Hof mannsthal in turn, citing Schopenhauer as his source, quotes in the early essay on "Maurice Barrés" (PI 57). See also in Das kleine Welttheater the speech of the emperor turned-gardner (GLD 300-302).</page><page sequence="14">66 The Smallest World Theatre If we recall, moreover, that the remark of Augustine's to which Schopen hauer in a footnote called Hofmannsthal's attention is part of the famous argument in De Civitate Dei that the Trinity is exactly imitated in basic human nature, "Nam et sumus et nos esse novimus et id esse ac nosse diligimus,"23 then we can perhaps understand even more completely the tripartite structure of the "Reiselied." The opening quatrain, as we have seen, develops from the assertive utterance of the word "uns," which is to say, it is a working out of the idea "sumus." The first tercet, then, in which transfigured nature, the true extent of our being, is actually seen, thus states in effect that "nos esse novimus," which idea here perhaps corresponds even better to the second person of the Trinity than in Augustine, since it is our knowledge which for Hofmannsthal constitutes our Promethean or Christ-like sacrifice. And the second tercet, finally, is an affirmation of both being and knowledge in that it represents both an actual entrance into our ultimate envisioned being and an acceptance of the qualifications of the vision made necessary by our situation as knowers. At any rate, even if this parallel does not reflect an actual echo, it is still clear that the "Reiselied" unfolds in a fundamentally dramatic manner, that the ideas and images all belong to a developing poetic situation brought about by the particular act of speaking. And it is clear, moreover, that the drama in question is a true world theater, that it encompasses and enacts existence as a whole, from aboriginal chaos to the beautiful but also deeply ambiguous world of man. In Das Salzburger grosse Welt theater, when the "Meister" expresses his desire to observe "ein lebendes, geheimes freies Wirken," the "Widersacher" remarks, "In solcher Weise hab ich ihn von Geschaffenem nie reden hören" (DIII 257), which disturbs us a bit, for this play is not about the beginning of mankind in Adam and Eve but about typical mankind; and the "Meister" in fact reminds us of this only a few pages later when he addresses the "Widersacher" as "Einbläser von Evas Apfel her" (DIII 260). The meaning of this apparent paradox, however— how can God never before have spoken of free creatures if Adam and Eve already belong to the past?—is clear enough: namely, that human ex istence begins anew in every man and in every moment of life. And it is precisely this sense of human existence as the constant birth of mankind, as a constant starting from scratch, which is expressed in Hofmannsthal's small est world theater, the "Reiselied." The speaking of this poem begins as it were in the middle of nowhere, in sheer unformed chaos, and by the time the poem is finished, only ten lines later, the whole, or at least the whole essence, of the great seven days' work, including man, has been spoken into being.
