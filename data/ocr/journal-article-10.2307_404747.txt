<plain_text><page sequence="1">DERACINATION AND ALIENATION IN LUDWIG TIECK'S DER RUNENBERG MARIA M. TATAR A mood of disenchantment and defeat suffuses the introductory paragraphs of Tieck's Runenberg. While tending a device for snaring birds, a young hunter reviews the motives that led him to abandon his native village and to explore a new environment. Contemplating his present situation and comparing it to his past, he realizes with astonish- ment that life in the mountains replicates the repetitive existence he had hoped to leave behind in the plains: "Er blickte mit einer Art von Verwunderung auf, dafi er sich nun in diesem Tale, in dieser Be- schaiftigung wiederfand" (my emphasis).' When Christian first arrived in the region of the mountains, a new world opened up before him. For days on end he roamed through the exotic landscape before finally settling down to the trade that cap- tivated his youthful imagination. Yet after only three months, the nov- city of the landscape has worn off. "Ich lernte jede Klippe, jede Schluft des Gebiirges kennen" (p. 65), Christian reports to the mys- terious stranger whom he meets on the wooded slopes. Although Chris- tian cannot identify the source of his profound discontent, the account he gives of his daily routine points to one possible explanation for it: . ich war in meiner Beschaiftigung, wenn wir am friihen Morgen nach dem Walde zogen, wenn wir B~iume im Forste fiillten, wenn ich mein Auge und meine Biichse iibte, und die treuen Gefiihrten, die Hunde, zu ihren Geschicklichkeiten abrichtete, iiberaus gliicklich" (p 65). The iterative emphasis that invades Christian's description of his daily routine betrays a feeling that the new enterprise can only temporarily arrest the sensation of eternal recurrence. Christian, as the narrator de- clares in the opening paragraph of the text, left his village, "um eine fremde Umgebung zu suchen, um sich aus dem Kreise der wiederkehren- den Gewoihnlichkeit zu entfernen" (p. 61). After three months in the mountains, the alien landscape of that region has become all too fa- miliar, and the rich new experiences as hunter and forester have taken on the flatness characteristic of the plains. While indulging in childhood reminiscences and casting about for a remedy to his plight, Christian "inadvertently" pulls up a root pro- truding from the earth. Startled by a dull moan that modulates into a plaintive lament, he leaps to his feet with the intention of fleeing the scene. But his departure is forestalled by the appearance of a mysteri- 285</page><page sequence="2">286 MARIA M. TATAR ous stranger. Although the act of deracination presumably stands in some kind of relation to the advent of this "fremder Mann," the con- nection between the two events is far from clear.2 The narrator takes pains to stress that Chr'stian's act is unpremeditated by using the words "gedankenlos" and "unvermutet" to describe it. Yet if there exists a causal relationship between the removal of the root and the arrival of the stranger, then Christian's ostensibly thought-less deed has succeeded in producing exactly what preoccupies the lonely hunter's thoughts: not merely companionship, but more importantly the alien. Christian's longing for that which is alien (fremd) culminates in the encounter with its literal personification (der Fremde). The Alrunenwurzel, which some critics have identified as the root of all evil for Christian, possesses magical powers extending beyond those explicitly mentioned in the text. Christian himself is acquainted with the legend that the mandrake root, when torn from the ground, releases a sound so heartrending that it can drive men mad. While the facts conveyed in the text about the powers of the mandrake fit squarely into the framework of nineteenth-century folk traditions, Tieck's spelling of the word deviates slightly from the orthographic norms of his age. Alraunwurzel is the form that Tieck's contemporaries ordinarily used when referring to the mysterious mandrake root.3 By eliding the "a" in the word and adding the syllable "en," Tieck subtly alerted his readers to a possible link between the root unearthed by Christian and the mountain that appears in the title of his story. Such a play on words, as obvious as it is easy to overlook, appears also in Der blonde Eckbert, a story in which the Christian names of the two consanguineous central characters (Bertha and Eckbert) share one syllable.' Despite the rigid dichotomy maintained throughout the text of Der Runenberg between the vegetable and mineral realms, the syl- lables common to the Alrunenwurzel and Runenberg suggest that the two regions may conspire with each other in more than a purely lin- guistic sense.5 For this reason the Alrunenwurzel must, for the mo- ment, retain our attention. I The etymology of the term "Alraun," like that of its English equivalent "mandragora" or "mandrake," has been the subject of much speculation." According to Kluge, the root of the word derives from the Germanic *run6-, meaning "Geheimnis," "Rat," "Beratung," "Schrift," or "Rune." The significance of the monosyllabic prefix has yet to be established. Whatever its precise meaning, the word Alrunen-</page><page sequence="3">TIECK'S RUNENBERG 287 wurzel literally contains within it the same mystery attached to the mountain visited by Christian and to the tablet he receives there. The superstitious beliefs that have clustered about the mandrake owe their origin largely to the unusual shape of the plant's root. Dur- ing both ancient and modern times the forked root of the mandrake has been thought to resemble the human frame.7 In order to explain the anthropomorphic qualities of its root, the plant was given a human progenitor on its paternal side. In their Deutsche Sagen, Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm note that mandrakes were believed to sprout from the spot where a criminal, hanged from the gallows, had fertilized the earth with his urine or sperm." The curious genesis of the plant ex- plains how the mandrake earned the sobriquet Galgenmiinnlein. While the mandrake was valued in Antiquity chiefly for its powers as a narcotic, as an aphrodisiac, and as a means of ensuring concep- tion, it came to possess more sober, practical virtues in Germanic folklore.9 The root of the Alraun was thought capable of locating hid- den treasure, multiplying gold, and generally of bringing good fortune to its owner. So precious a possession could hardly be acquired without considerable difficulty. "Wer kennt jetzt nicht die Bedingungen einen Alraun zu gewinnen und wer m6chte sich ihnen noch unterziehen, wer kionnte sie erfiillen?" asks the narrator of Achim von Arnim's Isabella von Agypten.1o The mandrake takes its revenge on those who seek to uproot it by releasing a bloodcurdling scream that either kills its viola- tor or drives him mad."1 Strategies were, however, developed to take possession of the plant without risking the fatal consequences attend- ing its extraction from the earth. In order to obtain the mandrake without penalty, an animal (by tradition a large black dog) was first fastened securely to the plant, then lured away from its station so as to wrest the mandrake from the ground. The animal inevitably fell vic- tim to the mandrake's shrill cries, while its master, his ears stopped with cotton or wax, remained immune to the plant's deadly wail. The ritual will be familiar to those who recall Mephisto's words of con- tempt for those who suggest that he would adopt such measures for unearthing hidden treasure: Da stehen sie umher und staunen, Vertrauen nicht dem hohen Fund, Der eine faselt von Alraunen, Der andre von dem schwarzen Hund. (4977-80) As is to be expected, the wealth that the mandrake bestows on its pos- sessor carries with it a curse. The greater the material blessings granted</page><page sequence="4">288 MARIA M. TATAR by the mandrake, the more difficult it becomes for the owner to divest himself of the root. The mandrake invariably brings ruin to the man who dares to sever it from its natural surroundings. Knowledge of the magical properties associated with the man- drake explains to some extent the significance of the plant's root in Tieck's Runenberg. Although the narrator draws attention to the root's cry of outrage at its violation, he remains conspicuously silent about other features of the rich tradition surrounding the mandrake. Once aware of the semi-human qualities of the mandrake's root, most read- ers will find it more than pure coincidence that a stranger appears out of nowhere at the moment when Christian unearths the root. The narrator even suggests that the stranger stands on the very spot occu- pied by the root: as Christian flees the scene of his crime (presumably with his back turned), he becomes conscious of a man standing be- hind him: "Indem er fortgehen wollte, stand ein fremder Mann hinter ihm" (p. 63). The use of "indem," the same locution that later ushers in the appearance of the Waldweib and the return of the magic tablet from the Runenberg, seems to imply that the stranger is somehow linked to the new world discovered by Christian on the summit of the mountain. The stranger appears friendly, if not especially communicative. He questions Christian twice about his destination and offers to pro- vide companionship on the way to a goal that remains, for the mo- ment, undisclosed. Until the very end of the excursion, when he and Christian reach a clearing in the woods, the stranger allows his loqua- cious companion to monopolize the conversation. Only after the two have reached the Runenberg does he divulge any information about himself. What he tells Christian in no way contradicts the notion that he is an inhabitant of subterranean regions: "Unser Weg trennt sich hier, ... ich gehe in diese Tiefe hinunter, dort bei jenem alten Schacht ist meine Wohnung: die Erze sind meine Nachbarn, die Berggewiisser erzaihlen mir Wunderdinge in der Nacht, dahin kannst du mir doch nicht folgen" (pp. 65-66). After tantalizing Christian with the marvels to be found on the nearby Runenberg, he disappears into the mine shaft without so much as a parting greeting. More than five years later, after Christian has settled down to a comfortable domestic existence, a stranger arrives in the village. Al- though he resides in Christian's home for three months, neither the narrator nor any members of the household designate him by name. Like the anonymous inhabitant of the mine shaft, he is referred to</page><page sequence="5">TIECK'S RUNENBERG 289 only as "ein Fremder" or as "der fremde Mann." That the stranger seems less than strange to Christian hardly comes as a surprise. What is quite striking, however, is that Christian is unable to recall the occa- sion on which he had previously met the man. His already prosperous house is later enriched by a sum of money left behind by the stranger, who instructs his host to keep that sum should he fail to return within the year. The planting of money in Christian's home seems to confirm the possibility that the Alrunenwurzel has assumed human shape in the guise of the stranger: true to its character, the anthropoid root brings wealth tainted with a curse. The gold bequeathed by the stranger seems, from the start, to take possession of its trustee. When caught by his father in the act of count- ing the gold, Christian concedes that the newly acquired riches prey incessantly on his mind. He agrees, however, to lock up the money and promises to mend his ways. When the stranger fails to claim his fortune, Christian invests it in land. The conversion of the money into land seems only to translate the obsession with gold into a new obses- sion related to the earth. Elisabeth confides to her father-in-law that Christian has been behaving strangely both night and day. He refuses to tend the garden or to work in the fields, for he is haunted by the sound of "ein unterirdisches fiirchterliches Achzen" (p. 75). She also notes that Christian has finally divined the identity of the stranger: he is "ein wundersch5nes Weib" masquerading as a man. On the one hand, Christian seems to retain the memory of the Alrunenwurzel, for he transfers its demonic powers to other plants; on the other he has successfully repressed or dismissed as inconsequential the memory of the stranger. Only the majestic woman from the Runenberg continues to preoccupy his mind. Christian finally meets the woman from the mountain again at a time when his disenchantment with life in the plains is complete. While taking refuge in the forest from the tedium of his daily routine, he sees a man-who appears to be the stranger-walking toward him. But soon he recognizes his error: the silhouette of the man dissolves and takes on the shape of a hideously ugly woman. Only after the old hag, who is designated as the Waldweib, turns her back to him does Christian recognize in her the woman from the Runenberg. She van- ishes as mysteriously as she appeared, leaving behind only the Tafel with its cryptic markings. Determined to answer her call, Christian descends into the bowels of the earth via a mining shaft that, for cen- turies, has lain in ruins. "Vielleicht, daB ich sie dort finde!" (p. 79),</page><page sequence="6">290 MARIA M. TATAR he declares to his father. Why he chooses the shaft as the passageway that will lead him to the Waldweib remains a mystery. Would it not be more sensible to seek her on the Runenberg or in the forest, the two places where he has actually seen her? Instead Christian takes a route that, by the logic of his experience, would lead him to the abode of the stranger. Clearly the identity of the Waldweib and the stranger has become firmly entrenched in his mind. The woman who captures Christian's imagination is primarily associated with that part of nature untamed by man. Hers is the realm of forests, streams, and mountains, in contrast to the gardens, rivers, and plains cultivated and controlled by man.12 In the opening paragraph of Der Runenberg, as in nearly every subsequent passage describing an alpine setting, the nouns Wald, Bach, and Berg or their synonymous relatives appear. These three features of the landscape come to figure in Christian's mind as anatomical parts of the woman from the Runenberg. Passing through the mountains on a journey to his native village, he gives utterance to the fears that haunt him: "Sehe ich nicht schon Wiilder wie schwarze Haare vor mir? Schauen nicht aus dem Bache die blitzenden Augen nach mir her? Schreiten die grofen Glieder nicht aus den Bergen auf mich zu?" (p. 72). The enchantress from the Runenberg "embodies" nature in the literal sense of the word. Blending both the terrifying and sublime aspects of na- ture, she appears to be a creature at once satanic and divine. In order to enlarge our understanding of her ambiguous character, we must look to the traditions on which Tieck drew to shape the supernatural beauty residing in the Runenberg. II A cavern on the summit of a mountain has served to shelter a variety of supernatural beings who seek commerce with mortals. Of the many legends depicting the seduction of a man by a sorceress re- siding in a sacred alpine preserve, none exercised so strong a fascina- tion on Tieck and his contemporaries as the story of Tannh~iuser. Der ge.treue Eckart und der Tannenhiiuser, Tieck's own recasting of the medieval tale, was the first of numerous Romantic accounts describing what Baudelaire was later to characterize as the essence of the Tann- hiiuser theme: "la lutte des deux principes qui ont choisi le coeur humain pour principal champ de bataille, c'est-a-dire de la chair avec l'esprit, de l'enfer avec le ciel, de Satan avec Dieu."'3 In their own adaptations of the Tannhiiuser legend, the Romantics retained the</page><page sequence="7">TIECK'S RUNENBERG 291 basic theme of a struggle between opposing forces, yet they also used the plot of the medieval text as a vehicle for expressing their own pre- occupations. A search for the literary cousins of Tieck's Tannenhiuser, E. T. A. Hoffmann's Heinrich von Ofterdingen (in Der Kampf der Siinger), Eichendorff's Florio, and Heine's Tannhauser would lead to the world of Romantic fiction rather than to the Middle Ages. Of the many nineteenth-century versions of the Tannhiiuser story, Wagner's operatic pageant, despite its bold deviations from the original ballad, comes closest to recapturing its medieval spirit. While the conflict between sensual bliss and divine salvation has assumed different contours throughout the ages, the tripartite pattern underlying the original Tannhiiuser ballad has, for the most part, re- mained intact. Nearly every Romantic Tannhiiuser-figure indulges in the forbidden pleasures of the Venusberg or of some other earthly para- dise, revisits the world seeking absolution for his sins, and finally either finds salvation or returns to the amorous paradise he once abandoned. The life of Christian in Der Runenberg follows essentially the same pattern, though the knowledge that Tieck's hero secures on the summit of a mountain can hardly be described as purely carnal. The symbolic landscape of Tieck's story is also consonant with that of the medieval tale. The mountains, domain of the Waldweib, are invariably characterized as a region both wicked and godless. When Christian returns to the plains, he delivers a prayer of thanks for having been liberated "aus den Netzen des b6sen Geistes" (p. 70). It is in the plains that he seeks salvation, and-if only temporarily-takes root and flourishes. "Das gute, fromme, ebene Land" (p. 73) is repeatedly set in sharp contrast to the stark terrain of the mountains. Yet the figure who weaves a spell over Christian on the Runenberg has little in com- mon with Venus (that she disrobes before Christian seems less an act of seduction than of revelation). Her association with the woods, streams, and mountains suggests that she is more closely allied with goddesses of nature than with goddesses of love. In molding the character of his mountain enchantress, Tieck ap- pears to have fused the Venus of the original "Lied von dem Tann- hiluser" with Germanic, Celtic, and Italian relatives of the Latin deity. Venus, as noted earlier, is only one of many mythological temptresses thought to lure men into their splendid mountain enclaves. The Ro- man goddess of love is, in fact, a relatively recent avatar of the elves, fairies, and elemental spirits who hold court in caverns hollowed out of mountains. Introduced into Germanic mythology only in the twelfth</page><page sequence="8">292 MARIA M. TATAR century, she supplanted in part the role assigned to Holda, Berchta, and other pagan goddesses of nature. The Venus of the Tannhaiuser legend can also boast a literary heritage-a heritage as controversial as it is impressive.14 Two candi- dates frequently mentioned in discussions of her antecedents are Mor- gain le Fay of Celtic provenance and the Sibyl of classical antiquity. While Morgain's charms do not differ greatly from those of Venus, the chaste prophetess on the Monte della Sibilla possesses preternatural powers that are not shared by her Celtic and Germanic counterparts. Although the magic mountain housing her is associated with divina- tion and knowledge rather than love, Italian versions of the Tann- hiiuser legend almost invariably lead their heroes to her abode. In this context it is worth noting that female soothsayers were not unknown to Germanic mythology. Tacitus refers to one such creature who is designated as Albruna, a name etymologically related to Alraune." Whether Tieck was aware of the additional linguistic connections link- ing the Alrunenwurzel and the stranger with the Runenberg and its enchanting inhabitant remains in the realm of speculation. But in any case, the associations established between the Alrunenwurzel and the Runenberg are sufficiently clear within the text itself to set up a bond between the stranger and the enchantress. It is above all the desire for knowledge, rather than for love, that takes Christian to the Runenberg. "Es schien mir, als wenn alle Men- schen um mich her in der bejammernswiirdigsten Unwissenheit lebten" (p. 64), he complains with reference to life on the plain. Although the course of Christian's life suggests analogies with that of Tann- haiuser, the mountain he ascends seems to bear a greater resemblance to the Monte della Sibilla than to the Venusberg, and the woman whose domain he enters grants him visionary powers rather than love. Tieck wove into the fabric of his narrative various strands of legends depicting a liaison between mortals and the divinities, spirits, and seers who make their homes in sacred mountains. The spellbinding woman on the Runenberg is a composite figure whose beauty matches that of Venus, whose territory encompasses that of the goddess Natura, and whose magical powers rival those of sorceresses. Representing more than the corrupting and elevating power of love, the demonic and divine s:de of nature, or the strength of preternatural knowledge, she stands as the central enigma of the Runenberg.</page><page sequence="9">TIECK'S RUNENBERG 293 III Christian voluntarily deserts the tranquil and secure sphere of the plains to indulge in the ambiguous pleasures of the forests and moun- tains over which the Waldweib rules. In a passage analyzing Chris- tain's mental state, the narrator describes Christian's feelings of nos- talgia for the plains, a region, "die er freiwillig verlassen hatte, um sein Gliick in unbekannten Gegenden, in Bergen, unter fremden Men- schen, in einer neuen Beschiiftigung zu finden" (p. 62; my emphasis). The narrator's report, as one recent critic has noted, contradicts Chris- tian's own subsequent testimony.16 In the course of a conversation with the stranger, Christian suggests that an alien power had dictated the journey into the mountains: "Es hat mich wie mit fremder Gewalt aus dem Kreise meiner Eltern und Verwandten hinweggenommen, mein Geist war seiner selbst nicht miichtig; wie ein Vogel, der in einem Netz gefangen ist und sich vergeblich straiubt, so verstrickt war meine Seele in seltsamen Vorstellungen und Wiinschen" (p. 63). The two similes that Christian selects to describe the process by which he was lifted out of his native environment are not chosen arbitrarily. In both cases, the vehicle of comparison is colored by a metonymic relationship to Christian's surroundings. That Christian uses the term "fremde Gewalt" while speaking to a man who is re- peatedly designated as "ein Fremder" may be nothing more than coin- cidence. But the associations triggered by the comparison between his soul's anguish and the agony of a trapped bird must strike the reader with special force. Christian is a hunter, and the very first sentence of his story specifically names one of the ways in which he plies his trade: "Ein junger Jaiger saf im innersten Gebirge nachdenkend bei einem Vogelherde. . ." (p. 61). Like his avian quarry, Christian is caught in a net from which there appears to be no escape. That net-as con- stricting, if somewhat less substantial, than the one he himself uses- consists of the strange thoughts and wishes that occupy his mind. Such thoughts and wishes, as we later learn, can be realized on the Runen- berg. "Wer nur zu suchen versteht," the stranger tells Christian, "wes- sen Herz recht innerlich hingezogen wird, der findet uralte Freunde dort und Herrlichkeiten, alles, was er am eifrigsten wiinscht" (p. 66; my emphasis). After the stranger takes his leave, Christian is literally driven up to the mountain by "irre Vorstellungen und unverstiindliche Wiinsche" (p. 66). Nature is portrayed as animated and takes on human faculties as Christian follows the path leading to the summit of the Runenberg:</page><page sequence="10">294 MARIA M. TATAR "alles winkte ihm dorthin, die Sterne schienen dorthin zu leuchten, der Mond wies mit einer hellen StraBe nach den Triimmern, lichte Wolken zogen hinauf, und aus der Tiefe redeten ihm Gewiisser und rauschende Wiilder zu und sprachen ihm Mut ein" (p. 66). The roles have been reversed: the hunter is now lured by nature into a net that awaits him at the top of the mountain. Christian himself has assumed the part of the helpless quarry: "Seine Schritte waren wie befliigelt . . . ein einsam klagender Wind jagte ihn vor ich her. . . . Er achtete nicht auf die Tiefe, die unter ihm giihnte und ihn zu verschlingen drohte, so sehr spornten ihn irre Vorstellungen und unverst~indliche Wiinsche. Jetzt zog ihn der gefiihrliche Weg neben eine hohe Mauer hin" (p. 66). On a second journey through the mountains, after his marriage to Elisabeth, Christian is overcome by the same fears that beset him during his ascent of the Runenberg. The region through which he moves seems hostile and savage. After travelling only a few hours, Christian experiences for the first time in his life "Schmerzen der Trennung" (p. 72) and realizes, "daB seine Jugend voriiber sei, daB er eine Heimat gefunden, der er angehire, in die sein Herz Wurzel geschlagen habe" (p. 72; my emphasis). Like the simile used earlier in the text, this metaphor echoes an earlier violation of nature on Christian's part: in this case the uprooting of the mandrake. Just as Christian tore the root of that plant from its protective environment, so he too has been wrested from his natural surroundings. Unable to divine the motive for his departure from the village, he comes to think of himself as the passive victim of antagonistic powers. As he ap- proaches the Runenberg, Christian is reduced to a nearly immobile figure stationed in a landscape that has taken on a decidedly active and demonic dimension: "die fernen Ruinen . . . traten nach und nach kenntlicher hervor, viele Bergspitzen hoben sich abgeriindet aus dem blauen Nebel. Sein Schritt wurde zaghaft, er blieb oft stehen" (p. 72). A happy coincidence, however, rescues Christian from this threat- ening situation. Exhausted by the physical strains and mental anxieties of his journey, he seeks shelter beneath a tree that serves to shade an- other weary traveller. That traveller, who happens to be Christian's father, is contemplating a flower of rare breed. The reverent attitude of the old man to the flower contrasts sharply with Christian's earlier "thoughtless" act of uprooting. The father lovingly studies the plant, taking care not to injure it in any way. Like Christian, he has also undertaken the perilous journey through the mountains, but he sur- vives that journey with his personal integrity intact.</page><page sequence="11">TIECK'S RUNENBERG 295 Christian is first introduced to the reader as "ein junger Jaiger." Hunting and forestry are the two professions that he has adopted. In the mountains he has stalked his quarry; in the forests he has felled the trees. The tender cultivation and loving study of nature are activi- ties alien and unalluring to him. But nature ultimately takes its re- venge by subjecting Christian to the very torment suffered by victims of his trade. He struggles in vain to liberate himself from the same dense nets that imprison his prey, and he experiences pains of separa- tion that match those of the uprooting process. Christian's ascent of the Runenberg is, however, an experience as elevating as it is debasing. On the mountain Christian receives a tablet inscribed with "eine wunderliche unverstlindliche Figur" (p. 68). Blinded by its dazzling light, he contemplates with his inner eye a world transmitting pain and hope. "Er kannte sich nicht wieder" (p. 68), the narrator comments after describing Christian's visionary ex- perience. At the moment when Christian acquires the tablet and senses the figure engraved upon it enter his mind ("sein Inneres"), his vision abruptly dissolves. And when he finally returns to the plains, the inter- nalized figure appears to have lost its sway over him: "er fiihlte . .. das Schattenbild der Nacht in die tiefste Entfernung wie ein Gespenst hinabgeriickt" (p. 70). Another power seems to have taken hold of Christian, a power radically opposed to that exercised by the mountains. Christian was drawn, "wie mit fremder Gewalt" (p. 63), out of the circle formed by his parents and relatives to loftier regions; he is now moved, "wie von einer unsichtbaren Gewalt" (p. 70), to remain in the flatlands. In the mountains, Christian discovered "eine neue Welt" (p. 65) ; in the plains he begins "ein neues Leben" (p. 71). Both spheres provide Christian with visionary insight. His mystical experience on the Runenberg occurred at night-"spiit nach Mitternacht" (p. 66). Toward noon, presumably on the same day, Christian approaches "eine fremde entlegene Ge- gend" (p. 69) and is captivated by the vista that opens up before him. The sight of the plain with its peaceful huts, church, gardens, mead- ows, and fields moves him to tears. So profound is the reversal of values that has taken place in Chris- tian's mind that the plains now assume the earlier allure of the moun- tains. "Reizend" and "anlockend" are now the attributes of the flat- lands with its river that takes various twists and turns through fields and gardens. In both regions Christian takes part in a sacramental ritual and celebrates a marriage-if only on a symbolic level on the</page><page sequence="12">296 MARIA M. TATAR Runenberg. "Nimm dieses zu meinem Angedenken" (p. 68), the words uttered by the Woman as she passes the magical tablet to Christian, echo Christ's words at the Last Supper when bread is distributed among the disciples.'- At the church service in the village, Christian is present when the priest describes the "unvergdingliches Abendmahl" (p. 70) that each member of the congregation celebrates with God. Christian's encounter with the Woman of the Runenberg seems to rep- resent, as one critic points out, a form of hierogamy, a sacred marriage between mortal and god.'s That mystical union has its counterpart in the more mundane marriage ceremony performed in the village to unite Christian and Elisabeth. In the village, Christian figures as an alien in an alien land. He is referred to as "der fremde Jiingling," "der Fremde," and "der fremde Gast"; the territory in which he arrives is described as "eine fremde entlegene Gegend"; everything there appears "fremd" to him. At once strange, alien, and foreign, Christian comes to embody the one attribute most persistently applied to the mountains in the first segment of his story. Provincial life, earlier experienced as "gewahnlich" and "be- kannt," is now characterized by the adjective "fremd," once the sole predicate of the rugged alpine landscape. Yet Christian comes to feel very much at home in the village and at peace with himself: "ganz einheimisch und befriedigt." The two adjectives, however, strike an ominous note when considered in the context of other phrases used to describe Christian's marital bliss. The marriage to Elisabeth is cele- brated "mit aller Frdhlichkeit"; the bride and groom seem "trunken von ihrem Gliick"; in the arms of his wife, Christian feels "gliicklich" and "selig." By the time of his daughter's birth, however, he is no more than "vergniigt," and finally he is described as merely "einheimisch und befriedigt." The sequence of phrases tracing the development of Christian's attitude toward domestic life betrays a steady erosion of happiness and a distinct attenuation of feeling, with the result that the final expression in that sequence, "ganz einheimisch und befriedigt," takes on a nearly pejorative meaning. It therefore comes as no great surprise to the reader that Christian takes leave of what one character in Franz Sternbalds Wanderungen designates as the "hiusliche Hei- mat" to enter once again the "rditselhafte Fremde."'9 As soon as the foreign terrain of the village has become familiar to him, Christian feels a compulsion to abandon it. Although Christian ostensibly leaves his family to visit his parents who live on the northern side of the mountains, the real motive for his</page><page sequence="13">TIECK'S RUNENBERG 297 journey stems from the same restlessness and desire for the alien that prompted him to leave his native village. Now, however, this desire has been "engraved" on his subconscious mind, and he remains un- aware of its strength. But Christian fails to complete his journey. Ap- proaching the site of his visionary experience, he is rescued from what he himself terms madness by the chance meeting with his father. Heeding the father's warning to avoid the mountains, Christian re- turns home to build, with Elisabeth, his father, and children, "den zufriedensten und eintraichtigsten Kreis von Menschen" (p. 73). That circle, suggesting security, limitation, and repetition, remains intact for only a few years. Christian's obsessive concern for the money left be- hind by the stranger is the first sign that all is not well. To his father, Christian explains the source of his malaise: "Ich kann auf lange Zeit, auf Jahre, die wahre Gestalt meines Innern vergessen, und gleichsam ein fremdes Leben mit Leichtigkeit fiihren: dann geht aber pl6tzlich wie ein neuer Mond das regierende Gestirn, welches ich selber bin, in meinem Herzen auf, und besiegt die fremde Macht. Ich k6nnte ganz froh sein, aber einmal, in einer seltsamen Nacht, ist mir durch die Hand ein geheimnisvolles Zeichen tief in mein Gemiit hineingepriigt" (p. 76; my emphasis). To Elisabeth and to his father, Christian seems "fremd" and "fremdartig." By the same token, Christian considers life with them "fremd." The "Figur," once symbol of the alien, has now become what Christian feels to be his true self, "die wahre Gestalt meines In- nern." Its cryptic design lives up to the twin attributes "wunderlich" and "unverstiindlich," for the "Figur" seems by its very nature to resist interpretation.20 If the enigmatic lines engraved on the tablet are re- lated to the name of the mountain Christian ascends, then it seems even less likely that their meaning can be precisely determined. Runes are, by definition, mysterious in character, and runic inscriptions gen- erally are used to cast a spell or to convey a secret message. The magi- cal "Figur" on the tablet handed to Christian successfully performs both functions. Christian's resolution to remain faithful to the "geliebte Figur" within him is further strengthened when he revisits the vantage point from which, many years earlier, he had surveyed the village and its environs. The season is again fall, and he sees before him a landscape that remains unchanged despite the years that have elapsed since his arrival in the village. The true shape of Christian's mind, a cluster of lines and angular figures, cannot tolerate the spectacle of a scene</page><page sequence="14">298 MARIA M. TATAR which, if translated into geometric terms, suggests a circular pattern- the "Kreis der wiederkehrenden Gewi6hnlichkeit." "Sehnsuchtsvoll," Christian directs his path to the woods where he meets the Waldweib, finds the tablet, and elects to follow the call of a new and mysterious destiny. IV In the past decade critical attention to Tieck's Runenberg has focused almost exclusively on the ambiguities attending Christian's mental state. Is the Woman on the mountain the agent of demonic or divine powers, and is Christian possessed by a satanic force or inspired by a higher intelligence? These are the issues addressed by the vast majority of interpretive essays on Der Runenberg. Marianne Thal- mann and Wolfdietrich Rasch have succinctly formulated the positions that divide critics into two rival camps. Thalmann argues that life grants Christian "einen Kranz und ein Gliick."21 At the end of the story, his horizons have been expanded: what to others appears as in- sanity is in reality "der Triumph des Vorstellungsvermagens fiber die wahrgenommene Welt."22 Rasch, on the other hand, shares the opin- ion of most critics that the region of the Runenberg is "dlimonisch, gefiihrlich und gottfern." Refuting Thalmann's theory that Christian's madness is divine, he views the hero of Tieck's story as the victim of a delusion: "Christian ist am SchluB verstbrt, von Wahn umfangen."2" In recent years critics have sought to chart a course between these two extreme positions by pointing to the deliberate ambiguities an- chored in Tieck's text.24 Neither the values associated with the plains nor those connected with the mountains prevail in the end. While the plains provide stability and a secure existence, they are the region of narrowness and "Unwissenheit." The magic realm of the mountains favors its inhabitants with a moment of inner illumination, yet it can also extinguish the light of reason. Tieck seems to have fused the twin traditions of "mountain gloom and mountain glory" that Marjorie Nicolson so eloquently defines in her book of that title.25 Viewed from the plains, the Runenberg is emblematic of man's sinful nature; but to those who conquer its heights it serves as the place of sublime inspira- tion and spiritual growth. In their attempts to define the exact nature of the two areas in which Christian dwells, many critics have neglected to study the change that occurs within Christian himself from the time of his noc- turnal sojourn on the mountain to his descent into subterranean re- gions through a mining shaft. The divergence in mood on those two</page><page sequence="15">TIECK'S RUNENBERG 299 occasions is as vast as the spatial expanse separating the two areas. It is difficult to deny the revelatory quality of Christian's visionary experi- ence on the Runenberg. The supernatural beauty of the woman, the blinding splendor of her palatial residence, and the mixture of pain and ecstasy that stirs Christian all suggest a vision that is of divine rather than satanic provenance. The evocative landscape that flashes through his mind can hardly be the work of a demon: "Scharen von befliigelten Toinen und wehmiitigen und freudigen 'Melodien zogen durch sein Gemilt, das bis auf den Grund bewegt war: er sah eine Welt von Schmerz und Hoffnung in sich aufgehen, mrichtige Wunder- felsen von Vertrauen und trotzender Zuversicht, groBe Wasserstr6me, wie voll Wehmut flieFlend" (p. 68). That Christian would attempt to recover this visionary moment is hardly astonishing. Yet his decision to follow the call of the Waldweib does not lead him back to the splendors of the mountain chamber, but into the interior of the earth. And the goal of his second quest is not the intangible richness of the imagination, but the very real treasures buried beneath the surface of the earth. "Wunderbare, unermel3iche Schiitze . . . muBl es noch in den Tiefen der Erde geben. Wer diese ergriinden, heben, und an sich reiFlen k6nnte! Wer die Erde so wie eine geliebte Braut an sich zu driicken vermSchte, da13 sie ihm in Angst und Liebe gem ihr Kostbarstes g6nnte!" (p. 79). Christian speaks the language of men who show far more interest in mining material wealth than in exploring the rich vein of the imagination. His second journey into the mountains is an arduous one, and he re- turns with what he believes to be "die kostbarsten Schiitze ..., die die Einbildung nur denken oder das Herz sich wiinschen kann" (p. 81). In reality, these "priceless gems" are worthless pebbles and fragments of quartz. Only by striking them against each other can Christian replicate the beauty of genuine precious stones. The radical difference between Christian's desires on the excur- sion into the mountains and his intentions on the journey into sub- terranean regions corresponds to a distinction drawn by a miner who appears in the fifth chapter of Novalis's Heinrich von Ofterdingen. Contrasting "WiBbegier" with the passion for "Eigentum," the miner first describes the innocent nobility of his own colleagues who strive only for knowledge. The miner, he maintains, remains immune to the powers of the metals that he brings to the earth's surface. "Unentziin- det von gefAihrlichem Wahnsinn, freut er sich mehr iiber ihre wunder- lichen Bildungen, und die Seltsamkeiten ihrer Herkunft und ihrer</page><page sequence="16">300 MARIA M. TATAR Wohnungen, als iiber ihren alles verheiflenden Besitz."'- The gifts of nature, he further declares, cannot belong to any one man alone. Translated into possessions, nature becomes "ein bases Gift" that con- taminates everything it touches. It undermines-"den Grund des Eigen- tiimers, und begraibt ihn bald in den einbrechenden Abgrund, um aus Hand in Hand zu gehen, und so ihre Neigung, allen anzugeh6ren, all- miahlich zu befriedigen."27 A more apt description of Christian's for- tunes and of the fate that befalls his wealth would be difficult to find. To his family, Christian is "so gut wie gestorben" (p. 81), and the gold left behind by the stranger is so quickly dissipated that it seems to have taken "eine schleunige Flucht" (p. 80). On his first journey to the mountains, Christian had hoped to escape from the monotony of life in the plains and from the ignorance of its inhabitants. Like the men described by the miner in Heinrich von Ofterdingen, he was inspired by a thirst for knowledge and was in search of the sublime. On the summit of the Runenberg, he found a new world of beauty and basked briefly in its splendor. His second ex- cursion, however, seems to be motivated solely by what Christian's father designates as "der Hunger nach dem Metall" (p. 76). "Die kostbarsten Schlitze" are the only object of his desires. Christian re- turns from his journey with stones so worthless that they require an act of violence before they set forth sparks. Such sparks are hardly capable of igniting the poetic imagination, as some critics maintain. Nature-personified alternately in the form of the stranger, the Waldweib, and the woman on the Runenberg-seems to have taken its revenge on Christian. The original act of deracination, which set the plot of the story in motion, has radical consequences. At the end of the story, Christian is described as a "wunderbare Gestalt," both "seltsam" and "unbegreiflich." With staff in hand and sack on his shoulder he presents the picture of the perpetual wanderer. His final situation thus figures as an intensification of his life in the village, where he was both alien and without roots. The punishment for his transgression against nature is designed to suit his crimes. Now a cap- tive of nature, he has lost his own roots and has become as strange and as marvelous as its emissaries.

All references to Der Runenberg will be to this edition. 2 Although one critic of Tieck's story advances the view that the mandrake and the stranger are identical, he marshals no evidence to support that assumption. See Ralph Tymms, German Romantic Literature (London: Methuen, 1955), p. 92. 3 Novalis, Arnim, Chamisso, Hoffmann, and Heine all write "Alraun- wurzel" or use the form "Alraun" and "Alriiunchen." Raimund Bel- gardt calls attention to Tieck's unusual spelling by printing the word sic after a reference to the "Alrunenwurzel," but makes no attempt to explain that spelling. See "Poetic Imagination and Ex- ternal Reality in Tieck: From Divergence to Convergence," in Essays on German Literature in Honour of G. Joyce Hallamore, ed. Michael S. Batts and Marketa Goetz Stankiewicz (Toronto: Univ. of Toronto Press, 1968), pp. 41-61. 4 Raymond Immerwahr regards Bertha and Eckbert as "the symbolic expression of a single consciousness split into two personalities" ("'Der blonde Eckbert' As a Poetic Confession," GQ, 34 [1961], 103-17). 6 Paul Kluckhohn is, to my knowledge, the only critic of Tieck's Runenberg to call attention to the significance of the title. He con- nects the name of the mountain with the inscriptions on the tablet given to Christian by the supernatural beauty residing on the Runenberg. See his "Einfiihrung" to Deutsche Literatur in Ent- wicklungsreihen: Romantik, Vol. 7, ed. Paul Kluckhohn (1933; rpt. Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1970), pp. 5-14.

The titular heroine of Hanns Heinz Ewer's novel Alraune is con- ceived by artificially inseminating a prostitute (who embodies the traits of Mother Nature) with the seed of a hanged criminal (Al- raune: Die Geschichte eines lebenden Wesens [Munich: Georg Miil- ler, 1919]). When Vladimir and Estragon, while waiting for Godot, decide to pass the time by hanging themselves, Vladimir points out: "La ou ga tombe il pousse des mandragores" (Samuel Beckett, En attendant Godot [Paris: Editions de minuit, 1952], p. 25).

Walther Migge, 3 vols. (Munich: Hanser, 1963), II, 464. at Both powers are familiar to characters in two Shakespearean plays. Juliet expresses her fear of "Shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth, / That living mortals, hearing them run mad" (Romeo and Juliet, IV.iii.48-49), and Suffolk, who has been schooled in the same superstitions, cries out: "Would curses kill, as doth the mandrake's groan, / I would invent as bitter-searching terms, / As curst, as harsh, and horribe to hear / ... As lean-fac'd Envy in her loathsome cave" (King Henry VI, Pt. 2, III.ii.310-12, 315). 12 Kimpel ("Nature, Quest and Reality," pp. 185-86) suggests that the division between stones and plants established by the characters in Tieck's story constitutes a false dichotomy. "If there is a true dichotomy of nature in Der Runenberg," he writes, "it is between untamed and cultivated nature." 13 Charles Baudelaire, "Richard Wagner et 'Tannhiiuser' a Paris," Oeuvres complktes, ed.

As Lilly- man points out, some critics view Christian's decision to go to the mountains as a free choice, while others-taking Christian at his word-maintain that he is drawn to that region by a demonic power (see Scheibe, "Aspekte des Zeitproblems," p. 60, and Klussmann, "Die Zweideutigkeit des Wirklichen," p. 442). 17 See Lillyman, "Ludwig Tieck's 'Der Runenberg,'" p. 236. 18 Vredeveld makes this point: "Ludwig Tieck's Der Runenberg," p. 204. 19 Ludwig Tieck, Franz Sternbalds Wanderungen: Eine altdeut8che Geschichte, in Friihe Erzdhlungen und Romane, ed.

Paul Kluckhohn and Richard Samuel (Stuttgart: Kohlhammer, 1960-75), I, 244. I am grateful to W. J. Lillyman for pointing out that a poem in Tieck's William Lovell anticipates a connection between madness and the search for treasures hidden beneath the earth's surface. In the poem, from Lovell's pen, the lyrical "I" is driven both by the desire for treasures and for knowl- edge ("Wit3begier"). Although he senses that death or madness may await him in subterranean regions, he is nonetheless drawn to ex- plore them. "Wilbegier," in the context of the novel, is fraught with the same hazards that attend material greed. 27 Novalis, Schriften, I, 245.</page></plain_text>
