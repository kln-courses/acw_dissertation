You can't tell a book by its author: A study of Muctazilite theology in al-Zamakhsharï's (d. 538/1144) Kashshäf Andrew J. Lane University of Toronto Andrew.lane@utoronto.ca Abstract This article examines the Kashshäf, the Quran commentary of the Mutazilite al-Zamakhshan (d. 538/1144). This involves: (1) the continuous reading of the commentary on two süras; (2) the study of al-Zamakhshan's commen tary in the Kashshäf on Quranic passages used by him or his teacher Ibn al-Malâhimï (d. 536/1141) in their theological treatises; and (3) an analysis of a report claiming that al-Zamakhshan had begun his commentary with the blatantly Mutazilite statement: "Praise be to God who created the Quran". The conclusion is that the results of the study of the commentary on the two süras reflect the overall theological content of the Kashshäf and that to consider the Kashshäf to be a Mutazilite Quran commentary amounts more to looking at the theological school of its author and to accepting med ieval hearsay than it does to drawing conclusions based on a detailed exam ination of the relevant sources.

TJmar al-Zamakhshan (467/1075-538/1144) was a Mutazilite man of letters and grammarian from Khwärazm. The author of about fifty works, two-thirds of which have survived (many in print), his main fields of interest were adab, grammar and lexicography, but he also composed works in theol ogy and law, as well as works on the Quran and the Tradition.1 He is best known, however, for his Quran commentary, al-Kashshäf 'an haqä'iq ghawämid al-tanzîl wa-uyün al-aqâwïl fi wujüh al-ta 'wîl (The Discoverer of the Truths of the Hidden Things of Revelation and the Choicest Statements concerning the Aspects of Interpretation) which he completed in Mecca in 528/1134.2 Throughout its history, tThis article is based on sections of my PhD thesis, "Al-Zamakhshan (d. 538/1144) and his Qur'än commentary al-Kashshäf. a late Mu'tazilite scholar at work" (University of Toronto, 2003), some of which did not make it into my A Traditional Mu'tazilite Qur'än Commentary.

LANE the Kashshäfhas been described as a "Mutazilite interpretation of the Quran". By the seventh/thirteenth century, Näsir al-DIn Abd Allah ibn TJmar al-Baydâwï (d. c. 685/ 1286) had already composed his Anwar al-tanzll wa-asrär al-ta 'ml, a Quran com mentary which Robson describes as "largely a condensed and amended edition of al-Zamakhshan's Kashshäf, which sometimes refuted the latter's Mutazilite views and sometimes simply omitted them.3 Al-Baydäwl was not the only one pre occupied with the Mu tazilism of the Kashshäf. his contemporary, Alexandrian qâdï Näsir al-DIn Ahmad b. Muhammad Ibn al-Munayyir (d. 683/1284), also wrote a counterblast to the commentary at this time.4 Half a centuiy later, Shams al-Dïn Muhammad b. Ahmad al-Dhahabl (d. 748/1348) warned readers to be wary of the Kashshäf and, even a century after that, Ahmad b. 'All Ibn Hajar al-cAsqalânT (d. 846/1442) repeated the warning, saying that the Kashshäf was off limits to all who wished to study it unless they were aware of its dangers.5 In modern times a number of scholars have made a connection between the Kashshäf and its supposed Mu'tazilism. Nöldeke spoke of "[al-Zamakhshan's] most clever and over-subtle investigations of philosophical and theological mat ters" in the Kashshäf, Nassau Lees referred to the Mutazilite doctrines that "per vade the whole Preface"; Goldziher said that in the Kashshäf al-Zamakhshañ "produced a concise fondamental work for Mu'tazilite Qur'än interpretation"; and Brockelmann spoke of "Mu tazila bias".6 More recently, Smith noted that "[al-Zamakhsharï's] interpretation of and commentary on the Qur'än were strongly influenced by his theological viewpoints"; McAuliffe referred to the Kashshäf as a "mouthpiece for the dogmas of the [Mu tazilites]"; and Madelung stated that al-Zamakhshan's "rationalist Mu tazill interpretations ... provoked criticism among traditionalist Sunnïs", mentioning al-BaydäwT and Ibn al-Munayyir as representatives of this criticism.7 Other authors, however, hold a position opposed to the one above. Jansen states: "[I]n spite of traces of Mutazilite dogmatical attitudes, [the Kashshäj] 3 J. Robson, "al-BaydâwT,' EI2 1:1129. 4 This scholar is Näsir al-Dîn Abü 1-Abbäs Ahmad b.

Versteegh (EI2 11: 434) passes over the Kashshäf in silence, referring his readers to the EI2 Supplement for al-Zamakhshan's contributions in theology, exegesis and adab.</page><page sequence="3">MU'TAZILITE THEOLOGY IN A L - Z A M A K H S H A R I' S KASHSHAF 49 is not a dogmatical commentary"; Gimaret writes: "The Kur'änic commentaries of Abü Dja'far al-Tûsï (d. 459/1067) and of al-Tabarsï (d. c. 548/1155) are overtly Mu'tazill commentaries, even more so than the Kashshäf of al-Zamakhshari"; Rippin argues: "The famous work of al-Zamakhshari (d. 538/1144), renowned for its Mu'tazill perspective, is distinctive primarily for its special outlook and not for the presence of an overall theological argument per se, nor for the quantity of such argumentation" (though what this "special outlook" is, if it refers to Mutazilism, is unclear); and Saleh notes: "His Mu'tazill opinions are few and far between to be significant (sic) and too buried in a normative Sunn! approach to allow them a distinctive voice" (though the term "normative Sunnï approach" requires some clarification). Later, though, in his remarks on al-Zamakhshañ's commentary on Q93:7, Saleh seems to lean towards the first position.8 A closer look at the preceding statements raises more questions than it answers. One might ask how the content of the Kashshäf exercised such medieval scholars as al-Baydâwï, Ibn al-Munayyir, al-Dhahabï and Ibn Hajar al-'Asqalanl so much that they were still condemning the commentary three-hundred years after it first appeared. Why had it not simply been destroyed, banned or replaced by al-Baydâwï's version? Here again, though, there is a problem, for al-Baydâwï would not have removed everything that was objectionable in al-Zamakhsharï's Kashshäf, so it was left to two later scholars, Shams al-Dïn Muhammad ibn 'All al-Dä'üdl al-Mälikl (d. 945/1538) and Ahmad al-Nübl (d. c. 1037/1627), to com plete his task for him. In their respective works, al-Ithäf bi-tamyïz mä tabiafîhi l-Baydâwï sahïb al-Kashshäf and Kashf al-aqwäl al-mubtadhala fi sabq qalam al-Baydâwï li-madhhab al-Mutazila, these scholars drew attention to the places in the Kashshäf where al-Baydâwï would have "failed to remove al-ZamakhsharT's heresies".9 These later efforts to "de-Mu'tazilize" the Kashshäf several centuries after al-Baydâwï, make one wonder, not only if there was ever agreement as to what was specifically Mutazilite and, therefore, hereretical in the commentary, but also if there was not more afoot than saving al-ZamakhsharT's readers from exposure to his heresy. More recent statements on the Kashshäf are not particularly helpful either. While not wishing to criticize the scholars cited here, it is worth noting that 8 J. J. G. Jansen, The Interpretation of the Koran in Modern Egypt (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1974), 63; D. Gimaret, "Mutazila", El2 7: 786; A. Rippin, "Tafsïr", EI2 10: 85; W.

On al-Zamakhshari's comments on Q93:7, Saleh writes: "The praise from modern scholars showered on al-Zamakhshan, however, has more to do with their intellectual affinity with his Mu tazilite theology than with a balanced analysis of his approach to the Quran. Al-Zamakhshari is as doctrinally motivated as any other medieval scholar" {Formation, 148). 9 J. Robson, "al-Baydâwï", El2 1: 1129; GAL1 1: 418; GAL.Sp 1: 741; GAL 1: 532-3. Al-Dä'üdl was one of al-Suyütl's (d. 911/1505) students and wrote, besides the afore mentioned Ithäf on al-Baydâwï, Tabaqät al-mufassirïn in 941/1534 (see GAL1 2: 289; GAL 2: 373; GAL.Sp 2: 401). Ahmad al-Nübl lived in al-Tä'if and composed five works, including one on al-Baydâwï, another in praise of his hometown of al-Tä'if (1027/1617), and a third against smoking tobacco written in the year of his death (see GAL1 2: 385; GAL 2: 504-5; GAL.Sp 2: 520).</page><page sequence="4">50 ANDREW J. LANE their statements on the Kashshäf are broad and more or less assume that readers are well informed. The result of this is that readers may assume they have learned more than they have. Goldziher, for example, referred to the Kashshäf as "a concise fondamental work for Mu'tazilite Qur'än interpretation" and Gimaret argued that al-Tûsï and al-Tabarsï wrote "overtly Mu'tazilT commen taries, even more so than the Kashshäf, but neither told readers what makes a commentary a Mu'tazilT interpretation of the Quran or, in the case of Gimaret, why the Kashshäf was less of a commentary of this kind than those of the others.10 Would this have something to do with the "special outlook" to which Rippin refers? Even if it does, we are no further along the path to clarity as to what makes the Kashshäf, or any commentary, "Mu'tazilite". Would a commentary be Mu'tazilite, then, not because of its outlook but simply because it contains specifically Mu'tazilite theology? As noted, Rippin has stated that there is little in the way of Mu'tazilite theological argumentation in the Kashshäf, yet Smith argued that al-Zamakhshan's commentary was "strongly influenced by his theological viewpoints"; and McAuliffe referred to the Kashshäf as a "mouthpiece" for the dogmas of the Mu'tazilites. How far is the Kashshäf specifically Mu'tazilite dogma? No-one seems to know. For a variety of undoubtedly good reasons, no one has studied al-Zamakhshan's Kashshäf to any great extent (and the same could probably be said for other Quran commentaries). The views presented above therefore tend to repeat, to some degree, broad statements that have their roots in primary sources that have been around for centuries. In the light of these various opinions, this article sets out to study al-ZamakhsharT's Kashshäf with an eye to discovering what can be said about its Mutazilite contents. It may be possible, afterwards, to agree with Goldziher's statement that the Kashshäf is "a concise fundamental work for Mu tazilite Qur'än interpretation", or with any of the statements above, and for these statements to have a more precise meaning than they do now. On the other hand, these statements may be unwarranted, not because they contra dict the evidence but because there is insufficient evidence to support them. Once the matter of the Kashshäf s Mu tazilism has been studied, it will be poss ible to see if its condemnation was in any way justified; and if not, to see what motives might have led to its censure. While a detailed, line-by-line reading of the commentary might be the best way to answer questions concerning the content of the Kashshäf, I adopt here a shorter but no less sound approach, looking at the text from a number of angles. The first involves a detailed study of a limited part of the Kashshäf, the commentary on Q44 (Sürat al-Dukhän/Smoke) and Q54 (Sürat al-Qamar/ The Moon), to establish the extent to which Mutazilite theological ideas can be found therein. The continuous reading of these two süras avoids the trap of focusing on verses that might seem to fit a Mu tazilite agenda more easily 10 For al-TüsT and al-Tabarsï (al-Tabrisï), see Mohammad Ali Amir-Moezzi, "al-Tûsï", EI2 10: 744-6 and E. Kohlberg, "al-Tabrisï", EI2 10: 40-1. Neither author comments on the Mu1 tazilite nature of the Kashshâf, although Kohlberg notes that al-Tabarsï wrote three commentaries on the Quran, one of which, al-Käfi l-shäfi min kitäb al-Kashshäf, was a one-volume abridgement of al-Zamakhshan's.</page><page sequence="5">MU'TAZILITE THEOLOGY IN A L - Z A M A K H S H A RI' S KASHSHÂF 51 and thus retains the possibility that Mu'tazilite views might emerge in unex pected places.11 The second approach has two parts, each involving comparing the Kashshäf with a theological treatise that may have influenced it. The first is al-Zamakhshan's theological tractate, al-Minhäj fi usül al-dïn; the second al-Mutamad fi usül al-dïn, the major theological treatise of al-Zamakhshañ's teacher Rukn al-Dïn (Ibn) al-Malâhimî (d. 536/1141). The third approach focuses on manuscripts of the Kashshäf in order to test the veracity of the well known anecdote according to which al-Zamakhshan would have begun his com mentary with the words al-hamdu li-llah alladhï khalaqa l-Qur 'art (Praise be to God who created the Quran), a clear declaration of his Mu'tazilite position. By approaching the Kashshäf from these various angles, it will be possible to gain a clearer idea of its Mu'tazilite contents and the extent to which it may be con sidered a Mu'tazilite commentary on the Quran. 1. The first approach: a study of Q44 (Sörat al-Dukhän) and Q54 (Sürat al-Qamar) As noted above, al-Zamakhsharï has been said to have given a Mutazilite interpretation of the Quran. A study of his commentary on Q44 (Sürat al-Dukhän/Smoke) and Q54 (Sürat al-Qamar/The Moon) shows, however, that the Kashshäf hardly speaks constantly of Mutazilism; nor does it seek occasion to do so. Within the framework of the traditional tafsïr musalsal, al-Zamakhsharï offers some Mu tazilism when the opportunity arises, but does not present a detailed development.12 It might have been possible for him to have used many passages as a starting point for a presentation of his Mutazilite opinions but he does not. What distinguishes this commentary from others, then, is not an excess of Mu tazilism.13 This restrained use of the tafsïr for expressing Mu tazilite views is shown by the fact that, in his commentary on Q44 and Q54, al-Zamakhsharï makes only one reference to a Mutazilite tenet. In his commentary on Q54:17 we read:14 For a more detailed study of al-Zamakhshan's commentary on Q44 and Q54, see my A Traditional Mutazilite Qur'än Commentary, Chapter 3, especially pp. 118 ff. These two süras were originally chosen because they were of average length and therefore suscep tible to a detailed study within a reasonable time frame. To call a Quran commentary a tafsTr musalsal ("chained commentary") means that it "begins with the first sürah of the Quran and comments verse by verse on that sürah and all subsequent ones. Exegetical chronology has, therefore, its own autonomy, follow ing the sequence of text rather than that of revelation ... Within the sürah each verse is quoted separately and then broken into exegetical units, what medieval Biblical scholars would call lemmata. Each passage, or lemma, is then analyzed separately and relevant comments are made about the verse as a whole, such as its sabab al-nuzül. What is fre quently absent is any extended consideration of the larger context. Occasionally, a con nection will be made with the previous verse or, even more rarely, with more distant parts of the sürah" (McAuliffe, Qur'änic Christians, 34). A brief perusal of the Kashshäf will show that there are no long excurses on any topic; the most that can be hoped for is a series of explanations, interpretations or variations of the passage under scrutiny. I use Arberry's translation of the Quran (The Koran Interpreted. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1985, 19641); any changes are indicated by square brackets. Since</page><page sequence="6">52 ANDREW J. LANE Now We have made the Quran easy for Remembrance. Is there any that will remember? wa-la-qad yassarnä l-Qur'äna li-l-dhikri fa-hal min muddakirin. Al-Zamakhsharl explains the passage as follows:15 that is, we have made it easy to remember and to take a warning from, m that we have filled it with healing exhortations and by means of it have turned [people] away from the promise and the threat [but] "is there any one" to heed the warning? ay sahhalnahu li-l-iddikar wa-1-ittiäz bi-an shahannahu bi-1-mawäiz al-shäfiya wa-sarrafnä fihi min al-wad wa-l-waïd «fa-hal min» muttaiz. He begins his commentary by using synonyms to explain the Quranic passage: sahhala (to facilitate, to make easy, to ease) means the same as yassara the Quranic verse; 2. iddikar (masdar of iddakara [idhtakara]: to remember, to think about, to bear in mind) has the same meaning as dhikr in the verse. At the same time, however, al-Zamakhsharï s explanation goes beyond simple synomyms; he adds: and to take a warning from (ittiäz). He then continues: in that we have filled it with healing exhortations and through it have turned [people] away from the promise and the threat (al-wa'd wa-1-wa'ïd) [but] "is there anyone" to heed the warning? This last expression, translated as "the promise and the threat", is one of the five principles of the Mu tazilite school of theology.16 Arberry follows Flügel's enumeration of the verses, both his and that of Cairo will be given where necessary, first Cairo and then Flügel's. 15 Kashshäf4: 436. 16 The Mu tazilites had five principles (al-usül al-khamsa) which Gimaret summarizes thus: 1. The uniqueness of God (al-tawhïd); 2. The justice of God (al-'adl); 3. "The promise and the threat" (al-wa'd wa-1-wa'ïd); 4. The theory of "the intermediate state" (al-manzila bayna l-manzilatayn) for the sinful Muslim here on earth (neither "believing" (mu 'min) nor "disbelieving" (käfir), they are a "malefactor" (Jasiq)); 5. The obligation laid upon every believer to "command the good and forbid the evil" (al-amr bi-1-marüf wa-l-nahy 'an al-munkar), i.e. to intervene in public affairs to uphold the Law (EI2 7: 786-7). The last three principles were derivative of the first two, divine unity and justice, and the Mu'tazilites were known as the People of (Divine) Unity and Justice (ahl al-tawhïd wa-l-'adl). The principle known as "the promise and the threat" (al-wa'd wa-1-wa'ïd) said that God must necessarily reward the good and punish the wicked in the next life. However, the accent was on the second part, the eternal damnation of the sinner who did not repent. That is why al-Zamakhshan speaks only about turning [people] away from the promise and the threat, for he is talking about eternal punishment. Van Ess gives the "eternal punishment of the 'transgressor'" as the third principle of the founding father Abu 1-Hudhayl ("Mu'tazilah", The Encyclopedia of Religion (New York: Macmillan and London: Collier-Macmillan, 1986) 7: 225); and Gimaret</page><page sequence="7">MU'TAZILITE THEOLOGY IN A L - Z A M A K H S H A RI' S KASHSHÂF 53 Having interpreted the text in line with his own theological al-Zamakhshan then gives two other interpretations. First: It was said: We have made it easy to memorize (sahhalnähu li-l-hifz) and those who wish to memorize it are helped to do so but is there anyone seeking to memorize [the Quran] in order to be helped? Here the emphasis is on the understanding of the word dhikr - it means hifz. Second, al-Zamakhshañ says: It is possible that the meaning is: We have made it easy to remember (hayya'nähu li-l-dhikr) as one prepares (yassara) his camel for a trip when he saddles it; and one prepares (yassara) his horse for a raid when he puts a saddle and bridle on it. Here the accent returns to the meaning of yassara; the idea of making remem bering the Quran easy by specifically preparing it for this. It is interesting to note, however, that al-Zamakhshaiï explains yassara as hayya 'a but then pro ceeds to give an example in which the original verb, yassara, is used to clarify the meaning of the verb hayya 'a. This may be because he is thinking of the lines of poetry he wishes to use next, which include: wa-qumtu ilayhi bi-l-lijam muyassiran I stood up and went to [my horse], with the bridle making him ready to ride.17 The verb yassara, then, means: making performance easy through pnor prep aration. This nuance is clearly explained with the help of the example and the verse; passing via the verb hayya'a, then, appears superfluous.18 Before ending his comments, al-Zamakhshan stresses the validity of the second of his three interpretations (that the Quran has been made easy to mem orize (hifz)). He says: It is related that the followers of [other] religions recite their books, like the Torah and the Gospel, only by looking at them, and that they do not mem orize them as [the Muslims do with] the Quran. writes that by al-wad wa-1-waîd "is understood that on account of the 'threat' uttered against him in the Kur'än, every Muslim guilty of a serious offence, who dies without repentance, will suffer for eternity the torments of Hell" ("Mu'tazila", EI2 7: 786). 17 This line is by al-A'raj al-Khârijï, according to the editors' notes from both the 1997 Dar Ihyä' al-Turäth al-'ArabI (Beirut) and 1998 Maktabat al-'Ubaykän (Riyadh) editions of the Kashshäf (4: 436, n. 1; 5: 658-9, n. 2). He could be, then, Abü Mälik al-Nadr ibn Abl 1-Nadr, called al-A'raj, a poet at the court of Härün al-Rashïd (r. 170/786-195/809). 18 E. W. Lane, An Arabic-English Lexicon (repr.) (Beirut: Librairie du Liban, 1980), 8: 2976, at the root y-s-r, which defines yassara l-faras as: "he prepared the horse for rid ing, by saddling and bridling".</page><page sequence="8">54 ANDREW J. LANE Having presented what could be said about this passage, both Mu'tazilite in meaning and other, al-Zamakhshañ moves on to the next verse. The only indi cation that he might prefer the Mutazilite interpretation is that it was given first. In line with the previous analysis is al-Zamakhshan's rather imaginative use of one of his sources in his commentary on Q35:8/9: "And what of him, the evil of whose deeds has been decked out fair to him, so that he thinks it is good?" Here we see him ostensibly quoting this source, al-Zajjäj's Maäni l-Qur'ä n, but closer analysis of the original text indicates that al-Zamakhshañ is giving a Mu'tazilite bent to al-Zajjäj's text.19 Q35:8/9 is obviously an important verse concerning free will and divine predestination, since it speaks of God's leading astray and guiding whom he will. In order to understand the explanations of the text, the full verse is presented here schematically: And what of him, the evil of whose deeds has a fa-man zuyyina lahu sü u been decked out fair to him, so that he thinks 'amalihi fa-ra 'ähu hasanan it is good? God leads astray whomsoever He will, and fa-inna llana yudillu man whomsoever He will He guides; yashä u wa-yahdi man yasha u so let not thy soul be wasted in regrets for fa-lä tadhhab nafsuka alayhim them; hasarätin God has knowledge of the things they work. inna llaha calimun bi-mä yasna una 19 Abu Ishäq Ibrahim ibn Sahl ibn al-Sârî al-Zajjâj (d. c. 311/923) was a lexicographer, grammarian, and an intimate student of al-Mubarrad Abu 1-Abbäs Muhammad ibn Jazïd al-Azdl (d. 285/898 or 286/900), the most important representative of the so-called Basran school of grammar of his time. After his studies, al-Zajjäj was tutor in the house hold of 'Ubayd Allah Ibn Sulaymän, vizier of the Abbäsid caliph al-Mutadid (r. 892 902 CE). Later he was employed in the service of Ibn Sulaymän's son, al-Qäsim, when he became vizier; he remained al-Qäsim's secretary until his death in Baghdad at the age of over eighty.

It was a methodological study, an effort to see how accurately what was read in the Kashshâf reflected the earlier sources that were referred to; the results were presented at the 2002 annual meeting of the American Academy of Religion in Toronto. In the Kashshâf, al-Zamakhshan refers specifically to al-Zajjäj by name on thirty-two occasions at least. In his references, al-Zamakhshan gives only al-Zajjäj's name; there are no references to particular works. He indicates that he is borrowing from al-Zajjäj usually by the expression qäla l-Zajjäj ("al-Zajjäj said") (75 per cent of the time). Of the thirty-two references to al-Zajjäj in the Kashshâf under study, all but one could be traced to a corresponding text in the Ma'änl l-Qur'än. The other was not traced; it must have been a reference to a work of al-Zajjäj that is not yet available or was lost, or else it is an error. Q35:8/9 is the only occasion on which we see some Mu'tazilite tampering with al-Zajjäj's original text.</page><page sequence="9">MU'TAZILITE THEOLOGY IN AL-ZAMAKHSHARI'S KA S HS H A F 55 This verse begins with a question to which no answer is given.-0 Al-ZamakhsharT, and al-Zajjäj before him, realized that an answer was apparently missing. Al-ZamakhsharT creates an elaborate dialogue between God and "his prophet (nabiyyihi)", into which he injects and then explains parts of this passage. The point is that those who think their evil deeds are good are the same as those whom God leads astray (wa-manä tazyïn al-amal wa-l-idläl wähid); and the Prophet is not to waste away regretting any of them.21 Al-Zamakhshan then gives the two explanations he says al-Zajjäj mentioned (dhakara). The latter proposes his explanations by supplying an answer (A, below) to the question (Q, below); this answer is, each time, based on what follows in the Quranic verse, what could be called the "Quranic answer" (Aq, below). Since the contents of the answer are, therefore, indicated by the later passages (daläla 'alayhi), that is, the "Quranic answer" (Aq), al-Zajjäj says that the answer (A) to the question (Q) itself has been dropped (hudhifa). The two question-and-answer explanations that al-Zamakhshañ says al-Zajjäj gives are as follows:22 Q: "And what him, the evil of whose deeds has been decked out fair to him?" A: Thy soul was wasted in regrets for them (dhahabat nafsuka 'alayhim hasratari). Aq: 'so let not thy soul be wasted m regrets for him (sic)" ( alayhi m the Kashshäf). Here the answer (A) has been dropped because, as shown above, it is given later in the verse (Aq). This is in accord with what al-Zamakhshañ has already stated: the Prophet is not to waste time regretting such people. As for al-Zajjâj's second explanation, as quoted by al-Zamakhshan, the answer does not fit the question quite so snugly; nor does al-Zamakhshan give any additional explanations: 20 Some translations, however, supply an answer. Pickthall's translation, for example, reads: "Is he, the evil of whose deeds is made fairseeming unto him so that he deemeth it good, (other than Satan's dupe)?" (M. M. Pickthall, The Meaning of the Glorious Quran (Cairo: Dar al-Kitäb al-Misrï and Beirut: Dar al-Kitäb al-Lubnânî, n.d.)). The hamza at the beginning of the verse can also be an inteijection; Blachère translates it as "Eh quoi (What)!" {Le Coran, Paris: G.-P. Maisonneuve &amp; Larose, 1980). Arberry stays closer to the Arabic. 21 This statement may look very un- or even anti-Mutazilite, for it seems to be stating that God causes those whom he leads astray to be blinded to the evil of their deeds. A closer reading of the passage indicates that the tazyïn al-amal = al-idläl equation is the outcome of a process where individual liberty comes first. After stating that the two expressions have the same meaning, al-Zamkhshan continues: "That is, the one who disobeys is one for whom benefits are of no avail, so that he merits thereby to be forsaken by God Most High, to be abandoned - he and his lot etc. (wa-huwa an yaküna l-'äsi 'alä sifa lä tajdï 'alayhi l-masälih hattä yastawjiba bi-dhälik khidhlän Alläh ta'älä wa-takhliyatahu wa-sha 'nihi ilkh)". Later al-Zamakhshan writes that the Prophet is not to regret what hap pens when God forsakes "those who are determined to be unbelievers (al-musammüna 'alä l-kufr)". It is clear, then, that God leads astray those who are determined to be so treated, who, by their freely chosen disobedience, merit what they get (Kashshäf3: 609). 22 Kashshäf y. 609.</page><page sequence="10">56 ANDREW J. LANE Q: "And what of him, the evil of whose deeds has been decked out fair to him?" A: [He is] like the one whom God has guided (ka-man hadähu lläh). Aq: "God leads astray whomsoever He will, and whomsoever He will He guides". * When the Maänl l-Qur'än itself is examined, it becomes clear that al-Zamakhsharï is practically quoting al-Zajjäj, with some slight, but not insig nificant, changes. In the first explanation, al-Zajjäj 's original question and answer reads:23 Q: "And what of him, the evil of whose deeds has been decked out fair to him" and whom God has led astray (fa-adallahu lläh)? A: Thy soul was wasted in regrets for him (dhahabat nafsuka alayhi hasratan). Aq: "so let not they soul be wasted in regrets for them . Al-Zamakhsharï's version does not mention the phrase about God leading the evildoers astray. While this could be an oversight on the part of the author or copyist, the context is far too tantalizing to allow easy acceptance of such an explanation. It looks, rather, like the elimination of a statement contrary to the Mu tazilite explanation that al-Zamakhshan has just given concerning the true meaning of God's leading someone astray. As for the second explanation, we see al-Zamakhshan's Mutazilite hand at work even more clearly. In the MaänT l-Qur'än, al-Zajjäj's original sequence reads: Q: "And what of him, the evil of whose deeds has been decked out fair to him?" A: [He is] like the one from whom God has turned away (ka-man taäddähu lläh) Aq: God leads astray whomsoever He will, and whomsoever He will He guides. In this sequence we see that al-Zamakhshan has done the opposite of al-Zajjäj. Since the Quranic answer (Aq) has two parts, one answer (A) is as acceptable as the other. However, as we have seen, al-Zamakhshan's answer does not fit as easily as one would expect; it appears, again, to be an attempt to avoid saying that God leads people astray. More seriously, perhaps, he appears to attribute this interpretation to al-Zajjäj. The whole passage is a clear example of al-Zamakhshan altering a passage in the Ma'äm l-Qur'än to make it fit his own theological views more closely. Ibâhïm ibn al-Sarï ibn Sahl al-Zajjâj (d. 311/923), Kitäb Ma'äni l-Qur'ân (wa-iräbuhu), ed. 'Abd al-Jalîl 'Abduh Shalabî (Cairo: al-Hay'a al-'Amma li-Shu'un al-Matâbi' al-Amïriyya and Beirut: Maktabat al-'Asriyya, 1974), 4: 264.</page><page sequence="11">MU TAZILITE THEOLOGY IN AL-ZAMAKHSHARÏ'S KASHSHÀF 57 The aforementioned study of al-Zamakhshan's commentary on Q44 and Q54 showed that the Kashshäf had all the elements of a traditional Quran commentary (tafsïr musalsal) and in no way distinguished itself within the genre. Its author employed all the traditional techniques (tafsïr al-Qur'än bi-l-Qur'än, grammar, questions-and-answers (masä'il wa-ajwiba)) and information (variant readings (iqirä'ät), occasions of revelation (asbäb al-nuzül), traditions (ahädlth), poetry and other transmitted knowledge) at his disposal to explain the meaning of the text on a word-by-word or phrase-by-phrase basis. This indicates that the Kashshäf retained all the elements of a traditional work of exegesis, no matter how it was viewed or defined with respect to the Mu'tazilism of its author. Furthermore, with respect to this theology and despite the fact that al-Zamakhshan was accused by some of using the Kashshäf as a means for propa gating it, an attentive reading of his commentary on the forty-fourth and fifty-fourth süras reveals nothing by way of polemics, proseletyzing or even theological discussion; one sees only a passing reference to a Mu'tazilite principle. Likewise, a comparative study of the Kashshäf with one of its sources, al-Zajjäj's Ma'änl l-Quran, revelaed only one instance reflecting al-Zamakhshan's theological position, in his "quotation" from the Ma'äm. The Kashshäf received strong criticism in some circles, and this suggests that it was caused more by al-Zamakhshan's being a Mu'tazilite than by the content of the Kashshäf 2. The second approach: possible theological influences on the Kashshäf From the previous section it would seem that, despite the general accusations of heresy, al-Zamakhsharî's commentary was on the whole well within the accepted exegetical tradition. In this section, I will compare the Kashshäf with two theological treatises to see if any of the theological ideas from the latter can be detected. The treatises are al-Zamakhsharî's own al-Minhäj fi usül al-dîn, and al-Mu 'tamad fi usül al-dîn, the major theological treatise of his teacher Rukn al-DTn (Ibn) al-Malähiml (d. 536/1141). 2.1 Al-ZamakhshaiTs al-Minhaj fi usül al-dîn Al-Minhäj ß usül al-ain is al-Zamakhsharl's short, and only, truly theological treatise. However, its theological content is not the main interest here; rather, it is used to see to what extent the "Mu'tazilite content" of Quranic verses used in the Minhäj can be found repeated or reflected in the Kashshäf. There is no assumption that the Minhäj was written before the Kashshäf or that it was a source. We do not know when the Minhäj was completed, although the Kashshäf was completed in 528/1134. The goal, then, is to see to what extent, if at all, the theological ideas al-Zamakhshan associated with certain Quranic passages or verses in the Minhäj were also associated with them in the Kashshäf It is this association of theological ideas and Quranic texts that is our focus here. The Minhäj ß usül al-dïn is described by Madelung as "a brief summary of his theological creed", and by Schmidtke as "a short creedal tract on theology". It is divided into nine chapters, each laid out in the usual question-and-answer (masa il wa-ajwiba) format. A tenth chapter on the imamate is lacking from</page><page sequence="12">58 ANDREW J. LANE surviving Yemeni manuscripts, since it did not agree with the doctrine of the Kufan Zaydïs who brought the Minhäj to Yemen.24 The chapter titles given by Schmidtke indicate that al-Zamakhshan deals with themes that were dear to the hearts of the Mu tazilites.25 In particular, the titles of Chapter 7 (Chapter on the Promise and the Threat) and Chapter 8 (Chapter on the Command of what is Proper and the Interdiction of what is Reprehensible) state two of the five prin ciples of the Mutazilite School. Their position at the end of the treatise probably indicates their relative importance. The long second chapter (Chapter on the Knowledge of God and His Attributes) deals with the unity of God (tawhïd), a fun damental Mutazilite fundamental principle, while the next three chapters (Chapter on the Imposition of Moral Obligations, Chapter on the Facilitating Favours and Chapter on Pains) deal with themes associated with the other fundamental prin ciple, divine justice Çadl). The sixth (Chapter on Sustenance, Prices and Terms of Death) brushes with the question of divine predestination (qadar). These nine chapters are of similar length, two to three pages in Schmidtke's edition, although the seventh, on 'the promise and the threat' is four full pages. The only exception is the second chapter which, at ten pages, amounts to nearly a third of the entire trea tise (even if a few of these pages bear some ample footnotes). In the Minhäj, Madelung argues, al-Zamakhsharï avoided entering into the controversies that separated the two branches of the Mu'tazila that existed in Khwärazm during his time: those who followed Abd al-Jabbär (d. 415/1025), known as the Bahshamiyya, and those who followed the latter's student Abü 1-Husayn al-Basrï (d. 436/1044). While al-Zamakhsharï's method was masä'il wa-ajwiba, his approach was "catholic": if he mentioned two conflicting views, he did not take sides or even directly indicate his preference; nor did he ever refute a Mutazilite view. He was influenced by the views of Abü 1-Husayn al-Basrï and Rukn al-Dïn (Ibn) al-Malâhimî (d. 536/1141), a disciple of the former and one of al-Zamakhsharï's contemporaries, as a closer reading of the Minhäj reveals - nowhere does he uphold views of the Bahshamiyya that the latter had rejected.26 While being influenced by the theology of Abü 1-Husayn al-Basrï and Ibn al-Malähiml, Madelung notes that al-Zamakhsharï did not 24 W.

These are not divided equally among the nine chapters (which, with the exception of the second, are of a similar length). It is not surprising that a significant number of the Quranic references are found in chapter 2 (12 of the 28). Chapter 7, however, also has a good number of references (9); the rest are divided between Chapter 8 (two) and Chapter 9 (five). The remaining chapters do not contain Quranic references. Furthermore, it should be noted that Quranic references are not spread evenly through these chapters. Al-Zamakhshan frequently sup ports a position with three or four passages from the Quran, so that, even in the relatively short Chapter 7, the nine references are found in just three places: a single verse on one occasion and two groups of four on the other. One might ask about the role of these Quranic passages in the Minhäj. A study of the text reveals that this is twofold: an illustrative role, for example at the end of Chapter 9 on prophecy, where al-Zamakhshan deals with Muhammad's miracle and the miraculous character of the Quran. First he states what a miracle is and gives the conditions for its occurrence; he then asks: "What is the miracle (mujiza) of Muhammad?" He begins his answer by mentioning the Quran, but then adds others, such as the splitting of the moon (inshiqäq al-qamar), the glorification of God by the pebbles (tasbih al-hasa), the moaning of the tree trunk (hanïn al-jidh'), the feeding of the crowds with little food and the quenching of their thirst with little water (ifäm al-jamaät min taäm y asir wa-saqyuhum min mä' qalTl) and, finally, Muhammad's communication of hidden matters (ikhbäruhu bi-l-ghuyüti). Al-Zamakhsharî then returns to the Quran to describe in more detail its miraculous character and gives two aspects of this: the Quranic passages are used to illustrate the second characteristic of the Quran's miraculous character, its "reports on hidden matters".28 The miraculous character of the Quran is two-fold: (first,) the inability of the people of eloquence [(ahl al-fasäha)] to match it and (secondly,) the reports on hidden matters in it like the saying of God the Exalted "and you will not do",29 "Certainly the host shall be routed",30 "that He may uplift it above every religion",31 "God will protect thee from men".32 in the Minhäj, with references to the first two chapters of the treatise, which deal with the proof of the existence of God and with the divine attributes. 27 Madelung, "Theology", 492-3. 28 Schmidtke, Minhäj, 43 (E = English), 80 (A = Arabic). Arberry's translation is followed for Quranic passages. My translation of the Minhäj does not always follow Schmidtke's. 29 Q2: 24/22. 30 Q54: 45. 31 Q9: 33. 32 Q5: 67/71.</page><page sequence="14">60 ANDREW J. LANE Al-Zamakhsharf s answer and his demonstration of the Quran's two-fold mir aculous character ends rather abruptly here. No explanations are given as to the context of these Quranic passages; as with the list of miracles, he accepts that his reader is familiar with them.33 The context of these verses is as follows: 1. Q2:24/22 has to do with the challenge to the polytheists to produce a sura like one in the Quran; but the Quran says that they will not do this (lan taf 'alü); 2. Q54:45 is taken as a reference to the victory at Badr; 3. Q9:33 says the religion brought by Muhammad will be raised above other religions; 4. Q5: 67/71 is an order to the Prophet to deliver his message and is accompanied by a promise of divine protection. Three of these verses were later understood to refer to events that came to pass afterwards. What is important for al-Zamakhshañ, though, is that they are reports of hidden matters known only to God and revealed in the Quran. Besides this more illustrative role in the Minhäj, Quranic passages can some times be raised to the level of a "proof' (dalTl). An example is found in Chapter 7 on 'The promise and the threat', where the question is asked as to the proof (dalïl) that the persistent offender will stay eternally in hell; here al-Zamakhshan gives three Quranic passages followed by a saying of the Prophet: "Whosoever throws himself off a mountain will fall into hell-fire for eternity; and whosoever kills himself with a knife will be in hell-fire eternally, sticking his knife into his belly with his [own] hand". Here al-Zamakhshañ also mentions that his opponents, whom he calls the Muiji'ites, are wrong to cling to traditions which are countered by others which agree with the Quran, although he does not elabor ate. On such occasions, though, there does not appear to be a distinction between a rational proof (dalïl) and a more traditional argument from authority where the revealed text is simply brought forward to support a position; in each case either a series of passages from the Quran or sometimes even a single passage is pre sented.34 It may be that al-Zamakhshan takes the word dalïl to mean "indication" or "sign" rather than "decisive proof' or "clear demonstration".35 Either way, in the preceding section of the Minhäj, the question is asked as to the scriptural indi cations (sing, mäni al-sam') prohibiting prophetic intercession for the grave sin ner, and here again we find Quranic passages. Al-Zamakhsharfs "proof" {dalïl), then, that the persistent sinner remains in hell does not involve carefully crafted rational arguments with respect to the correct understanding of the traditional material he has presented. In fact, the only developed discussion of this kind is found in the latter section where, after giving the scriptural indications prohibiting prophetic intercession, al-Zamakhshañ has to explain the tradition where the 33 One is reminded of al-Zamakhshan's presentation of the muhkamät and mutashäbihät verses in his commentary on Q3:7. He gives two pairs of verses: in each case one verse, the mutashäbih, is referred to the other, the muhkam, in order to be understood. However, he does not say why these verses are so considered. See Kashshäfl: 365-6. 34 See L Gardet, '"Ilm al-Kaläm", EI2 3: 1141-50, especially section III: Method and pro blematic (pp. 1146-7). 35 See S. van den Bergh, "Daffl", El2 2: 101-2; L.

Al-Zamakhshan concludes this section with another appeal to authority: "We have held to what is agreed upon (fa-akhadhnä bi-mä ttufiqa 'alayhi)".36 When al-Zamakhshañ's demonstrations go beyond a simple list of Quranic pas sages, one might question their relevance; perhaps there is a history with which his readers are familiar. In his use of one cluster of four Quranic passages in Chapter 2, for example, the Quranic passages are incorporated into a proof that God can be neither perceived by the senses nor seen.37 The section begins with the question: "What is the proof (dalTl) that He cannot be perceived by any sense (là yudraku bi-hässa) and that He is not seen (laysa bi-mar'ï)'.?" The answer has three related parts: (i) God is neither a body (Jism) nor an accident Çarad) and so cannot be perceived by any of the senses; (ii) God remains unseen even if one has good eyesight and all impediments (al-mawäni min al-ru 'ya) have been removed;38 and (iii) God cannot be faced (muqabala) since he is not a body and does not subsist (häl) in one. Al-Zamakhshan then abruptly quotes four Quranic passages without introduction: "The eyes attain Him not" (Q6:103), "Thou shalt not see Me" (Q7:143/138), "(those) ... shall never create a fly" (Q22:73/72) and "for they said, 'Show us God openly'. And the thunder bolt took them for their evil doing" (Q4:153/152).39 When we look closely at these passages, it becomes clear that the main thrust is the impossibility of see ing God, of looking at him. They do not deal with God's not being a body (Jism) or subsisting in one (häl fijism), nor do they refer to either of the two preceding points. They "prove" that God can be neither perceived nor seen, in much the same way as the verses in the preceding example proved that the persistent 36 Schmidtke, Minhäj, 38-9 (E, which has "fall into the hell-fire for eternity"), 75-6 (A). I have not followed Schmidtke's English translation exactly for either tradition; in the lat ter case, the Arabic has: shafa atuhu li-ahl al-kabä 'ir min ummati. In these few pages from the Minhäj we see a number of points that reflect Gardet's comments on traditional arguments in Kalâm, i.e. arguments from authority: quotations from the Quran, tra ditions, and positions that were agreed upon. 37 Schmidtke, Minhäj, 16-7 (E), 54-5 (A). 38 Al-Zamakhshan includes in his explanation a list of impediments to seeing, one of which is the inability to face or be in front of an object (khiläf al-muqäbala). Although the word has the meaning being "in front of' or "facing", there should not be, in theory, any "front" and the only "face" would be that of the one seeing. The main idea is "to take a position with respect to something", or for something "to have a position" (Jt jiha). This leads to the next point. 39 The passage from the Minhäj reads as follows [I have used square brackets to indicate changes to Schmitke's translation]: "Yet it is impossible to face God because He is neither a body nor subsisting in a body. God said "The eyes attain Him not" [(Q6:103)] and He said "Thou shalt not see Me" [(Q7:143/138)] as He said "(those) ... shall never create a fly" [(Q22:73/72)] because [seeing Him is as impossible as their creating a body]; and God said "for they said, 'Show us God openly'. And the thun derbolt took them for their evil doing" [(Q4:153/152)]. If they had asked for something that [was] possible (jä 'iz) they would not have done evil and would not have been taken by the thunderbolt... [Mose's statement] - peace be upon him - 'Show me, that I may behold Thee!' [(Q7:143/138)] is not binding because he said this [only] in order to silence those who demanded to see (God) by proving its impossibility and in order to stop their arguing when they heard His saying "Thou shalt not see Me" [(Q7:143/ 138)]" (Schmidtke, Minhäj, 17 (E), 55 (A)).</page><page sequence="16">62 ANDREW J. LANE sinner will remain in hell for ever: by making a broad statement that is not at odds with the theological position. It should be added here that, as in the pre vious example and on other occasions where al-Zamakhshan offers more than Quranic proof for the position he is defending, references to the Quran are not always given first. Sometimes Quranic verses are used merely to support second ary points that arise in the course of the argument. Perhaps this is Gardet's think ing when he writes: "The fact that these 'traditional' arguments are in some manuals listed after the "rational" arguments indicates that the former are to be regarded as a confirmatur to the results of dialectical reasoning".40 The overall impression left by the Minhäj is that it is "a brief summary of [al-Zamakhshañ's] theological creed", a short work in which the main tenets of Mu tazilism were exposed and "defended" by set answers and Quranic refer ences. Within this framework, Quranic verses and passages have a role as an authority next to rational arguments, although in what we have seen there were few of these arguments. Unlike tafsir, where he would comment on indi vidual words or phrases, in the Minhäj he uses them to support or illustrate the theological position he is upholding. In these cases al-Zamakhshan either pre sumes that the meaning of the passage is clear - and in line with the position he is taking - or he explains it in terms of this position. This was not new to al-Zamakhshan: he is merely reflecting the approach of his predecessors in the field of Kaläm, even if he makes relatively little use of direct scriptural quotes for his theological purposes. What is interesting, though, is how he blurs the lines between rational and traditional arguments in his presentation, since he often quotes scripture or tradtions as part of what he calls a dalïl. 2.1.2 Reflections of the Minhaj in the Kashshäf Whatever the final evaluation of the Minhäj as a theological work is, it is impor tant in that it incorporates Quranic references. In the Minhäj we are presented with 28 Quranic passages which had a Mu tazilite connection, if not content, for al-Zamakhsharï. While the use of these passages in Mu tazilite treatises prob ably did not start with al-Zamakhsharï, what is of interest is how far their Mu tazilite connection or content is to be found in the Kashshäf. Studying the Minhäj and the Kashshäf allows us to see al-Zamakhsharï's interpretative pro cess at work from both ends. In the Minhäj we saw him illustrating or defending his theological positions with reference to the Quran; in the Kashshäf we can see the same process starting from the Quran. What, then, do we see when we study al-Zamakhsharï's commentary on these 28 passages in the Kashshäf! The stat istics are shown in Table 1. A careful examination of the exegesis of these verses or passages reveals that in only ten cases (35.7%) does al-Zamakhshan raise the theological points for which he used them in the Minhäj. This does not mean that in his commentary on some of the remaining eighteen passages (64.3%) he does not express ideas that could be attributed to a Mutazilite position. Seven of these eighteen verses (38.9%) have some Mutazilite content while the other 11 (61.1%) do not. L Gardet, "'Ilm al-Kaläm" EI2 3: 1146.

This means that in approximately 60% of the 28 verses Mutazilite content can be found, and that more than half of these (58.8%) are in the Minhäj. In 40% of the cases nothing Mutazilite was raised. An example of the intermediary situation can be found in al-Zamakhshan's commentary, which he brings forth in the seventh chapter of the Minhäj on the Promise and the Threat as scriptural indications (sing, mäni al-sam ) prohi biting prophetic intercession for the grave sinner (see pp. 38-9 (E); p. 75 (A)). He here presents passages from four verses (in italics below) without further comment: Q24:23; 40:18; 2:48/45; 39:19/20.41 The first passage might also indi cate what, for al-Zamakhsharf, amounted to a grave sin, although the main theme of these passages is definitely elsewhere. Q24:23: Surely those who cast it up on women in wedlock that are heedless but believing shall be accursed in the present world and the world to come; and there awaits them a mighty chastisement,42 Q40:18: And warn them against the Day of the Imminent when, choking with anguish, the hearts are in the throats and the evil doers have not one loyal friend, no intercessor to be heeded. Q2: 48/45: And beware of a day when no soul for another shall give sat isfaction, and no intercession shall be accepted from it, nor any counter poise be taken, neither shall they be helped. Q39: 19/20: He against whom the word of chastisement is realized - shalt thou deliver him out of the Fire?43 When the commentary on these verses in the Kashshäf is examined, we note that at Q24:23 al-Zamakhsharî does not raise the matter of Quranic impediments to prophetic intercession for the grave sinner. In his commentary on Q40:18, he devotes a few lines to the topic of intercession (shqfaa), saying that it is an additional favour (ziyädat al-tafaddul) and only those who repent receive it, a position similar to that expressed in the Minhäj in his explanation of the tradition on prophetic intercession: "[My] intercession is for the grave offenders among my nation".44 His commentary in the Kashshäf would, of course, cover 41 Schmidtke, Minhäj, 38 (E), 75 (A). 42 In the Minhäj, the text runs: "inna lladhïna yarmüna l-muhsanäti" ilä qawlihi "wa-lahum 'adhäbun 'azïmun". 43 The verse is addressed to Muhammad. 44 Kashshäf 4: 163. Al-Zamakhsharï supports his interpretation in the Kashshäf with refer ences to Q4:174 and a tradition reporting that al-Hasan al-Basn said, "By God! They will have absolutely no intercessor (wa-llähi mä yakünu lahum shaft al-batta)".</page><page sequence="18">64 ANDREW J. LANE prophetic intercession, but al-Zamakhshan does not raise this topic, nor is there reason to assume he was thinking solely of prophetic intercession, since the verse speaks of "loyal friend" (hamïm) and "intercessor" {shaft). At Q2:48/ 45, the topic of intercession for the "disobedient" (al-usät) is dealt with in the same way, but there is no specific reference to the intercession of a pro phet.45 Finally, although in his commentary on Q39:19/20, al-Zamakhshan makes it clear that God alone can release a soul from the Fire and, as a conse quence, the role of the prophet is non-existent, he does not raise the topic of intercession (shafö'a). The focus is the prophet's actions in this world and his inability to bring about faith, not his intercessory powers in the next world.46 In the Kashshäf, then, the interdiction of prophetic intercession is not men tioned explicitly in the commentary on any of these verses; nor are they pre sented as being "revealed prohibitions". In the first verse nothing is said on the topic. In the second, intercession is mentioned as an additional favour for those who have repented; in the third, there is a question about intercession for the disobedient not being accepted; and in the fourth, the stress is on God's omnipotence, that is, that Muhammad can neither create faith in this world nor save those who merit chastisement in the next. While, in the previous example, al-Zamakhshan's commentary reflects Mu'tazilite ideas not specifically mentioned in the Minhäj, elsewhere in the Kashshäf we find him discussing, with respect to certain Quranic passages, the ideas he raised in the Minhäj when these passages were quoted. For example, the first cluster of Quranic references in the Minhäj, alluded to above, contains four verses: Q6:103; 7:143/139; 22:73/72; 4:153/152. They are incorporated into a discussion in Chapter 2 on the impossibility of seeing God. In the commentary on some of these verses in the Kashshäf we see some of the same ideas. In his commentary on Q6:103: lä tudrikuhu l-absäru ("The eyes attain him not") in the Kashshäf, al-Zamakhsharî is evidently in the same zone as when com posing the Minhäj. There he uses only a part of Q6:103; the full verse is as follows: The eyes attain Him not, but he attains the eyes; He is the All-subtle, the All-aware. lä tudrikuhu l-absaru wa-huwayudriku l-absära wa-huwa l-latïfu l-khabïru. In the Kashshäf he first defines "vision (al-basar)" as: "the subtle substance that God has set in the sense of sight, by which what can be seen is attained".47 He then explains the passage: 45 Kashsháf 1: 165. Al-Zamakhsharï says: "If you were to say, 'Is there any proof therein that intercession for the disobedient is not accepted?' then I would say, 'Yes, because He did not allow one soul to pay another's due, by which it would be free from [what was its due for] either an action or an omission; nor did He allow that intercession be accepted from it. So it is known that the intercession of an advocate is not accepted for those who disobey'". 46 Kashsháf4: 123. 47 Kashsháf 2:51: al-basr huwa l-jawhar al-latif alladhl rakkabahu lläh fi hässat al-nazr, bihi tudraku l-mubsarât - the last part could read: bihi tudriku l-mubsarät ("by which you perceive what can be seen").</page><page sequence="19">MU'TAZILITE THEOLOGY IN A L - Z A M A K H S H A R I ' S KASHSHÀF 65 The meaning is that the eyes do not connect with Him and do not attain Him, because in His essence He is above being seen. The eyes connect only with what is in some position, either primarily or secondarily, like bodies (ajsäm) and forms (hay at).48 In the Kashshäf he tends to repeat himself and even gives one part of the verse as an explanation of another. Nevertheless, it is clear that he is expressing the same ideas as those in Chapter 2 of the Minhä j, where he used the verse as a proof-text, though here the development is greater. The philosophical vocabulary is present, and he states clearly that only bodies and forms can be perceived by the faculty of sight, but that God is in his essence beyond such visible things, too subtle to be seen, although he sees all and nothing is too subtle for his perception. It could be noted, however, that al-Zamakhshar! seems to be grappling with either the ideas or the vocabulary, for in his commentary on the last three short phrases he uses words derived from the fourth form of the root d-r-k a total of eight times.49 The next relevant verse is Q7 :143/139: lan tarän I ("Thou shalt not see Me"). This is a long verse, containing a dialogue between God and Moses, and al-Zamakhshan devotes a lot of ink to it.50 Of greatest interest here is the connec tion between lan tarânï or other parts of the verse, and the Kaläm topic for which it was used in Chapter 2 of the Minhäj. When al-Zamakhshan comes to the state ment lan tarânï, it is evident that he has this Kaläm topic clearly in mind. When he asks his theoretical question as to why Moses should have asked to see God, since as a prophet he should have known better, his question is six lines long and covers a number of theological ideas that are only touched upon in the Minhäj.51 He shows that God cannot be seen because of what he is and 48 Kashshäfl: 52. For the technical terms used here, see R. Arnaldez, "Hay'a", El2 3: 301-2; S. van den Bergh, "Djawhar", EI2 2: 493-4; Tj. de Boer, "Djism", EI 2: 553-5. 49 Kashshäf 2: 52. His commentary can be summarized as follows: Quran wa-huwa yudriku l-absara but he attains the eyes wa-huwa l-latffu He is the All-subtle l-khablru the All-aware The core dialogue here runs: Commentary Because of the subtlety of his perception (idräk), he attains those subtle substances (Jawähir latïfà) that no one else can. He is too subtle to be attained by the eyes (yultafu 'an an tudrikahu l-absär). [He is All-aware] of all subtle things {kull latïf), for he attains the eyes; they are not too subtle to be attained by him. he said, 'Oh my Lord, show me, that I may behold qäla rabbi arinï anzur ilayka Thee!' Said He, 'Thou shalt not see Me; qäla lan taränl The question is: "If you were to say, 'How could Moses - Peace be upon him - have asked that, he being one of the most knowledgeable of people as to God and what is and is not permitted concerning him; and as to his being above being seen, which is to be attained by one of the senses? This is true only for something that is in a position, but it is impossible for what is neither a body nor an accident to be in a position. The Mujbirites' refusing to say it is rationally absurd is not binding, since it is not the first</page><page sequence="20">66 ANDREW J. LANE then establishes that Moses' request was made only to silence those who had asked - a point already made in the Minhäj.52 He returns to this second point, stressing that such a request would imply a crass anthropomorphism unworthy of a prophet.53 Throughout the commentary on this verse, the theological ideas of the Mu'tazilites are clear. If any greater indication of where al-Zamakhsharï stands were needed, there is the list of the early members of the school he gives, from the founding fathers to its most famous theologians of the fourth/ tenth century: Wäsil ibn 'Ata' (d. 748), 'Amr ibn 'Ubayd (d. 761), al-Nazzäm (d. 836), Abü 1-Hudhayl (d. 841?), Abü All al-Jubbâ'ï (d. 915) and his son Abü Häshim al-Jubbâ'ï (d. 933). Both the ideas and the vocabulary used to express them are identical to those found in the Minhäj. In the Kashshäf, however, the topic is developed far more than in the theological treatise. The extra time and space allow al-Zamakhsharî to take a swipe at his opponents (whom he calls the "Mujbira"); he argues that what they say does not hold up since they are sinners! The third verse used in the Minhäj to illustrate the point is Q22:73/72: lan yakhluqü dhubäban (" (those) ... shall never create a fly)". In the Minhäj, the phrase was used merely to indicate impossibility, the impossibility of seeing time they act arrogantly or commit a sin. How could he (i.e. Moses) have demanded it, when he had said - when 'the earthquake seized' those who had said openly, 'Show us God,' - 'Wilt Thou destroy us for what the foolish ones of us have done? [It is only Thy trial, whereby] Thou leadest astray whom Thou wilt' (Q7: 155/154). So he washed his hands of their action and called them foolish and lost". The answer is: "I would say, 'He asked to see only in order to censure those whom he called foolish and lost, and whose actions he washed his hands of; and in order to silence them. That is because, when they asked to see, he denied it to them and let them know about sin and told them about the truth; but they were obstinate and persisted in their obstinacy, and said, 'No escaping it! We will not believe you (lan nu'mina laka) until we see God openly.' So he wanted them to hear the clear revelation inass) from God about the impossibility of [what they were asking]. That is his word, 'lan tarânï (Thou shalt not see me),' so that they would be sure and the doubt that had entered them would depart from them. It was for this that he said, 'rabbi arinï anzur ilayka (Oh my Lord, show me, that I may behold Thee!)" (Kashshä/2: 144-5). By Mujbira, al-Zamakhsharî means his orthodox opponents in general; see W. M. Watt, "Djabariyya", El2 2: 365. 52 Schmidtke, Minhäj, 17 (E), 55 (A) ("[Mose's statement] - peace be upon him-"show me, that I may behold Thee!' is not binding because he said this [only] in order to silence those who had demanded to see (God) by proving its impossibility and in order to stop their arguing when they heard His saying 'Thou shalt not see Me.'"). 53 Al-Zamakhsharî writes: "And his saying 'that I may behold Thee! ' with the meaning that it has of'to be in front of, to face', which is pure anthropomorphism and crude materialism, is a proof that it is an interpretation of their demands and an account of what they said. The one riding the camel (sahib al-jamal) was too great to make God something that could be looked towards or that could be in front of the sense of sight, for how [could that be] with one who is more deeply rooted in the knowledge of God Most High than Wäsil ibn 'Ata', Amr ibn 'Ubayd, al-Nazzäm, Abu 1-Hudhayl, the two shaykhs and all of the Kaläm theo logians?" (Kashshäf2:\4S). The two shaykhs referred to here are Abu Alï al-Jubbâ'ï (d. 303/915) and his son Abü Häshim al-Jubbâ'ï (321/933). From what I have been able to dis cover, sähib al-jamal is a title given to Muhammad. Here, however, al-Zamakhsharî seems to be using it with reference to Moses. Otherwise, he either suddenly started to speak about Muhammad (not to attribute the Quranic passage to him) or else his text was corrupted in transmission and an intermediary passge is missing.</page><page sequence="21">MUTAZILITE THEOLOGY IN A L - Z A M A K H S H A RI' S KASHSHAF 67 God; no context was given for it. In fact, the verse deals with the gods of the polytheists, which cannot create even so much as a fly. In the Kashshäf, al-Zamakhshan does not make any reference to seeing God or to any point from the theological debate that surrounds the phrase in the Minhäj.54 In the Kashshäf it illustrates the impotence of the polytheists' idols; in the Minhäj it illustrates the impossibility of seeing God. The fourth and final verse used in the first cluster of Minhäj is Q4:153/152: fa-qälü arinä lläha jahratan fa-akhadhathumu l-saiqatu bi-zulmihim ("for they said, 'Show us God openly'. And the thunderbolt took them for their evil doing"). In the Minhäj, al-Zamakhshan states clearly that the punishment was due to their demanding something impossible, that is, seeing God, and gives an example of Abraham's demanding something that was possible: If they had asked for something that [was] possible, they would not have done evil and would not have been taken by the thunderbolt, as when [Abraham] demanded the revivification of [the] dead, [for] he did no evil and was not taken by the thunderbolt.55 In the Kashshäf, at this passage, there is no reference to the theological ques tions that were the context for its use in the Minhäj. Al-Zamakhshan merely states that the Quranic "for their evil doing" (bi-zulmihim) means "because of their asking to see" (bi-sabab su'älihim al-ru'ya). He then gives the same example about Abraham in practically the same words, ending with a shot at his opponents (whom he calls the "Mushabbiha"): "May evil and thunderbolts befall the Mushabbiha".56 With Q4:153/152, the first cluster of verses from the Minhäj has been exam ined. While the commentary on the first two verses in this cluster reflects Mu'tazilite theological thinking, the other two do not; Q22:73/72 does not even deal with the theme of seeing God. One might question the meaning of these statistics. What do they say about the Mu'tazilite content of the Kashshäf m general, assuming that one can extrapolate from them? If it is recalled that in five of the Minhäf s nine chapters, al-Zamakhshañ made no direct reference to the Quran, the first idea that springs to mind is that in al-Zamakhshañ's Kaläm, Quranic passages played a secondary role. Furthermore, considering that al-Zamakhsharï was not primarily a theolo gian, there is no need to assume that his knowledge of the minutiae of Kaläm debate and the Mu'tazilite positions was excessive. Not only was the Minhäj a brief summary of al-Zamakhshañ's theological position, as Madelung says, but it could also have been all that he was capable of writing on the topic. As for the Kashshäf, al-Zamakhshañ appears to manifest an overall lack of concern there for the specific "Mu'tazilite content" of the verses that he used in the Minhäj. As shown above, there was a lack of reciprocity between the Kashshäf 54 Kashshäf 3: 172-3. 55 Schmidtke, Minhäj, 17 (E), 55 (A). 56 Kashshäf 1:618. The Mushabbiha would be those guilty of tashbïh, that anthropomorphists.</page><page sequence="22">68 ANDREW J. LANE and the Minhäj at the 28 verses used in the latter; for in about 65% of cases, what was to be found in the Minhäj did not reappear in the Kashshäf. Al-Zamakhsharï was clearly not constantly thinking about Kaläm as he composed his Quran com mentary. This is in line with the results of the study of Q44 and Q54. Consequently, a comparison with the Minhäj fi usül al-dïn supports the view that the Kashshäf was not written primarily as a vehicle for Mu tazilite theology. 2.2 Rukn al-DTn (Ibn) al-Malâhimï's (d. 536/1141) al-Mu tamad fi usul al-din In Rukn al-DIn îbn al-Malâhimï, "the mam representative of the school of Abü 1-Husayn al-Basn in the first half of the 6th/12th century", we find a scholar whose lifespan corresponds with that of al-Zamakhshan.57 Ibn al-Malâhimï taught al-Zamakhshan theology, while the latter taught the former exegesis.58 Furthermore, the extant parts of Ibn al-Malâhimï's Kaläm work, al-Mutamad fi usül al-dîn, have been published and are available for scrutiny.59 This work could offer us a direct and contemporary source for the Mu'tazilism of the Kashshâf.60 However, the fact that material is found in both the Mutamad and the Kashshâf is hardly a guarantee that the former was a source for the latter. It may be that al-Zamakhsharï had completed the Kashshâf before Ibn al-Malâhimï even began the Mutamad, and that they both drew on earlier, com mon sources; no dates indicate when the latter was finished so it is necessary to keep this point in mind. 57 Schmidtke, Minhäj, 8. Rukn al-DTn's exact name is uncertain. Following McDermott and Madelung I will refer to him consistently as Ibn al-Malâhimï. 58 Ahmad b. Mustafa b. Khalll Tâshkubn Zäda (d. 968/1560—61), Miftâh al-saäda wa-misbäh al-siyäda ß mawduät al-'ulüm, ed. Kämil Kämil Bakri and 'Abd al-Wahhäb Abu 1-Nür (Cairo: Där al-Kutub al-Hadîtha, [1968]), 2, 100. 59 Ed. McDermott and Madelung (London: al-Hoda, 1991). According to Madelung, Ibn al-Malähiml states in the introduction to the Mutamad that his intention is "to condense, complete and update" 'Abu 1-Husayn al-Basn's largest Kaläm work, the Kitäb Tasaffuh al-adilla, in which he critically scrutinized (tasaffaha) the arguments of the Mu'tazilï scholars as much as those of their opponents". However, he adds that Ibn al-Malâhimï does not go much beyond the end of this book, his main but not only source (Mutamad, xi).The present edition of the Mutamad is over 600 pages long and includes dozens of references to the Quran, although there is no index at the end of their edition. The edition is divided into two parts (sing, juz '), the first and the third, following the divisions of the manuscripts that were used. According to the introduction, this edition contains most of the first two parts and the complete third part of the Mutamad, even if only the first and third parts are indicated in the table of contents. This is because the section heading for Part 2 in the manuscript was omitted, and not because the second part was missing. The fourth part, however, is missing, although the editors have incor porated one chapter (bâb) that was found in a manuscript of another of Ibn al-Malâhimï's works, the Kitäb al-Faiq, described as "a greatly abridged version of the Mutamad" (Mutamad, xiv). Each part is divided into three large sections of unequal length; each of these has a number of chapters (sing, bâb), some of which are divided into smaller sections (sing, fast); there are a few independent sections called fast also. 60 There is no need to limit Mutazilite sources to this one author. Al-Zamakhshan had come into contact with the teachings and Quran commentary of the Mutazilite Zaydi imäm al-Häkim al-Jushamï (d. 494/1101) through the latter's student Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Ishäq al-Khwärazml, although he did not draw directly on this commentary when com posing the Kashshäf. See Madelung, "Theology", 487; "al-Zamakhshan", EI2 Suppl., fasc. 11-12: 341.</page><page sequence="23">MU'TAZILITE THEOLOGY IN AL-ZAMAKHSHARI'S KASHSHAF 69 2.2.1 Overall view on the use of the Quran in the Mutamad A study of the Mutamad shows, first of all, that the Quranic verses are not spread evenly throughout the entire work. In fact, they are quite limited. Besides a few in the opening pages of the first part and at the very end of the single chapter from the fourth part (for the divisions of the Mutamad, see note 59), Quranic references in the main body of the book are limited to nine chapters, four chapters in the first part and five in the third part. If it is taken into account that the first part has twenty-two chapters and two independent sec tions, and that the third part has fourteen chapters, two of which have three sub sections (sing, fasl), to say nothing of the final fifty-page section on sects opposed to the Islamic doctrine of tawhïd (that has no divisions into chapters and subsections); then it becomes clear that Ibn al-Malâhimï uses the Quran as sparingly here as al-Zamakhshari did in the Minhäj. As in the Minhäj, verses tend to be presented in clusters in chapters that range from one page to nearly one hundred. In the mam body of the Mutamad, Ibn al-Malâhimï makes about 160 refer ences to nearly 140 Quranic passages, either individual verses, several verses together, or simply parts of verses. Occasionally he refers to a verse more than once but rarely more than twice; the majority of the verses mentioned in the Mutamad are used only once. Ibn al-Malâhimï indicates on several occasions that what he has given by way of Quranic references is not everything that could have been supplied, writing such things as wa-ghayr dhälika, ilä ghayr dhälika or ilä ghayr dhälika min al-äyät after a number of Quranic citations. Methodologically I will try to establish here whether any of the theological ideas Ibn al-Malâhimï buttressed with Quranic passages in the Mutamad are repeated or reflected in al-Zamakhsharf s commentary on the same verses in the Kashshäf. Because of the large number of such references, it is not possible here to give an exhaustive comparison of their use in both works. As was the case with the more limited Minhäj fi usül al-dïn, a few examples will be chosen to illustrate Ibn al-Malâhimï's use of a verse or cluster of verses in the Mutamad; al-Zamakhsharî's comments on these same verses in the Kashshäf will then be presented. These verses will be drawn from an earlier study of approximately twenty verses (approximately 13% of the 140 or so) that were examined with respect to their use in the Kashshäf and the Mutamad.61 A few remarks will then be offered as to the extent to which al-Zamakhshan employed Ibn al-Malâhimî's Mutamad when writing the Kashshäf 2.2.2 Ibn al-MalahimVs Mutamad: a source for the Kashshaf? Part 3, ch. 11 of the Mutamad deals with the meaning of describing God as being one and the meaning of divine unity. Ibn al-Malähiml here uses Q2:163/158: wa-ilähukum ilähun wähidun lä iläha illä huwa l-rahmänu l-rahlmu ("Your God is One God; there is no god but He, the All-merciful, the All-compassionate"); it occurs alone in a discussion about what it means The original study was carried out for the author's PhD thesis and involved a detailed comparison of what al-Zamakhshan and Ibn al-Malâhiml had to say on approximately twenty verses in their respective works.</page><page sequence="24">70 ANDREW J. LANE when the Mu tazilite teachers (shuyükhuna) describe God as being one (wähid). Ibn al-Malähiml says that one of three things is meant:62 1. A single essence that cannot be divided or broken into parts (dhät wähida lä yajüzu 'alayhi l-tajazzu ' wa-1-tab'ïd). This is not applied to God in the way of praise Çalâ jihat al-madh), since others too are described in this way. 2. No one shares with God the qualities that are attributed to him in the way that they are attributed to him; in this sense, it is said that he has no second. 3. God is the one god (iläh wähia), who alone deserves worship Çibâda) and has no partners in it. Ibn al-Malähiml then quotes part of Q2:163/158: "Your God is One God; there is no god but He, the All-merciful, the All-compassionate". Ibn al-Malähiml concludes the third point by referring to the last words of the Quranic passage he quotes: "By these two qualities He (May He be exalted) is praised". In this list we can see three aspects of divine unity underlined, or the three angles from which the idea is viewed. These can be described as: (i) internal unity, that is, indivisibility; (ii) uniqueness, that is, God is completely different from everything else (tanzïh); and (iii) external unity, that is, there is no god with God. In the Kashshäf at Q2:163/158, al-Zamakhshan mentions the third meaning, which Ibn al-Malâhimï illustrated by a reference to the same verse, i.e. al-Zamakhshan speaks of God's unity in terms of his being the only god, of being unique (sole, single or one of its kind, and not exceptional, inimitable or matchless, which is the second understanding given by Ibn al-Malâhimï). He also refers to the two epithets (rahmän and rahïm), as did Ibn al-Malâhimï; however, his comments are more in line with Ibn al-Malâhimï's second point, that of God's incomparability with creatures in his attributes. He writes: "One God": unique with respect to divinity, with absolutely no one sharing it with him; it is not correct to call anyone other than him a god. "There is no god but He": affirmation of unity, denying [other gods] and affirming him. "The All-merciful, the All-compassionate": Lord of all benefits, both in their sources and in their developments; no one other than he is with this quality. Everything other than he is either a grace or object of a grace.63 In al-Zamakhshan's comments here, we see some similarity with the Mutamad. However, he gives a wider interpretation of the verse than Ibn al-Malâhimï in that he incorporates ideas of tanzïh. Furthermore, while this would also have been an occasion for al-Zamakhshan to give the summary of the shaykhs' views that Ibn al-Malähiml did, he chooses not to do so. 62 Ibn al-Malähiml, Mutamad, 502-3. Ibn al-Malâhimï compares the first use of the word to its application to the atom (jawhar); see S. van den Bergh, "Djawhar", EI2 2: 493-4. 63 Al-Kashshäf 1: 236. The passage here seems a little like a flow of consciousness. Al-Zamakhshan ends his comments on this verse with a sabab al-nuzül: "It was said: The polytheists had three hundred and sixty idols around the Ka'ba, and when they heard of this verse, they were amazed and said, 'If you speak the truth, then bring a sign so that by it we may know your truthfulness'; and the verse was revealed (fa-nazalat)". As it stands now, this occasion for revelation implies that the verse had been heard of before it was revealed.</page><page sequence="25">MU'TAZILITE THEOLOGY IN A L - Z A M A K H S H A RI ' S KASHSHÄF 71 Part 3, ch. 3 of the Mutamad, dealing with the impossibility of God's being a location for accidents, contains three references to the Quran, all of which are grouped together. Concerning the meaning of verse Q89:22/23: "and Thy Lord comes (wa-jä'a rabbuka)" (and that of parts of two other verses (Q2:210/206; 6:158/159) that speak of the Lord's coming (using the verbs ja a and atä)), Ibn al-Malahiml says that, although this verse speaks of God's essence (dhät), what is meant are his acts (af äl) and his punishments (*uqübät).64 His answer involves listing other verses (Q59:2; 16:26/28) to explain how these three are to be understood, and to show that the true meaning of the verses is not the appar ent one. Ibn al-Malâhimï ends this section with a commentary on Q2:210/206: "What do they look for, but that God shall come to them in the cloud-shadows?" (one of the verses he has just referred to) that was transmitted on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas, who is quoted as saying: "He will come to them with the promise and the threat (al-wad wa-1-waïd), and he will reveal to them what of the command (ial-amr) was hidden from them". It is interesting to note how this very Mutazilite tradition has made its way into Ibn al-Malâhimï's treatise.65 In the Kashshäf, al-Zamakhsharï makes some comments on Q89:22/23: "and Thy Lord comes (wa-jä'a rabbuka)". However, while he raises essentially the same question as Ibn al-Malâhimï concerning predicating motion of God, his answer is different. In the Mutamad, this verse was used in Ibn al-Malâhimï's dis cussion of the essence of God, his movement, acts and punishments, and God's "coming" meant His acts and His punishments; in the Kashshäf al-Zamakhshan sees it as an expression of incomparable divine majesty and glory. One might argue that al-Zamakhshaii's view is similar to Ibn al-Malâhimï's here, in that he says that predicating the verb "to come" of God is "a comparison to the mani festation of the signs of [God's] might and the demonstration of the effects of his power and authority" and, therefore, in a sense he is saying that the verse speaks of the manifestion of something other than the essence (dhät) of God. However, the rest of the passage indicates that al-Zamakhshaff is more concerned with the great ness of God's glory and majesty than with questions of the divine essence, for he writes: "In this, [God's] state is comparable to the state of a king who, if he is pre sent himself, there appear with his presence effects of awe and command that are not evident with the presence of all of his armies and of all his ministers and lead ing personalities together without exception.'"66 64 These passages read: Q2: 210/206: "What do they look for, but that God shall come to them (ya'tiyahum Allah) in the cloud-shadows?" and Q6:158/159: "What, do they look for the angels to come to them (to 'tiyahum al-malä ïka), nothing less, or that thy Lord should come (ya 'tiya rabbukum)T 65 Ibn al-Malähiml, Mutamad, 327-8. This is a very Mu'tazilite understanding of the verse that has been placed on the lips of Ibn 'Abbâs, since we see in it references to two of the five Mu'tazilite principles. 66 Kashshäf4: 754-5: "If you were to say, 'What is the meaning of predicating [the verb] "to come" of God, since movement and change of place are permitted only concerning those who can be in a position?' I would say, 'It is a comparison to the manifestation of the signs of his might and the demonstration of the effects of his power and authority. In this, his state is comparable to the state of a king who, if he is present himself, there appear with his presence effects of awe and command that are not evident with the pres ence of all of his armies and of all his ministers and leading personalities together with out exception.'"</page><page sequence="26">72 ANDREW J. LANE Reading Ibn al-Malâhimï's Mutamad, it is striking how very little direct use he makes of the Quran in this six-hundred page book. When he does use the revealed text, the impression is the same as that left by al-Zamakhshan's use of it in the Minhäj: the role is secondary. When the comparison is made with the Kashshäf at the twenty verses originally studied, practically nowhere in al-Zamakhshan's commentary on these verses can specific ideas expressed in the Mutamad be found. It is only in his commentary on Q2:163 and Q5:116 (not mentioned in this article) that al-Zamakhshañ raises explanations that resemble material found in the Mutamad. Even in the former case, the simi larities are counterbalanced by differences. Something similar is seen in the commentary on Q89:22 (above), where al-Zamakhshan asks essentially the same question as Ibn al-Malähiml, only to give a different answer. For the remaining verses, there are no similarities between the Mutamad and the Kashshäf. Thus, if these twenty verses are indicative, the Mutamad played no role in the formulation of the ideas and explanations in the Kashshäf, where similarities are apparent they can probably be attributed to chance. Since Ibn al-Malahiml was al-Zamakhshañ's teacher, this probably means that al-Zamakhshan had no access to the Mutamad. The lack of common ground between the two works reflects the scarcity of shared ideas between al-Zamakhshañ's own work in Kaläm, the Minhäj fi usül al-dïn, and the Kashshäf, and recalls earlier remarks concerning al-ZamakhsharT's preparation as a theologian and his lack of interest in incorpor ating into his commentary even his own theological ideas. Furthermore, consid ering this comparison with the Minhäj, it would seem that even if al-ZamakhsharT had had access to the Mutamad before he began the Kashshäf, its ideas might not have been reproduced there. In any case, based on our survey of the use of the Quran in a number of chapters of the Mutamad, it is clear that this work cannot be considered a source for the Kashshäf. 3. The third approach: the matter of Khalaqa l-Qur'än67 3.1 Background68 The matter of the creation of the Quran is intimately linked to both Mu tazilite theology and the Trial or Inquisition (mihna) the 'Abbäsid Caliph al-Ma'mün set in motion four months before his death in 218/833, and which continued under his successors al-Mu'tasim (d. 227/842), al-Wäthiq (d. 232/847) and al-Mutawakkil (d. 247/861) until the latter finally put an end to it in 237/851-2.69 Two phases in the development of the doctrine of the created Quran can be observed, the 67 The results of this research were presented at the 2005 annual meeting of the American Academy of Religion in Philadelphia. 68 The following is based primarily on Wilfred Madelung, "The origins of the controversy concerning the creation of the Koran", in P. Morewedge (ed.), Islamic Philsophical Theology (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1979), 504—25. 69 See M. Hinds, "Mihna", EI2 7: 2-6 and John A.

Towards the middle of the eighth century, those who held that the Quran was created focused on the anthropomorphism (tashbïh) of the more traditionalist groups whose concept of God was based on such verses as Q4:164, which spoke of God's having spoken directly to Moses (kallama llähu Müsä taklïman) and Q4:125, which spoke of God's having taken Abraham for a friend (wa-ttakhadha llähu Ibrâhïma khalïlan).70 For those who held that the Quran was created, God could not be said to have spoken any more than he could be said to have taken a creature for a friend; God was above such human attributes as speech and friendship. God, therefore, created the sound of speech that was heard, but it was not God's speech in a literal sense. Those opposed to this position did not respond directly but stated that the Quran was God's speech; they sought to show the inti mate connection between the Quran and God. This, in fact, was nothing new. What was new was for this group to add either a condemnation of those who said that the Quran was created, or a denial that the Quran was created, initially with the negative "It is not created (laysa bi-makhlüqy rather than the more posi tive "It is uncreated (ghayr makhlüq)". However, during this early period in the debate, the denial of the creation of the Quran was not meant to imply in any way that it was eternal (qadïm). The traditionalists' shift towards the doctrine of the eternal Quran was attribu table to developments in the arguments of their opponents, the Mu tazilites and other asserters of the creation of the Quran, in the decades leading up to the mihna. The latter did not deny that God truly spoke, though they did argue that God produced speech without speech organs; furthermore, they held that the Quran was truly God's speech. What was new was the refusal to admit that anything could be co-eternal with God. To assert that the Quran was not created, i.e. that it was not temporal, was to say that it was eternal, which would destroy the unity of God by setting up something co-eternal with him. The traditionalist response rejected the Mutazilite view, noting, in particular, that it implied that God was originally ignorant (for the Quran contained the names and knowledge of God) and that there was a time when God did not speak. The result of the mihna, al-Ma'mün's motives for which are still debated (cf. note 69), hinged on the acceptance by the 'ulamä ' (even under duress) of the statement that the Quran was created. The result of this Trial, however, was not the imposition of the doctrine of the created Quran, but its opposite: the acceptance of the doctrine of the uncreated, eternal Quran. As the doctrine of the created Quran was a Mu tazilite tenet, they were discredited, and what was to become Sunnism developed unhindered. This did not mean, as Hinds says, that "the inspiration for the mihna necessarily came from Mutazills or that its initial purpose was the imposition of Mu'tazilï doctrine"; rather, it was simply the case that, "in the context of the mihna, Mu'tazilï interests overlapped considerably with those of al-Ma'mün, for all that they were not 70 Names associated with the created Quran at this time are Ja'd ibn Dirham (d. 125/743) and Jahm ibn Safwän (d. 128/745), both executed towards the end of the Umayyad period. See G. Vajda, "Ibn Dirham", EI2 3: 747-8 and W. M. Watt, "Djahm b. Safwän", EI2 2: 388.</page><page sequence="28">74 ANDREW J. LANE identical".71 Neither did the result of the Trial mean that the Mu'tazilites and their doctrines disappeared: they continued to exist and even to thrive, influen cing theological traditions both within and outside of Islam. Of Khwärazm, where al-Zamakhshari was born more than two centuries after the end of the mihna, Gimaret writes that Mu'tazilism continued to be the dominant ideology "to such an extent that outside this area khwärazmi was understood as a syno nym of mutazilV'.72 In such a milieu, then, beginning a Quran commentary with the words "Praise be to God who created the Quran (al-hamdu li-lläh alladhï khalaqa l-Qur an)" would not only immediately indicate the theological position of the author but would also call to mind the entire history of the mihna and the suffering traditionalist scholars underwent at the hands of political auth orities who had espoused this Mu'tazilite position. The aforementioned anecdote, found in a number of biographical dictionaries, says that al-Zamakhshan would have first written "Praise be to God who created the Quran (al-hamdu li-lläh alladhï khalaqa l-Qur 'art)" at the very beginning of the Kashshäf but then changed it to al-hamdu li-lläh alladhï ja'ala l-Qur'än when told that his commentary would be shunned by the people if he did not do so.73 Although none of the sources mentions copies of the Kashshäf that had either khalaqa or ja ala, the latter of which, Ibn Khallikän says, was used 71 M. Hinds, "Mihna", EI2 7: 5-6 This view contrasts with that held by Patton, who wrote: "When al-Rashîd died, the matter remained in the same position during the time of his son al-Amîn; but when al-Ma'mün succeeded some of the Mu'tazilites led him astray and made the doctrine of the creation of the Korân to appear plausible to him". Patton's source here is the Egyptian historian al-Maqrïzï (d. 1442); the "matter" he refers to is that the Quran was the uncreated Word of God (Walter M. Patton, Ahmed ibn Hanbal and the Mihna (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1897), 48-9). 72 D. Gimaret, "Mu'tazila", EI2 7:785. 73 Ahmad ibn Muhammad Ibn Khallikän (d. 681/1282), Wafayät al-a'yän wa-anbä' abnä' al-zamän, ed. Ihsän 'Abbäs (Beirut: Dar al-Thaqäfa, [1968]), 5: 170 [no. 711].

After noting Ibn Khallikän's comments in the pre face to his edition of the Kashshäf, Nassau-Lees writes: "It is not at all improbable that al-Zamakhshari originally did write Khalaqa - first because, instead of being ashamed of his doctrines, he was proud them; and secondly, because it would appear that the word Anzala is not his, for a different form of the same verb occurs in the next sentence, which, though not a breach of the rules of good composition, would here be an inele gancy. As to his having substituted the word J'ala (sic), the idea is absurd. To introduce the identical word in the same line twice in the same sense, would be a gross breach of the rules of good composition, and a blunder, that no man of sound sense would be guilty of accusing the most profound philoger and elegant scholar of his age (sic). The word J'ala (sic) is understood before the words Wjjc. Liljá which occur lower down, and will there, no doubt, be taken in the sense of Khalaqa. I am satisfied that Ibn Khallikán's statement, which I am surprised to see that al-Soyooti has endorsed, is with out foundation" (Calcutta: Matba'at al-LaysI, 1856-59, 1: 7-8, n.7). This does not mean that Nassau-Lees necessarily accepted that al-Zamakhshari wrote khalaqa l-Quran but rather that the latter would never have changed it to ja ala l-Qur 'än, as Ibn Khallikän maintains.</page><page sequence="29">MU'TAZILITE THEOLOGY IN A L - Z A M A K H S H A R T ' S KASHSHÄF 75 by the Mu tazilites with the meaning of the former anyway (wa-jaala 'indahum bi-manä khalaqa), those who give the report state that it was not al-Zamakhshan who changed the expression to "Praise be to God who revealed the Quran (al-hamdu li-llâh alladhï anzala l-Qur'än)" (which can be read today), even though they do not agree on who actually made the change.74 Ibn Khallikân s remark that ja ala and khalaqa have the same meaning merits comment. Wolfson has pointed out that the verb jaala differed from the verb khalaqa in that the former was used in the Quran in connection with itself while the latter was not. He illustrates this with a reference to Q43:2: "We have made it (Ja'alnähu) an Arabic Quran". Referring to Patton, Wolfson also says that, "in his defense of the uncreatedness of the Koran, [Ibn Hanbal] argued that the word ja'al does not mean the same as halak". In his first letter concern ing the creation of the Quran and the Trial, al-Ma'mün refers to Q43:2 as proof that God did create the Quran, for everything that God makes he also creates. In fact, during the Trial, an Ibn al-Bakkä 1-Akbar from Baghdad admitted that the Quran was something "made" (maf ül) and "newly produced" (muhdath), but he would not say that it was "created" (makhlüq). When questioned by al-Mu tasim's governor about the meaning ofjaala in Q43:2, Ibn Hanbal replied by quoting Q 105:5: "and He made them like green blades devoured (Ja-ja alahum ka-asfin ma 'kidin)", which also has the verb ja'ala, and asking the governor if anything could be concluded from this text about their having been created.75 Consequently, changing khalaqa to jaala (if any change ever took place) may not have been as unacceptable as Ibn Khallikân believed. In fact, in the second line of the muqaddima al-Zamakhshañ says that God made (Jaala) the Quran begin with his high praise (wa-ja'alahu bi-1-tahmïd mufta tahan), and yet nowhere in these sources do we find any objections to the use of this word. So the question remains: Did al-Zamakhshan begin the Kashshäf with this statement? In the next section, manuscript evidence will be examined to test the authenticity of this account. 3.2 Manuscripts of the Kashshäf: the main text and the marginal glosses76 A study of 110 manuscripts of the Kashshäf containing the muqaddima revealed that only five had a comment on the khalaqa l-Qur 'än, and these were not all of equal weight. Even some of these glossators rejected the idea that 74 Ibn Khallikän says that it was the modification of the people (isläh al-näs) (Wafayät 5: 170 [no. 711]), Abu 1-Fidä' that it was the work of al-Zamakhshan's companions (ashäb) (Abu 1-Fidä' Ismä'Tl ibn All (d. 732/1331), Kitäb al-Mukhtasar ß akhbär al-bashar (Beirut: Där al-Fikr, 1956-61) 2: 25 [juz' 5]), and Ibn al-Wardl merely states that the text was changed after his death (ba'dahu) (Zayn al-DTn 'Umar ibn al-Muzaffar Ibn al-Wardl (d. 749/1349), Ta'rïkh Ibn al-Wardï (al-Najaf: al-Matba'a al-Haydariyya, 1969) 2: 63). For the meanings of khalaqa, see R. Arnaldez, "Khalk", EI2 4: 980-8. 75 H. A. Wolfson, The Philosophy of the Kalam (Cambridge and London: Harvard University Press, 1976), 297; Patton, Ahmed ibn Hanbal, 58, 73-4, 90-1. For the tradi tionist and eponym of one of the four Sunnï madhähib, see H. Laoust, "Ahmad ibn Hanbal", EI2 1: 272-7. 76 The results in this section are based on a study of approximately 250 manuscripts of the Kashshäf, most of which were studied during a nine-week trip to Istanbul in the spring and summer of 2004.</page><page sequence="30">76 ANDREW J. LANE al-Zamakhsharî had first written khalaqa l-Qur'än and then changed it. In the margin of MS. Fatih 340, for example, there is a note next to the opening lines of the muqaddima that reads: I have heard some people say that the author wrote khalaqa in the auto graph copy (nuskhat al-asl), which is the umm al-Kashshäf, and then chan ged it to anzala out of fear (khawfan) but this is not so, for he was clear about his theological position (madhhab) throughout the entire introduc tion (khutba) and used not to conceal his position. I have studied the Kashshäf [written] in his handwriting (khatt) and I have seen neither era sure (kasht) nor change (taghylr) in it.77 A similar statement is found in the margin of MS. Fatih 344.78 MSS. Beyezit 575 and Köprülü 129, however, support the claim that al-Zamakhsharï first wrote khalaqa l-Qur'än and later changed it.79 In the first of these manuscripts, the gloss refers not to a personal study of the Kashshäf but to someone else's observations: Ibn al-'Amid Amïr Kätib al-Itqänl (May God have mercy on him) said, "I saw in the author's (May God have mercy on him) copy the word anzala written in someone else's handwriting. It was as if in its place there had been khalaqa, in accordance with what was his (i.e. al-Zamakhshan's) theological position (madhhabuhu)".so 77 The umm al-Kashshâf is the name al-Zamakhshan gives to the final draft he finished in Mecca in 528/1134; he refers to it in the postscript he added to this copy. My study indi cates that it was not the only copy used by medieval copyists. The other was stored at the Abu HanTfa tomb-shrine (mashhad) in Baghdad, and is referred to in the colophon of other manuscripts. The Baghdad copy could well have been the rough draft (sawäd) to which al-Zamakhshan refers in the postscript to the umm al-Kashshâf and from which he copied the umm al-Kashshäf in Mecca. See my A Traditional Mu'tazilite Qur'än Commentary, especially pp. 70-75. 78 MS. Fatih 344 is a complete copy of the Kashshäf finished on 20 Shawwäl 798H. MS. Fatih 340 is a copy of the commentary on Q1-Q33; it was finished in Dhü 1-Qa'da 732H. Although the glossator on MS. Fatih 340 writes "I have heard some people say" and "I have studied the Kashshäf ', it is highly unlikely that he did. This marginal gloss repeats almost verbatim what al-Yamanl (d. 750/1348-9) says on the matter ofkhalaqa l-Qur'än in his sharh on the Kashshäf completed in 733/1332. This gloss and al-Yamanl's com ment are confirmed by a more recent source; Nassau-Lees writes: "Firawzabádí (apud the Kashf al-Zonoon) on the other hand says, that he asked his master regarding it, and that he told him he had seen at Baghdad, in the Imàm Aboo Hanifah's tomb, the Author's autograph, and that it bore no signs of erasure or emendation (Kashshäf (ed. Calcutta, 1856-9) 1: 7, n.7). Firawzabádí is undoubtedly Flrüzäbätfl (d. 817/1415); the "master" may be TaqT al-Dïn al-Subkï (d. 756/1355) with whom he studied in Damascus in 750/1349 and then accompanied to Jerusalem the same year. See H. Fleisch, "FlrüzäbädT", EI2 2: 926-7; J. Schacht and C. E. Bosworth, "al-Subkï", EI2 9: 743-5. The copy of the Kashshäf referred to here, though, is that of Abu HanTfa's mashhad, and most likely not the umm al-Kashshäf 79 MSS. Beyezit 575-6 are a complete copy of the Kashshäf (Q1 -Q18 and Q19-Q114); they are undated. MS.

The fifth manuscript (MS. Shehid 'All Pasha 153) had only the word ja ala written above anzala,81 An isolated word is hard to interpret but this one is not necessarily as neutral as it might appear if it is viewed in the light of the dis cussion of Ibn Khallikän's comment given above. It would have been far more significant if the main text had had ja'ala and the gloss had been anzala. As it is now, it appears to be either a protest that ja'ala had the same meaning as anzala, or else a half-hearted attempt to put forward what might be considered the Mu'tazilite position. In the latter case the glossator was careful not to write the more incendiary khalaqa. An examination of the manuscript tradition shows that none of the manu scripts studied contained khalaqa l-Qur'än or ja ala l-Qur'än, neither was there any indication that a later hand had changed a copyist's khalaqa or ja'ala to anzala. In 95.5% of the manuscripts the khalaqa l-Qur'än received no attention at all. This question then was of interest to practically no one. In the 4.5% that did garner a few words from a glossator, only two said that al-Zamakhshan had originally written khalaqa l-Qur'än - less than 2% of the total: MS. Köprülü 129 which has a statement that cannot be substantiated; MS. Bayezit 575 which, on the other hand, is more interesting as the glossator cites from a known source, the aforementioned Ibn al-'Amïd Amir Kätib al-Itqânï (d. 758/1357) who made his own copy of the Kashshäf in 718H.82 The important question is: did al-Itqanl say what was attributed to him? He did see that the autograph of the Kashshäf at the Abü Hanïfa tomb-shrine for his own copy (MS. Lâleli 216, 718H) was made from it, and this was used by later copyists. However, only part of his copy was available (Q15-Q23) and so we do not know if he indicated that the introduction to the Kashshäf In 730/1330 (or 720/1320, GAL.Sp) he travelled to Damascus and Cairo, and then was pro fessor and qâdî in Baghdad. In Damascus again, he was al-Dhahabl's successor in the Dar al-Hadlth al-Zähiriyya, but following a quarrel with TaqT al-DIn al-Subkï (d. 756/1355) and others, he resigned and went to Egypt where he was professor in a new madrasa built in 757/1356 by Sarighitmish. He died in Egypt in 758/1357. In GAL.Sp the itinerary differs slightly in that al-Itqän! had only one stay in Damascus, the quarrel having taken place before he left for Baghdad, from where he then proceeded to Egypt. Brockelmann lists seven works attributed to al-Itqänl, several of which are commentaries on other works. These include The Crusher of the Mutazilites (Shaddäkhat al-Mu tazila), a risäla "against al-Zamakhsharï's interpretation (gegen Zamahsarïs Auslegung)", that is, his interpretation of the Quran (GAÚ 2: 79; GAL 2: 95; GAL.Sp 2: 87; for al-Subkî, see J. Schacht and C. E. Bosworth, "al-Subkî', El2 9: 743-5). 81 MS. Shehid 'All Pasha 153 was finished in Muharram 704H. 82 Part of al-Itqänl's copy of the Kashshäf exists. It is MS. Lâleli 216, copied in 718H in Baghdad (the copyist's name is given as Ibn 'Amid Kätib al-Itqänl); at the top of folio 2A a gloss says: al-räbf min al-Kashshäf li-Jär Alläh al-alläma bi-khatt Qawäm al-Dïn al-Itqänl. At the end, al-Itqäm writes: "[It] was copied from the autograph copy written in [the author's] handwriting, bequeathed to the tomb-shrine (mashhad) of the great Imam Abü Hanlfa (May God be pleased with him and his followers)". MS. Lâleli 216 contains only the commentary on Q15-Q23 and does not have the Shaddäkhat al-Mu tazila in the margins.</page><page sequence="32">78 ANDREW J. LANE had been changed. While al-Itqânï's copy is of no interest for the matter at hand, a possible source for his views may be found in two complete copies of the Kashshäf made using al-Itqânï's copy. MSS. Ali Emiri Efendi 80-81 (840H) were copied from that belonging to al-Itqânï, and MS. Nurosmaniye 290/399 (1050H) was collated with the one belonging to him.83 Each copy has the usual expression, anzala l-Qur an, in the introduction, and neither has margin alia to indicate that there had been anything different in either al-Itqânï's copy or al-Zamakhsharî's original. This indicates that al-Itqânï's copy had the standard text and makes one wonder why, if, as the glossator of MS. Bayezit 575 has claimed, al-Itqânï had said that anzala had been written by another hand, he did not write or otherwise indicate what had been in the original. Al-Itqânï might have raised the issue of the opening words of the Kashshäf in his own muqaddima to his copy of the Kashshäf, this introduction appears to be given at the beginning of MS. Nurosmaniye 290/399.84 In this short text, al-Itqânï says that al-Zamakhshan received the title Jär Allah because he had spent five years in Mecca; he supports this statement with lines from one of al-Zamakhsharî's qasïdas. He then says that al-Zamakhshan wrote 20 works (mu 'allaßt), and lists them.85 However, he makes no reference to the opening words of the Kashshäf, either to say what al-Zamakhshañ had originally written or to indicate who had changed it. The conclusion, then, is not only that the remark given in MS. Bayezit 575 cannot be taken at face value, but that it is most likely simply false. 3.3 Sharks and häshiyas on the Kashshäf The margins of Kashshäf copies are not the only places where comments on al-Zamakhsharï's supposed declaration of his Mu'tazilism occur. The phrase al-hamdu li-lläh alladhï khalaqa l-Qur'än received attention in at least three commentaries on the Kashshäf, where authors had more space to deal with the matter. In chronological order, those examined here are the sharhs (or häshiyas) by al-Tïbï (d. 743/1342), al-Yamanï (d. 750/1348-9) and al-Juijânï (d. 816/1413).86 The first two are contemporaries and their comments on 83 In the Itqânï manuscript (MS. Lâleli 216) and its two copies (MSS. Ali Emiri Efendi 80-81 and Nurosmaniye 290/399), it is clearly stated that the copy of the Kashshäf used was the author's, which had been bequeathed (mawqüfa) to the Abü Hanïfa tomb shrine (mashhad) in Baghdad. MSS. Lâleli 216 and Nurosmaniye 290/399 both add that this copy was written in his own handwriting. 84 Completed on 09 Muharram 1050H by 'Alä 1-Dln al-Shuhüdl. It was later compared with al-Itqânï's copy and collated with it and another copy, completed on 27 Ramadan 1051H. The short muqaddima on folio 1A was probably added at this time; it concludes: wa-nuqilat min khatt al-shaykh Qidäm al-Dïn al-Itqânï rahimahu lläh taälä. 85 For more on al-Zamakhsharî's life and work, see my A Traditional Mutazilite Qur'än Commentary, Chapter 1 and Appendix 3. 86 Abü 'All (or Muhammad) al-Husayn b. Muhammad b. Abd Allah al-Tïbï's (d.743/1342) commentary on the Kashshäf, entitled Futûh al-ghayb (fi l-kashf'an qina al-rayb), is one of several works he composed. Al-SuyütT describes him as an eminent scholar Çallâma) in the sciences, Arabic, and rhetoric; and quotes Ibn Hajar's exceedingly posi tive opinion of him. Al-Suyûtï says that, in his commentary on the Kashshäf, al-Tïbî mentions that shortly before beginning to write it he saw the Prophet in his sleep, who offered him a bowl of milk from which he drank (al-Suyütl, Bughya 1: 522-3</page><page sequence="33">MU'TAZILITE THEOLOGY IN A L - Z A M A K H S H A RI' S KASHSHAF 79 al-Zamakhsharï's khalaqa l-Qur'än are similar, although not necessarily con nected; they both reject the idea that al-Zamakhsharï ever wrote al-hamdu li-lläh alladhï khalaqa l-Qur 'an. In the Futüh al-ghayb, al-Tïbî's commentary, the author says that al-Zamakhshan's opening words in his commentary are "the clarification of the order of the revelation (bayän tartïb al-nuzül)",87 Al-Tïbï's explanation of this order is traditional: first God "sent down" (anzala) the Quran from the Guarded Tablet (al-lawh al-mahßz) to the nearest heaven (al-samä' al-dunyä); then he "sent it down" (nazzala) according to the requirements and events on earth, where it was established in a composed and organized way, as shown by the words mu 'allaf and munazzam in al-Zamakhshan's commen tary. As regards al-Zamakhshan's having written and then changed khalaqa l-Qur'än, al-Tïbï says that anzala expressed what was originally intended and so no change had occurred; nor was there any need to use khalaqa l-Qur'än, since later in the passage al-Zamakhshan clearly indicates where he stood with respect to the nature of the Qur'än.

Al-Suyflt! says he was familiar with the Kashsháf and wrote a gloss (ta'llqa) on it. Al-ZiriklT gives the title of his gloss, finished in 733/1332, as Tuhfat al-ashräffi kashf ghawätnid al-Kashshäf, that listed in GAL.Sp. However, it is listed as Durar al-asdäf ß hall 'uqad al-Kashshäf in GAL and the Fihris al-shämil.

Tritton writes that he "belonged to an age which wrote commentaries on earlier works" and that in his Tarifât, "he was not afraid to be simple" (pp. 602-3). He wrote on many subjects: gram mar, logic, law and language; and as a theologian devoted considerable space to philos ophy. Kahhäla says he wrote over 50 works, and almost all of those that he lists are häshiyas, sharhs, or häshiyas on other sharhs or mukhtasars (al-Suyütí, Bughya 2: i96—7 [no. 1777]; A. S.

Al-JuijänT never finished his gloss on the Kashshäf and this is evident in editions of the Kashshäf that contain it, for it ends in the first volume. Here I am following Topkapi MS. 1780 A230 (copied about the 11th/! 7th century). The opening words of the Kashshäf are: al-hamdu li-lläh alladhï anzala l-Qur'än kaläman mu'allafan munazzaman wa-nazzalahu bi-hasab al-masälih munajjaman wa-ja'alahu bi-1-tahmïd muftatahan wa-bi-1-istíädha mukhtataman (Kashshäf 1: 41).</page><page sequence="34">80 ANDREW J. LANE This (i.e. the explanation he has just given) is what was intended and not what has been said, that he said first of all khalaqa l-Qur'än and then changed it out of pious fear (taqiyyatari), because he was clear about that (i.e. his Mu tazilite position) when he said, "They are only the attri butes of a first creation, etc".88 A similar dismissal of the idea that anzala l-Qur 'än was a later emendation to al-Zamakhshaff's original khalaqa l-Qur'än is given by al-Yamanï. He writes: Know that God the Sublime "sent down" (anzala) the Quran all at once from the Preserved Tablet to the nearest heaven. Then, after that, he "sent it down" (nazzala) piecemeal, corresponding to requirements and matching events. That is why he (i.e. al-Zamakhshan) said anzala and naz zala, taking into account the technique of tajnïs al-ishtiqäqT.s9 I have heard some people say that in the original copy (nuskhat al-umm) he wrote khalaqa and then changed it to anzala out of fear (khawfan) but this is not so, for he was clear about his theological position (madhhab) through out the entire introduction (khutba). He used not to conceal his position but to make it known and to boast of it. I have studied (täla'a) the Kashshäf [written] in his handwriting (khatt) and I have seen neither erasure (kasht) nor change (taghyïr) in it.90 The third witness to the debate on what al-Zamakhshar! originally wrote is al-Sayyid al-Shanf al-Juijânï (d. 816/1413).91 At the beginning of his 88 The Arabic text reads: hädhä huwa l-muräd lä md qlla innahu qäla awwalan khalaqa l-Qur'än thumma ghayyarahu taqiyyatan li-annahu saraha bi-dhälika bi-qawlihi 'wa-mä hiya ilia sifit mubtada " ilä äkhirihi. The words wa-mä hiya illä sifat mubtada ' {mubtada') ilä äkhirihi to which al-Tïbl refers are the continuation of the passage in the Kashshäf. In it al-Zamakhsharï describes the Quran and refers to it in terms of a created being (e.g. mubtada ' mubtada\ munsha ' mukhtara'). 89 Tajriïs al-ishtiqâqî could be translated as same-root paronomasia. Heinrichs writes: "A general definition of tadjms would be: a pair of utterances (mostly, but not necessarily single words), within a line or colon, which are semantically different but phonetically, either completely or partially, identical. The alternative "completeness or lack of such" is the basis for distinguishing the various subtypes that the rhetoricians have discovered. Since words that are only partially identical are very likely to be semantically different anyway, it becomes clear that two notions have merged in the tad[nïs concept: a narrow one which covers only the case of complete phonetic identity (this is the tad[nïs tämm, which some say, or imply, is the original and "correct" meaning of the term), and a broader one in which the two terms of the tadjms show any kind of lesser degrees of assonance, down to root-repetition (ishtikäk, figura etymologica). Some authors deny that ishtikäk is a subtype of tad¿nis" (W. P. Heinrichs, "Tadjms", EI2 10: 67). 90 Here I foilow MS. Nurosmaniye 417/563, completed on 03 Safar 997 in Yemen by Abd al-Hâdl b. Sa'ïd al-Yamanï. The card catalogue gives no title but lists it as a hashiya. It is interesting to note that al-Yamanl refers to the "original copy" of the Kashshäf, that people said had khalaqa l-Quran, as nuskhat al-umm. This gives the impression that he is referring to the umm al-Kashshäf that al-Zamakhshan finished in Mecca in 528/ 1134, and not the copy at the Abü Hanîfa mashhad in Baghdad. 91 Unlike the two previous commentaries, al-Juijânî's has been printed in a number of edi tions; here the Mustafa 1-Bâbï al-Halabï (Cairo: 1385-87/1966-68) edition has been used.</page><page sequence="35">MU'TAZILITE THEOLOGY IN A L - Z A M A K H S H A R I' S KASHSHAF 81 commentary he too specifically notes al-Zamakhshan's theological position (,madhhab) with respect to the Quran and adds that he went to trouble to show his Mutazilism and was proud of it. In his comments on anzala, however, al-Juijânï does not explicitly deny that al-Zamakhshan ever wrote al-hamdu li-lläh alladhï khalaqa l-Quran; he does not address the question at all, but merely uses an anonymous khalaqa/anzala report as a way of introducing his own explanation of how brilliant al-ZamakhsharT's text is. He writes: "It is reported that in the original copy khalaqa occurred in the place of anzala, but that then the author changed it. If this is correct, then the change was ben eficial";92 he then proceeds to give seven reasons why the change (if it did occur, as reported) had benefits (fawä'id). Al-Juijânï, then, is not interested in confirming or denying the report; nor is he concerned with its authenticity. What is important is that the word anzala was much better suited to what al-Zamakhshari was saying than khalaqa could ever have been, and this he amply demonstrates with the seven fawä'id that he supplies. 3.4 The evidence and the story Manuscript evidence supports the view that al-Zamakhshañ never wrote khalaqa l-Quran, for in none of the 110 manuscripts containing the muqaddima was the reference to the creation of the Quran to be found; nor was there any indication that manuscripts had been tampered with, to erase or change what an earlier copyist had written.93 This limited number of manuscripts may seem too small to be the basis for such a statement. However, further evidence is avail able: there are the biographical dictionaries (tabaqät). While the story of the Kashshäf s opening words is to be found in a number of these works, none of the authors ever claimed to have seen a copy of the commentary containing the offending expression, or even one that had been changed. Moreover, there is no agreement in these tabaqät works as to who would have changed khalaqa l-Qur'än to anzala I-Qur'än, if such a change did occur. Secondly, glossators corroborate the view that al-Zamakhshafl never wrote khalaqa l-Qur'än by the general silence with which they pass over the account; furthermore, those who do say that khalaqa l-Qur'än was written originally are very few and their evidence is extremely weak. Thirdly, the main commentators on the Kashshäf reject the idea that al-Zamakhshan ever wrote khalaqa l-Qur'än and take pains to point it out. Finally, there has been no debate on this matter in the sources. There was simply a story in circulation, which many biographers and most glossators ignored but which a few commentators took the time to refute. Nevertheless, the story seems to have taken on a life of its own, to the point that Brockelmann could remark parenthetically that "at the very beginning [of the Kashshäf al-Zamakhshan] declares the Kur'än created" and Jansen could 92 Kashshäf (ed. Cairo, 1966-68) 1:3. The Arabic text reads: yurwä annahu waqaa fi umm al-nusakh khalaqa makäna anzala thumma ghayyarahu l-musannif fa-in sahha dhälika fa-l-taghyîr li-fawä 'id. 93 Nassau-Lees refers to similar results in the first printed edition of the Kashshäf: "I have myself seven or eight good copies, and some of them ... are very old; yet in none of them occur (sic) either of the words, khalaqa or J'ala (sic)" (Kashshäf (ed. Calcutta, 1856-59) 1: 7, ti. 7).</page><page sequence="36">82 ANDREW J. LANE state: '"Glory to God who created the Koran' are the opening words of Az-Zamakhshan's Koran commentary".94 In the light of this study these state ments are very hard to endorse. Not only have no manuscripts with khalaqa l-Qur'än (or even ja ala l-Qur'än) been found; there is no reason to believe either that there ever were any, or that al-Zamakhshan wrote khalaqa l-Qur 'än in the first place. The question anses as to when and where the report about al-Zamakhshan's having written khalaqa l-Qur an first appeared and who was behind it. Despite his risäla against al-Zamakhshan's interpretation of the Quran, the aforemen tioned al-Itqânî cannot have been at the origin of this account. Not only does the evidence not support this position, but the story was in circulation before his time; Ibn Khallikän (d. 681/1282) had already reported the matter before al-Itqânï (b. 685/1286) was born. What is noteworthy about Ibn Khallikän's account is that it is one of two anecdotes he gives to illustrate how open al-Zamakhsharî was about his Mu'tazilism, a point already made by a number of other authors. Immediately before presenting the report about the opening words of the Kashshäf, Ibn Khallikän gives an anonymous report which says that, when visiting someone, al-Zamakhshañ would have himself announced with: "Abü 1-Qäsim the Mu tazilite is at the door (Abü l-Qäsim al-Mutazilï bi-l-bäby.95 The Mu'tazilite Abü Yüsuf al-QazwInl (d. 488/1095) was attributed with a similar way of announcing himself, indicating that the story was either an invention applied to Mutazilites who were open about their theology, or perhaps a way of behaving that was not all that uncommon.96 The report concerning the opening words of the Kashshäf, on the other hand, which Ibn Khallikän (d. 681/ 1282) places immediately after the report on al-Zamakhshari's way of having himself announced and for which he himself says he found no evidence in the "many copies" (kathir min al-nusakh) of the commentary he had seen (just as he found no evidence for saying that the emendation to the text was the work of the people and not that of the author), can only be a fabrication that appeared sometime in the late sixth/twelfth or early seventh/thirteenth cen tury as an indirect means of saying not only that al-Zamakhshañ was a Mutazilite (which was well known) but also that his commentary was not free from his beliefs. Such a "creation story" would have been in line with the thinking of Ibn Khallikän's (d. 681/1282) contemporary Ibn AbT Jamra (d. 699/1300?) who dis cussed who could study the Kashshäf and said that those who did so and who preferred it to the books of the "masters" were in error. This theme was contin ued by Ibn Hajar al-'Asqalânï (d. 852/1449) a century and a half later in perhaps stronger terms, for he forbad people to touch the Kashshäf and transmitted 94 "al-Zamakhshati", £/' 4: 1205; Jansen, Interpretation, 62. 95 See for example: Ibn Khallikän, Wafayät 5: 170 [no. 711], reproduced in al-Fâsï, al-Iqd al-thamln 7: 141 and Ibn al-'Imäd, Shadharät al-dhahab 4: 120. 96 G.

A less strident variation on the theme of the "Mu'tazilite Kashshäf' can, however, be seen in the biographies of such eighth/fourteenth century writers as Abu l-Fida' (d. 732/1331) and Ibn Kathïr (d. 774/1373). Most writers, though, had nothing but praise for the Kashshäf and its author, and passed over the "creation story" in silence. Nevertheless, this does not mean that they were unaware of it. Authors borrowed heavily from each other and no one had more borrowed from him than Ibn Khallikän (d. 681/1282). This story, then, was well known and continued to cir culate (to the point of becoming an accepted fact in modern times), perhaps reflective of an effort either to fight a perceived resurgent Mutazilism or simply to destroy the popularity of the Kashshäf and to stop its spread. In the end, though, if the latter were the intention, the endeavour proved fruitless.97 Conclusion This article set out to examine in a systematic way al-Zamakhshan's Kashshäf. From medieval times, this commentary was considered by some, at least, to be a Mu'tazilite commentary on the Quran and this perception has found its way into modern scholarship, even though, as the various references have shown, scholars do not define precisely what they might understand a Mu'tazilite commentary to be. Some modern-day scholars have shied away from considering the Kashshäf to be such a commentary, but even these do not seem to have studied the text itself to any great extent, and so what al-Zamakhshan in fact said remains some thing of a mystery. While it is clearly not possible for every scholar to write a book on every medieval scholar or work before writing about them, it is necess ary on occasion for individuals to examine a little more closely what many others may know from afar. This article comes out of such an endeavour with respect to al-Zamakhshan and his Kashshäf. The endeavour in question approached the Kashshäf from three angles: first, a close reading of a section of the text (Q44 and Q54), to see what it would yield by way of a Mu'tazilite interpretation. Only one passage clearly referred to a principle of this school; the commentary on Q54:17. What is interesting here, though, is that the Mu'tazilite interpretation was only one of three that al-Zamakhshañ offered; it was indeed the first but, it was only one of three. Just as infrequent was al-Zamakhshañ's slightly Mu'tazilite manipulation of a passage from an earlier source he was ostensibly quoting, al-Zajjäj's Maânï l-Qur'än.98 The relative scarcity of both Mu'tazilite interpretations of the Quranic text and Mu'tazilite alterations to the earlier source indicates that the Kashshäf was not primarily focused on the theology of its author. In fact, this 97 For 'Abd Allah b. Sa'd (Sa'Td?) Ibn AbT Jamra al-AndalusI (d. 699/1300?), see GAL1 1: 372; GAL 1: 458-9; GAL.Sp 1: 635. His comments on the Kashshäf can be found in his Bahjat al-nujus wa-tahallThä bi-marafat mä lahä wa-mä 'alayhä (Beirut: Där al-JTl, 1972) 1: 46 \juz' 1]. The Bahjat al-nufüs is a commentary on one of Ibn AbT Jamra's earlier works, the Kitäb Jam al-nihäya fi bad' al-khayr wa-1-ghäya, a summary of al-Bukhäri's Sahïh. 98 Such examples should be kept in mind when reconstructing earlier texts from references to them in later works.</page><page sequence="38">84 ANDREW J. LANE detailed reading of these two süras revealed the Kashshäf to be a traditional tafsïr musalsal, grounded in the earlier exegetical tradition and relying on the interpretations and tools of the trade that al-Zamakhshan's predecessors had used. The second approach involved studying two theological works whose ideas might be reflected in the Kashshäf, al-Zamakhshan's own al-Minhäj fi usül al-dïn and al-Mutamad fi usül al-dïn by his teacher Ibn al-Malähiml (d. 536/ 1141). Unlike the first approach, which involved the continuous reading of the commentary on the two süras in the hope that it might lead to Mu'tazilite ideas in the text, this was focused on verses whose commentary might reveal such ideas more readily. If a number of Quranic verses had been used by either al-Zamakhshañ or Ibn al-Malähiml to support, defend or even "prove" Mu'tazilite ideas in their theological treatises, it seemed reasonable to assume that some of these ideas might emerge in the commentary on the same verses in the Kashshäf. It was noted, however, that in these Kaläm works, scripture was used relatively rarely to begin with, and that even then it appeared to have an ancillary role. With respect to the 28 Quranic passages quoted in the Minhäj, the commentary on approximately 40% of them had no Mu'tazilite con tent in the Kashshäf, the commentary on approximately 35% of them did reflect ideas presented in the theological treatise; and the commentary on the rest (25%) reflected Mutazilite positions that were not to be found in the Minhäj. These statistics may look good but do so only until it is realized that very little of the Quran made its way into the Minhäj. As for the Mutamad, this larger theo logical work used far more scripture than did the shorter Minhäj but, relatively speaking, it too did so exceedingly sparingly. The study showed that this book was simply not used by al-Zamakhshan. In general then, even on the relatively rare occasions when scripture was used in these theological works, the connec tion between specific scriptural passages and the theological arguments they supported was weak, especially when it came to proofs, and this weakness was reflected in the lack of a connection between them and Mu'tazilite ideas in the Kashshäf Understood in this light and on the basis of what has been studied here, it is not necessary to assume that al-Zamakhshan would have had Mu'tazilite ideas to develop in his commentary on verses that had no con nection to theology in the Kaläm tradition since this would be pulling him out of the tradition, even if the connection between theology and scripture in the trea tises often appeared weak. The third approach was much more focused, looking at one line from the commentary, the first. For almost as long as the Kashshäf has been in existence, there has also been a story that it began with the blatantly Mu tazilite words "Praise be to God who created the Quran (al-hamdu li-lläh alladhl khalaqa l-Qur'än)". By the beginning of the twentieth century, this story was considered to be fact. In conjunction with the few medieval sources that transmitted it, it may have been at the origins of the modern-day view that the Kashshäf was a "Mu'tazilite commentary" on the Quran. In any case, such a statement would have set the tone for the remainder of the commentary in the eyes of orthodox readers, and would probably have driven them away before they even turned the first page. This may, in fact, have been the intention, for the story is undoubtedly a fabrication set in place early by opponents of the Mutazila as a way of keeping</page><page sequence="39">MU'TAZILITE THEOLOGY IN A L - Z A M A K H S H A Ri ' S KASHSHÄF 85 people away from the Kashshäf which, they believed, had to be tainted by heresy since its author was a Mu'tazilite. The story did not, however, have the desired results, as the many manuscript copies and printed editions (20 as of today) of the Kashshäf show. In fact, a study of over 100 of these manuscripts gave no indication that this "creation story" was anything more than an inven tion, for there was no evidence to support it, and glossators and commentators openly rejected the story for the most part, if they spoke about it at all. Their silence reflects that of the medieval scholarly community in general, where the story was undoubtedly well known but probably not accepted, for it received limited exposure in the biographical dictionaries (tabaqät) and does not seem to have had much effect on the reputation of either al-Zamakhshan or his commen tary. With the exception of al-Dhahabï (d. 748/1348) and Ibn Hajar (d. 852/ 1449) after him, none of the authors of the biographical works under study had anything critical to say about the Kashshäf." On the contrary, the impression they give is that the work was held in high esteem, for it was invari ably the first of al-Zamakhsharï's works to be listed. The so-called "Mu'tazilite" Kashshäf then, received a much warmer reception from scholars than one might have expected if it had truly been steeped in heresy. Al-Zamakhshañ's Kashshäf is a traditional Quran commentary written by a member of the Mutazilite school of theology, that sometimes incorporates Mu'tazilite comments into a traditional framework. Of the three approaches to the text followed here, the findings from the reading of Q44 and Q54 are prob ably more representative of the Kashshäf s Mutazilite contents than are those from the comparison of it to the Minhäj and the Mutamad where, despite the percentages with respect to the former, direct use of the Quran was sparse and the connection between Quranic passages and theology, on the level of "proof" at least, often appeared vague and unconvincing. It might be that their main role was simply to be a traditional confirmatur to the results of rational arguments (as Gardet said), no matter how they were presented in the Minhäj}00 As for the "creation story", it is a fabrication which attempted to draw a direct connection 99 The biographical sources consulted for the original study numbered nearly three dozen and spanned a period of seven centuries, from Ibn al-Anbän's (d. 577/1181) Nuzhat al-alibba fi tabaqät al-udabä' to al-Khuwänasärfs (d. 1313/1895) Rawdät al-jannät ß ahwäl al-ulamä ' wa-l-sädät. 100 Even at this level the selection of Quranic passages (verses or parts thereof) that could have been used at various places in the Minhäj and the Mutamad was probably wider than what was used; Ibn al-Malâhimï says as much himself (see §2.2.1 above). Why certain passages were chosen for specific theological arguments may be hard to explain, beyond the fact that they supported the latter in a general way without getting into the details of the Kaläm arguments. If this is the case, the connection was probably too weak for such passages to stand out as the Quranic pillars on which specific theological arguments stood, and this would be reflected in the Kashshäf. In any case, they remained connected to only a small part of the theological treatises, and represented a tiny percentage of the Quran. By al-Zamakhshan's time, it is possible that the pas sages he refers to (and maybe others he did not mention) were solidly set in the theo logical tradition as part of the arguments; something similar could probably be said for the muhkamät and mutashäbihät verses of the Quran (n. 33).

To reject it for the forgery it is, is merely to concur with most medieval scholars, either directly or indirectly, even if the study of a limited number of these sources could and did lead a number of modern-day scholars astray. To say more about the Kashshäf, to describe it as a Mu tazilite commentary on the Quran - and, as already noted, scholars today have not really defined what such a commentary might be, a difficulty that may have begun with al-Baydâwï - or to expect more from it than what this study has brought to light, would be to focus more on the author and the "creation story" that has dogged him throughout history than it would be to focus on the Kashshäf and what its author actually wrote in it.
