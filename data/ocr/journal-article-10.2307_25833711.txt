<plain_text><page sequence="1">614 German Studies MEDIEVAL LITERATURE BvNigelW. Harris, University ofBirmingham i. General Medieval Germany: An Encyclopaedia, ed. John M. Jeep, NY, Garland, xxxviii 4- 928 pp., is a monumental work of reference. Its 647 alphabetically ordered entries encompass many aspects of political and social history, as well as language, literature, art and architecture, music, philosophy, theology, education, and 'daily life'; and, pleas ingly, there is considerable coverage of Dutch literature and culture. Prominent among the contributors of literary articles are G. H. M. Claasens, A. Classen, R. H. Firestone, F. G. Gentry, E. R. Haymes, H. P. Heinen, E. R. Hintz, S. Jefferis, W. C. McDonald, J. A. Rushing, and S. C. Van D'Elden. Most entries are admirably clear and concise, although the accompanying bibliographies are in some cases thin. One could also argue that late-medieval literary culture and the works of Latin authors are somewhat under-represented. Quibbles such as these, however, are dwarfed by the sheer scale of the volume's achievement. The second fascicle of the supplementary 11 th vol. of Die deutsche Literatur des Mittelalters. Verfasserlexikon, ed. Kurt Ruh et al., Berlin, de Gruyter, 321-640 cols, contains, along with corrections and addi tions, many entirely new articles. Several of these deal with chronicles, plays, and medical and legal literature; but there is also new material on 'Glaubensbekenntnisse' (G. Steer) and 'Heiltumbucher' (F. Eiser mann), and, of course, a wide range of authors. These include Heinrich von Coesfeld, Heinrich von Isernia, and Andreas and Vinzenz Griiner (all by F. J. Worstbrock); and three notable Humanists in Marsilio Ficino (S. Limbeck), Wessel Gansfort, and Dietrich von Pleningen (both by Worstbrock). Deutschsprachige Literatur des Mittelalters. Studienauswahl aus dem 'Verfasserlexikon' (Bd. 1-10), ed. Burghart Wachinger, Berlin, de Gruyter, 1108 cols, is a selection of some 83 Verfasserlexikon articles. With commendable pragmatism, W. restricts his choice largely to authors and works which are likely to interest undergraduates. Hence Latin texts are excluded, and there is also little on non-mystical religious literature, historiography, or scientific and specialist literature. By contrast, the canonical OHG and MHG authors are well represented, as are short narratives and Fastnachtspiele. Beutin, Literaturgeschichte, is a revised and expanded edition of this much used literary history (see TWMLS, 51:623, 54:648). It includes entirely new chapters on the periods between 1890 and 1920, and</page><page sequence="2">Medieval Literature 615 since 1989; other chapters have been revised to take greater account of the broader European cultural context. In the case of B. Lutz's contribution on medieval literature (1-56), this entails above all a five-page introductory sketch of medieval and pre-medieval Euro pean history. The Katalog der deutschsprachigen illustrierten Handschriften des Mittelal ters, vol. in, fasc. 4, ed. Norbert H. Ott and Ulrike Bodemann, 241-366 pp., continues its description of illustrated MSS and printed books of vernacular chronicles. This fascicle encompasses Austrian chronicles by Leopold von Wien and Ottokar von Steiermark, Gallus Ohem's Chronik der Reichenau, and the Schwabische Chronik and Gmiinder Chronik of Thomas Lirer. A. Otto, Mediaevalia, 20: 227-55, examines a heterogeneous group of i5th-c. miscellany MSS, for which he establishes a common origin in a workshop such as that of Diebolt Lauber; and U. Weber, Fest. Menke, 907-18, analyses some late medieval and early modern MSS written by unpractised hands. C. Meier, FmSt, 34, 2000:338-92, surveys the iconographical representation of various medieval conceptions of authorship; and in Suntrup, Tradition, 227-55, sne studies medieval colour codes and allegories, especially those developed in relation to liturgy, heraldry, and courtly love. In GLM, 38:50-54, E. A. Overgaauw summarizes and comments on the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft's new proposals for cata loguing and providing information about medieval MSS on the inter net; and R. Giel, ib., 39:34-40, describes specifically the online data base Manuscripta Mediaevalia &lt;www.manuscripta-mediaevalia.de&gt;. This initiative is also the subject of a notice by J. Bove, %DA9 130:495-96, which is one of the first eight contributions to a new series called 'Mittelalter-Philologie im Internet'. Other projects described in vol. 130 include: the MS census known as the 'Marburger Repertorium zur Uberlieferung der deutschen Literatur des Mittelalters' &lt;www.marburger-repertorien.de&gt; (J. Heinzle and K. Klein, 245-46); a database of medieval German autographs &lt; www.uni-muenster.de / Fruehmittelalter / Projekte / Autographen/ Abfrage.html &gt; (V. Honemann, 247-48); a catalogue of MSS from the Diocesan and Cathedral Library in Cologne &lt;www.ceec.uni koeln.de&gt; (P. Sahle, 370-74); an inventory of the MSS formerly in the City Archive in Kaliningrad (Konigsberg) &lt; www.bis.uni oldenburg.de/kbg_hss_archiv&gt; (R. G. Pasler, 374-75); details of copies of the six printed editions of the 'StraBburger Heldenbuch' &lt;www.geocities.com/walter.kofler/ &gt; (W. Kofler, 376); the multi purpose medieval gateway &lt;www.mediaevum.de&gt; (J. Hamm et al., 492-93); and the extraordinarily useful 'Mittelhochdeutsche Begriffsdatenbank' &lt; mhdbdb.bgsu.edu &gt; (H. P. Piitz and K. M.</page><page sequence="3">6i6 German Studies Schmidt, 493-94). Moreover, J. Fligge et al., Fest. Menke, 183-237, discuss the LG MSS from Liibeck which have been returned there from the former GDR and USSR since 1989. Wolfgang Milde, Mediaevalia et Lessingania. Kleine Schriften, ed. Wolfgang Maaz et al. (Spolia Berolinensia, 19), Hildesheim, Weid mann, xii + 390 pp., reprints some 24 of M.'s essays from between 1971 and 1998. Along with pieces on medieval and early modern libraries and their catalogues, and on Lessing, there are several dealing with medieval MSS, including M.'s important 1982 article on the Wolfenbuttel Erec fragments (see TWMLS, 44: 749). T. Bein, Nutt-Kofoth, Text, 81-98, surveys past and present approaches to editing medieval German texts, with particular reference to differing concepts of textual variance. In Editio, 15, H. G. Roloff (25-36) discusses problems associated with editing trans lated texts from 1400-1750; and M. E. Dorninger (197-204) continues her critical bibliography of works dealing with editorial questions, this time covering publications from 1997. In Schroder Vol., F. Debus (161-78) discusses attempts, especially by igth-c. scholars, to reconstruct MHG works from post-medieval MSS; and K. Gartner (273-88) evaluates the potential of the computer as tool and medium for the editing of medieval texts. S. Kranich-Hofbauer, Firchow Vol., 217-30, pleads for an 'historical-diplomatic' approach to editing late medieval works, arguing specifically against the normalization of analogous graphemes. Verfiihrer, Schurken, Magier, ed. Ulrich Miiller and Werner Wunder lich (Mittelalter-Mythen, 3), St Gall, UVK, 990 pp., is an even thicker and more wide-ranging volume than its predecessors in this series (see TWMLS, 61:592-93). Save for an arguable shared status as outsiders who oppose and sometimes threaten society, the subjects it treats have little in common; and the contributors themselves use diverse methodological approaches. Nevertheless the book is a mine of up-to-date and generally well documented information. Its 60 chapters include studies of temptresses such as Eve (M. Hubrath), Venus (U. Muller), Dido (M. Mecklenburg), Helen of Troy (A. Classen), and, less predictably, Agnes Bernauer (J. L. Flood); male seducers are represented by the likes of Don Juan (J. Manuel Lopez de Abaida and D. Studer) and Lancelot (U. Muller); the many scoundrels range from Eulenspiegel (W. C. McDonald) and Markolf (R. Brandt and H. Wuth) to Judas Iscariot (M. Dorninger) and Mordred (S. Schmidt); and the roll-call of magicians encompasses Merlin (U. Muller), Klingsor (R. Krohn), and even Albertus Magnus (L. Petzoldt). There are also several chapters on figures such as Everyman (S. Schmidt), Cundry (K. Pappas), and the Pied Piper of</page><page sequence="4">Medieval Literature 6i7 Hamelin (W. Wunderlich), whom one would not necessarily have anticipated meeting in this company. Brian Murdoch, Adam's Grace. Fall and Redemption in Medieval Literature, Cambridge, Brewer, 2000, xii 4- 205 pp., is a remarkably erudite study of the use of Adam, and other Adam-figures, to illuminate through literature such fundamental Christian themes as the Fall, redemption, and the universality of original sin. M. deals in turn with apocryphal lives of Adam, and with Adamic analogues and motifs in the legends of Gregorius, Parzival, and several lepers (including Hartmann's Heinrich). Bettina Mattig-Krampe, Das Pilatusbild in der deutschen Bibel- und Legendenepik des Mittelalters (GB, 9), 252 pp., surveys developments in the presentation of Pontius Pilate in vernacular religious literature from the 9th to the 14th centuries. Whilst one can distinguish easily enough between biblical epics (from Der Heliand to Die Erlosung) which focus on Pilate's role in the Passion narrative, and legends (often based on the Gospel of Nicodemus) which also describe other aspects of his putative biography, M.-K. shows that it is impossible to speak of clear trends in his presentation and evaluation either within genres or at specific periods. Rather, Pilate remains, as in the New Testament, a complex and ambivalent figure, whose characterization varies considerably according to the viewpoints of individual authors and the precise nature of their source material. L. de Grauwe, LB, 90:161-79, examines the presentation of Pilate in the Redentiner Osterspiel and other Easter plays. Verena Holzmann, '. . Jch beswer dich wurm vnd wyrmin ..." Formen und Typen altdeutscher ^auberspriiche und Segen (WAGAPH, 36), 322 pp., is the first comprehensive survey of the more than 300 German charms and blessings from the 9th to the 16th cs which appear in modern editions. H. begins with a lucid introduction to the beliefs underlying these short texts, and then lists and prints them all, giving brief details of their date and MS tradition. She orders them according to four categories (command, narrative, parable, and prayer), the differences between and within which she explains in detail. David N. Yeandle, 'Schame' im Alt- und Mittelhochdeutschen bis urn 1210. Fine sprach- und literaturgeschichtliche Untersuchung unter besonderer Beriicksichtigung der Herausbildung einer ethischen Bedeutung, Heidelberg, Winter, xxv 4- 264 pp., is a meticulous study of schame in all its aspects (positive and negative, ethical and non-ethical, prospective and retrospective, physical and psychological, concerned with oneself and with others). Composite chapters on OHG and early MHG texts are followed by individual chapters devoted to Hartmann, Herbort von Fritzlar, Ulrich von Zatzikhoven, the Mbelungenlied, Parzival, Wigalois,</page><page sequence="5">6i8 German Studies Tristan, Willehalm and Titurel, and Walther von der Vogelweide. Y.'s conclusions rely heavily on his division of references to schame into clear-cut categories which are by definition debatable; but his approach yields significant gains. Particularly convincing is his stress on the importance of schame as a positive ethical concept, and on the seminal importance of Parzival in formulating and propagating its role as a 'sloz ob alien siten'. C. Stephen Jaeger, Die Entstehung hofischer Kultur. Vom hqfischen Bischof zum hqfischen Ritter (PSQ, 167), 389 pp., is a translation, by Sabine Hellwig-Wagnitz, of J.'s important 1985 volume The Origins of Courtliness (see TWMLS, 48:682). The text has not been updated, but there is new prefatory material by Horst Wenzel and by J. himself. Peters, Text, contains several essays on the applicability of con temporary theories to the study of medieval literature. Reacting to the tenets of'New Philology', K. Grubmiiller (8-33) demonstrates a desire on the part of numerous medieval authors to assert and protect the thematic and formal integrity of their works; and B. Quast (34-46) argues that this desire is particularly strong in the case of authors of didactic or normative texts. J. Heinzle (198-214) re assesses the value for Altgermanisten of Norbert Elias's theory of civilization; and U. Friedrich (245-67) essays a discourse-analytical survey of literary constructions of the relationship between knight and horse. Meanwhile E. Briiggen (546-74) problematizes the distinction often drawn between 'fictional' and 'non-fictional' medi eval literature; and F. Bezner (575-611) recommends a pragmatic, interdisciplinary approach to the study of medieval literary theories such as the integumentum. Elsewhere C. Brinker-von der Heyde, DUS, 53.2:55-64, discusses, from a medievalist's perspective, the debate surrounding the definition and usefulness of the terms Kultur and Kulturwissenschaften. In Kellner, Kommunikation, P. Strohschneider (1-26) examines the relationship between literary communication and social interaction in medieval Germany, in the light especially of his concept of 'institutionality'; and B. Kellner (153-82) finds hints of a con sciousness of literary tradition, and of an accepted canon, in both heroic epic and courtly romance. Meanwhile V. Honemann, Das Mittelalter, 6.1:19-30, discusses various forms of symbolic commun ication described in medieval German literature; and M. Schu macher, DUS, 53.6:8-15, evaluates the (generally non-prescriptive) guidelines for the practice of conversation found in medieval and early modern texts. Other studies of a general nature include: Burghart Wachinger, Erzahlen fur die Gesundheit. Didtetik und Literatur im Mittelalter (SKHAW, 23), Heidelberg, Winter, 44 pp., a survey of both medical-dietetic</page><page sequence="6">Medieval Literature 619 and narrative literature in which stories are ascribed a balancing or therapeutic function; E. Feistner's discussion (ZDA, 130:253-69) of the characteristics of legends, fairy-tales, and forms which combine the two; I. Bennewitz's bibliography (JIG, 32:64-96) of scholarly works dealing with family and gender roles in medieval and other literature; and N. Harris's account (FMLS, 37:429-40) of recent research into the teaching of medieval German literature at American universities. other works. Juden in Europa. Ihre Geschichte in Quelten. 1: Von den Anfdngen bis zum spdten Mittelalter, ed. Julius H. Schoeps and Hiltrud Wallenborn, Darmstadt, Primus, viii 4- 309 pp., is the first of a planned series of five collections of fundamental documents on the history of European Jewry, translated into NHG and aimed mainly at the non-specialist. It includes edicts of Frederick II and Charles IV, an excerpt from the Sachsenspiegel, texts by Jewish authors regulating community life in Worms, Speyer, and Mainz, and several chilling accounts of pogroms. Jorg W. Busch, Certi et veri cupidus. Geschichtliche Zweife^sfa^e und inre Behandlung um 1100, um ijoo und um 1475. Drei Fallstudien (MMS, 80), 278 pp., is an absorbing and successful attempt to revise the traditional view that medieval historians were less inclined than their Humanist or modern counterparts to investigate or refute dubious statements found in their sources. On the basis of detailed discussion of three issues that generated historiographical controversy at distinct points during the Middle Ages, B. discerns a remarkable degree of continuity not only in historians' concern for demonstrably accurate truth, but also in the methods they adopted to pursue it. He also points, however, to the influence on late-medieval historiography of a gradually growing awareness of disparities between different historical periods and contexts. Ludger Korntgen, Kbnigsherrschaft und Gottes Gnade (Vorstellungs welten des Mittelalters, 2), Berlin, Akademie, 540 pp., discusses perceptions of the sacred nature of kingship under the Ottoman and early Salian emperors, and stresses that these were not used merely to legitimize their rule, but also to generate socio-political action. K.'s sources include depictions of emperors in liturgical MSS (where their function is to remind readers of the Emperor's role and of his need for intercession). Knut Gorich, Die Ehre Friedrich Barbarossas. Kommunikation, Konflikt und politisches Handeln im 12. Jahrhundert, WBG, x 4- 638 pp., is a detailed but readable study of Barbarossa's (and his contemporaries') concept of honour, especially in so far as it motivated political action and was expressed in symbol and gesture. G. discusses the role played by honour in such political conflicts as the investiture controversy, as</page><page sequence="7">620 German Studies well as in Barbarossa's dealings with the law and with money. Relatively little use is made of literary parallels, though there is an interesting brief analysis of the 'rash boon' motif in Iwein. W. Hau brichs, DB, 105, 2000:128-38, examines concepts of honour preval ent in early medieval society, drawing attention to their relational and legal orientation. Meanwhile Barbarossa's role as mediator is analysed in Hermann Kamp, Friedensstifter und Vermittler im Mittelalter, WBG, x + 384 pp., an innovative study of peacemaking and arbitra tion as practised in the Empire between the 7th and 15th cs, in which K. lays particular emphasis on the increasing institutionalization of these processes in the High Middle Ages. F. Shaw, German History, 19:321-39, examines the medieval origins of the myth identifying Frederick II as an undead 'Last Emperor', before discussing the 19th c. transference of this myth to Barbarossa. In Haupt, Endzeitvorstellungen, H. Schulte Herbruggen (49-93) surveys medieval and Renaissance expectations of the last times; P. Dinzelbacher (95-131) discusses the uncomfortable co-existence in medieval thought of the doctrines of a general and an individual judgement; J. Semmler (133-45) examines the nature and extent of fears that the world would end in the year 1000; W. G. Busse (179-96) discusses the fear occasioned by medieval people's association of the end of the world with natural catastrophes; H. J. F. Brall-Tuchel (197-228) surveys references to Gog and Magog in a variety of OHG and MHG texts; and H. Finger (251-70) considers the relationship between heresy and apocalyptic ideas in the 12th- and i3th-c. Rhineland. In Fest. Brunner, 391-402, R. Sprandel examines indi vidual and collective responses to the Black Death. Also noted: Recht und Verfassung im Ubergang vom Mittelalter zur JVeuzeit. Bericht iiber Kolloquien der Kommission zur Erforschung der Kultur des Spdtmittetatters 1996 bis 1997, ed. Hartmut Boockmann et al. (AAWG, 239), 520 pp. 2. Germanic and Old High German Ottar Gronvik, Uber die Bildung des dlteren und desjiingeren Runenalphabets (Osloer Beitrage zur Germanistik, 29), Frankfurt, Lang, 118 pp., argues that the older runic alphabet, with its evident indebtedness to the Norse phonemic system, was devised in Denmark between 180 and 200 ad, quite possibly by a single chieftain. He then traces its development into the younger, reduced furthak found in the recently discovered inscription from Ribe (?.720-30). G.'s careful analysis identifies the Viking period as one of significant change also in the matter of the (increasingly loose) relationship between phonemes and their graphemic representation. M. K. Dahm, ABAG, 55:15-20, postulates the influence of the Latin cursive 'p' on the development of</page><page sequence="8">Medieval Literature 621 the p-rune; and U. Schwab, SM, 42:797-839, discusses recent publications on runes and runic inscriptions. Eckhart Meineke and Judith Schwerdt, Einfiihrung in das Althochdeut sche (UTB, 2167), Paderborn, Schoningh, 350 pp., is an outstandingly thorough introduction to the subject. It begins with a survey of the Indo-European and Germanic foundations of OHG, and ends with a detailed but generally approachable treatment of OHG phonology, morphology, word formation, and syntax. In between there is an introduction to OHG literature (including glosses) which usefully provides photographs of some 16 MS pages. The multi-volume Althochdeutsches Wbrterbuch, ed. Rudolf Grosse et al., Berlin, Akademie, has spawned four fascicles in 2000 and 2001 (together constituting vol. iv, cols 1301-1620). These cover the alphabetical ground between 'houga' and 'inni'. Meanwhile A. Greu le, Fest. Ruberg, 237-44, considers some of the purposes and possibil ities of his Syntaktisches Verbwdrterbuch zu den althochdeutschen Texten des 9. Jahrhunderts (see TWMLS, 61:601); and M. Rein, LiLi, 122:7-79, surveys the meanings and implications of OHG bikeran, and other terms relating to conversion which it superseded. A great deal of work has been done on OHG glosses. Claudia Wich-Reif, Studien zur Textglossariiberlieferung. Mit Entersuchungen zu den Handschriften St. Gotten, Stiftsbibliothek 292 und Karlsruhe, Badische Landesbibliothek St. Peter perg.8y (GB, 8), 383 pp., begins with a painstaking analysis of these two closely related MSS, followed by both a diplomatic and an annotated parallel edition of excerpts from them. W.-R. identifies certain features overlooked by previous scholars, such as seven 'new' vernacular glosses and some Latin ones to Priscian's Institutio de arte grammatical and she postulates that the MSS have a common, late 9th-c. Rhenish-Franconian/Alemannic source. W.-R. then turns to define the characteristics of Textglossare more generally: their prime function, she contends, is to elucidate a specific Latin text, principally in Latin, but also on occasion by translating particular lemmata into the vernacular. Her work con cludes with a list of some 166 MSS with OHG or OS glosses which fit this definition. H. Tiefenbach, Sprachwissenschqft, 26:93-111, exam ines several OHG dry point glosses recently published by E. Glaser (see TWMLS, 58:720-21) and by M. McCormick. P. W. Tax, ib., 327-416, prints, elucidates, and assesses the 220 OHG glosses found in Einsiedeln 179, a ioth-c. MS containing Boethius's De consolatione Philosophiae and a Latin commentary on it. He concludes that, contrary to common belief, the OHG glosses frequently render the commentary, rather than the Consolatio itself ? a finding which has potentially significant consequences, not least for lexicographers.</page><page sequence="9">622 German Studies In Bergmann, Glossen, E. Hellgardt (261-96) compares semantic, morphological, and syntactical features of OHG, OS, and Old English interlinear glosses on the Psalms. H. Tiefenbach (325-51) discusses various problems associated with OS glosses, not least the difficulty of defining exactly what one is. C. Moulin-Fankhanel (353-79) surveys the OHG glosses in MSS formerly in the Cathedral Library at Wurzburg; H. U. Schmid (381-92) explores perceived differences between the vocabulary of OHG glosses and 'literary' works; R. Grosse (393-410) discusses the use of conjunctions and prepositions in OHG glosses; and L. Voetz (411-27) argues that the so-called St. Pauler Lukasglossen are not in fact glosses, but rather constitute an interlinear version of their Latin source. Furthermore N. Henkel (429-51) discusses the functions of OHG glosses which appear in the form of a few letters, rather than whole words; C. Cigni (453-73) argues that both the Latin and the OHG glosses of Walafrid Strabo's Hortulus were intended for use in schools; S. Blum (475-84) demonstrates that the OHG glosses of Canon Law texts sometimes offered surprisingly free renderings appropriate to the vernacular cultural context; and M. Baldzuhn (485-512) examines MSS of Avianus's fables with OHG glosses, suggesting that those intended for oral exploitation in schools are often the most lightly glossed. E. Langbroek (513-28) discusses cases of problematic relationships between Latin lemmata and OHG glosses; W. Wegstein (529?35) presents evidence for dating the Summarium Heinrici to no later than 11 o 1; and S. Strieker (551-73) examines the Latin verses and German interlinear glosses of the Versus de volucribus. The Heliand is discussed by E. S. Dick, Firchow Vol., 23-30, who examines its strategies of cultural and semantic transfer; by H. Hafer land, DVLG, 95:237-56, who discerns the influence of Germanic heroic poetry on its narrative conception and structure; and by T. Klein, Fest. Menke, 375-84, who raises the fundamental issue of whether its language can be described as OS. W. Haubrichs, Fest. Ruberg, 99-112, assesses the extent to which direct speech used in Otfrid's Evangelienbuch reflects contemporary oral usage; J. Schneider, Firchow Vol., 343-58, discusses the historical political context in which the work was composed; and W. Kleiber, Schroder Vol., 115-41, examines the use of initials to separate groups of strophes in Otfrid's own MS of it. Two articles in Firchow Vol. are concerned with Notker Labeo: A. A. Grotans (1 o 1 -17) speculates on how his works might have been composed and copied, and identifies the scribal hands of the St Gall and Zurich MSS of them; and P. Ochsenbein (299-315) prints and comments on 25 short texts from as far apart as the 1 ith and 17th cs which discuss Notker's life and works. Meanwhile in Bergmann,</page><page sequence="10">Medieval Literature 623 Glossen, 575-85, A. Schwarz suggests that Notker could be said to 'deconstruct' the texts he translates. Essays on other OHG subjects: R. Schmidt-Wiegand, Firchow Vol., 335-42, discusses examples of vernacular legal terms in Carolingian capitularies; H. Fromm, Fest. Brunner, 1 ?14, considers possible reasons for the 'gap' in OHG literature after c. 900; and W. Haubrichs, Schroder Vol., 143-59, outlines the MS tradition of Latin lives of St George, on which the OHG Georgslied depends. 3. Middle High German general. Beate Hennig et al., Kleines Mittelhochdeutsches Worterbuch, 4th rev. edn, Tubingen, Niemeyer, xxvi 4- 503 pp., appears in a fourth edition only eight years after the publication of the first (see TWMLS, 55: 710, 57:665, 60:584). This in itself bears testimony to its reliability and user-friendliness. The present edition revises and slightly expands its immediate predecessor, in the light of comments from reviewers and other users. E. Meineke, Firchow Vol., 653-74, surveys existing MHG dictionaries and makes recommendations for future ones; and K. Gartner and R. Plate, Fest. Ruberg, 247-56, describe two current lexicographical projects. One involves the preparation of online and CD-ROM versions of four existing MHG dictionaries (see TWMLS, 62:597; the CD-ROM is introduced in detail by T. Burch andj. Fournier, %DA, 130:306-18). The other seeks to create, by c. 2022, a new four-volume Mittelhochdeutsches Worterbuch. In Moser, Verarbeitung, R. Plate and U. Recker (169-83) discuss the information technology used in connection with this latter project; and Y. Yokoyama (159-68) describes the computer-assisted concordance to Wirnt von Gravenberg's Wigalois which was prepared as part of it. Also in Moser, Verarbeitung, Y. Koga (107-15) reports on work to create a bilingual MHG/Japanese dictionary; F. Debus (117-28) outlines the principles on which his forthcoming dictionary of names in MHG literature is based; I. Lemberg (129-47) discusses the role of information technology in the preparation of the Deutsches Rechtswdrterbuch; P. Sappier (149-58) describes problems encountered when compiling the indices to the Repertorium der Sangspriiche und Meisterlieder, and S. Moser (185-98) gives details of the database constructed as part of his study of early NHG noun derivations. Meanwhile T. Klein (83-103) describes the processes involved in creating a MHG grammar from texts scanned into a computer; and C. M. Sperberg-McQueen (3-22) discusses various aspects of the relationship between information technology and philology. Johannes Singer, Mittelhochdeutscher Grundwortschatz, 3rd rev. edn (UTB, 2253), Paderborn, Schoningh, x 4- 170 pp., is both fuller and</page><page sequence="11">624 German Studies easier to use than earlier editions. There is now at least one textual example (from Hartmann, the Nibelungenlied, or Walther) for each of the 698 lemmata; the layout of the entries is clearer; and the notes for the user are more helpful. Not least because of its excellent summary of MHG grammar, this is now an outstandingly useful volume for students. JOWG, 12, 2000, subtitled 'Bilanz der Spatmittelalterforschung', features numerous articles that assess the current state of research into a particular subject and suggest lines of future inquiry. H. Brunner (1-20) begins with a general survey of late-medieval research by Germanists. Areas subsequently covered are editorial methodology (K. Kranich-Hofbauer, 49-64) and textual variance (M. J. Schubert, 35-47); vernacular MS culture (C. Bertelsmeier Kierst and J. Wolf, 21-34); heroic epic and Spielmannsdichtung (W. Kofler, 95-105, and S. Kerth and E. Lienert, 107-22); Mdren and their thematization of relationships between the sexes (M. Schnyder, 123-34); Minnereden (W. Achnitz, 137-49); late Spruehdichtung and early Meistersang (J.

Furbeth, 411-22); and the theory and practice of gebliimte Rede (G. Hiibner, 175-84). Moreover J. Goheen (163-74) considers research into late-medieval concepts of memory, with special reference to gnomic texts; both M. Ankermann (339-51) and W. Beutin (353-63) examine the relationship between mysticism and science; G. Blaschitz (381-96) discusses the interface between Germanic philology and Realienkunde', and C. Brinker-von der Heyde (65-81) assesses the potential of interdisciplinary research linking literary studies with intellectual history and anthropology. J. Janota, BGDSL, 123:397-427, surveys the entire field of late-medieval literature in one article. Annette Volfing, John the Evangelist in Medieval German Writing. Imitating the Inimitable, OUP, x 4- 273 pp., is an important and original study of the ways in which the fourth Evangelist is presented and instrumentalized in MHG literature. Both devotional and poetolo gical uses of John are explored, with special reference throughout to the question of imitation, be it the imitatio sancti enjoined in homiletic and similar contexts, or the imitatio auctoris problematized in narrative and lyric poetry. A substantial introductory chapter discusses the construction of the John-figure in Latin accounts of his biography and in the liturgy of his two saint's days. V. then turns to vernacular</page><page sequence="12">Medieval Literature 625 devotional works, analysing first a selection of sermons (in which John is typically perceived as a mirror reflecting Christ in both his writings and his person), and then the little known Johannes-Libelli (c. 1400). Finally she considers the poetological uses of John in both biblical epic and Meisterlieder. For all their differences, the narrative or lyrical personae who preside over these works share an intrinsically ambiva lent view of John, who for them is both role-model and rival. J. F. Hamburger, Peters, Text, 296-327, discusses various presentations of John's virginity in medieval literature and art. Other general or comparative studies: in Test. Ruberg, R. Voss (21-34) discusses the concept of a person's name as presented in courtly literature, and S. Obermaier (45-60) considers various models of the relationship between hidden and obvious meanings of texts. In Firchow Vol., J. C. Frakes (85-100) examines the motif of women watching men from windows in Das Nibelungenlied, Die Klage, Kudrun, and the narratives of Wolfram; and S. C. Van D'Elden (407-23) evaluates the claims to literacy or illiteracy made by the narrators of works by Hartmann, Wolfram, Hildegard, and Ulrich von Lichtenstein. Elsewhere W. G. Rohr, Gorner, Traces, 47-87, analyses the meanings of kldr and its derivatives in various 12th-c. texts; S. Kerth, Fest. Brunner, 267-89, studies Das Wachtelmare and other examples of MHG nonsense literature; I. Bennewitz, JIG, 32, 2000:8-18, discusses family structures and relationships presented in MHG literature; S.

Gossmann, DB, 105, 2000:49-57, examines gender-specific metaphors used by a number of authors, including Hildegard and Gertrud von Helfta, to illuminate divine and human nature; R. Peters, Fest. Menke, 591-601, comments on several i3th-c. Westphalian texts; A. Classen, Spiewok Vol., 89-118, discusses the presentation of bereavement and grieving in MHG literature, especially in Die Klage and Der Ackermann aus Bohmen; Id., SM, 42:565-604, assesses the importance of money in Walther von der Vogelweide, Boppe, Der Strieker, Oswald von Wolkenstein, and Fortunatus; and W. Rocke, Hubrath, Zwickau, 145-66, studies descriptions of monsters and portents in late medieval and early modern literature. EARLY MIDDLE HIGH GERMAN LITERATURE Robert G. Sullivan, Justice and the Social Context of Early Middle High German Literature (Studies in Medieval History and Culture, 5), NY, Routledge, xviii 4- 186 pp., illuminates the socio-historical content of early MHG religious literature from between roughly 1050 and 1200</page><page sequence="13">626 German Studies by examining its concept of justice (refit). S. argues that this concept, which owes much to patristic and medieval Latin notions of iustitia, is concerned less with legal than with moral and social categories, emphasizing as it does not just impartial and corruption-free jurisdiction, but also favour and mercy towards the poor. As such it depends fundamentally on the perception of a divinely-inspired ordering of society, in which everyone has his 'due'. S. concludes that this perspective on justice constitutes both a reaction to the poverty and venality of contemporary society, and an intriguing precursor of the aristocratic code of courtly virtues. C. Mackert, ?ZW5 130:143-65, describes a forgotten igth-c. copy by Heinrich Schreiber of a page from the lost 'StraBburg-Molsheimer Handschrift', which shows received wisdom on the codex to be in need of revision; E. Hellgardt, Firchow Vol., 149-60, points to apparent contradictions in the montage structure of Williram von Ebersberg's Expositio in Cantica Canticorum, and assesses the implications of Williram's use of the first person pronoun; M. Moser, Spiewok Vol., 253-60, dicusses realistic and fantastic elements in the Merigarto; E. Nellmann, %DA, 130:377-91, investigates textual contamination in the 'Vorauer Handschrift' of the Kaiserchronik, M. Schulz, Kellner, Kommunikation, 73-88, discusses ways in which the 'Kemenatenszene' of Kbnig Rother prefigures the work's harmonious ending; W. Hoffmann, &lt;Z&gt;.P, 120:345-60, argues for a return to the traditional view of Genelun in the Rolandslied as a self-centred traitor; and S. M.Johnson, Firchow Vol., 187-94, edits, translates into English, and comments on the religious-didactic poem Die Wahrheit. O. Neu deck, Euphorion, 95:287-303, discusses ways in which forms of symbolic communication are presented and ironized in Herzog Ernst (B) and in the Mbelungenlied; R. Luff, Euphorion, 95:305-40, seeks to reconstruct the contours of an oral performance of the former work; and K.-P. Ebel, FmSt, 34, 2000:186-212, discusses its thematization of the peaceful resolution of conflict. There are three full-length volumes devoted to Hildegard von Bingen. Barbara Beuys, Denn ich bin krank vor Liebe\ Das Leben der Hildegard von Bingen, Munich, Hanser, 376 pp., is a popular biography. B.'s awareness of contemporary scholarship on Hildegard is not always sophisticated; her description of certain aspects of her life (for example her childhood and relationship with Richardis) are decidedly speculative; and her strong emphasis on Hildegard's progressiveness and modernity is not consistently convincing. On the other hand, this is a generally solid and highly readable account of Hildegard's life, which will have wide appeal. Viki Ranff, Wissen und Weisheit bei Hildegard von Bingen (MGG, 1.17), 443 pp., is a scholarly analysis of</page><page sequence="14">Medieval Literature 627 Hildegard's thought written from a philosopher's perspective. R. stu dies the meanings and implications of the terms scientia and sapientia as they occur (apparently some 2,600 times between them) in Hildegard's works. These concepts emerge as more central to her theological and anthropological ideas than has hitherto been recog nized, not least in that the similarities and differences between divine and human wisdom can be seen as paradigmatic for the relationship between God and his rational creatures more generally. R. also illuminates the linguistic means by which Hildegard conveys precise philosophical ideas; and she demonstrates that the abbess was both profoundly influenced by ancient, patristic, and medieval philosophy, and able to express herself in philosophically rigorous terms. Berndt, Angesicht, contains numerous essays on Hildegard. Several deal with her relationship to aspects of her spiritual and cultural context: F. J. Felten (27-86) discusses her views on contemporary reform move ments, the circumstances of her own monastic life, and her coenobitic ideal; G. Iversen (87-113) studies her descriptions of the celestial hierarchies in the light of other contemporary perceptions of them; and F. Staab (157-79) and U. Vones-Liebenstein (213-40) examine her relationship to Cistercian spirituality and the or do canonicus respectively. More specifically on Hildegard's own works, J. van Banning (243-68) and B. Mayne Kienzle (299-324) study her Gospel homilies, the former from a theological perspective and the latter focusing on her exegesis of the parable of the Prodigal Son; R. Berndt (269-90) explores her theology of vision, and H. B. Feiss (291-98) the Christology of the Scivias; C. J. Mews (325-42) discusses her use of reports of her visions to communicate views on the need for Church reform; J. Schroder (343-74) examines her treatment of the Book of Ezekiel in her visionary writings; and A. Schavan (17-23) considers her conception of human nature. Two pieces by L. Moulinier deal with the scientific writings attributed to Hildegard: the first (115-46) questions her authorship of Causae et curae, and the second (545-59) considers her presentation of magic, psychology, and 'soul-sickness' in that work and in the Physica. Meanwhile, M. Enders (461-501) discusses Hildegard's notably anthropomorphic concept of nature. Hildegard's reception and influence are studied by A. Einarsson (377-400), who sees her imagery as a key to understanding the Icelandic Raudulfs Thattr, by M. Embach (401-59), who discusses the transmission of her works in MSS and, especially, early printed editions; by E. Stein (577-91), who examines the reception of her visions in and via the much copied Pentachronon of Gebeno von Eberbach; byj. C. S. Paz (561-76), who surveys medieval discussions of her sanctity; and by W. Lauter (503-43), who catalogues no fewer</page><page sequence="15">628 German Studies than 82 relics and reliquaries devoted to her. Elsewhere R. Hilde brandt, Bergmann, Glossen, 537-50, describes his planned new edition of Hildegard's Physica; and S. El Kholi, Euphorion, 95:257-62, comments on two of her letters (Storch 163 and 163R). MIDDLE HIGH GERMAN HEROIC LITERATURE 'Ortnit und Wolfdietrich D\ Kritischer Text nach MS Carm. 2 der Stadt- und Universitdtsbibliothek Frankfurt am Main, ed. Walter Kofler, Stuttgart, Hirzel, 451 pp., is the first edition of the so-called 4a' version of Ortnit/ Wolfdietrich D, based on MS b, copied in Alsace around 1420. Editing a text of more than 2,800 Mbelungenstrophen is a Herculean task, which K. performs creditably. His text, intended to complement rather than replace editions of other versions, maintains a judicious balance between comprehensibility and fidelity to the base MS, though his use of a different typeface for material added from MS c is irritating. His introduction clarifies the work's convoluted origins and textual history, describes its MSS, and considers its internal contradictions. There are several short studies of the Nibelungenlied. M. Jonsson, SN, 73:223-37, sees its author's presentation of dilemmas confronting the characters as a means of distancing himself from the fatalistic quality of his source; T. Robin, RG, 30, 2000:1-16, examines its narrative technique, stressing in particular affinities to drama; U. Schulze, Fest. Brunner, 161-80, discusses its reception and instru mentalization of motifs from Walther von der Vogelweide; K. Wilson and D. P. Beistle, GN, 32: 14-17, point to its innovative treatment of the heroic water-crossing topos; I. Cavalie, ^DP, 120:361-80, surveys interpretations of Siegfried's aggressive arrival at Worms; and E. R. Haymes, Fest. Brunner, 447-61, examines aspects of MS n which arguably reflect recollections of oral performances on the part of its scribe. Furthermore, A. Classen, Neophilologus, 85:565-87, interprets the Nibelungenlied and Klage in the light of sociological theories concerning communication and communicative action; K. Stack mann, -^DP, 120:381-93, considers the implications for editorial theory of Joachim Bumke's remarkable synoptic edition of the Klage; E. Lienert, ?DA, 130:127-42, examines its presentation of dead heroes and their posthumous reputation; and N. Watanabe, DB, 107:115-25, discusses the differing concepts of list that inform the presentation of Kriemhild in the Klage and in Der Rosengarten zu Worms A. In ASNS, 238: 241-59, E. Lienert sees the challenge and relevance of heroic epic in the problematic nature of its textuality and in its depiction of war, history, and heroism; and in Cramer, Frauenlieder, 151?61, H. Sievert analyses the Wechsel sung by the protagonists of Karl und Galie(\\\, 23-30, 49-56).</page><page sequence="16">Medieval Literature 629 THE COURTLY ROMANCE Joseph M. Sullivan, Counsel in Middle High German Arthurian Romance (GAG, 690), vi 4- 148 pp., is the first comprehensive study of counsel in romances from between roughly 1185 and 1290. S.'s definition of counsel (rat) is a very broad one, encompassing for example non verbal aid and the promptings of God, the Devil, or one's own heart; but he concentrates especially on political advice given by and to individuals. A substantial introduction surveys the situations in which counsel is given, the status and personal qualities of those who participate in them, and differences in the presentation of counsel in romance as against epic. This is followed by three 'case studies', dealing with Erec, Iwein, and the Prosa-Lancelot. S. stresses throughout the role of counsel scenes in establishing character and generating narrative action, but also sees them as loci of comment on the function and value of advice in contemporary aristocratic society. The bulk of S.'s chapter on Iwein appears also in Neophilologus, 85* 335-54- .. Bernhard Ohlinger, Destruktive (unminne\ Der Liehe ? Leid ? Tod ? Komplex in der Epik um 1200 im Kontext zeitgenossischer Diskurse (GAG, 673), xxviii 4- 196 pp., discusses love's relationship with suffering, illness, combat, and death in six central MHG narratives: Eneit, Erec, Parzival, Willehalm, Tristan, and the Nihelungenlied. O. discerns in these works a powerful and intrinsically physical form of love which, when lost or unrequited, can have destructive or even fatal consequences. He then evaluates this concept of love against the background of contemporary theological attitudes, and concludes that, not least in its anti-Augustinian attempt to re-unite the erotic with the sacred, it is likely to have been regarded, if expressed unequivocally, as subversive or even heretical. The resultant need for veiled discourse is seen by O. as lying behind the ambiguous and frequently perplexing religious allusions of both Gottfried and Wolfram ? a thesis that most readers will probably find intriguing rather than ultimately persuasive. M. Chinca and C. Young, Peters, Text, 612-44, use examples from Erec, Iwein, and Tristan, and the work of Pierre Bourdieu, to problematize and develop aspects of Walter Haug's analysis of medieval vernacular literary theory (see TWMLS, 47:641, 59:662). T. Reuvekamp-Felber, ?DP, 120:1-23, surveys the author/nar rator's statements about himself in prologues and epilogues by Hartmann, Wolfram, and Rudolf von Ems, stressing their depen dence on considerations of genre and plot. W. McConnell, Firchow Vol., 255-68, claims that both Gottfried and Wolfram address the dichotomy between the feminine and the masculine prevalent in their</page><page sequence="17">630 German Studies society, and propose a vision of ultimately androgynous wholeness which has its origin in Celtic perspectives. Elisabeth Lienert, Deutsche Antikenromane des Mittelalters (Grundlagen der Germanistik, 39), Berlin, Schmidt, 223 pp., is an expert, lucid, and full introductory guide to German treatments of the matiere de Rome. Separate chapters deal in turn with romances on Alexander, Aeneas, Troy, and Apollonius; these are framed by an introduction which defines the genre and examines its presentation of antiquity, and by a concluding discussion of its coherence and literary historical importance. There are excellent general and work-specific biblio graphies. In Fest. Brunner, 129-46, L. surveys the involvement of women in warfare in a variety of romances. On Veldeke's Eneit, A. Volfing, OGS, 30:1-25, discusses the hero's alleged sodomy and the author's concept of rehtiu minne; C. Kottmann, SN, 73:71-85, examines the tension between Classical traditions (especially polythe ism) and medieval cultural norms; and T. S. Weicker, ZPA, 130:1-18, discusses the work's origins, suggesting in particular that Veldeke's account of the theft of a MS is fictitious. On Herbort von Fritzlar's Liet von Troye, H. Mayer, Firchow Vol., 245-54, considers the narrator and his comments; and M. Siebel-Achenbach, GRM, 51:267-83, compares Herbort's presentation of Helen with that in Benoit de Sainte-Maure's Roman de Troie. HARTMANN VON AUE Arthurian Romances, Tales, and Lyric Poetry. The Complete Works ofHartmann von Aue, trans, and comm. Frank Tobin, Kim Vivian, and Richard H. Lawson, University Park PA, Pennsylvania State U.P., xiv + 329 pp., unites for the first time in one volume prose transla tions of all of Hartmann's works, including the Klagebilchlein and all the lyrics, even those of questionable authenticity. Existing renderings of most of the works are not exactly thin on the ground, and the new volume does not entirely supersede these. Its translations, introduct ory material, and footnotes are, however, both scholarly and accessible; it has up-to-date bibliographies; and its format is conveni ent and handsome. G. Wolf, Peters, Text, 215-44, applies Pierre Bourdieu's concepts of 'habitus' and 'field' to the interpretation of Free and Iwein; and K. Ridder, DVLG, 75:539-60, discusses Hart mann's reflections on the relationship between fictionality and authorship in the two romances. Specifically on Free, W. Mieder, MJ, 36:45-76, examines Hartmann's use of proverbs and their thematic significance; E. Schmid, Fest. Brunner, 109-27, compares the differing models of marriage informing Chretien's and Hartmann's versions; and W. C. McDonald, LB, 90:403-18, contends that the unnamed</page><page sequence="18">Medieval Literature 631 'vrouwe' on Erec's shield (L2313) forges a link between Enite and Mary (via Hartmann's putative reception of Geoffrey of Monmouth). On Iwein, F. Wenzel, Keller, Kommunikation, 89-109, assesses what the opening scene reveals about both aristocratic communication and courtly narrative culture; in the same volume, B. Quast (110-28) discusses the narrative models used to present courtly civilization, nature, and the hero's liminality; S. Heimann-Seelbach, Euphorion, 95: 263-85, analyses dilemmas faced by characters which they cannot resolve with reference to conventional ethical categories; N. Kamin ski, OGS, 30:26-51, perceives a conflict for control of the hero between Lunete and (a homoerotically motivated) Gawein, supported respectively by Frau Minne and the narrator; and A. Hausmann, Peters, Text, 72-95, interprets the differing versions of Laudine's kneeling before Iwein. Hartmann von Aue, Der arme Heinrich, ed. Hermann Paul and Kurt Gartner (ATB, 3), 17th rev. edn, xxxviii 4- 63 pp., is not significantly different from the 16th edition (see TWMLS, 58:733), though some details have been amended in the light of reviewers' comments, and the bibliography has been updated. R. A. Boggs et al., Moser, Verarbeitung, 211-29, describe a forthcoming multimedia edition, with supporting materials, of Der arme Heinrich. C. Brinker-von der Heyde, JIG, 32, 2000:45-63, examines the structure of and relationships within the nuclear families described in Hartmann's legend and in Helmbrecht] and A. Classen, StSp, 11:166-86, assesses the relationship between spiritual and worldly love in Der arme Heinrich, the letters of Abelard and Heloise, and the writings of Hadewijch. WOLFRAM VON ESCHENBACH Joachim Bumke, Die Blutstropfen im Schnee. Uber Wahrnehmung und Erkenntnis im 'Parzival3 Wolframs von Eschenbach (Hermaea, n.s., 94), Tubingen, Niemeyer, vi 4- 205 pp., is a characteristically penetrating study, which begins with a detailed analysis of the scene of the blood drops on the snow that opens Book VI of Parzival, interpreted in the light of ancient and medieval theories of perception and knowledge. The focus then broadens into a discussion of Parzival's failings of perception and cognition more generally. B. sees these as resulting from the intrinsic, tumpheit-related inability of his senses, imagination, memory, and reason to work together ? an inability which he never fully overcomes. B. goes on to suggest that issues of knowledge, perception, and learning are also problematized through the role of the comparably 'unlearned' narrator, whose frequently unreliable and self-contradictory interventions are used both to mock the</page><page sequence="19">632 German Studies procedures of more apparently sophisticated authors such as Hart mann, and to create an open narrative which the interpreter is challenged to unravel. B. summarizes many of his arguments in Peters, Text, 355-70. W. Haug, BGDSL, 123: 211-29, argues that the prologue of Parzival seeks to prepare its audience for a differentiated, open narrative which transcends conventional categories of black and white; L. P.Johnson, Fest. Brunner, 181-98, examines Wolfram's presentation of various aspects of Parzival's early life against the background of Chretien's Perceval, T. Tomasek, Fest. Menke, 879-91, discusses the implications of the image of the narrator naked in a bath (115,29-116,4); E. Nellmann, ^DP, 120:421-25, interprets the difficult lines (177,18-24) describing Gurnemanz's quadripartite heart; F. M. Dimpel, ,?DP, 120:39-59, discusses the conflicts between love and knighthood depicted in the Gawain and Orgeluse episodes; and H. Lahnemann and M. Rupp, BGDSL, 123:353-78, analyse the narrative function of parenthetical structures in Parzival. Wolfram von Eschenbach: 'Willehalm3. Abbildung des 'Willehalm3-Teils von Codex St. Gallen #57 mit einem Beitrag zu neueren Forschungen zum Sangallensis und zum Verkaufskatalog von ij6y, ed. Bernd Schirok (Litterae, 119), Goppingen, Kummerle, 2000, Hi + 139 pp., does exactly what its title says. The black-and-white photographs of the MS's text of Willehalm (on which the now standard edition by Heinzle is based ? see TWMLS, 56: 747) is preceded by a discussion of articles published on the codex since the late 1980s, and by a fascinating analysis of its description in an i8th-c. sales catalogue. W. Rocke, ?Ger, n.s. 2:274-91, explores the relationship between laughter and violence in Willehalm', and U. Liebertz-Griin, GRM, 51:385-95, interprets the Gardeviaz fragment of Titurel as an open metanarrative. GOTTFRIED VON STRASSBURG Patrizia Massadi, Autorreflexionen zur Rezeption: Prolog und Exkurse in Gottfrieds 'Tristan3 (Quaderni di Hesperides, Serie Saggi, 2), Trieste, Parnaso, 2000, 253 pp., argues that the prologue of Tristan and its various excursuses (including the digression on literature and the allegorical interpretation of the Minnegrotte) constitute an intricate continuum structured along the lines of a contemporary Latin sermon ? with the stanzaic part of the prologue comprising the thema and distinctiones, which are then subjected to dilatatio in the stichic part of the prologue and in the (carefully positioned) excursuses. M. claims that the principal theme of this continuum is the importance of the sympathetic reception of love stories, and that it reaches a climax in the so-called 'huote'-Exkurs, in which the 'noble hearts' in the audience are offered an ideal form of love which is denied to the work's</page><page sequence="20">Medieval Literature 633 protagonists. This is of course far-fetched, but M. argues her case with conviction and no little perspicacity. Peter K. Stein, Tristan-Studien, ed. Ingrid Bennewitz et al., Stuttgart, Hirzel, iv 4- 520 pp., comprises a modestly revised version of Stein's previously unpublished Habilitationsschrift (Tristan in den Literaturen des europaischen Mittelalters, Salzburg 1983), and his long 1979 essay Die Musik in Gottfrieds von Strassburg 'Tristan' (see TWMLS, 42:727), here offered as a memorial to him. The 300-page Habilitationsschrift is a magisterial survey of the entire Tristan tradition, with innumerable (partially updated) bibliographical references and much discussion of earlier research. S.'s coverage encompasses Celtic and other pre literary motifs, the French, German, Norse, and Middle English verse texts, and prose versions in French, Italian, various Iberian languages, English (Malory), Greek, Russian, and Serbo-Croat. Elsewhere J.-M. Pastre, Spiewok Vol., 261-78, interprets the French and German Tristan texts in the light of Levi-Strauss's concepts of forgetting, misunderstanding, and indiscretion; E. Nellmann, 2J)P, 120: 24-38, studies the presentation of Brangane in Gottfried, Eilhart, and the Carlisle fragments of Thomas, concluding that Gottfried used both of the other authors as sources; and G. Eifler, Fest. Ruberg, 113-30, points to the differing narrative perspectives of Gottfried and Thomas (in the Carlisle fragments). Specifically on Gottfried, M. Oswald, Kellner, Kommunikation, 129-52, shows, with reference to the Brautwer bung and to the Gandin episode, how he presents art as legitimizing itself through integration into institutionalized social norms; M. Schausten, BGDSL, 123:24-48, analyses his use of biographical and autobiographical statements made by characters to establish and develop his hero's identity; W. Roll, Fest. Brunner, 199-209, suggests that he uses literary allusions, especially to Hartmann and Virgil, to shed light on the imperfect nature of the lovers' life in the Minnegrotte; R. H. Firestone, Firchow Vol., 67-84, examines the concept of saelde and its derivatives in Tristan', U. Stormer-Caysa, Poetica, 33:51-68, discusses Gottfried's presentation of time and of kept or missed appointments; and U. Liebertz-Grun, GRM, 51: 1-20, reads his work as an open, ambiguous 'meta-romance', in which a double-tongued narrator both proposes and debunks contemporary courtly discourses. OTHER ROMANCES AND SHORTER NARRATIVES Alison Williams, Tricksters and Pranksters. Roguery in French and German Literature of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance (IFAVL, 49), 2000, viii + 236 pp., studies literary scoundrels who can be categorized as tricksters (those who deceive for material gain) and pranksters (whose</page><page sequence="21">634 German Studies prime purpose is to entertain). Figures from German literature whom W. discusses include Pfaffe Amis and the Pfarrer vom Kalenberg, Reinhart Fuchs, Eulenspiegel, and various female protagonists of Schwdnke. She is especially strong in her interpretations of the extent of Amis's victims' complicity in their own deception, and of the differences of tone and moral intention between Heinrich's Reinhart Fuchs and the Roman de Renart; and she demonstrates throughout how the transgressive, potentially destructive behaviour of tricksters often has the paradoxical effect of reinforcing social stability. Her book is also refreshing in its genuinely critical and constructive use of theoretical insights, in this case from Bakhtin, Bergson, and Freud. Maryvonne Hagby, 'man hat uns fur die warheit . . . geseit/ Die Striekersche Kurzerzdhlung im Kontext mittellateinischer 'narrationes' des 12. und 13. Jahrhunderts (Studien und Texte zum Mittelalter und zur fruhen Neuzeit, 2), Munster, Waxmann, x + 359 pp., is an original and valuable study of the complex intertextual relationships between Der Strieker's short narratives and various forms of Latin exempla. H. identifies Latin sources (often fables) for at least a quarter of Der Strieker's stories; his adaptations of these are, however, often free, and tend to emphasize their flctionality whilst clarifying and accentu ating their didactic message. Moreover H. finds evidence of Der Strieker in turn being used as a source in i4th-c. Latin collections. Her book throws into consistent relief the German poet's learning and literary talent, as well as the perhaps surprising coherence of his ceuvre. J. Margetts, Fest. Brunner, 227-48, establishes that much of the information on precious stones retailed in Der Strieker's Von den edelen Steinen is derived from Latin encyclopaedias; and H. Ragotzky, BGDSL, 123:49-64, discusses the complex relationships between Der Strieker's Mdren and the didactic epimythia which often conclude them. R.Chamberlain, MGS, 24, 1999:8-17, interprets Ulrich von Zatzikhoven's presentation of the dragon Elidia in Lanzelet as an example of the use of fantastic elements to imply spiritual meaning. A. Classen, ABAG, 55:75-93, discusses issues arising out of recent publications on Mauritius von Craun; and T. Bulang, Kellner, Kommuni kation, 207-29, reads Mauritius as thematizing problems of courtly communication and interaction. There are three articles on Heinrich von dem Turlin's Diu Crone: G. Shockey, ABAG, 55:127-45, argues that Heinrich, influenced by contemporary jurisprudence, attempts to reconstruct Arthur's court as an ideal of stability and the rule of law; M. Meyer, Peters, Text, 529-45, applies James Phelan's theory of 'literary character', as well as psychological perspectives, to an analysis of the figures of Artus and Gawein; and S. T. Samples, Arthuriana, 11.4:23-38, examines the role of the 'problem women'</page><page sequence="22">Medieval Literature 635 Amurfina and Giramphiel, and the contrasting degrees to which they are integrated into Arthurian society. In addition, B. Schirok, ?1X4, 130:166-96, discusses questions of editorial principle raised by Werner Schroder's recent edition of Ulrich von dem Turlin's Arabel (see YWMLS, 61:617). There are two new monographs on the Prosa-Lancelot. Thordis Hennings, Altfranzbsischer und mittelhochdeutscher 'Prosa-Lancelot'. Uber setzungs- und quellenkritische Studien, Heidelberg, Winter, xii 4- 452 pp., sheds new light on the relationship between the German romance and its French source. Painstakingly detailed comparison of five substantial parallel sections from the first part of the Prosa-Lancelot and the Lancelot propre yields two main insights. First, the German author worked from a MS of a strikingly independent, now lost, French version, whose text was similar to that of the hitherto little studied MS O. Secondly, his rendering of this version is a notably literal translation (of high quality), rather than an 'adaptation courtoise'. Essentially, H. has identified and convincingly reconstructed a missing link between the French and German traditions. She summarizes many of these points in BGDSL, 123:379-96, suggesting also that the German translation might have been made for the Count Palatine of the Rhine. Judith Klinger, Der mifiratene Ritter. Konzeptionen von Identitat im 'Prosa-Lancelot' (FGADL, 26), 528 pp., is a densely argued and theory-informed discussion of the many complex forms of personal identity thematized in the romance. Its three main sections deal successively with Lancelot as Arthurian knight, lover, and seeker after the Grail (and hence himself). Lancelot emerges as an ambivalent and inconsistent figure, whose identity is not the product of any intrinsic individuality, but rather is constructed by means of various, not always obviously compatible, narrative stra tegies. K. Speckenbach, Fest. Ruberg, 131-42, discusses parallels in the presentation of Lancelot's amorous relationship with Ginover and of his friendship with Galahot. K. Philipowski both re-assesses (WW, 51:165-82) the relationship between freedom, predestination, and heredity in the Prosa-Lancelot, and suggests (DVLG, 75'. 363-86) that its poetic structure is undermined and demystified by the use of allegory and personification. Sebastian Coxon, The Presentation of Authorship in Medieval German Narrative Literature 1220-1290, OUP, x + 254 pp., is a distinguished and wide-ranging study of the varied ways in which I3th-c. narrative poets thematized their own authorship. The corpus of texts covered comprises all the narratives of Rudolf von Ems and Konrad von Wurzburg, as well as some 17 heroic epics and 52 Mdren. These are analysed against the background both of the techniques of self presentation used by the canonical Blutezeit poets, and of such</page><page sequence="23">636 German Studies pertinent i3th-c. developments as the social diversification ofliterary culture and the rise of lay literacy. The picture which emerges is an immensely complex and in some respects surprising one: Rudolf's espousal of numerous strategies of self-assertion from both Latin and vernacular sources, and not least the portraits of him which feature in several MSS, contrast markedly with Konrad's often cursory references to himself and his patrons, and superficial disconnec tedness from MHG literary traditions. Moreover the heroic epics and short stories which C. discusses evince not just the authorial anonymity and self-effacement one would expect to find in these genres, but also, especially in the case of the Maren, elements of an authorial self-consciousness more normally associated with romance. C.'s book is notable not least for its sensitivity to the tensions between 'original' texts and their MS transmission, and for its judicious use of Foucault's theory of 'author-function'. Also on Rudolf and Konrad: S. Zoller, /?ZM, 130:270-90, re-evaluates Dieter Kartschoke's view of Dergute Gerhart as a study of the human conscience; and E. Feistner, Fest. Brunner, 291-304, examines the themes of eating and table manners in Konrad's narratives, amongst which she numbers Die halbe Birne. Anne Wawer, Tabuisierte Liebe. Mythische Erzahlschemata in Konrads von Wiirzburg 'Partonopier und Meliur'und im Friedrich von Schwaben\ Cologne, Bohlau, 2000, x + 257 pp., examines these two romances against the background of mythic analogues in which the love of a male protagonist and a woman with supernatural characteristics is hindered by a taboo. Partonopier und Meliur is compared especially to the Greek legend of Amor and Psyche, and Friedrich von Schwaben to the Irish Echtra Airt. Detailed textual analysis reveals that both German works are much more indebted to mythic narrative struc tures than are, say, the canonical Arthurian romances, but that they also develop and adapt these in ways that reflect high medieval preoccupations. This is true, for example, of the consistent fore grounding of questions of individual love in both romances, of Partonopier und Meliur s transformation of what is originally a Madchen tragbdie into a Knabentragbdie, or of Friedrich von Schwaben 's emphasis on the theme of poverty caused by a divided inheritance. M. Schulz, ABAG, 55:147-92, reads Friedrich von Schwaben as a didactic work dealing with the importance of honour and loyalty for the consolida tion of political power. In Nolte, Helmbrecht, F. P. Knapp (9-24) examines Wernher's presentation of the betrayal of class and homeland against the background of other contemporary Bavarian-Austrian works; H. Kastner (25-43) draws fascinating and suggestive parallels between the themes of Helmbrecht and contemporary Franciscan social</page><page sequence="24">Medieval Literature 637 and legal thought; and U. Seelbach (45-69) examines links between Helmbrecht and the Hildemar strophes of Neidhart, as well as updating (83-116) his 1981 bibliography (see TWMLS, 43: 762-63). Heinrich von Neustadt, Leben und Abenteuer des grofien Konigs Apollonius von Tyrus zu Land und zur See, trans, and ed. Helmut Birkhan, Berne, Lang, 463 pp., is the first modern translation of Apollonius von Tyrland. B. 's version is highly readable, the volume is handsomely produced (including for example all 109 miniatures from the Vienna MS C), and there are over 100 pages of explicatory material. All in all, the task of making Apollonius more readily available could hardly have been better performed, and one hopes the book will attract the wide non-specialist audience it deserves. D. Huschenbett, Fest. Brunner, 305-31, interprets and translates the closing sections (5949-6045) of Albrecht's Jiingerer Titurel. C. Wand-Wittkowski, Poetica, 32, 2000:227-49, sees Reinfried von Braunschweig as a 'new' type of hero, motivated by curiosity and avoiding the conventional pattern of crisis followed by rehabilitation; and A. Classen, Seminar, 37:95-112, discusses the often idealized presentation of women, marriage, and relationships between the sexes in Reinfried. Studies of other late-medieval narratives: B. Kellner, Peters, Text, 268-95, surveys the relationship between the human and the demonic in Latin and vernacular Melusine stories (including that of Thiiring von Ringoltingen); J. H. Winkelman, ABAG, 55:223-38, discusses the relationship between late-medieval erotic insignia and Mdren such as Das Monnenturnier, Gold und ?ers9 and Der Rosendorn; C. Fasbender and C. Kropik, Euphorion, 95:341-55, present two radically different readings of Das Nonnenturnier, both of which they consider intrinsic to the work's texture and intention; J. Sander, Kellner, Kommunikation, 231-48, examines the construction of common authorship as a unifying factor in the corpus attributed in Cgm 270 to Heinrich Kaufringer; R. Schlechtweg-Jahn, FCS, 26, 2000:142-57, examines the roles of the author, the narrator, and dialogue in Hermann von Sachsenheim's Die Mdrin; G. Kornrumpf, Fest. Brunner, 473-85, edits and introduces Der Herr von Braunschweig, a brief prose narrative in Jorg Stuler's Historienbuch (c.1479); and D. Huschenbett, %DA, 130:431 -34, contends that Fortunatus was written in Augsburg. LYRIC POETRY Schwob, Entstehung, is centred around the three leaves from an illustrated lyric MS (Budapest, National Library, Cod. Germ. 92, ?.1300, from Austria/Bavaria), which were rediscovered in 1985. These fragments, known as Bu, are described by G. Kornrumpf (165-85), who also discusses their relationship to Minnesang MSS B</page><page sequence="25">638 German Studies and C, and the likely common source *BuBC. C. Bertelsmeier-Kierst (37-46) places Bu in the context of other Bavarian-Austrian lyric MSS, and suggests that it originated in Regensburg. A. Vizkelety (303-14) argues that Bu's iconography, but not its scribal hands, link it with a group of MSS produced around 1300 by the 'Meister der Munchner Weltchronik'; and M. Roland's comparison (207-22) of Bu's illustrations both to other works of the 'Meister' and to MS C leads him to date the fragments to the first decade of the 14th c. Meanwhile A. Hausmann (65-77) contends that the stanzas ascribed in Bu to Rudolf von Rotenburg were attributed in their (loose-leaf) source to Reinmar der Alte. The volume also contains essays on other lyric MSS: W. Hofmeister (79-106) surveys gaps left by the principal scribe of MS C, and discusses the ways in which these were filled; M. Siller (255-80) examines the 'Sterzinger Miszellaneen Handschrift', arguing that it did not originate in the Southern Tyrol; C. Edwards (47-64) surveys the vernacular secular lyrics copied in MSS from the Benedictine monastery of Kremsmunster; and M. Schiendorfer (223-41) discusses opportunities and problems associated with attempts to reconstruct the lost i5th-c. song MS of Heinrich Laufenberg. Essays with a slightly broader perspective include F.-J. Holznagel's typology (107-30) of vernacular lyric MSS from the 12th-14th cs, T. Bein's plea (15-36) that literary historians should react more positively and creatively to MS attributions of stanzas or songs to more than one author, and U. Miiller's assessment (187-206) of the value of jottings inserted in lyric MSS. In 2J)A, I3o:392_43?5 U. Peters compares the illustrations of German lyric MSS with those of their Provencal and French counterparts. Alongside treatments of individual poets (discussed below), Cramer, Frauentieder, contains several contributions of a more general nature. I. Kasten (3-18) surveys research into Frauenlieder, and suggests as a future project the elaboration of a 'Poetologie der weiblichen Stimme'; U. Wyss (163-69) censures the tendency of earlier scholars to view cantigas de amigo and their German equivalents as close to nature, and hence to the origins of Western love poetry; T. Cramer (19-32) outlines the difficulty of distinguishing between Frauen- and Mannerstrophen, suggesting that acknowledging the 'andro gyny' of many poems and stanzas opens up new interpretative possibilities; S. Obermaier (33-48) compares the roles played by the male and female first-person speakers of Frauenlieder and classical Minnesang; E. Schmid (49-58) identifies stylistic and rhetorical devices used by poets to distinguish between male and female speakers; and J. Margetts (59-67) shows how such distinctions can be drawn also on the basis of syntax. Meanwhile I. Bennewitz (69-84) considers the tendency of poets such as Reinmar and Neidhart to place erotic and</page><page sequence="26">Medieval Literature 639 obscene discourse in the mouths of female speakers; and N. R. Wolf (85-93) traces an increased use of dialogue in Frauenlieder by later medieval poets such as the Monch von Salzburg and Oswald von Wolkenstein. Hinderer, Lyrik, has a new publisher since its first edition (see TWMLS, 45:643), and also a new chapter on 'Lyrik heute'. U. Muller's contribution on the Middle Ages (20-48) has, however, been reproduced unaltered save for an updated bibliography. Jan Dirk Miiller, Minnesang und Literaturtheorie, ed. U. von Bloh et al., Tubingen, Niemeyer, viii 4-246 pp., collects nine of M.'s essays published between 1984 and 2001. These are linked by a consistent attempt to apply the insights of literary theory to the study of MHG lyric poetry, especially that of Walther von der Vogelweide, Ulrich von Lichtenstein, and Neidhart. The latter is the subject of the most recent essay (233-44), which also appears in Schabert Vol., 334-45. In it, M. interprets Neidhart's treatment of dialogue in his Sommerlieder as a sign of his rejection of the gender roles of conventional Minnesang. H. Tervooren, Fest. Brunner, 15-47, examines traces of the Song of Songs and of Marian poetry in various examples of Minnesang; N. Henkel, Ragotzky, Liedinterpretation, 13-39, outlines the problems posed by stanzas which stand alone in some MSS, but in others form part of longer songs; L. Lieb, Kellner, Kommunikation, 183-206, discusses the function of the topos of the seasons in Minnesang; R. Schnell, Peters, Text, 96-149, argues that the shift from oral to written reception of Minnelieder typically entailed a different and narrower perception of the poetic T; and F. J. Worstbrock, Ragotzky, Liedinterpretation, 75?90, postulates a lost vernacular Minnesang tradi tion emphasizing nature and joy, which had parallels in the Latin Carmina Burana and decisively influenced Neidhart. Hie 'Carmina Burana': Four Essays, ed. Martin H. Jones (King's College London Medieval Studies, 18), Exeter, Short Run, 2000, x 4- 109 pp., contains pieces by experts in four different fields. A. J. Duggan (1 ? 13) discusses the MS's social and intellectual context, with special reference to contemporary student culture; P. Dronke (25-40) examines the Latin songs, singling out CB 85, 120, 165, 131, and 177 as examples of the collection's amorous and satirical material; C. Edwards (41-70) surveys the MS's German texts, assessing its glosses, aphorisms, dramas, and excerpts from St John's Gospel and the Eckenlied, as well as the lyrics; andj. Walworth (71-83) examines its pictures and their relationships to the groups of poems they accompany. In Cramer, Frauenlieder(267'-80), Edwards accounts for the more extensive use of Frauenstrophen in the MS's German and macaronic songs than in its purely Latin ones. In MJ, 36, D. Schaller (77-93) essays a typology of its Latin love lyrics on the basis of generic</page><page sequence="27">640 German Studies and formal criteria; and D. A. Traill, ib., 95-112, offers a new edition (with translation and commentary) of CB 60 and 60a. Moreover, in Fest. Brunner, 211-26, J. Janota discusses the refrains of the bilingual love songs, especially CB 179-85. In Schwob, Entstehung, 143-63, P. Kern compares Kurenberg 7,1, 7,10, 8,33, and 9,5 as transmitted in MSS C and Bu; and H. Ter vooren (291-301) interprets the variant MS readings of her and ^rin Kurenberg, 8,9. T. Reuvekamp-Felber, Peters, Text, 377-402, dis cerns numerous elements of fictionality, and few of ritual, in Kiirenberg's songs. Meanwhile T. Neukirchen, GRM, 511285-302, discusses the strophes attributed to the Burggraf von Rietenburg, stressing their coherence and literary-historical importance, whereas J. Janota, Schwob, Entstehung, 131-42, suggests a common authorship for these strophes and for those attributed to the Burggraf von Regensburg. In Fest. Brunner, U. Meves (49-72) re-examines the documentary evidence relating to the biography of Ulrich von Gutenberg; D. Klein (73-93) assesses the interplay between the discourse of love and that of crusading propaganda, especially in songs by Hausen and Johansdorf; T. Ehlert (95-107) discusses ways in which Hartmann's lyrics both construct and ironically deconstruct the concept othoheMinne; and R. Fisher, ABAG, 55:61-74, addresses textual and translation problems of Wolfram's Ez ist nu tac, and considers its use of alienation techniques. Hans Irler, Minnerollen ? Rollenspiele. Fiktion und Funktion im Minnesang Heinrichs von Morungen (Mikrokosmos, 62), Frankfurt, Lang, 310 pp., interprets the poetic T of Morungen's songs as oscillating between and creatively combining the roles of wooer, poet, and 'mediator' of love. The latter has the function of expressing joy and admiration for the lady on behalf of the audience, and is presented by I. as one of several devices used by Morungen to thematize the complex interaction between the poet's voice, his lady, and his audience which is intrinsic to Minnesang. For all the diverse relation ships between poetry and reality which they suggest, Morungen's songs emerge as a surprisingly coherent whole, linked by a strong sense of the poet's individuality, and by a pervasive, and strikingly modern, degree of openness and ambiguity. D. Hirschberg, Ra gotzky, Liedinterpretation, 40-56, discusses Morungen's concept of herzeliebe. There are several essays on Walther von der Vogelweide. G. Hahn, Fest. Brunner, 147-60, discusses the coherence of his ceuvre; C. Ort mann, Ragotzky, Liedinterpretation, 57-74, analyses the roles played by the singer and the concept of werdekeit in his 'Palastinalied'; J. Ashcroft, Cramer, Frauenlieder, 95-102, examines his songs with female speakers, emphasizing in particular their dialogicity and poetological</page><page sequence="28">Medieval Literature 641 motivation; W. Hoffmann, LJb, 42:9-42, surveys his Altersdichtung, paying particular attention to the 'Reuelied' (122,24); and M. Chinca, Hutchinson, Landmarks, 9-30, discusses the MS transmission of his 'Elegy', which he goes on to interpret as a 'kaleidoscope of lamentation'. Jorn Bockmann, 'Translatio NeidhardV. Untersuchungen zur Konstitution derFigurenidentitdtin der Neidhart-Tradition (Mikrokosmos, 61), Frankfurt, Lang, 395 pp., is concerned with the construction of Neidhart's identity in all the songs attributed to him, and in the i5th-c. 'Schwankroman' Neithart Fuchs. B. examines first the names ascribed to Neidhart, which, with their consistently negative overtones, do not facilitate a clear distinction between author and protagonist. Then he analyses Neidhart's interaction with other characters in the songs of MSS R and c, again concluding that the relationships described are inconsistent, polyvalent, and multi-functional. Finally, a detailed discussion of Neithart Fuchs shows that it too constructs a protagonist who is both courtier and rascal, and who as such, for all his invariable application of list, remains ultimately ambivalent. I. Bennewitz et al., Hubrath, Zwic^au-&gt; I9_54&gt; survey the transmission of the Neithart Fuchs corpus, describe the principles of the forthcoming Salzburg Neidhart edition in which it will be printed, and interpret its 'Welt-Lauf-Lied' z 38/h. The contribution made by information technology to this project is described by U. Muller and A. Weiss in Moser, Verarbeitung, 201-09. Cramer, Frauenlieder, contains two comparative studies of the mother-daughter dialogues in Neidhart's ceuvre and in the cantigas de amigo. E. Koller (103-22) constructs a typology of these; and V. Millet (123?32) sees Neidhart's originality above all in the roles he gives to his narrators. Moreover J.-D. Muller, Ragotzky, Liedinterpretation, 91-102, finds in Neidhart MS c narrative elements which suggest 15th-c. reception of these poems in written form; and G. Shockey, NMi, 102 1469-81, discusses the peasant women presented in 'Som merlied' 14. Helmut Tervooren, Sangspruchdichtung (SM, 293), 2nd rev. edn, x 4- 150 pp., is a modestly revised and updated edition of this thorough and reliable survey (see TWMLS, 57:685). D. Peil, Fest. Ruberg, 35-44, discusses reflections on language in Spruchdichtung, especially by Reinmar von Zweter and Der Meissner; A.M. Ras mussen, Ashley, Conduct, 106-34, shows how critical understanding of the Winsbecke poems has been influenced by igth-c. paternalistic values; H.-J. Behr, Fest. Brunner, 249-65, compares and contrasts Freidank's Bescheidenheit and Hermann Bote's Koker, with special reference to the modes of reception envisaged by the two poets; and U. Muller and F. V. Spechtler, Ragotzky, Liedinterpretation, 135-57, discuss the strophes composed by Friedrich von Sonnenburg in</page><page sequence="29">642 German Studies response to the Pope's offer to crown Rudolf von Habsburg (1274-75). On the basis of its animal images, R.-H. Steinmetz, ASMS, 238:260-79, argues that Frauenlob's 'Lied 4' invites a reading on both a secular and a spiritual level; P. Strohschneider, Peters, Text, 482-505, analyses communicative strategies in the complex known in the 'Kolmarer Liederhandschrift' as Der Oberkrieg; and F. V. Spechtler, Schwob, Entstehung, 281-90, argues, on the basis of an examination of the 'Mondsee-Wiener Handschrift', that the Monch von Salzburg may have learnt new poetic and musical forms in Prague. Die Lebenszeugnisse Oswalds von Wolkenstein. Edition und Kommentar. 11: 1420-1428, Mr. 93-177, ed. Anton Schwob et al., Vienna, Bohlau, xxvi 4- 379 pp., continues the diplomatic edition, begun in 1999, of all the surviving documents pertaining to Oswald's life. These are arranged chronologically, and each is accompanied by a detailed commentary providing background information and linguistic elu cidation. The value of this edition for the interpretation of Oswald's uniquely self-absorbed poetry can hardly be overstated. Two contri butions to Firchow Vol. are based on it. A. Schwob (359-67) discusses a vernacular Wappenbriej"issued to Oswald in 1419 by Duke Przemkos von Troppau; and U. M. Schwob (369-84) finds clues to the nature of the relationships within the Wolkenstein family in documents up to the year 1419. Moreover in Cramer, Frauenlieder, 133-40, U. M. and A. Schwob compare the images of women found in these documents with those constructed in Oswald's songs. In the same volume, K. Helmkamp (141-49) examines questions of gender and genre in the Wechsel Kl. 56 and 107; and in Schwob, Entstehung, 243-54, A. Schwob discusses the origins, date, structure, and purpose of Oswald's song MS A. There are also two articles on Oswald by B. Wachinger. In Ragotzky, Liedinterpretation, 103-17, he highlights the audacity of the Marian allusions in the dawn songs; and in Fest. Brunner, 403-22, he analyses four songs from Klein's edition (Kl. 126, 131-2, 134) which do not appear in the two MSS whose compilation the poet oversaw. In addition, M. Schumacher, BGDSL, 123: 252-73, interprets Kl. 6, with special reference to its indebtedness to contemporary 'contemptus mundi' perspectives; S. Hartmann, ?DP, 120:60-77, uses recent research to illuminate the historical back ground to Oswald's honouring by the French Queen (in Kl. 19); and V. Mertens, Peters, Text, 329-44, brings various theoretical perspec tives to bear on the interpretation of Kl. 75. Friederike Niemeyer, Tch} Michel Pehn.} Zum Kunst- und Rollenver stdndnis des meisterlichen Berufsdichters Michel Beheim (Mikrokosmos, 59), Frankfurt, Lang, 398 pp., is a lucidly written investigation of Beheim's concept of art and his role as a poet, which, N. argues, evolved significantly in the course of his career. Benefiting from the relatively</page><page sequence="30">Medieval Literature 643 easy datability of many of Beheim's songs, N. begins with a chronological survey of his creative life, which she sees as consisting of three phases (c. 1435-52, 1452-c. 1465, 1466-t. 1472), the parameters of which reflect changes in the poet's location and material circumstances. Her subsequent discussion of individual works limits itself almost entirely to Beheim's songs dealing with love, art, and his own biography, and hence concentrates mainly on the first two of these periods. N. shows above all that the locus of Beheim's reflection on and experimentation with the nature of the poetic T shifted from love poems to those dealing more explicitly with art, and that, in line with this, the contours of the T became less abstract and apparently more firmly rooted in actuality. Albrecht Classen, Deutsche Liederbiicher des 15. und 16. Jahrhunderts (Volksliedstudien, 1), Miinster, Waxmann, 354 pp., is a valuable inventory and study of the contents of some 20 song collections. Perhaps inevitably, C. concentrates mainly on i6th-c. corpora, but also covers four from the 15th c: the Altere Augsburger Liederbuch, the Haager and Rostocker Liederhandschriften and, of course, the Liederbuch der Clara Hdtzlerin. Each is allotted a separate chapter, in which the title or incipit of each song is listed with brief explanatory comments, and the collection as a whole described and characterized. S. Gade, BGDSL, 230-51, examines the instrumentalization of a versified passage from the Lucidarius in a song in 'Regenbogens langer Ton'. In Fest. Brunner, K. Stackmann (463-72) prints and comments on a riddle, in Der junge Meissner's 'erster Ton', which appears in Heidelberg, Cpg 355 (15th a), and E. Klesatschke and B. Taylor (487-512) list and discuss some 29 Meisterlieder categorized as either 'Loica' or 'Equivoca'. Finally, E. Langbroek and A. Roeleveld, ABAG, 55:193_221, edit and discuss the MLG poem Van der hymmeluart marien from the i5th-c. Wolfenbuttel, MS Cod. Guelf. Helmst. 1084. DIDACTIC, DEVOTIONAL, AND RELIGIOUS LITERATURE Thomasin von Zerklaere, Der Welsche Gast, ed. Raffaele Disanto (Quaderni di Hesperides, Serie Testi, 3), Trieste, Parnaso, 334 pp., is a new edition of Thomasin's text, based on MS A, and incorporating both the variants of MS G and the material from that MS added to the text of A by its igth-c. editor Heinrich Ruckert. D. reproduces the text of A far more faithfully than did Ruckert, and corrects numerous errors in his predecessor's critical apparatus. As such his volume represents a worthwhile complement to the earlier edition; but one regrets that he fails to take full account of the work's MS tradition. C. Del Zotto, RCCM, 43:267-92, analyses exempla from both the Aesopic and the zoological traditions in Der Welsche Gast.</page><page sequence="31">644 German Studies Rudolf Kilian Weigand, Der 'Rennef des Hugo von Trimberg. Uberlie ferung, Quellenabhdngigkeit und Struktur einer spdtmittelalterlichen Lehrdichtung (WM, 35), 2000, x 4- 403 pp., exemplifies the merits of the so-called 'uberlieferungsgeschichtlich' approach to the study of frequently copied late-medieval texts. W.'s investigation, the first really thorough one, of the Renner\ 65 (mainly i5th-c.) textual witnesses enables him to identify a total of seven versions ? two authorial and five later adaptations. Some of these had a primarily regional sphere of distribution, but all appear to have been read predominantly by lay people. Moreover W.'s examination of Hugo's sources reveals a perhaps surprising degree of dependence on the author's own Solsequium and Registrum multorum auctorum, from which Hugo adopted not just didactic material, but also an essentially open structure ? one of the causes, no doubt, of the Rennets textual variability. D. Buschinger, Spiewok Vol., 51-72, also discusses the Renner, with special reference to its comments on society and morality. A. E. Wright, 'Hie lert uns der meister.'Latin Commentary and the German Fable 1350-1500 (MRTS, 218), xxxii 4- 293 pp., ^s an outstanding study of the Latin commentaries found in MSS that transmit the fables of Avianus and the Anonymus Neveleti, and their influence on late-medieval German fable collections. W. begins by surveying a number of little known Latin commentaries, and then documents and assesses the contribution made by them to the Vernacularization' of fables in late-medieval Germany. With particular reference to Boner's Edelstein, the Magdeburger Asop, the Niimberger Prosa-Asop, and the fables of Michael Beheim, he demonstrates that this impact was much greater than has hitherto been realized, and affected not just individual narratives and their moralizations, but also structural and programmatic features of entire collections. In many cases W. is able to identify the source MSS used by German fabulists with remarkable precision; and he also discusses occurrences of bilingualism in fable collections as diverse as the Edelstein, the Niimberger Prosa-Asop, and the uniquely complex Breslauer Asop. R.-H. Steinmetz, Fest. Menke, 847-59, points to analogies between the 1498 Reynke de vos and late medieval fable collections such as the Magdeburger Prosa-Asop. Petra Busch, Die Vogelparlamente und Vogelsprachen in der deutschen Literatur des Mittelalters und der friihen Neuzeit (Poetica, Beihefte, 24), Munich, Fink, 427 pp., is the first substantial study of two closely related late-medieval textual traditions. Vogelparlamente and Vogel sprachen are short texts in which pairs of birds speak brief rhyming stanzas; in the former, however, the birds offer advice to a king, whereas in the latter their utterances are of a more general moral didactic nature. B. begins by describing and analysing all the relevant surviving MSS, postulating complex and at times highly speculative</page><page sequence="32">Medieval Literature 645 relationships between them. She then traces the genesis and develop ment of the two traditions, concentrating especially on the work to which both can ultimately be traced back, the mid-i4th-c. Vogelparla ment of Ulrich von Lilienfeld. Some of B.'s conclusions are question able, but she succeeds in establishing that both the MHG and MLG Vogelparlamente circulated mainly in lay aristocratic circles, whereas the exclusively MLG Vogelsprachen were intended mainly for a broad based urban audience. Meister Eckhart, Deutsche Predigten. Eine Auswahl, ed. and trans. Uta Stormer-Caysa (UB, 18117), 222 pp., is a welcome newcomer to Reclam's series of bilingual (MHG/NHG) editions of medieval texts. S.-C. prints and translates twelve sermons (Quint 2, 5b, 6, 9, 12, 20a, 38, 44, 52, 60, 70, and 78), which together form a coherent conspectus of Eckhart's vernacular homilies. Particularly laudable features of S. C.'s work are her use, where possible, of recent editions, and her provision of some 76 pages of commentary, bibliography, and introductory material. Burkhart Mojsisch, Meister Eckhart. Analogy, Univocity and Unity, trans. Orrin F. Summerrell, Amsterdam, Griiner, xvi 4- 220 pp., is an English version of M.'s 1983 volume on Eckhart as a philosopher (M.E. Analogic, Univozitdt und Einheit). The opportunity has wisely been taken to allow M. to revise and update his original text in the light of recent research. Helena Stadler, Konfrontation und Nachfolge. Die metaphorische und narrative Ausgestaltung der cunio mystica} im 'Fliessenden Licht der GottheiV von Mechthild von Magdeburg (DLA, 35), 210 pp., is an at times opaque study of the poetic and narrative strategies Mechthild uses to describe the simultaneously close and distant relationship, based on the participants' essential similarity and dissimilarity, which exists between God and the mystical soul. S. argues that metaphor, composed as it is of comparison and paradox, is an ideal means of expressing such a relationship; and she draws particular attention to Mechthild's metaphor of God as a vessel, whose contents are poured continually into a smaller vessel which then overflows ? a vivid illustration of the combination of confrontation with and imitation of the divine which characterizes her concept of mystic union. S. goes on to explore in detail the paradox that this 'unio mystica' is also associated with the soul renouncing God's presence, waiting on him, and preparing itself for him. S. S. Poor, JMEMS, 31:213-50, interprets Mechthild's use of LG as the product of various theological and socio-political factors, and explores the differing attitudes towards female authorship evinced in the MS tradition of Das fliefiende Licht. In JOWG, 12, 2000, H. Fielmann (365-79) discusses the applicability of Ricarda Huch's historiographical methodology to the study of Gertrud von Helfta, and F.-J. Schweitzer (325-38) examines the</page><page sequence="33">646 German Studies relationship between asceticism and the heresy of the free spirit in writings by beghards and their opponents. A. Classen, StSp, 10, 2000:182-204, examines the narrative strategies deployed in Seuse's autobiography; and S. Altrock and H.-J. Ziegeler, Peters, Text, 150-81, show how illustrated MSS and printed texts transformed the image of the author presented in the text of his Exemplar. Heinrich von Nbrdlingen e Margarethe Ebner: Le Lettere (1332-1350), ed. Lucia Corsini (Medioevo Tedesco, Studi e Testi, 9), Pisa, E.T.S., 453 pp., reprints Philipp Strauch's 1882 edition of these authors' correspondence (the vast majority of the letters are by Heinrich), alongside a new Italian translation of them. This parallel text is preceded by introductory material by C. and by D. Bremer Buono which discusses medieval mysticism, the lives and works of Heinrich and Margarethe, and Heinrich's language; and it also features an impressively scholarly commentary. One regrets, however, that the opportunity was not taken to revise or replace Strauch's text. The 'Vita' of Margaret the Lame by Friar Johannes O.P. of Magdeburg, trans, and comm. Gertrud Jaron Lewis and Tilman Lewis, Toronto, Peregrina, 187 pp., is the first translation into any vernacular of this originally Latin text from c. 1260-70. It is a saint's life with a difference: no miracles are described, and Margaret's death is dealt with only peremptorily; rather, the author is concerned primarily with her inner life and mystical experiences, and loses no opportunity to indulge in homiletic asides. Three major publications have appeared on another saint's life with a difference, Bruder Hermann's Tolanda von Vianden. None of these, however, is able to take full advantage of the sensational re discovery, in 1999, of the so-called 'Codex Mariendalensis' (MS M, c. 1325), the only medieval MS known to transmit Hermann's text. Bruder Hermann, Tolanda von Vianden. Moselfrankischer Text aus dem spdten 13. Jahrhundert, ed. and trans. Gerald Newton and Franz Losel (Beitrage zur Luxemburgischen Sprach- und Volkskunde, 21), Lux embourg, Institut Grand-Ducal, 1999, 186 pp., offers a lightly amended version of the text of John Meier's 1889 edition (based on a I7th-c. transcription of M by Alexander Wiltheim), along with a careful and accurate translation of Hermann's work ? the first into German prose. The volume's introduction begins with discussion (by N.) of the work's textual history, previous translations, and language, and continues with an examination (by L.) of its historical context, author, religious purport, prologue, and characters. Michele Backes, Tolanda von Vianden und die religiose Frauenbewegung ihrer Z,eit (Beitrage zur Luxemburgischen Sprach- und Volkskunde, 28), Luxembourg, Insti tut Grand-Ducal, 2000, 194 pp., assesses Hermann's text against the background of contemporary trends in spirituality and, in particular,</page><page sequence="34">Medieval Literature 647 of several Latin vitae of holy women, including works by Thomas of Cantimpre and Jacques de Vitry. Hermann's life of Yolanda emerges as remarkably different from these, not least in its lack of emphasis on miracles, stigmata, or mystical experiences. B. argues that it fre quently reflects Dominican interests and perspectives, and that it was written with a specific, probably local audience in mind. A summary of B.'s monograph appears on pp. 150-55 of Berg, Yolanda, a volume which also contains 13 other papers. In these, A. Heinz (125-38) focuses, like Backes, on the extent to which Hartmann's Yolanda reflects contemporary religious ideas and practices; K. Gartner (35-51) offers preliminary impressions of the relationship between MS M, Wiltheim's transcript, and Meier's edition; and R. Christ mann (26-38) also incorporates some readings from M into her discussion of the work's language. H. Volker (52-63) finds suggestively few traces of the influence of French culture, toponyms, and general vocabulary on Yolanda; andj. Kramer (75-87) similarly discerns only very general typological similarities between Yolanda and contempo rary French saints' lives. Relationships between Yolanda and other works are also studied by W. G. Rohr (13-25), who examines allusions to Tristan, Parzival, Willehalm, Walther von der Vogelweide (L 48,38), and Das Haslein; by F. Losel (88-95), wno discusses the role of the female protagonist and of the author in Yolanda and in Der arme Heinrich; by E. de Dominguez (139-49), who argues that Hermann's construction of Yolanda owes much to accounts of virgin martyrs such as St Catherine and St Agnes; and by G. Newton (64-74), wno compares this construction of her with that of Wiltheim in his Latin Vita venerabilis Yolandae (1674). An historical perspective is provided by J. Milmeister (96-101), who investigates the controversy surrounding the 'real' Yolanda's entry into the Mariental convent, and by M. Margue (105-24), who demonstrates that Hermann's references to the convent's poverty are the product of literary stylization. Finally C. Hollerich (102-04) discusses the work's multifunctionality; and A. Rapp and U. Leuk (156-66) describe an approach to teaching it in schools, using, along with other media, a website &lt;gaer27.uni trier.de/CLL/welcome.html &gt;. Other work on legends includes M. Backes's discussion (Keller, Kommunikation, 249-60) of the genesis of the Freiburger Magdalenenbuch and the socio-historical functions of its various redactions, and reports by K. Klein (%DA, 130:58-62) and W. Williams-Krapp (ib., 302-05) of recently discovered fragments of Reinbot von Durne's Georg and the Niederdeutsche Legenda Aurea respectively. Meanwhile J. Eming, ZDP, 120:394-412, argues that in medieval Judas vitae, and notably in Das alte Passional, the introduction of the motif of incest paradoxi cally makes the betrayer into a more rounded, even heroic figure.</page><page sequence="35">648 German Studies Werner J. Hoffmann, Konrad von Heimesfurt. Untersuchungen zu Quellen, Uberlieferung und Wirkung seiner beiden Werke cUnser vrouwen hinvart3 und 'Urstende' (WM, 37), 2000, x + 465 pp., is a meticulous study which valuably complements H.'s and Kurt Gartner's 1989 edition of these verse re-tellings of material from the New Testament Apocrypha (see TWMLS, 511659). H. begins by establishing the precise identity of Konrad's sources, which in the case of the Urstende is a version of the Gospel of Nicodemus preserved in only one Salzburg MS. Konrad's adaptations are shown to be notable above all for their freedom and for their consistent determination to concentrate only on 'essential' elements. H.'s examination of their MS tradition is particularly fruitful in the case of the Hinvart (preserved in ten MSS), but also encompasses a productive study of those parts of the sparsely transmitted Urstende that have survived in MSS of Heinrich von Miinchen's Weltchronik. The book concludes with a detailed account of Konrad's influence on later authors. B. Quast, BGDSL, 123:65-77, discusses Konrad's characterization, in the Urstende, of his 'were' as a form of artefact, whose individuality is closely bound up with that of its author. B. Haupt, Haupt, Endzeitvorstellungen, 147-78, considers the Linzer Entecrist against the background of both its direct source and its more general historical-theological background; K. Gartner and R. Plate, Fest. Brunner, 333-45, edit and discuss the material concerning the history of heathen lands (especially Troy) in the so-called Leipziger Schlufi of the Christherre-Chronik, and N. A. Bondarko, LiLi, 122:80-135, examines the function of orchards and palm trees in providing structural frameworks for i3th-c. religious texts in prose. Falk Eisermann, 'Stimulus amoris\ Inhalt, lateinische Uberlieferung, deutsche Ubersetzungen, Rezeption (MTU, 118), x 4- 649 pp., is a monu mental study of the textual history of this much copied Franciscan ascetic treatise, the first version of which, probably written by James of Milan, dates from c. 1300. E. identifies and describes some 500 Latin and 58 German MSS transmitting the text (or 'Textfamilie', as E. prefers): there are four main Latin redactions, each of which had taken a clearly defined shape by the mid-14th c, and five German translations, which vary considerably in quality and approach, but which all originated in the second half of the 14th c. The Stimulus was used by an enormously wide range of readers and authors (including Ludolf von Sachsen, Heinrich von St. Gallen, and Johannes von Tepl); but the spheres of influence of individual versions can in several cases be clearly circumscribed. Moreover, for all its variability, the Stimulus tradition as a whole is united by its title and its frequent (erroneous) attribution to a single author, namely St Bonaventure.</page><page sequence="36">Medieval Literature 649 Albertanus de Brescia: cDe amore Dei etproximo in der Ubersetzung Heinrich Halters, ed. Erika Bauer (Analecta Cartusiana, 18), Salzburg, Institut fur Anglisdk und Amerikanistik der Universitat, 135 pp., edits Haller's text along with the three other previously unpublished parts of Innsbruck, Universitatsbibliothek, MS 641 (dated 1466 and written in Haller's own hand). These include his translation of an excerpt from the Stimulus amoris (along with a brief treatise on the love of God, and a comparably short work in which a father gives advice to his son). A well-organized introduction discusses Haller and his working environment at the Charterhouse in Schnals (Southern Tyrol), Albertanus's De amore Dei, and, especially, the relationship between it and Haller's translation. Two monographs by Ernst Haberkern contain first editions of late medieval theological texts. E.H., Richard von St. Viktor: 'Benjamin minor', deutsch. Ein neu aufgefundenes Handschriftenfragment (GAG, 685), 2000, 131 pp., edits, translates, and introduces the text of a fascinating four leaf fragment from the collection of Gerhard Eis. Copied in the Nuremberg area early in the 15th c, it transmits part of a German adaptation of Richard of St Victor's Benjamin minor which appears to have been used byjohann von Indersdorf in his Von dreierlei Wesen des Menschen. H.'s conscientious edition and translation are combined with detailed discussion of Richard, his work and its biblical basis, and with a thorough analysis of the German MS's linguistic features. There is rather less on the content of the German adaptation, however, and H.'s facsimile of the fragment is of disappointing quality. E.H., Das 'Beichtbiichlein' des Thomas Peuntner nach den Heidel berger, Miinchner und Wiener Handschriften (GAG, 696), 260 pp., makes available one of the few hitherto unpublished works by this notable representative of the later 'Vienna School', albeit in an edition which takes account of only 20 of its 37 known MSS. That said, H.'s base MS, Vienna, CPV 2828 (dated 1464) is obviously a reliable one. His introduction deals with Peuntner's life and works, the structure, content, and style of the Beichtbiichlein, and late-medieval catechetical and confessional literature more generally. Heinrich Kalteisen OP: Drei Easier Predigten. Ubersetzung vom Friihneuhoch deutschen ins JVeuhochdeutsche, trans. Helga Haage-Naber (GAG, 691), 102 pp., provides modern German versions of the three Kalteisen sermons (V, VII, and X) published by H.-N. in 2000 (see TWMLS, 62:630). The introductory material from the earlier volume is re ordered but otherwise unchanged. Other work on sermons includes C. Roth's detailed introduction, with textual examples, to the little known early I5th-c. sermon cycle of Johannes Bischoff (ZDA, 130:19-57); R. Schiewer's investigation (MSS, 45:40-57) of the preachers' names contained in the postil generally attributed to</page><page sequence="37">650 German Studies Hartwig of Erfurt; J. Splett's analysis (Fest. Menke, 823-45) ?f tne relationship between the Bremer Evangelistar and the glossed Gospel MSS of the so-called Heidelberger Typ; and W. Frey's discussion (Fest. Brunner, 431-45) of the conception of life as a pilgrimage, especially as presented in the sermons of Johannes Geiler von Kaysersberg. Christoph Fasbender, Von der Widerkehr der Seelen Verstorbener. Untersuchungen zur Uberlieferung und Rezeption eines Erfolgstextes Jakobs von Paradies (Jenaer Germanistische Forschungen, 13), Heidelberg, Win ter, x + 384 pp., studies the textual history of De apparitionibus animarum separatarum, a treatise on apparitions from the dead written in 1454 by the Erfurt Carthusian Jakob von Paradies. F. prints the Latin text from Jakob's autograph, and describes and analyses its over 90 MSS and 13 printed editions. He establishes that it circulated widely in reformed Benedictine houses, and was also owned by a large number of secular priests and university students. Perhaps surprisingly, it underwent little variation in the course of its MS transmission. More significant levels of textual change, and a notably wide range of apparent functions, are however observable in the work's three German adaptations: a printed edition by Konrad Fyner (Esslingen, c. 1478), an adaptation by the Benedictine Thomas Finck (in Cgm 6940, c. 1490), and Georg Antworter's Belehrung fiber das Beschwbren von Geistern (in a Bamberg MS dated 1482). F.'s volume is laced with astute and provocative observations both on the literary culture of i5th-c. Germany and on scholarly orthodoxies old and new. Susanne Rischpler, 'Biblia Sacra figuris expressa.' Mnemotechnische Bilderbibeln des /j. Jahrhunderts (WM, 36), 231 pp., is an innovative study of I5th-c. mnemonic pocket Bibles which couple large numbers of carefully coded pictures (ten per MS page) with brief captions or statements taken from a biblical Summarium. R. describes the known witnesses to this tradition (five MSS and five printed editions), establishes that they were almost certainly intended for use by clerics, and discusses their structure, pictorial code, mnemonic techniques, and sources. Her findings are tested and developed in a series of detailed page-by-page analyses of chapters from a diverse range of biblical books. R.'s well argued monograph, which contains several handsome plates, makes one wish for a facsimile edition of at least one of the MSS she discusses. H. Blosen, Fest. Menke, 71-88, discusses an illustrated MLG Speculum humanae salvationis in Copenhagen, Gl. kgl. Sam. 80 fol. (c. 1440), and offers an edition, with commentary, of its prologue; G. Roth, %DA, 130:291-97, introduces a West German adaptation of Dire van Delft's Tafel van der Kersten Ghelove found in two i5th-c. MSS; and V. Honemann, Suntrup, Tradition, 75-95, examines the</page><page sequence="38">Medieval Literature piety and religious practices of the seemingly conventional 'late medieval' knight Florian Waldauf von Waldenstein, and of the Humanist Heinrich Bebel. DRAMA Tydeman, Stage, contains (351-420) a group of 44 documents concerning plays and their performance in the German-speaking lands between 1400 and 1550, selected, translated, and introduced by J. E. Tailby. These include, alongside excerpts from and outlines of religious and secular plays, texts as diverse as council minutes, an episcopal authorization, and an account of the collapse of a wall during the Bautzen St Dorothy play of 1413, which killed 33 people. Dieter Trauden, Gnade vor Recht? Untersuchungen zu den deutschspra chigen Weltgerichtsspielen desMittetatters (APSL, 142), 2000, vi 4- 465 pp., is a major monograph on late-medieval vernacular drama. T. begins by surveying the MSS and printed texts said by previous scholars to contain Last Judgment plays; from these, he singles out a corpus of 12 witnesses (from the 15th or 16th cs, nearly all Alemannic) which preserve texts likely to be similar to a lost 'original' version. The themes and structure of the plays within this corpus are then assessed against the background of medieval legal, moral, theological, and catechetical traditions. Both in their theological undergirding and in their manifest intention to edify the uneducated, the plays reveal a surprisingly consistent indebtedness to Dominican thought ? a finding which T. is careful not to overplay, but which raises tantalizing questions about the origins and purposes of late-medieval religious drama more generally. LB, 90, contains papers given at a symposium at Louvain in April 2000 on medieval German religious drama. Many of these focus on the Redentiner Osterspiel. U. Obhof (1-10) describes and discusses the MS in which it is transmitted (Karlsruhe, Badische Landesbibliothek, 369, dated 1464); I. Rosier (11-28) and L. Draye (43-51) study aspects of its language, and D. Stellmacher (29-41) its 1991 translation into modern LG by Dieter Andresen; E. Ukena-Best (181-214) assesses its presentation of superbia, the Devil, and hell, and K. Scheel (215-32) that of the 'knights' who guard Christ's tomb; andj. Nowe (325-59) examines its stage directions, both explicit and implicit, and their relevance to modern productions of the play. Moreover C. Kune (233-48) discusses the depiction of John the Baptist in Limbo in the Redentiner and other Easter Plays, and E. Simon (53-74) assesses the evidence suggesting that plays with religious themes were performed in late-medieval Lubeck. C. Dauven-van Knippenberg (309-23) examines the use of dialogic structures, and especially of personal pronouns, to create a polarity</page><page sequence="39">652 German Studies of good and evil in the Frankfurter Passionsspiel of 1493; M. Straeter (263-95) discusses 'volkstumlich' elements in medieval German Christmas plays; and H. Linke (75-126) problematizes the frequently drawn but unmedieval distinction between 'religious' and 'secular' drama. Spiewok Vol. includes three articles on religious drama: G. Borgnet (23-50) discusses the three structural blocs of the fragmentary Wiener Passionsspiel, and their treatment of earlier traditions; C. Kune (197-218) analyses the negative stage directions in the Heidelberger Passionsspiel and related plays; and A. Touber (311-29) sees traces of Franciscan thought and iconography in the presentation of the crucifixion in the Donaueschinger Passionsspiel. G. Ehrstine, Peters, Text, 414-37, recommends, and gives examples of, a culturally-informed 'philology of the stage'; and E. E. DuBruck, FCS, 26, 2000:1-20, surveys recent research into late-medieval drama. SCIENTIFIC AND SPECIALIZED LITERATURE Fruhneuhochdeutsches Glossenwbrterbuch. Index zum deutschen Wortgut des (Vocabularius Ex quo', ed. Klaus Grubmtiller et al. (TTG, 27), xii + 889 pp., completes the edition of this frequently copied i5th-c. glossary, some 12 years after the appearance of its first five volumes. In contrast to the Vocabularius itself, this new, remarkably comprehen sive index has alphabetically arranged German (rather than Latin) lemmata, listing first the early NHG and then the (many fewer) MLG forms which appear in the edition proper, alongside the Latin terms they were originally intended to translate or elucidate. As such the volume provides an enormously valuable resource for all who work with i5th-c. texts, particularly the many German ones translated from Latin. Elsewhere R. Damme, Fest. Menke, 143-63, describes and evaluates a late i5th-c. MLG-Latin vocabulary found in Kiel, Cod. Bord. in. quart. Marialuisa Caparrini, Un Manuale di tedesco per italiani del XVsecolo: Lo (SprachbuchJ di Meister Jbrg (GAG, 694), xvi + 212 pp., introduces and edits an early i5th-c. manual compiled by a schoolmaster, originally from Nuremberg, who appears to have taught German to Italian merchants at a school near the 'Fondaco dei Tedeschi' in Venice. His work comprises a thematically-arranged glossary, a section on the morphology of adjectives, pronouns and verbs, and a set of three model dialogues; throughout, Italian forms and their German equivalents are presented in parallel columns. C.'s edition transcribes two MSS now in Florence: Magi.

Werner Paravicini (Kieler Werkstucke, D, 5), Frankfurt, Lang, 563 pp., is the second edition of this useful work of reference, first published in 1994 (see TWMLS, 56:771). A reprint of the first edition is supplemented by some 35 pp. of additional material, including many new bibliographical references, and a list of reviews of the first edition ? corrections suggested in which are also incorporated. W. Baum, JOWG, 12, 2000:423-37, describes how contact with the East broadened the perspectives of Westerners between the 12th and 15th cs; K. Niehr, GJ, 2001: 269-300, discusses the perception and description of unfamiliar phenomena in Bernhard von Brydenbach's Peregrinationes in terram sane tarn and other pilgrimage reports; and M. Barmann, Daphnis, 30:1-36, finds evidence of the reception of the Basler Alexander and of Mandeville's Travels in the late i5th-c. Familienbuch der Herren von Eptingen. Meanwhile N. Miedema, Suntrup, Tradition, 51-72, points to the interplay of tradition and innovation in geographical descriptions of Germany published in Nuremberg between roughly 1450 and 1550; K. Ridder and J. Wolf, Firchow Vol., 317-34, examine Strasbourg MS 2119 (c.1450, from Nuremberg), a new-style 'urban encyclopaedia' containing texts and excerpts with a primarily historical and geographical orientation; and B. Schnell, Fest. Brunner, 369-90, edits and introduces a i4th-c. Gedihte von der physionomie found in the Hausbuch des Michael de Leone. Constantin Hruschka, Kriegsfiihrung und Geschichtsschreibung im Spdt mittelalter (Kollektive Einstellungen und sozialer Wandel im Mittel alter, n.s. 5), Cologne, Bohlau, 445 pp., investigates the extent to which the perspectives on war evinced in late-medieval chronicles were influenced by changes in the purpose and practice of warfare. H. considers various forms of hostility presented in Latin chronicles written by clerics between 1378 and 1438 which were also translated into German. The main authors discussed are Andreas von Regens burg and Hermann Korner, as well as the compilers of the Chronica episcoporum Monasteriensium. Whilst, inevitably, each chronicle presents war significantly differently, H. demonstrates that they share certain characteristics: an essentially negative, non-participant's view of combat is typically combined with a concern for legal issues, and an awareness of the increasing importance of both territory and national consciousness. Das Mittelalter, 5.2, 2000, contains several studies of the reception and instrumentalization of historiography in the later Middle Ages. B. Studt (31-48) traces the reception of Alexander von Roes's Memoriale in German and Latin texts of the 15th c, and</page><page sequence="41">654 German Studies S. Weigelt (71-85) that of Johannes Rothe's Thuringische Landeschronik in the 15th and 16th cs; U. Andermann (87-104) analyses German Humanist historians' sometimes uncritical treatment of Classical sources; and R. Schmid (115-38) discusses the production and functions of the official chronicles of Swiss cities. A. Rapp, Moser, Verarbeitung, 247-61, describes a computer-assisted project to edit i3th-c. and I4th-c. documents from the Archbishopric of Trier (see also &lt;gaer27.uni-trier.de/Urkunden/welcome.htm &gt;). Joelle Fuhrmann, Theorie und Praxis in der Gesetzgebung des Spatmittetat ters in Deutschland am Beispiel der Ingelheimer Schqffenspriiche, Berne, Lang, 172 pp., is an unusual and stimulating monograph which focuses on the little studied pronouncements of the i5th-c. lay judges of Ingelheim (Rheinhessen). Following a lucid historical introduction, F. assesses the Ingelheimer Schqffenspriiche^ perspectives on women, children, and marriage, as well as on property, inheritance, and criminal law, alongside those of several comparable vernacular legal codes. She finds the tenor of the Ingelheim documents to be relatively liberal, even 'modern', a fact which she attributes to the increasing influence, in this part of the Empire, of Canon and Roman Law, and of Humanism. There are also three articles on the Sachsenspiegel: R. Schmidt-Wiegand, Fest. Ruberg, 257-62, discusses its presentation of persons exercising their right to silence in court; M. Dobozy, Firchow Vol., 31-40, finds in it traces of an oral juridical tradition; and U. Schulze, Peters, Text, 47-71, discusses the nature of textual variance in it and other legal works. Meanwhile U.-D. Oppitz and K. Klein, -&lt;ZL4, 130:298-301, present two newly discovered frag ments of Bruder Berthold's Rechtssumme; and N. Schnitzler, Hubrath, Zwickau, 169-94, examines the authorship, textual history, contents, and purpose of the i4th-c. Zwic^auer Rechtsbuch. OTHER LATE-MEDIEVAL LITERATURE 'Die Historia von den sieben weisen Meistern und dem Kaiser Diocletianus.' Nach der Giefiener Handschrift 104, ed. Ralf-Henning Steinmetz (ATB, 116), xxx + 86 pp., is, remarkably, the first modern edition of any of the eight I5th-c. German prose versions of the story of the seven sages. The text presented reproduces faithfully the flavour of the sole MS which preserves it (written c. 1464), but is rendered easily readable not least by the inclusion of modern punctuation. S.'s introduction and commentary situate this version and its individual exempla within the complex tradition of which it is part. K. Skow Obenaus, FCS, 26, 2000:169-82, identifies misogyny as a pervasive theme which unifies the frame-story of Die sieben weisen Meister with the exempla it encloses.</page><page sequence="42">Medieval Literature 655 Der cGute GerharV Rudolfs von Ems in einer anonymen Prosaauflbsung und die lateinische und deutsche Fassung der Gerold-Legende Albrechts von Bonstetten, ed.

Both appear in recently rediscovered Weimar MSS formerly in the possession of Georg Spalatin (1484-1545), who is likely to have been interested mainly in the light they arguably shed on aspects of Saxon history. The introduction to the present volume, however, concen trates on codicological, literary, and linguistic matters; particularly valuable are the sections that discuss the relationships between the prose reduction oiDergute Gerhart and Rudolf's original, and between the Latin and German versions of the life of St Gerald. Michael Mareiner, Mittelhochdeutsche Minnereden und Minneallegorien der Prager Handschrift R VI Fc 26. 11: (Standhaftigkeit in der Liebesqual\ Wbrterbuch undReimwbrterbuch (EH, 1, 1807), 436 pp., supplements M.'s recent edition of this i5th-c. discourse on love (see TWMLS, 62:625). It is an absolutely complete concordance and glossary of the words and rhymes found in that edition. One admires M.'s meticulousness, but wonders whether he might have proceeded a little more selectively: few readers, for example, will require NHG translations of 'bitter', 'bourn', or 'blenden'. L. Lieb, Peters, Text, 506-28, discusses the poetics of Minnereden, emphasizing particularly their use of repetition. The Letters of the Rozmberk Sisters: Noblewomen in i^th-Century Bohemia, trans, and introd. John M. Klassen et al., Cambridge, Brewer, x 4- 134 pp., makes available, in English translation, some 70 letters written between the 1440s and 1482 by (or in a few cases concerning) Perchta and Anezka, the daughters of the long-time leader of the Catholic-Austrian party in Bohemia, Ulrich von Rozmberk, whose career and that of his powerful family is painstakingly described in K.'s introduction. Roughly a quarter of the letters were written in German, the rest in Czech. Much of their interest resides in the very different perspectives expressed by the unmarried Anezka and the unhappily married Perchta, whose concept of herself in relation to her family is the principal subject of the essay that concludes the volume. Sabine Driicke, Humanistische Laienbildung urn 1500. Das Ubersetzungs werk des rheinischen Humanisten Johann Gottfried (Palaestra, 312), Got tingen, Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 490 pp., is an immensely valuable study of the 17 German translations of works by ancient authors and Renaissance Humanists made by the Oppenheim priest Johann Gottfried between 1489 and 1494. D.'s summary of Gottfried's biography indicates not only that he was tutor to the Dalberg family, but also that he had considerable contact with the Heidelberg circle</page><page sequence="43">656 German Studies of Humanists. The works he selected for translation represent a wide range of periods and genres, but have in common an indebtedness to Aristotle's system of moral philosophy. D.'s investigation of Gottfried's sources and techniques of translation is based on a detailed analysis of three examples, by Cicero, Leonardo Bruni, and Pseudo-Isokrates. His renderings of these works (alongside the Latin originals) appear in a substantial appendix; they evince an approach to translation that owes much to the literal approach of Niklas von Wyle, along with a solicitous concern for comprehensibility. One hopes D.'s volume will stimulate further study of the still inadequately understood Humanist aim of involving non-Latinate readers in their ambitious educational programme. Nina Hard, Die (Stultifera Navis'. Jakob Lochers Ubertragung von Sebastian Brants 'Narrenschiff' (Studien und Texte zum Mittelalter und zur fruhen Neuzeit, i), 2 vols, Miinster, Waxmann, 305 + 373 pp., is an overdue and most welcome study of this enormously influential Latin adaptation of the Narrenschiff. Its value resides primarily in H.'s provision of the first modern edition of substantial sections of Locher's work (nearly half of the chapters it shares with Brant's, plus all of its additional material), along with a careful NHG translation and an elucidatory commentary. One is also grateful, however, for H.'s introduction to Locher and the i5th-c. editions of the Stultifera Navis, and for her detailed analysis of the priorities and techniques of his didactic, humanistically oriented adaptation. A. Classen, FCS, 26, 2000:52-65, interprets Brant's Narrenschiff as a document of social and intellectual history. Other articles on late-medieval works: in Fest. Brunner, N. R. Wolf (359-68) examines linguistic features of the Hausbuch des Michael de Leone, and O. Riha (423-30) lists and discusses research into Heinrich Wittenwiler's Ring published between 1988 and 1998; A. Hruby, Firchow Vol., 177-86, discusses eschatological motifs in the Ackermann aus Bbhmen; A. Classen, JEGP, 100:377-405, surveys the varied ceuvre of the Nuremberg Carthusian Erhart Gross, with special reference to his Witwenbuch; and T. Ehlert, Firchow Vol., 41-65, considers the relationship between the Kilchenmeisterei printed in Nuremberg around 1485 by Peter Wagner, and two earlier i5th-c. MS collections of recipes. GJ contains several articles relevant to late-medieval German literary culture. L. Hellinga (20-26) approaches the early history of printing as a form of cultural history; C. Hust (60-67) examines an invoice detailing the costs of producing a i4th-c. antiphonal; R. Schartl (83-86) discusses the involvement of Fust and Gutenberg in two cases tried by the 'Frankfurter Schoffengericht' in 1446-47; K. Emmrich (87-94) assesses the possible contribution of four Mainz</page><page sequence="44">Medieval Literature 657 clerics to the spread of printing to Rome; P. Amelung (95-97) refutes D. Mauss's claim (see TWMLS, 62:635) that the rubricator 'P.W.' was the same person as the scribe Peter von Urach; C. Reske (98-103) surveys what is known about Anton Koberger and his Nuremberg printing shop; M. K. Duggan (104-17) outlines the involvement of i5th-c. conciliarists in the preparation of an ordinary suitable for printing; H. D. Saffrey (143-64) discusses the foundation of the Cologne Confraternity of the Rosary in 1475, and the various printed texts associated with it; J. A. Dane (165-67) argues that Hans Schaur's 1497 and 1500 printed editions of Bartholomaeus Metlin ger's Regiment der Kindheit do not constitute two editions in the accepted sense; and J. L. Flood (172-82) examines the printed book as a commodity in the 15th and early 16th cs. Other work on early printed material includes A. Simon's discussion (OGS, 30:52-79) of woodcuts depicting women in Michael Furter's 1493 print oiDerRitter vom Turn (showing how these consistently reflect a male-dominated agenda); R. Schlusemann's examination (Fest. Menke, 659-75) of the career of the Lubeck printer Johann Koelhoff; and F. Eisermann's study (Suntrup, Tradition, 99-128) of how the production and distribution of letters of indulgence in the 15th c. exploited the possibilities of new technology in ways that decisively influenced the Protestant reformers.</page></plain_text>
