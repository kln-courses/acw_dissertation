<plain_text><page sequence="1">688 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW "THE LORD OF HEAVEN." (THE FIRE OF GOD; THE MOUNTAIN SUMMIT; THE DIVINE CHARIOT; AND THE VISION OF EZEKIEL.) A PEOPLE worshipping the Moon-god as supreme, as lord of the starry hosts, and as their own national deity, would be likely to invest him with the functions of the Sky-god, who sends or withholds the rain, wields the lightning, and speaks in the thunder. In the solitary tree struck by lightning, his worshippers would witness the visible descent of the god. In the fire kindled from its boughs they would discern the manifestation of the god within. That the latter supposition is no fancy of the modern student, may be shown from the interesting passage which closes the first chapter of Isaiah. This chapter should properly conclude with ver. 26. Verses 27 and 28 may be, as Cheyne has suggested, an editorial link. But vv. 29-31 properly belong to the second chapter, from which they have been accidentally separated by the intercalation of ii. 1-5. The latter verses are derived from the margin, where originally ii. I may have stood as a variant to i. i (the title of the book), and ii. 2-5 as a sequel to i. 26. These marginalia may indeed have been written at the foot of the tablet, page, or column (ni) containing the first chapter, or prologue, which, as we may see from the heading" Vision of Isaiah," &amp;c., must have re- placed chap. vi et seq., which once occupied this position. The original text of chaps. ii and iii consisted of five sections, each beginning with the catchword tz (i. 29; ii. 6, 12; iii. I, 8). The first of these has been much misunderstood. In ver. 31 ibnn is not an epithet of the strong mtan, but as may be</page><page sequence="2">THE LORD OF HEAVEN" 689 seen from Amos ii. 9 of the sacred tree; while, in the next clause, for ra1 we should read 1S:y. The whole will then run: " And the mighty oak shall be as tow, and the lord thereof (i. e., the indwelling divinity conceived as a latent fire) shall be as a spark; and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them." The conception belongs to the same order of beliefs with the story of the burning bush, but the result is exactly the reverse, since the prophet Isaiah is condemning the beliefs which he describes. Analogous conceptions appear in connexion with the theophany which gave rise to the " altar" called nlt mrnv -no mere " place-name," but the appellation of the deity as there invoked, and parallel both in form and meaning to mslw im: our "Jerusalem." We are told in Judges vi. 11-24, how the "n 1 t--an impersonation, not a messenger, of the divinity--came and sat (like Deborah the prophetess, iv. 5) under the holy tree--" the place, and primitively, the object of worship" (Moore, on iv. 11 and vi. i i). He then appeared to Gideon, who presently made ready his offering "and brought it out unto him under the Tree and presented it. And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so. Then the angel of Jahveh put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and the fire went up out of the rock and ate the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and the angel of Jahveh departed out of his sight." Compare the appearance to Manoah in chap. xiii. I9, 20: "So Manoah took the kid with the meal- offering, and offered it upon the rock unto Jahveh.... And it came to pass, when the flames went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of Jahveh ascended in the flame of the altar: and Manoah and his wife looked on, and they fell on their faces to the ground." In the latter case it is clear that the mal'akh Jahveh is himself the divinity manifested in the fire, which in the former case proceeded at his touch out of the sacred rock</page><page sequence="3">690 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW (itself a habitation of the god) and devoured the offering made to him. And both the rock and the angel are closely associated with the sacred tree. But in the divine mani- festation which decided the contest between Elijah and the prophets of Baal, the Fire of Jahveh comes straight from heaven, and acts just as in the previous cases and with similar effects. " Then the fire of Jahveh fell and ate the burnt offering, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. And when the people saw it, they fell on their faces ": just as Manoah and his wife had done, and for the same reason- Jahveh was present in the fire 1. If the incomparable narra- tive of I Kings xviii records a fact, as I am inclined to believe, it is legitimate to suppose that, after the previous drought, and before the ensuing tempest, the altar on the exposed headland of Mount Carmel was actually struck by lightning (cf. Isa. ii. 2-I15). And in the first chapter of the second book of Kings, Elijah calls down the fire of God (ver. .2) from heaven, to consume his enemies, while in the next chapter he himself is taken thither in a chariot of fire which is presumably that of Jahveh. Thus we see that the fire of God supplies a link between heaven and earth, between the Sky-god and the nnumen of Tree or Rock. And here we have to note the especial connexion of the Sky-god with the mountain-top, resting, I doubt not, on the physical phenomena of the storm, preluded by the gathering of clouds round the highest summits, and accompanied by the lightning and the thunder-clear signs to early man of a divine presence descending in the visible cloud. This is well shown in the eighth Iliad, where, in the opening lines, Zeus, who wields the thunderbolt, holds an assembly of the gods " upon the topmost peak of many-ridged Olympus," and presently harnessing his chariot drives "between earth and starry heaven " to Ida even unto Gargarus, 'vOa be ol rpcrvog 1 If the sacred fire of Israel " were the naphtha of 2 Macc., we must remember that its properties would be regarded as supernatural.</page><page sequence="4">"THE LORD OF HEAVEN" 691 Bc)jos re OvrEtls. Here he looses his horses from the chariot, and casts thick mist about them, "and himself sate on the mountain-tops rejoicing in his glory '." So, but without the chariot, and with a sublimity of terror to which the god of Homer is a stranger, Jahveh descended on Mount Sinai 2. Yet more sublime is the manifestation to Elijah in the same place 3, preceded by the great and strong wind, the earthquake, and the fire-but Jahveh was not in them--and after the fire, np, rnnt ilp. From the mythical standpoint here presupposed and re- jected, the lightning, D,5s s 4, is itself a theophany. It should be observed that when in 2 Kings i Elijah calls down fire from heaven, he is seated, or more probably dwelling, ,nn w'il 5Y, perhaps Carmel (ver. 9). Note also the presence (vv. 3, 15) of the "4 1NSn. Among the Romans the spot struck by lightning was sacer, and scarred by lightning Whymper found the summit of the Matterhorn. Conversely, in Mediaeval Europe, such solitary heights as Glastonbury Tor, and the two St. Michael's Mounts--I may add a reference to Monte Sant' Angelo (and it is but one of many instances) the highest point of the Sorrentine peninsula-were placed beneath the protection of the archangel, to guard them against the assaults of Satan, "the prince of the power of the air 5." On the whole, then, the god of Sky and Storm is of necessity " a god of hills " (I Kings xx. 23). But the con- ception which attributes to him the possession of Chariot and Horses of Fire cannot belong to the life of the nomad or to that of the early settlers in a hill country, who had even in the time of the monarchy to import their horses from Egypt 6. Chariots were suited to the plains of Egypt and Assyria, but must have been of far less value, for military purposes, in the hill-country of Judah and 1 II. viii. 42-52; cf. xiv. 343. 2 Exod. xix. i6, I8. 3 I Kings xix.

Indeed, it is very probable that the victories of Israel over more powerful and civilized enemies were largely due to this circumstance 2. But from very early times the stars, identified with the "sons of the gods," were regarded as forming at once the army and the assembly of Jahveh. When therefore Israel became acquainted with splendid hosts in which the war-chariot played a part of great importance, it was natural that imagination should attribute a similar equipment to the hosts on high. That this was actually the case may be proved from 2 Kings vi. 14-17, where the earthly host of Syria is over-matched by the horses and chariots of fire which fill the mountain round about Elisha 3. t,t. rt nn_n V'.niK n 31 says the Psalmist (lxviii. 17). So the kings of Judah gave chariots and horses to the Sun4, but not, it would appear, to Jahveh himself, unless indeed they confounded the God of Israel with the solar Ba'al, which is just what Ahab has been often thought to have done. But it is perhaps more probable that as the Carthaginians worshipped an "Apollo " associated with " Zeus" and "Hera5," so these Jewish servants of a strange god regarded the wwm i'p as son of the Dn4wn 5r. In the Roman triumph the general mounted the sacred chariot drawn by four white horses, the same which drew the statue of Jupiter on the day of the great procession 6, and Mommsen hence infers that " the state chariot even in the city where every one else went on foot . . . belonged alike to the Roman god and to the Roman king."

Maspero5 tells us how Merodach wrought the dome of heaven " out of a hard resisting metal which shone brilliantly during the day in the rays of the sun, and at night appeared only as a dark blue surface, strewn irregularly with luminous stars." The earth, the "Mountain of the World," was at first supposed to be divided into seven horizontal zones; "later on it was divided into four 'houses,' each of which, like the' houses' of Egypt, corresponded with one of the four cardinal points, and was under the rule of particular gods6." In Egypt, one ancient tradition "taught that heaven and earth are wedded gods, Sib6 and NUi\t.. . Most people invested them with human form, and represented the earth-god SibA as extended beneath Nuit the Starry One; the goddess stretched out her arms, stretched out her slender legs, stretched out her body above the clouds, and her dishevelled head drooped westward7." Or again, the sky is the cow Hathors. " The head of the good beast rises into the heavens, the mysterious waters which cover 1 Ver. 26. 2 er 22. 3 Ibid. 4 E. B., art.

"In the eastern cities of the Delta ... it was admitted that in the beginning earth and sky were two lovers ... fast locked in each other's embrace, the god lying beneath the goddess. On the day of creation a new god, Shu, came forth from the primaeval waters, slipped between the two, and seizing Nuit with both hands, lifted her above his head with outstretched arms. Though the starry body of the goddess extended in space-her head being to the west, and her loins to the east-her feet and hands hung down to the earth. These were the four pillars of the firmament2, under another form, and four gods of four adjacent principalities were in charge of them. Osiris, or Horus the sparrow-hawk, presided over the southern, and Sit over the northern pillar; Thot over that of the west, and Sapdi, the author of the Zodiacal light, over that of the east. They had divided the world among themselves into four regions, or rather into four 'houses,' bounded by those mountains which surround it, and by the diameters intersecting between the pillars. Each of these houses belonged to one, and to one only; none of the other three, nor even the sun himself, might enter it, dwell there, or even pass through it, without having obtained its master's permission ." "The Heliopolitans proclaimed the creation to be the work of the sun-god Atumuf-Ra, and of the four pairs of deities who were descended from hiin. It was really a learned variant of the old doctrine that the universe was composed of a sky-god, Horus, supported by his four children and their four pillars; in fact, the four sons of the Heliopolitan cosmogony, Shu and Sibu, Osiris and Sit, were occasionally substituted for the four elder gods of the 'houses' of the world ." And when Ra, the sun-god and first king of Egypt, would take leave of earth, "Nuiit . . . changed herself into a cow, and placed the Majesty of Ra upon her back." Later on "he again mounted the cow, who rose, supported on her four legs as on so many pillars; and her belly, stretched out above the earth like a ceiling, formed the sky... Nuiit, suddenly transported to unaccustomed heights, grew frightened, and cried for help: 'For pity's sake give me supports to sustain me.'" This was the origin of the support-gods. They came 1 Compare the figures, Dawn of Civilization, pp. 86, 89, I29, and I69. 2 For the four pillars and their hieroglyphic representation, vide ibid., pp. I6, 17, with note. 3 Ibid., p. 128. 4 Pp. 141, I42.</page><page sequence="8">'THE LORD OF HEAVEN" 695 and stationed themselves by each of her four legs, steadying these with their hands, and keeping constant watch over them. As this was not enough to reassure the good beast, " R said, 'My son Shu, place thyself beneath my daughter Nuit, and keep watch on both sides over the supports, who live in the twilight; hold thou her up above thy head, and be her guardian.' Shu obeyed; Ntit com- posed herself, and the world, now furnished with the sky which it had hitherto lacked, assumed its present symmetrical form l." These barbarous and grotesque myths, so various in form, so consistent in significance, enable us to judge as well of the intention as of the superior elevation and refinement of the idea presented by Ezekiel. He too has his answer to the question, " Who sustains the firmament which bears the throne of God ? " And he represents it as supported by four animated beings, rin, corresponding, as we may safely presume, in the first instance, to the cardinal points and the related quarters of the heavens. They are covered all over2 with eyes, that is, with stars, as in the well-known epigram, ascribed to Plato:- Star of my life! Oh, might I Heaven be, And gaze with myriad eyes on thee! And in the second place, these supernatural bearers, now at rest, now in motion-" when they stood, they let down their wings "-inasmuch as they not only sustain the firmament on high, but also transport the throne of Jahveh from place to place, in accordance with his will, must correspond, not only to the fixed points of the compass, the four quarters of the world, but also to the winds which proceed from, or (according to the conception of Zechariah, vi. 6) toward them. Ezekiel stood too near the age of Deuteronomy, and, it may be thought, possessed too lofty an imagination, to adopt the horse as a symbol of the winds of God. But we may safely use the language of the later prophet to interpret the conception of his pre. 1 Dawn of Civilization, pp. I67-9. 2 Ezek. x. i2. But the text is by no means free from suspicion. VOL.

II:- Whence it appears (a) that Jahveh rides upon a cherub; (b) that the cherub is singular; (c) that the cherub is the wind. In Ps. civ. 3, 4, Jahveh is described as:- n r3 ut y bnwn nimnl 1sN'x D inEw ere, hough he makeh he clouds his chario "(cf. Ezek. Here, though " he maketh the clouds his chariot "(cf. Ezek. i. 4 5r1 pv), yet, as in the prophet's vision, " he goeth on the wings of the wind," and " maketh the winds his angels "- for rnal'akh is, in origin, more than messenger. It follows from what has been said that the nn of Ezekiel are winds, that they are cherubim, and that they are *nin 4M. The first of these propositions is further illustrated and confirmed by a characteristic feature of the prophet's description. It would seem that he conceives the four winds as proceeding, each in an undeviating course, from one end of heaven to the other-they cannot turn (see i. 12). This involves a serious inconsistency. It was, we may presume, the high purpose of Ezekiel to express the omnipresence of Israel's God. Therefore all the four winds must be associated with the chariot of Jahveh, though obviously it can only proceed in one direction at a time. Zechariah solved the problem by separating the four winds; Ezekiel by assigning to each one the four faces, and the four natures, proper to the several elements of his conception. We have now to inquire into the origin of these. They are, I conceive, strictly, mnl t5Nn. The instances are many of the manifestation or embodiment of God in human form, in colloquy with the patriarchs and heroes of Israel. But the Israelites who worshipped the Calf of Aaron at</page><page sequence="10">"THE LORD OF HEAVEN" 697 Bethel, or the Serpent of Moses at Jerusalem, must have regarded these also as embodiments of the national deity. We may reasonably place a similar interpretation on the lions which, as well as oxen and cherubim, figured among the ornaments of the Temple (i Kings vii. 29), where, doubtless, Ezekiel may have seen them. Lastly, we cannot find among animal forms one more appropriate to the Sky-god than that of the eagle (compare the fine image in Deut. xxxii. ii). With the progress, or the reform, of religion in Israel, these beings exchanged the character of divine incarnations for that of supernatural ministers (cf. Ps. civ. 4 sup. cit.). The qv of Num. xxi. 8, presumably a 9ip '1' (Isa. xiv. 29, xxx. 6), was replaced by a six- winged, yet otherwise anthropomorphic Dnwa of Isa. vi, attendant on the throne of Jahveh. In the vision of Ezekiel, clearly modelled on, or suggested by, that of Isaiah, either the seraphim are tacitly rejected or the Face of Man is all of them that survives. Ezek. x. I4, in which the face of the Cherub is (by im- plication) identified with that of the Ox, is treated both by Toy, in the Polychrome Bible, and by Cheyne (art. "Cherub," col. 742, n. 5) as a gloss. Even so, it represents an ancient opinion, which receives strong confirmation from the re- markable and significant circumstance that all the four beings have hooves like the hooves of a calf (i. 7). There could not be clearer proof that the cherubim share the nature of the Calf of Bethel. It is possible that in this mythology of the heavens, the Ox or Calf was once associated with the " Bull of Anu," the Moon, and the Lion in like manner with the power and fierceness of the Sun. But this is not the signification in which they are employed by Ezekiel. If, however, we suppose the Face of Man directed to the East, then (i. io) the Lion's Face will be appropriately turned toward the South (m;Dn tK: cf. trn), the region of noonday Sun and parching Wind; the Face of the Eagle, or rather Vulture, toward the West, which we shall see in the sequel to be zz 2</page><page sequence="11">698 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW specially the region of the Dead; while perhaps we may discover a reason to connect not the Ox, nor yet the Moon as such, but the " Bull of Anu," considered as Lord of Heaven, with the dominion of the North. Confirmation of these hypotheses may be found in the learned, though subjective, article of Winckler upon Sinai and Horeb, ? 2: "when the sun... is at the most southerly point of its course in the zodiac ... the corresponding full moon being in opposition is at the most northerly point." Again, "the Babylonian view . . . takes as its point of orientation . . . the E. (= that which is before, bip), and thus for it the N. is to the left, the S. to the right, and the W. behind" (col. 463i). It would seem that these four points were respectively assigned to Marduk, Ninib, Nabu, and Nergal (see col. 4630); to Marduk, as I understand, the East, to Ninib the North, the South to Nergal, and the West to Nabu (col. 463I). In the Babylonian story of the Deluge we have a parallel to Ezekiel's vision far too close to be accidental. (See Maspero, Dawn of Civilization, 568; and King, First Steps in Assyrian, pp. 166-7.) " When the early dawn appeared, there came up from the horizon (ishid shame = the foundation of heaven) a black cloud." (Cf. Ezek. i. 4; Ps. xviii. 8 seq.) The god within is Rammanu, the Hebrew Rimmon, the Thunderer. But the point which most concerns us is that he is accompanied by Nabu and Marduk, by Nergal' and Ninib. The two former deities are described in this passage as guzale "messengers" (King), or as "throne-bearers 2 " (Maspero), while earlier in the narrative (Maspero, 566; King, I62) Ninib is called guzalu of the great gods.

It is clear, I think, that they correspond to the DbnTrDn of Ps. civ. 4, just as the ,:nm of the preceding clause correspond to the nrvn, or cherubim, of Ezekiel, and the gods of Chaldea. We are now in a position to judge in what manner the great phenomena of Nature presented themselves to the apprehension of the prophet and his hearers. "There is One enthroned upon the heavens, but it is Jahveh; there is indeed a god who rides in the whirlwind and directs the storm, but it is the God of Israel. Four mighty beings bear aloft the firmament, and rule the winds: these also are his ministers." Such is the interpretation of the vision. And, as the movements of the atmosphere are represented by the nn, so the revolution of the celestial sphere, and the wandering course of the planets, find expression in the h,S:.. As there was originally but one Cherub (Ps. xviii. i), so was there originally but one Wheel; for the four do not differ in kind. Each must apparently be conceived as consisting of two intersecting circles--it would seem of equal diameter-capable therefore, as a whole, of rolling from east to west, from north to south, or in the reverse directions, but incapable of any other motion, of turning upon an axle, or of forming part of any mechanical con- struction. (By this time we begin to perceive that the "cchariot" is not a chariot at all, nor in fact does Ezekiel call it so.) The Wheel is moved from within by the inspiration of the several winds, and in their respective directions b:lI: rnnni nnmi : (vers. 19, 20, 21). And even as they do, it serves in some manner to sustain and to transport the Throne of God. The periphery is full of eyes-that is, as I suppose, of stars-round about, and, in fine, the Wheel clearly represents either the celestial sphere, or more precisely, the Zodiac. Its fourfold motions express, and were perhaps designed to explain, the diurnal revolution of the heavens, the displacement of the planets in latitude, and their sometimes retrograde course. This</page><page sequence="13">700 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW then is the otherwise obscure 53 of x. 13, and not im- probably of Ps. lxxvii. 19, where the rendering of Kimchi is more trustworthy than the speculations of the Encyclo- paedia Biblica (art. "Wheel "). Were we to suppose each planet provided with a distinct wheel or sphere--tmll tlan trmn--we should approach very nearly the Ptolemaic astronomy. "The gods principally worshipped," writes Winckler, "are the moon, the sun, and the five planets. Their periods of revolution mark the divisions of time-month, year, and larger cycles-and compel attention by their importance for the course of natural life (Gen. i. 14, viii. 22). In the Babylonian view of these seven great divinities, the planet Venus is associated with the moon and the sun, so that the three together become rulers of the Zodiac (the sucpuk same-i.e. the highway of heaven, along which the seven travel). 'He (Bel) appointed Sin, SamaS, and Igtar to rule in the Zodiac'" (Art. "Sinai and Horeb," col. 4630). If Ezekiel accepted the tradition which represented the patriarch as a sojourner in Harran, or, according to the Priestly Code, in Ur of the Chaldees, and, in either case, a client of the god Sin; and if he retained some measure of respect for the myth which, as I suppose, regarded the Moon's disk as the Face or Presence of the Lord of Heaven, we can the better understand why he conceived the celestial Wheel as bearing in its revolutions the divine Throne. It is interesting, and may prove instructive, to compare with the conceptions of Ezekiel the description, drawn from Philo of Byblos, of the image of Ell, or "Kronos" ascribed to the Egyptian Thoth 2. I quote Cary's version3: "But before these things the god Taautus, having represented Ouranos, made types of the countenances of the gods Kronus and Dagon, and the sacred character of the other elements. He contrived also for Kronus the ensign of his royal power, having four eyes in the parts before and in the parts behind, two of them closing as in sleep; and upon the shoulders four wings, two in the act of flying, and two reposing as at rest. And the symbol was, that Kronus whilst he 1 Cf. Meyer, art. " Phoen.," col. 3743. 2 Taavros, v. 1. TavOos. 3 Ancient Fragments, ed. Hodges, 1876, p. I8.</page><page sequence="14">THE LORD OF HEAVEN" 701 slept was watching, and reposed whilst he was awake. And in like manner with respect to his wings, that whilst he rested he was flying, yet rested whilst he flew. But to the other gods there were two wings only to each upon his shoulders, to intimate that they flew under the control of Kronus; he had also two wings upon his head, the one for the most governing part, the mind, and one for the sense." We can hardly fail to recognize in this image of un- sleeping motion, "without haste and without rest," the eternal swift course of the spheres . NOTE.-" Irenaeus, too, finds the rationale for the' four' gospels in the fact that there are four quarters of the globe and four winds (7rverAara); since, further, the church extends over all the world, while its 'pillars and grounds' and spirit of life (7rvE4ita Cg'o) are the gospel, it is fitting that she should have four pillars breathing out (7rveovras) immortality on every side, and vivifying men afresh." E. B. "John, Son of Zebedee," ? 49 b. This shows that Irenaeus understood Ezekiel, and (with all deference to Prof. Schmiedel) it is no mere verbal trifling, but rests upon the mystical assumption of a correspondence between the outer and inner worlds. In J. Q.R., XI, p. 13 ("The Testament of Solomon"), Mr. Conybeare cites from Origen an account of " the seven ruling demons" referred to by Celsus, and accepted, it would seem, by the Ophiani. The first was shaped like a lion; this is Michael. The second like an ox; this is Suriel. The third resembles a dragon, and this is Raphael. The name may imply a reference to the healing powers of the serpent-god. It is important to observe that the similitude of the dragon replaces the Face of Man in Ezekiel's vision. And the fourth, Gabriel, "has the shape of an eagle." It is an astonishing reflection that through the influence of Ezekiel and Irenaeus, the Lion of Nergal, successively transferred to the Angel of the South and the Evangelist 1 Hymn of the Three Archangels in Shelley's translations from Faust.</page><page sequence="15">702 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW St. Mark, became in the Middle Ages the emblem of the Venetian Republic, and so remained until Venice fell before Napoleon.

I must also refer to Mr. Cook's note on the fourfold Apollo (F. L., XV, 284, n. I47); his mention of the Argive Zeus, surnamed razvd7rrTS, with eyes all over his body (ibid., p. 287); his note on the aenei orbes, the urfeta=orbita, and summnanalia associated with celestial deities in ancient Italy (F. I., XVI, 272, n. 9), and his remarks on the royal, or divine, chariot (ibid., pp. 307, 3I8). In the Hibbert Journal for October, I905, No. 13, at p. 22, Dr. Jeremias writes, with reference to the N.
