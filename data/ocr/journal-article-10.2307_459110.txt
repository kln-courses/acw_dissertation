<plain_text><page sequence="1">LVIII HARDY'S "MEPHISTOPHELIAN VISITANTS" THOMAS HARDY'S plots often introduce an outsider into a tran- quil current of events to project a disturbing force into the story. This outsider turns the current and sometimes continues to deflect it to a tragic end. Critics have called the outsiders "invaders" or "human 'apples of discord',"' but they have not considered what light may be thrown on the nature of these invaders if they are studied in terms that Hardy himself suggests. In speaking of reddlemen, the class to which the invader Diggory Venn belongs, Hardy uses the term "Mephistophe- lian visitants."2 This term is not inapt, I think, to describe a series of in- vaders, three of them dressed in red and all presented in a background of suggestions that they are preternatural. Under the Greenwood Tree (1872), which "contains the seeds of most of the Wessex novels,"3 exhibits the first invader with these traits. The love of Dick Dewey and Fancy Day runs a smooth course until Fancy's father tells Dick that marriage with his daughter is impossible; Fancy must look higher, presumably to Mr. Shiner or the Reverend Mr. Maybold. At this crisis, Fancy is driven by a rainstorm to the home of a woman who plays no other r6le in the story than to advise Fancy to practice de- ception. This woman is Elizabeth Endorfield, whose local reputation as a witch is: ... founded on the following items of character. She was shrewd and penetrating; her house stood in a lonely place; she never went to church; she wore a red cloak; she always retained her bonnet indoors; and she had a pointed chin. Thus far her attributes were distinctly Satanic; and those who looked no further called her, in plain terms, a witch.4 1 For example, McDowall speaks of "those 'invaders' who play a pivotal r61e in the novels." Arthur Sydney McDowall, Thomas Hardy A Critical Study (London: Faber &amp; Faber, 1931), p. 66. Holland says that "Hardy... in most of his books delighted to introduce persons from the outside world into these regions of tranquillity, and these often proved human 'apples of discord'."

Bailey Mrs. Endorfield perceives that Fancy is troubled, and she offers Fancy a chance-"O, such a wicked chance!"-to "bewitch your father to let you marry Dick Dewey." When Fancy agrees, the witch (as Hardy calls her) whispers her scheme, glancing into Fancy's face "with an expression of sinister humour." On the other hand, Hardy makes it clear that Mrs. Endorfield is "simply a Deep Body," whose charms are "worked by common sense." These charms work: Fancy becomes a hypocrite, pretending to lose her appetite and to pine away, until, alarmed, her father yields. Mrs. Endorfield's name suggests the Witch of Endor. Her externals are "distinctly Satanic": she does not go to church; her red cloak is a Satanic emblem. But she is also a woman, whose singular feature is some- what unscrupulous intelligence, or as Hardy elsewhere calls this qual- ity, "the subversive Mephistophelian endowment, brains."6 In the plot, she is an outsider who intervenes to change the lives of others, though her own life remains unchanged. Hardy's next invader in red is Sergeant Troy in Far from the Madding Crowd (1874).6 At the time he invades the story, Bathsheba is implicitly engaged to Boldwood; the current is running toward their marriage and Gabriel's philosophic resignation to it. Sergeant Troy has previously been heard of as the seducer of Fanny Robin. He is presumably a bastard, the son of the late Lord Severn and a French governess who had married a medical man before her child was born. He meets Bathsheba in a startling scene. As she walks with lantern darkened through her fir plantation on a pitch-black night, her dress becomes entangled in his uniform. When the lantern is opened she sees a figure "brilliant in brass and scarlet" whose sudden appearance "was to darkness what the sound of a trumpet is to silence." Upon seeing her beauty, Troy speaks with impudence, wishing the tangle "had been the knot of knots, which there's no untying!"7 Bathsheba learns from her maid that Troy is strangely gifted: "'Learnt all languages ... got on so far that he could take down Chinese in shorthand . . . listed a soldier; but even then he rose to be a sergeant 6 The Hand of Ethelberta, xxvI, 42. 6 The intervening novel, A Pair of Blue Eyes (1872-73), contains a character, the widow Jethway, whose traits seem developed in part from those of Mrs. Endorfield. She invades the story at critical points to turn the action: the engagement between Knight and Elfride is broken because Mrs. Jethway informs Knight that Elfride had had previous lovers. She is a mysterious figure flitting through the shadows of the story. On the other hand, she does not manifest enough of the Mephistophelian traits to be in exactly the same class as Mrs. Endorfield; she is vengefully sinister, rather than Satanic; no one thinks her a witch; her cloak is black rather than red; and she is scheming rather than brainy. 7 III, 191-194. 1147</page><page sequence="3">Hardy's "Mephistophelian Visitants" without trying at all'." He is, however, a creature of moods and im- pulses, "a man to whom memories were an incumbrance, and anticipa- tions a superfluity .... His outlook upon time was as a transient flash of the eye now and then . . . moderately truthful towards men, but to women lied like a Cretan.. "8 His vices, however, were "spruce" rather than "ugly." Bathsheba sees him next in her hayfield: "a bright scarlet spot emerged" from behind a wagon and turned out to be "the gallant sergeant." Again he flatters her impudently, and "smiled within himself, and probably too the devil smiled from a loop-hole in Tophet, for the moment was the turning-point of a career . . . the seed which was to lift the foundation had taken root in the chink."9 The next meeting is a tryst in a hollow, where to exhibit his skill in sword-exercises, Troy ap- pears, "a dim spot of artificial red moving round the shoulder of the rise." The exhibition is dazzling, an "aurora militaris" seen in a "scarlet haze"; he cuts a lock from her hair before she sees what he is doing; his swordpoint impales a caterpillar on her bodice. "'Why, it is magic'! said Bathsheba, amazed." He kisses her and is gone; "she saw his scarlet form disappear amid the ferny thicket, almost in a flash, like a brand swiftly waved."'0 Gabriel seeks to convince Bathsheba that Sergeant Troy is not a good man, but she insists that he " 'is very particular, too, about going to church-yes, he is' !" The reason no one ever sees him there is that " 'he goes in privately by the old tower door, just when the service com- mences, and sits at the back of the gallery'." As Gabriel left her, "A figure apparently arose from the earth beside her," Troy's. To test the assertion that Troy goes to church, Gabriel climbs to the gallery door; he finds a sprig of ivy grown across the door jamb, "decisive proof that the door had not been opened at least since Troy came back to Weather- bury."" When Boldwood sees Troy descend from a van, "a scarlet and gilded form," he urges Troy to marry Fanny Robin and leave Bathsheba alone. Troy answers him at first in a "devil-may-care tone" and then in "the voice of a trickster." When Troy insinuated that there were reasons why he had best marry Bathsheba, Boldwood "flung him back against the hedge. 'Devil, you torture me!' said he." Now Boldwood promises Troy five hundred pounds if he will save Bathsheba's honor by marrying her. Taking Boldwood to Bathsheba's house, supposedly to consult her, Troy disappears inside, and then returns with a newspaper describing his marriage to Bathsheba some days before in the town of Bath. In con- temptuous triumph, Troy throws Boldwood's money into the road. 8 Im, 195-198. 9 I, 200-204. 10 I, 216-221. 1 III, 228-231. 1148</page><page sequence="4">J. O. Bailey "Boldwood shook his clenched fist at him. 'You juggler of Satan! You black hound!' "12 Boldwood feels that Troy is an agent of some malignant Power. " 'I had some faint belief in the mercy of God till I lost that woman'," he said. "'Yes, He prepared a gourd to shade me, and like the prophet I thanked Him and was glad. But the next day He prepared a worm to smite the gourd and wither it; and I feel it is better to die than to live!' "'3 Meanwhile, Troy goes a route that may ruin Bathsheba. Seeing a storm coming that will destroy the year's harvest, Gabriel looks for help, but finds the work-folk in a drunken stupor to which Troy had enticed them. "In the midst of these shone red and distinct the figure of Sergeant Troy, leaning back in a chair."'4 A little later, Troy and his bride quarrel be- cause he is squandering her money: he has lost more than a hundred pounds in a month " 'by this dreadful horse-racing'."'5 But Troy is not all rascal. When Bathsheba has opened Fanny's casket and discovered Troy's child beside the mother, Troy, in a sudden access of love-and-remorse, bends over Fanny and kisses her. In the quarrel some manly quality in him is angry at what Satan had' led him to do: " 'If Satan had not tempted me with that face of yours, and those cursed coquetries, I should have married her'."'6 But when Troy plants flowers on Fanny's grave and water shot from the mouth of the gurgoyle on the church washes them away, he perceives "that Providence, far from help- ing him into a new course, or showing any wish that he might adopt one, actually jeered his first trembling and critical attempt in that kind." He became himself again, "simply threw up his cards and foreswore his game for that time and always."'7 He goes away, but when he returns after some years, he learns that he is thought drowned and that Boldwood, again seeking to marry Bath- sheba, is planning a Christmas party. Troy imagines how the guests will stare if he attends the party, like one from the dead: " 'and when I go in the guests will sit in silence and fear, and all laughter and pleasure will be hushed, and the lights in the chamber burn blue, and the worms- Ugh, horrible !' "18 Some of the work-folk, hearing that Troy has returned, heartily wish him " 'in '." At Troy's dramatic appearance, Boldwood recognizes "that the imper- sonator of Heaven's persistent irony towards him, who had once before broken in upon his bliss, scourged him, and snatched his delight away, had come to do these things a second time."19 Troy's name does not suggest a preternatural role, but that he is matched against a character named Gabriel may have had some meaning 12 IV, 32-41. 1 iv, 68. 4 iv, 53. 15 IV, 71. 16 v, 119. 17 IV, 140. 18 iv, 200. 19 Iv, 212-213. 1149</page><page sequence="5">Hardy's "Mephistophelian Visitants" in Hardy's mind. Several things said about him suggest Satanic sym- bolism. His scarlet coat flashes through the story in lurid lights. He does not go to church. His performance with the sword seems wizardry. At a crisis, Hardy says that the Devil may have smiled from a loop-hole in Tophet. Boldwood calls him Devil, juggler of Satan, black hound-this last, a form taken by Mephistopheles-and a worm prepared by God to smite his happiness. Troy himself said that Satan led him to Bathsheba. Hardy calls him "the impersonator of Heaven's persistent irony towards" Boldwood, though an unusual concept of Heaven must be understood, for the usual concept does not attribute to It persistent irony. When Troy seeks to change his course, he meets a grotesque rebuke from the gurgoyle on the church roof. But Troy is also a man, even if of mixed lineage and unstable char- acter. He has a facile wit, a brilliance of unscrupulous brains. He is fond of chance, at least to the extent of playing Bathsheba's money on the races. He is an outsider who invades the story to change three lives. His own ways are not changed, for the Power symbolized by the gurgoyle "actually jeered" his resolution to change. When he leaves the story, it returns to its former course, but at a new crisis, he appears again to wreck Boldwood and send Bathsheba back to her first suitor, Gabriel. His own death seems a violent last resort to get him out of the scene. In The Return of the Native (1878)20 the r6le of "Mephistophelian visitant" becomes organic.21 Diggory Venn "repeats with his blood-red clothes Troy's patch of scarlet in the other book: but here the strangeness is native to the scene."22 Diggory is not "temporarily overlaid" with lurid red; "it permeated him," denoting him a "nearly perished link between obsolete forms of life and those which generally prevail." He is handsome in an Egdon-worldly way, with an eye "keen as that of a bird of prey, and blue as autumn mist," as if he were himself a manifestation of Ish- maelitish Egdon, which is more a force than a background in this story. His lips remain habitually "compressed by thought" though "there was a pleasant twitch at their corners now and then."23 To the chorus of work-folk, there is something supernatural about Diggory. Just before he appears in their midst, they talk of ghosts, and 20 The intervening novel, The Hand of Ethelberta (1875-76), contains no Mephisto- phelian visitant, though Hardy ascribes Ethelberta's success to her possession of "the subversive Mephistophelian endowment, brains." xxvI, 42. 21 Diggory as "Mephistophelian visitant" is not to be taken as a literal imitation of Mephistopheles. The evidence indicates only that Hardy used the traditional Mephis- topheles as a basis for creating symbolic characters to fit his own concept of the universe and of theology. This point is discussed later when the relation of the "Mephistophelian visitants" to Hardy's theological views is taken up. 22 McDowall, op. cit., p. 70. 23 n, 9. 1150</page><page sequence="6">J. O. Bailey Timothy tells of a little boy who saw a ghost: " 'A red one. Yes, most ghosts be white; but this is as if it had been dipped in blood'." Diggory appears just as Christian murmurs of the dancing that " "tis tempting the Wicked One, 'tis'." His dramatic appearance in the firelight gives even sceptical Timothy a "turn": " 'Lord's sake, I thought, whatever fiery mommet is this come to trouble us? ... I half thought 'twas the devil or the red ghost the boy told of'." As Christian remarks, " 'If he had a handkerchief over his head he'd look for all the world like the Devil in the picture of the Temptation'."24 When little Johnny Nunsuch comes upon Diggory alone, he refuses to let Diggory tie up his bleeding hand until he finds the crooked sixpence-a charm against evil spirits- that Eustacia had given him and that he had clutched "to fortify his courage."25 Diggory is kind to Johnny, but he teases the boy, putting his own designation just beside that of the Devil: " 'You little children think there's only one cuckoo, one fox, one giant, one devil, and one reddleman, when there's lots of us all'."26 Diggory, though native to Egdon, was also a visitant; as he reminded Eustacia, " 'Since I have taken to the reddle trade I travel a good deal, as you know'."27 His reddleman-phase, which may be thought of as symbolizing his Mephistophelian aspect, was a chosen r61e, as he said to Mrs. Yeobright: " 'I am not red by birth, you know; I only took to this business for a freak; and I might turn my hand to something else in good time'."28 Wherever Diggory appeared, he seemed "lurid like a flame in sunlight" and, like Egdon, Ishmaelitish.29 He appeared in the lives of the main characters just in time to help throw the intended marriage of Thomasin and Wildeve into confusion. When this confusion was settling into a smooth current, he disappeared. Then at a crucial moment he re-appeared from a chimney-corner, followed Wildeve and Christian across the heath, and watched Wildeve and Christian use the "devil's playthings" in a game of chance. The title of the chapter that describes Diggory's inter- ference defines the role he played: "A New Force Disturbs the Current." Diggory's appearance to Wildeve was dramatic: "a figure rose from behind a neighbouring bush and came forward into the lantern light."30 With silent assurance, as if there were no question of his losing, he laid a sovereign on the stone to invite Wildeve to continue the gambling. 24 VI, 30-36. 25 See Ruth A. Firor, Folkways in Thomas Hardy (Philadelphia: University of Penn- sylvania Press, 1931), p. 91. 26 VII, 90. 27 VII, 112. 28 VII, 117. 29 "Ishmaelitish" is applied to "haggard Egdon" in vII, 6, and to Diggory in vii, 183. 30 III, 36. 1151</page><page sequence="7">Hardy's "Mephistophelian Visitants" Throughout the gaming, "He might have been an Arab, or an autom- aton; he would have been like a red-sandstone statue but for the motion of his arm with the dice-box."31 He spoke only to mock Wildeve with the enticements Wildeve had spoken to Christian. When Wildeve threw seventeen with the three dice, Wildeve clapped his hands for joy at this nearly-perfect score. " 'There are two playing, and only one has thrown,' said the reddleman, quietly bringing down the box,"32 and showing a triplet of sixes. In a frenzy, Wildeve hurled the dice across the heath, but immediately wanted to continue playing. The scene became grotesque; heath-croppers stood in a circle about them gazing intently at the game: Ten minutes passed away. Then a large death's head moth advanced from the obscure outer air, wheeled twice round the lantern, flew straight at the candle, and extinguished it by the force of the blow.33 Without matches, Wildeve collected thirteen glowworms and arranged them "in a circle on the stone" to throw a "pale phosphoric shine" over the game. But "Fortune had unmistakably fallen in love with the reddle- man to-night," for he threw highest so steadily that Wildeve proposed the lowest throw to win. With ten guineas left, Wildeve placed five and, throwing for low, turned up three points; Diggory threw two. In a rage, Wildeve seized the die and bit "as if he would bite it in pieces." He laid his last five guineas and threw again for low; he turned up the lowest possible number, one. Diggory then threw: He threw ace also. "O!" said Wildeve. "Curse me!" The die smacked the stone a second time. It was ace again. Venn looked gloomy, threw: the die was seen to be lying in two pieces, the cleft sides upper- most. "I've thrown nothing at all," he said. "Serves me right-I split the die with my teeth. Here-take your money. Blank is less than one."4 This is the turning point, and Diggory's luck controlled it. The mis- understanding between Eustacia and Mrs. Yeobright that led to the tragic end began as a quarrel that "arose entirely out of the unconscious misapplication by Venn of the fifty guineas intended for Yeobright."35 When Thomasin appealed to Diggory to help her keep Wildeve at home, shortly afterward Wildeve "perceived that Venn's counter-moves had begun again."36 Diggory used a gun to frighten Wildeve from Eu- stacia, but "The doubtful legitimacy of such rough coercion did not dis- turb the mind of Venn. It troubles few such minds in such cases, . . . 37 31 viii, 38. 32 VIII, 39. 33 VIii, 40-41. 34 vm, 43. 36 vm, 51. 38 viiI, 82. 37 VIII, 87. 1152</page><page sequence="8">J. O. Bailey The "well-known form in corduroy, lurid from head to foot" was active to the end; it was he who dragged the bodies from the pool. His work seemed done as he stood before the fireplace in Wildeve's inn, the steam from his leggings ascending the chimney with the smoke, and thought of those upstairs: "Two were corpses, one had barely escaped the jaws of death, another was sick and a widow ... of all the circle, he himself was the only one whose situation had not materially changed."38 In the book of "Aftercourses," as the novel stands, Diggory doffed his r6le as reddleman and exhibited "the strangely altered hues of an ordi- nary Christian countenance." To Thomasin it seemed incredible " 'that he had got white of his own accord! It seemed supernatural'." " 'What shall we have to frighten Thomasin's baby with, now you have become a human being again?' " asked Clym.39 But this transformation to human being must be understood as Hardy's concession to readers who failed to see Diggory as Hardy saw him. In the Wessex Edition of 1912 (London: Macmillan &amp; Co.) and in the Autograph Edition-the "Authorized and Definitive Edition"-of 1912 (New York: Harper and Brothers) the fol- lowing note appears on page 473: The writer may state here that the original conception of the story did not design a marriage between Thomasin and Venn. He was to have retained his iso- lated and weird character to the last, and to have disappeared mysteriously from the heath, nobody knowing whither-Thomasin remaining a widow. But certain circumstances of serial publication led to a change of intent. Readers can therefore choose between the endings, and those with an austere artistic code can assume the more consistent conclusion to be the true one.40 Many readers accept Diggory's transformation to human as "natural enough"; they are "grateful for this ray of sunshine in the prevailing gloom," for the happy ending "can hardly be said to invalidate Hardy's artistic purpose.... "41 The publishers of Belgravia who insisted upon Diggory's marriage to Thomasin were "right if the claims of probability were to be respected."42 These views are based, of course, upon the reader's apprehension of Diggory as a man who is luridly dressed, rather than upon Hardy's more austere view of him. In this austere view, Dig- gory seems to be a symbolic character, an aspect of some such force as the 38 VIII, 214-215. "9 vII, 225-226. 40 This note appears in vIII, 241, of the Mellstock Edition.

In this concept, perhaps only in this concept, the ending Hardy was persuaded to write does violate his "austere artistic code." In writing his "grim note," Hardy supposed that some readers might perceive his idea and "assume the more consistent conclusion to be the true one." It is not clear whether Hardy chose the reddleman's name to suggest his role. Diggory is a common name for a laborer, and from it comes, ap- parently, the Irish phrase "to work like diggory,"43 which phrase parallels the often-heard expression "to work like the devil (or deuce, or dickens)." If the phrase was heard in Wessex, Hardy may have chosen the name with this connotation in his mind. Venn is a Southern Middle English, i. e., "Wessex," varient offen in the meaning of "marsh" or "lowland."44 At most, then, the reddleman's name offers only a dim hint of his role. On the other hand, it fits the strangeness of his character better than such a name as Robert Shepherd, for instance, would have done. Satanic symbolism is constantly suggested by both the way he ap- peared abruptly in lurid lights and the way he affected the feelings of others. He seemed to Timothy a "fiery mommet," or such a puppet representing a Vice, Devil, or Mephistopheles as Timothy might have seen at fairs. He looked like such a mommet as he squatted on the heath rolling the "devil's playthings" with automatic motion of his arm. Ruth Firor comments, "Perhaps Hardy's intention was to suggest the ancient association of the Evil One with gaming."45 Furthermore, these play- things obeyed Diggory's will as if they were indeed his own and he con- trolled them. When Wildeve rolled 17, Diggory had one chance in 216 (6X6X6) to roll the higher number, 18. Though, in the theory of probabilities, his rolling 18 was not affected by the previous 17, that an 18 should follow a 17 at this critical moment seems even more remote than a 1/216th chance. When the death's head moth had extinguished the candle, the thirteen glowworms had been collected, and the scene had taken on the appearance of a Dantesque dream, Diggory's luck was even more fantastic. When Wildeve, rolling for low, threw 3, Diggory had one chance in three to throw below him. He threw a 2, mockingly just below the 3. Then Wildeve threw 1; Diggory could not throw below 1, but he threw 1 also. Wildeve threw 1 again, and he was exultant; it was impos- sible to throw below 1. But Diggory threw, and both sides of a cleft die lay uppermost, exhibiting "nothing at all." Gamblers record many odd 43 See Joseph Wright, English Dialect Dictionary. 44 See the New English Dictionary. The association of Venn andfen suggests the marsh- light or will-o'-the-wisp, a suggestion which is in keeping with Venn's mysterious character and his incalculable comings and goings. 45 Op. cit., p. 168. 1154</page><page sequence="10">J. O. Bailey evidences of the love or aversion of Lady Luck, but Diggory's luck was so incredible as to suggest that he exercised some supernatural power over the dice.46 Like Sergeant Troy, "impersonator of Heaven's persistent irony," Diggory seems to impersonate "the satire of Heaven." Shortly after the gaming on the heath, Eustacia meditated that "death appeared the only door of relief if the satire of Heaven should go much further."47 This satire did go further, for by the end of the chapter, "Venn's counter moves had begun again." As these moves became effective, Eustacia blamed "some indistinct, colossal Prince of the World, who had framed her situation and ruled her lot."48 It is Venn who had framed her situa- tion, apparently as agent of the colossal Prince of the World and imper- sonator of the satire of Heaven. How he had framed her situation is ap- parent at every crisis. Yet Diggory was also a man, so good that he is often compared with the self-sacrificing heroes Gabriel Oak and Winterborne. Like them, he had tolerance and patience; but like Mrs. Endorfield and Troy, he was apparently not a church-goer, and like them, he was distinguished by his possession of brains. He used his brains to eavesdrop, spy, and plot; "he is capable of employing subterfuge in support of his aims, and displays a grim satirical turn of mind on occasion."49 Like Troy, he was apparently fond of games of chance, but he was certainly a more lucky gambler. Diggory is Hardy's most impressive Mephistophelian visitant, in what many regard as his greatest book. His next use of this invader was in A Laodicean (1880-81), which is often called Hardy's poorest.50 A Laodicean was written under contract when Hardy was too ill to write at all. He had become ill in October after the first part of the novel had been published in Harper's. Bleeding internally, he was: ... in considerable pain, and compelled to lie on an inclined plane with the lower part of his body higher than his head. Yet he felt determined to finish the novel, 46 Wildeve's biting of the die was the natural cause of the crack that broke it. But the suggestion seems to me strong that the chain of caused-accident is Determination working through natural means. This use of a natural means to effect the incredible suggests to me one way in which Diggory as a compound of Mephistophelian visitant and human being might be defined, as the natural means through which the supernatural works. 47 VIm, 71. 48 VIII, 120. 49 Herbert B. Grimsditch, Character and Environment in the Novels of Thomas Hardy (London: H. F. and G. Witherby, 1925), p. 61. 50 A slight suggestion of the Mephistophelian visitant appears in the intervening novel, The Trumpet Major (1880). Many characters in the book are soldiers in red coats, which are, significantly, not emphasized, but Festus Derriman is, in addition, red-haired and of a florid complexion that flushes easily to scarlet. But this "florid son of Mars" is more a cowardly boastful soldier than anything else; his invasion of the life of Anne Garland is comic, or farcical, and is without consequence in affecting her life. 1155</page><page sequence="11">Hardy's "Mephistophelian Visitants" at whatever stress to himself-so as not to ruin the new venture of the pub- lishers, and also in the interests of his wife, for whom as yet he had made but a poor provision in the event of his own decease. Accordingly from November onwards he began dictating it to her from the awkward position he occupied .... till at the beginning of the following May a rough draft was finished by one shift or another.5' As a consequence, the novel contains much undigested material; for example, the passage about paedo-baptism stalls the story in a way un- usual for Hardy. He recognized the lumpish quality in the book, re- marked in his Preface of 1896 that the novel need not be taken seriously,52 and wrote to the Honorable Mrs. Henniker: "A great part of this story was dictated from a sick bed; and the original conception was but partially carried out."63 The invader in A Laodicean, William Dare, lacks the flash of red that marks the former Mephistophelian visitants, but in character and func- tion, and in the fact that Hardy twice (once in De Stancy's words) com- pared him with Mephistopheles, he more closely resembles the diabolic familiar Mephistopheles than the others. On his first appearance at De Stancy castle, Dare seemed a queer person, a boy-man: His age it was impossible to say. There was not a hair on his face which could serve to hang a guess upon. In repose he appeared a boy; but his actions were so completely those of a man that the beholder's first estimate of sixteen as his age was hastily corrected to six-and-twenty.... Charlotte De Stancy said, " 'I can't think whether he is a boy or a man'."56 Havill questioned him directly, without satisfaction: " 'I can never quite make out what you are, or what your age is. Are you sixteen, one-and-twenty, or twenty-seven?' "66 Somerset, though a skilled artist, could not make a drawing of Dare good enough to identify him to the police.

Bailey posed he might be in love with Paula Power, Dare remarked: "'I! The woman that interests my heart has yet to be born'."8 His nationality is equally uncertain. He said that he had lived "mostly in India, Malta, Gibraltar, the Ionian Islands, and Canada,"59 but he would say anything, and some facts about him suggest other back- grounds. Paula Power believed he was from the East; Charlotte De Stancy said he had an Italian accent when he spoke to her. Havill asked: "And are you an Englishman, Frenchman, Indian, American, or what? You seem not to have caught your accents in these parts." "That's a secret, my friend," said Dare. "I am a citizen of the world. I owe no country patriotism, and no king or queen obedience...." "Well, where were you born-somewhere, I suppose?" "It would be a fact worth the telling. The secret of my birth lies here." And Dare slapped his breast with his right hand.60 Dare was at home in several languages: English without flaw, Spanish, Italian, German, and French.61 Though he engaged in various stratagems for money, browbeating his father, scheming for his father to marry money, and gambling himself to ruin and then to opulence, he asserted that he was above "the base dicta- tion of what men call necessity."62 He had many extraordinary skills. He appeared as a photographer, but he applied for the position of architect's helper to Somerset as a drafts- man. Havill recognized him as: "... the artist, archaeologist, Gothic photographer-Mr. Dare." "Professor Dare." "Professor? Pardon me, I should not have guessed it-so young as you are."63 What he was professor of, and at what institution, Dare avoided specify- ing. When Love's Labour's Lost was performed, he interpolated a passage from Romeo and Juliet to give Captain De Stancy opportunity to kiss Paula on the stage. He seemed familiar with various poets.64 To make a distorted picture of Somerset, Dare taught a local photographer an in- genious device for photographic falsification. In short, as Somerset said, " ' ... it appears ... that he is a being of no age, no nationality, and no behaviour'."65 Besides these prodigious traits, Dare had others even more suggestive of the diabolic and specifical- 68 xxvII, 153. 59 XXVII, 63. o6 XXVII, 165. 61 At various times Dare said: " 'Compuesto no hay mugerfea, as they say at Madrid.'"

A bastard who made his dishonorable birth an excuse for evil behavior, he had a bold and impudent personality, with "the remains of a swagger in his body and limbs," and was instinctively repulsive to others: A latent power in the man, or boy, was revealed by the circumstance that Somer- set did not feel . . . that it was a matter of profound indifference to him whether this gentleman-photographer were a likeable person or DO.66 He had a twist in his eye that suggested diablerie. Somerset "did not observe the sly twist Dare threw into his right eye as he spoke."67 When Dare discovered Havill's rascality, sounds seemed to come from him "which bore a remarkable resemblance to the words 'Ho, ho, Havill!' ... Dare's eye was twisted comically upward."68 His entire attitude was that of an unscrupulous materialistic ra- tionalist. He thought of love as purely physical attraction and made his father fall in love with Paula Power by giving him brandy disguised as wine, leading him to a peep-hole where Paula could be seen exercising in her gymnasium, and then observing the " 'fermentation ... beginning in him ... a purely chemical process.. "69 He had no scruples about spying on Somerset while Somerset was being kind to him, or indeed about any other action. He stole and destroyed the letters of application Somerset received; he held a pistol to Havill's head to keep Havill from seeing what was tattooed on his chest; he stole Somerset's plans for Havill; he proposed to his father that they murder Somerset and seemed amused at his father's horror; he forged Somerset's name to a telegram to cast disgrace upon Somerset and get money for himself; and finally he burned De Stancy castle for no reason at all. He was especially interested in theories of chance and in gambling. When Somerset discharged him, he stayed around the castle reading Moivre's Doctrine of Chances. In Havill's office he pulled out his" 'Book of Chances, a volume as well thumbed as the minister's Bible,"70 and promised to teach Havill something some day. After he had milked his father for the largest check he could get, he then proposed a game of cards and won nine pounds fifteen shillings more. At Monte Carlo Somer- set found him seated at a gaming table in an attitude that suggests the "automaton . . .like a red-sandstone statue" of Diggory gambling on Egdon Heath. "Dare's face was as rigid and dry asif it had been encrusted with plaster, and he was like one turned into a computing machine which no longer had the power of feeling."71 Losing, Dare asked for a loan to continue gaming, for " 'If I only persevere in my system, the certainty 66 xxvn, 62. 67 XXVII, 132. 68 xxvn, 150. 69 xxvI, 204. 70 XXVII, 161. 7' xxviii, 86-87. 1158</page><page sequence="14">J. O. Bailey that I must win is almost mathematical'."72 Later he did win, multiplying his money four hundred times. The first specific suggestion that these traits are Satanic is in Dare's own words. When Captain De Stancy asked him where he had been, Dare replied: " 'From going to and fro in the earth, and walking up and down in it, as Satan said to his Maker'."73 The second suggestion is from Dare's father, who said: " 'You are quite a Mephistopheles, Will-I say it to my sorrow!' "74 The third is Hardy's description of how Captain De Stancy felt when he was on the verge of marrying Paula through Dare's machinations: "... he was as full of apprehension as one who has a league with Mephistopheles."75 Dare's final action in burning De Stancy castle seems meaningless except in terms of a Mephistophelian design. The crisis in Dare's intrigues occurs in the weird scene in which Dare faced that other strange man with weather-scarred, fire-twisted face, Abner Power, among the De Stancy tombs and in the chapel vestry, with pistols leveled at one another. To counter Power's threats, Dare revealed an intimate, apparently eye-witness knowledge of secret events in Power's life: his poverty in Geneva and his lodgings in a back street, his doings in a cellar, his connections with revolutionary anarchists, his secret work on an explosive machine, the explosion of this machine on a lake at night, Power's secret actions in hiding from the police, details of his going to Peru and making a fortune in the guano trade, and the fact that he was wanted by the governments of Europe. These deeds took place in secret, many of them when Power was presumably alone; they took place some years before. Dare was the son of a man who was only thirty-nine, and he must have been in his early teens when Abner Power was connected with the secret society Dare seemed to know more inti- mately than the police. How Dare got this information is not explained. He spoke of a dream. Undoubtedly Hardy had in mind some preternatural, Mephistophelian origin and function for William Dare. Apparently his name was not se- lected to suggest Mephistopheles, but his qualities suggest the inhuman and specifically the Satanic. His function is Mephistophelian: he invaded a situation that would have led smoothly to Somerset's marriage with Paula, decided to have Captain De Stancy marry Paula, and in a series of complex machinations manipulated the events of the story to this end. Some of the things he was able to do, such as to multiply his money four hundred times at the gaming table and to give Abner intimate details about his secret, distant past, seem preternatural. Where Sergeant Troy and Diggory Venn had been impersonators of Heaven (even if an ironic Heaven), Dare seems to impersonate Evil. 72 XXVIII, 89. 73 xxVTI, 184; see Job, II, 2. 1159 74 xxviI, 192. 7.5 xxvin, 203.</page><page sequence="15">Hardy's "Mephistophelian Visitants" Yet he was also a man. His learning was, for his age, prodigious; he was materialistic, cynical, unscrupulous-and hollow. He was hollow be- cause, no doubt, Hardy conceived him as a symbol and then became too ill to clothe this symbol in adequate flesh. The novelette, The Romantic Adventures of a Milkmaid (1883), exhibits a mysterious Baron Von Xanten, who in several respects resembles the Mephistophelian visitant.76 As Ruth Firor remarks: All through the story runs the suggestion that the Baron is not quite what he seems to be; how else explain the coal-black horses which draw his coach, the whole equipage vanishing mysteriously from sight as if by a stroke of black art? ... Upon his disappearance, the Baron became the center of a group of dark legends, hinting that he was a limb of the Devil, if not the Evil One himself.77 This "limb of the Devil" is somewhat Mephistophelian, though he differs in many ways from the archetypes in red that we have examined. The Baron was, like Diggory, a good man. At the time he entered the story, Margery was engaged to marry James Hayward, and all his activi- ties are designed to repay Margery for saving his life and especially to get her happily married to Hayward. The opposing force was simply the fatal attraction the Baron had for Margery; she could not be happy with Hayward until the Baron went away for good. The name Von Xanten, even when reduced to X carved on a beech tree, does not suggest anything diabolic. The Baron's function in the story was simply to attract Margery out of her natural orbit and then, by a strata- gem, to get her back into it. This is hardly Mephistophelian, but in the Baron's appearance and circumstances, in the attitude of the country people toward him, and in the nature of his attraction for Margery, there are many suggestions that he was more than human. He was "A fine-framed dark-mustachioed gentleman . . . quite a dif- ferent being from any of the other men to whom her [Margery's] eyes were accustomed."78 He was a stranger to Wessex. His name and accent were German, and " ' . . . he's a foreign noble that's lived in England so long as to be without any true country ... born to something that can't be earned by elbow-grease and Christian conduct'."79 "Whence he came, whither he was going, were alike unknown."80 He had apparently in- exhaustible wealth. To the country people, he occupied a "position . . .which combined the mysteriousness of a legendary character with the unobtrusive deeds of a modern gentleman." There still exists at "Silverthorn in Lower Wessex... almost a superstitious feeling for the moody melancholy 76 The intervening novel, Two on a Tower (1882), contains no invader of this sort. 77 Op. cit., p. 105. 78 xxx, 107. 7, xxx, 112. 80 xxx, 166. 1160</page><page sequence="16">J. O. Bailey stranger.... "81 When he finally vowed to go away and leave Margery alone, Hayward declared that: ... the ruddy light of the setting sun burned with more than earthly fire on the Baron's face as the words were spoken; and that the ruby flash of his eye in the same light was what he never witnessed before nor since in the eye of mortal man.82 In Wessex, "he is still regarded as one who had something about him magical and unearthly."83 His attraction for Margery was preternatural. She reasoned with her- self, but reason could not overcome the fatal attraction. She "always declared that there seemed to be some power in the stranger that was more than human, something magical and compulsory.... "84 When Hayward said to her: 'Anybody would think the devil had showed you all the kingdoms of the would since I saw you last!' She reddened, 'Perhaps he has!' she murmured.86 "Indeed, the Baron's power over this innocent girl was curiously like enchantment, or mesmeric influence."86 After he had been gone for some years and Margery was finally happy with her husband and her baby, she reflected that if he should send for her, "'I believe I should have no power to disobey.... He was like a magician to me. I think he was one. He could move me as a loadstone moves a speck of steel'."87 In various other hints, Hardy suggests something preternatural about the Baron. When Margery suddenly disappeared in the Baron's coach, Vine said: " '"Twas a stroke of the black art-as if she were sperrited [sic] away'."88 And when Hayward saw the Baron's coach at a distance, it appeared "black and daemonic against the slanting fires of the western sun."89 And yet, says Hardy, he was only a man; his influence over Margery was "probably only that of the cosmopolite over the recluse.... "90 The Mayor of Casterbridge (1886) does not, like The Return of the Native, exhibit a sustained manipulation of events by a Mephistophelian visi- tant. Yet the role does appear, in a curious form; it seems to be shared by two characters, the sailor Richard Newson and Donald Farfrae. Hardy had a tendency to complicate his plots by doubling or tripling his protag- onists. In Under the Greenwood Tree, the love of Fancy and Dick was challenged only momentarily by Shiner and Maybold, but in A Pair of Blue Eyes, Stephen and Knight were equally strong suitors for the hand '8 xxx, 166. 82 xxx, 212.

Then, in Far From the Madding Crowd, Bathsheba was sought by three, Gabriel, Boldwood, and Sergeant Troy, and in The Return of the Native, Hardy added, not a fourth suitor, but a second woman, to achieve the complex of attractions among Eustacia, Thomasin, Clym, Wildeve, and Venn. Apparently on the same principle, Hardy doubled his Mephistophelian visitant in The Mayor of Casterbridge. Newson and Farfrae alternated in playing this role. The story opens with Michael Henchard's sale of his wife. With the dramatic appearance of Richard Newson in the doorway of the furmity woman's tent and his prompt action in throwing onto the table cloth five "crisp new pieces of paper" for the purchase of Susan, the "jovial frivolity" of Henchard's drunken talk departed. "A lurid colour seemed to fill the tent, and change the aspect of all therein."9' Newson took Susan and the child and departed. No one knew him; whence he came, why he came to the tent (for the furmity woman was "not a penny the better for him"), and where he went were alike unknown. But he had changed Henchard's life. When Susan and her daughter, years later, went to seek Henchard, they believed Newson had been lost at sea. Like Sergeant Troy, he had let it be understood that he was drowned. He did not appear in the central portion of the novel, though the fact that Elizabeth-Jane was his daughter instead of Henchard's added a sinister twist to the situation. When Henchard discovered Elizabeth-Jane to be Newson's daugher, he felt the presence of a sinister influence working to overthrow him. "He looked out at the night as at a fiend" and "could not help thinking that the concatenation of events . . . was the scheme of some sinister intel- ligence bent on punishing him."92 Then as the plot straightened out and a chastened happiness seemed possible for Henchard, Newson re-appeared to play over again the r6le he had played when he purchased Susan. The skimmity ride was only talk over a tavern table until Newson appeared from the outer darkness, overheard the talk, said he did not mind "being something" towards "the old custom you are talking of," threw a sovereign on the table for part of the expenses, and went away. This action is a crisis; it determined the fatal skimmity ride. " 'Well,' said Jopp, 'now we'll consider the busi- ness begun, and will soon get it in train'."93 Though Newson did not stay to see the fun, his connection with it may have been in Hardy's mind when he called it a "Daemonic Sabbath." After a short absence, Newson, "a wanderer and a stranger, almost an alien,"94 returned again to seek Eliza- beth-Jane and tell her that he was alive. After his visit, Henchard was 91 Ix, 12. 92 Ix, 150-151. 1162 93 X, 115. 94 x, 163.</page><page sequence="18">J. O. Bailey desperately determined to keep Elizabeth-Jane. In this desperation, he was tempted to tell Farfrae that his betrothed was nobody's child. This temptation he shook off, saying to himself: " 'Why should I still be sub- ject to these visitations of the devil, . . . ?' "95 Besides Newson's role as an "intruder into his [Michael's] family,"96 as he said, there are other suggestions of the uncanny about him. He seems amoral, in both his own actions and his tolerance of others. Though he knew that Susan did not become his wife because he purchased her, he did not tell her so. His pretense to be drowned was a more active deception. He was equally tolerant toward Henchard's lie that Elizabeth- Jane was dead; he felt no indignation, even though the lie almost sepa- rated him from his daughter forever. "Newson, like a good many rovers and sojourners among strange men and strange moralities, failed to per- ceive the enormity of Henchard's crime, notwithstanding that he himself had been the chief sufferer therefrom."97 The preternatural was suggested when Henchard revisited the place where he had sold Susan; the very spot, he felt, was on a pixy-ring. "It must have been just on that very pixy-ring that she was standing when she said her last words to me before going off with him," he meditated.98 At the end of the novel, Newson had retired from Casterbridge to settle in distant lodgings with a window opening on the sea. Between Newson's first and his second appearance, Henchard's star rose. At its zenith, Donald Farfrae came upon the scene, a wanderer from Scotland on his way to America. He deflected Henchard's course. Had he not appeared, said Hardy, "this history had never been en- acted."99 He had the smartness, charm, and intelligence of Sergeant Troy, though his disposition was a far more candid one. Hardy spoke repeatedly of Farfrae's "brightness of intellect" and of Henchard's "respect ... for his brains.""'0 While he was Henchard's familiar, Henchard prospered, but when Farfrae was driven to become Henchard's rival, Henchard went downhill. Farfrae's luck was as phenomenally good as Diggory Venn's. Like "Jacob in Padan-Aram," he "would no sooner limit himself to the ringstraked-and-spotted exceptions of trade than the ringstraked- and-spotted would multiply and prevail.""10 In discussing this luck, Hardy spoke of Henchard, after Farfrae had left his side, as a kind of Faust without a guide: Henchard "might not inaptly be described as Faust has been described-as a vehement gloomy being who had quitted the ways of vulgar men without light to guide him on a better way."'02 Farfrae's luck was everywhere apparent; as Jopp said, " 'I sometimes think . . . that he must have some glass that he sees next year in'."'03 95 x, 170. 96 x, 176. 97 x, 181. 98 x, 184. 99 ix, 44. 100 ix, 108. m10 ix, 136. 102 IX, 136. 103 x, 22. 1163</page><page sequence="19">Hardy's "Mephistophelian Visitants" As his fortunes rose and Henchard's declined, Henchard felt that "some power was working against him": 'I wonder," he asked himself with eerie misgiving; "I wonder if it can be that somebody has been roasting a waxen image of me, or stirring an unholy brew to confound me." . . . Even then be could not admit that the perpetrator, if any, might be Farfrae.'4 When Henchard's furniture was sold and Farfrae bought it, Henchard, ignorant of Farfrae's intention to return it, exclaimed:" 'Surely he'll buy my body and soul likewise'!"105 This antagonism reached a desperate climax when Henchard lured Farfrae into the loft to fight it out with him. A touch of the lurid about Farfrae on this occasion recalls Hardy's former Mephistophelian visitants: the evening sunlight "caught his head and face when he emerged from the shadow of the wall, warming them to a complexion of flame-colour."l06 When Newson re-appeared, Farfrae's r61e ceased to have any suggetion of the preternatural. Richard Newson's name does not suggest his role; Farfrae's name, on the other hand, suggests one quality of the Mephistophelian visitant, that he comes from afar. Newson and Farfrae are nowhere compared with Mephistopheles, as Henchard is compared with Faust. They are clearly however, Henchard's adversaries, agents of Nemesis for him. Henchard's first name, Michael, seems to have some significance in this connection. In Hardy's manuscript, the mayor was first named James Henchard: "... not until the story was completed to the last page of the manu- script was the mayor's name changed to the now familiar Michael."'07 If Newson and Farfrae may be considered Mephistophelian, their op- ponent might be named Michael-as Oak, opposing Sergeant Troy, was named Gabriel. The connection is not evident enough to label Hardy's scheme, though it might satisfy his feeling for fitness. The suggestions of the preternatural are dim, but they are present. Evidently Hardy was working away from the more literal application of the Mephistophelian pattern he had employed in earlier books. A variation of it occurs in his next novel, The Woodlanders (1886-87). In this novel, Dr. Fitzpiers invaded the "sequestered spot outside the gates of the world" where the action takes place. Several things are noted at once regarding Fitzpiers and his role. First, his character seems modeled upon that of Faust rather than of Mephistopheles. Second, in a novel that ranks in other ways with The Return of the Native, the character of Dr. Fitzpiers is by no means as firmly developed as that of 104 x, 30. 15 x, 72. 106 x, 127. 107 Carl J. Weber, Hardy of Wessex (New York: Columbia University Press, 1940), p. 101. 1164</page><page sequence="20">J. O. Bailey Diggory Venn; beside Marty South, Giles Winterborne, and Grace Melbury, Fitzpiers and his inamorata, Felice Charmond, are paste- board, or as Rutland says, "stilted dummies, cut out with scissors from a vulgar fashion plate."'08 And third, The Woodlanders is the last of Hardy's novels to contain a clearly marked visitant-this time, Faust- like. Coming after The Mayor and before Tess and Jude, The Woodlanders seems out of place in 1886 as far as the artificial handling of Dr. Fitzpiers and his role is concerned. The novel would seem to belong in the series from Under the Greenwood Tree in 1872 to A Laodicean in 1880. There is evidence that, in conception at least, the novel does belong to this series. Mrs. Hardy says that Hardy was writing a woodland tale in 1875, that he laid it aside, and that it "later took shape as The Wood- landers.""9 Rutland conjectures: ... that the original Woodlanders consisted of that part of the story (doubtless incomplete) which is concerned with Giles and Marty; Grace Melbury may well have played the part in this story which she plays now, with slight variants; while Robert Creedle is clearly one of the compeers of Joseph Poorgrass. Such a story Hardy may well have written in part between Far From the Madding Crowd and The Return of the Native.10 Then he goes on to say that "What is, however, quite certain is that Fitzpiers and his part in the plot date from 1885, not 1875.""' He bases this statement upon the fact that Hardy in 1885 was studying philosophy and was pondering ideas of the kind we find in Fitzpiers's studies and attitudes. On the other hand, if Dr. Fitzpiers is removed from the plot, there is little story. As complex as Hardy's plots are, it is hardly conceivable that in 1875 he wrote a version, or part, of The Woodlanders without having someone perform the function in the plot that Fitzpiers does in the published work. A solution to this puzzle may be that the story of 1875 employed a Mephistophelian invader, as other stories of this period did, but that Hardy, in rewriting the story in 1886 while he was reading philosophy, threw out his original invader and substituted a more philo- sophic character modeled on Faust. This solution would explain the firm, penetrating treatment of the other characters in comparison with the superficial, undigested treatment of Dr. Fitzpiers. Dr. Fitzpiers was looked upon as a kind of Faust by the woodlanders. A woman told Percomb that " 'A very clever and learned young doctor lives in the place you be going to-not because there's anybody for'n to 108 op. cit., pp. 211-212. 109 The Early Life of Thomas Hardy, p. 135.

'. "113 from London, and they were delivered to the parson's house. As Cawtree told Melbury, " 'It seems that our new neighbour, this young Doctor What's-his-name, is a strange, deep, perusing gentleman; and there's good reason for supposing he has sold his soul to the wicked one'."14 Grammer Oliver, though she sold Fitzpiers her head for dissection when she should die, saw him as a very queer person: And yet he's a projick, a real projick, and says the oddest of rozums. 'Ah, Grammer,' he said at another time, 'let me tell you that Everything is Nothing. There's only Me and Not Me in the whole world.' And he told me that no man's hands could help what they did, any more than the hands of a clock.... Yes, he's a man of strange meditations, and his eyes seem to see as far as the north star."5 Grace first became aware of him in connection with his strange studies. Unable to sleep, she looked out her window in the dark of the morning and saw a strange light in the house where the doctor lived: " . . . it gradually changed colour, and at length shone blue as sapphire. Thus it remained several minutes, and then it passed through violet to red.""6 When she called on him to try to buy back Grammer's head, he had been examining something under a microscope: " 'That's a fragment of old John South's brain, which I am investigating.""7 In a roundabout way, through prescribing the wrong psychological cure, Dr. Fitzpiers had seemed to cause South's death; how he had got South's head is not explained. Seen in Hardy's description, he looked easily like a modern version of Faust. He was "a finely formed, handsome man. His eyes were dark and impressive.... His face was rather soft than stern, charming than grand . . . his presence bespoke the philosopher rather than the dandy.... 118 He was a rationalist who had an aversion for the church. He objected to going to church even to be married to Grace, saying: I don't see the necessity of going there! ... Marriage is a civil contract, and the 112 xi, 5.-In the serial version, the sentence reads: " 'A very clever and learned young doctor, who, they say, in in league with the devil, lives in the place you be going to- not because there's anybody for'n to cure there, but because 'tis the middle of his district.'" Macmillan's Magazine, LIV (1886), 65. The early book editions follow this text. See the dis- cussion below and footnote 126. This revision, it will be noted, omits the idea that Fitzpiers is an ordinary doctor with a "district." 113 xi, 32.-In the serial version, the phrase reads: " 'certain books on some mysterious science or black-art.'

Bailey shorter and simpler it is made the better. People don't go to church when they take a house, or even when they make a will."' His rather unscrupulous character, in spite of his fine philosophical words, was indicated not only in his desertion of Grace, but also in his casual seduction of Suke Damson. Most Faust-like, however, are his intellectual interests. He was edu- cated at Heidelberg and since then has continued studies that were very strange: In the course of a year his mind was accustomed to pass in a grand solar sweep throughout the zodiac of the intellectual heaven. Sometimes it was in the Ram, sometimes in the Bull; one month he would be immersed in alchemy, another in poesy; one month in the Twins of astrology and astronomy; then in the Crab of German literature and metaphysics.'20 Other oblique allusions to the Faustian story serve to deepen this im- pression. For example, in securing Marty's hair, Percomb played a mildly Mephistophelian r61e; the lure of this hair later attracted Fitzpiers to Mrs. Charmond and acted as a charm in holding him. Percomb's role was suggested in Marty's words: " 'You are tempting me. You go on like the Devil to Doctor Faustus in the penny book'."'12 Grace first ran into Fitzpiers's arms on the occasion when she and the village girls performed woodland rites in the hope of seeing their future husbands. The girls were tremulous with half-fearful excitement: " 'It is too much like having dealings with the evil one to try to raise their forms'."122 When Mrs. Charmond's Italianized former lover appeared, carrying an umbrella, the girls were sure that "'We saw Satan pursuing us with his hour- glass'."123 They ran, Grace straight into Fitzpiers's waiting arms. It is thus suggested, at least, that Satan had something to do with bringing them together. The r61e Dr. Fitzpiers played depended upon the fascination he exer- cised over Grace, and then upon his emotional unrest. It was settled that Grace would marry Giles, until, drawn by loneliness and extraordinarily complex passions-hunger for experience, hunger for beauty, and sexual hunger that was not satisfied by Suke-Fitzpiers invaded the scene and married Grace. But he was unable to be limited to domestic life; he de- serted Grace for Mrs. Charmond and followed her to Europe. Grace then returned to her "normal" orbit and desired a divorce so that she might marry Giles. At this point, Dr. Fitzpiers, like the other visitants, re- turned. Gradually, after Giles's death, Grace was reconciled to her husband. But final reconciliation depended upon his abandoning those abstruse studies that may be thought of as Faustian: " 'I wish you would 119 xi, 201. 120 xi, 148. 121 xI, 10. 22 xI, 176. 123 XI, 182. 1167</page><page sequence="23">Hardy's "Mephistophelian Visitants" . . . give up'," she said, " 'those strange studies that used to distract you so much'."124 Ie agreed to do so, asked her to make a bonfire of his books, and became reconciled-for the time. Apparently the novel has a happy ending for Grace and Dr. Fitzpiers, as The Return of the Native has for Thomasin and Diggory. But if Hardy constructed Dr. Fitzpiers on the archetype of Faust, this ending is a violation of an austere artistic code, just as the ending of The Return of the Native is. As a matter of fact, Hardy wrote the happy ending to please his readers in Macmillan's Magazine, but he wished the more perspica- cious among them to understand that it was not Dr. Fitzpiers's nature to remain content with Grace longer than it took him to look across the fence. In a copy of The Woodlanders in which Hardy wrote "Yours faith- fully, Thomas Hardy" for Miss Rebekah Owen, Miss Owen wrote a record of a conversation with Hardy on this point: He further said that he did not make the end as clear as he should have done and perhaps would do in a revised edition. He found that people (I among them) do not see that he means that Fitzpiers goes on all his life in his bad way, and that in returning to him Grace meets her retribution "for not sticking to Giles." Her father hints at it in one sentence, or forebodes it, but the matter is not made manifest.l25 The "sentence" of which Miss Owen wrote is not in the serial version of the novel or in the first book edition. But in the second edition (August, 1887), Hardy added: " 'Well-he's her husband,' Melbury said to him- self, 'and let her take him back to her bed if she will! It's a'forlorn hope for her; and God knows how it will end!' " Still apprehensive that his meaning might be misunderstood, Hardy, in 1895, added another sen- tence, inserted between the two preceding sentences: " 'But let her bear in mind that the woman walks and laughs somewhere at this very moment whose neck he'll be coling [sic] next year as he does hers tonight; and as he did Felice Charmond's last year; and Suke Damson's the year afore!' "126 That intelligent readers should understand this point was apparently of great importance to Hardy. About July, 1889, J. T. Grein asked Hardy for permission to adapt the novel for the theatre. In his reply, granting permission,127 Hardy wrote: You have probably observed that the ending of the story-hinted rather than stated-is that the heroine is doomed to an unhappy life with an inconstant hus- 124 x, 200. 126 See Carl J. Weber, "Hardy and The Woodlanders," Review of English Studies, xv (1939), 332. Miss Owen's copy of the book is now in the Library of Colby College. 126 xii, 225. See footnote 112 and Carl J.

Bailey band. I could not accentuate this strongly in the book, by reason of the conven- tions of the libraries, etc. Since the story was written, however, truth to character is not considered quite such a crime in literature as it was formerly; and it is therefore a question for you whether you will accent this ending, or prefer to obscure it.128 If Hardy thought of Dr. Fitzpiers as only a man, and at that, one whose character was rather inconsistently set forth (as surely Hardy was aware), what does it matter whether he reformed after the action of the novel was over? But if Hardy thought of him as a Faustian visitant, the point is important as a key to understanding the character. Hardy's in- serted sentences are analogous to the "grim note" in The Return of the Native. After The Woodlanders Hardy abandoned the device of the Mephis- tophelian (or Faustian) visitant in his novels.'29 For some time, however, 128 Hardy, The Early Life of Thomas Hardy, p. 289.-Had much change taken place in the British attitude toward the conventions in two years, between 1887 and 1889, or was the change in Hardy's own attitude as he was working on Tess? 129 It would be far-fetched, I believe, to regard Alec in Tess of the D'Urbervilles (1891) as a Mephistophelian visitant. It is true that he was an outsider, that he changed the normal course of Tess's life, and that when he appeared beside Tess in her garden, he called her Eve and himself " 'the old Other One come to tempt you in the disguise of an inferior animal.' "II, 210. But these features are by no means worked out here. The character of Wat Ollamoor in "The Fiddler of the Reels" (1893) exercised over Car'line Aspent a hypnotic power like that of Baron Von Xanten over Margery; he was an un-English visitant who had never entered a church, and he certainly changed Car'line's life. There are even suggestions of supernatural phenomena, as when she saw his form in a mirror and turned to find that he was not there. But his power over her resided in his fiddle and in her inability to keep her feet from dancing when he played. He was not other- wise like the Mephistophelian visitants. Vilbert in Jude the Obscure (1894-95) can hardly be called a Mephistophelian visitant, but he is clearly related to this tribe. As itinerant peddler of pills and nostrums, he came into the novel now and then, each time with a suggestion that affected a crisis. When Arabella had seduced Jude in expectation that she would become pregnant and that Jude would marry her to save her "honor," she was at her wit's end because she did not become pregnant. "One day she met the itinerant Vilbert ... and she began telling him her ex- periences. .. before he left her she had grown brighter. That evening she kept an appoint- ment with Jude, who seemed sad." (v, 65.) At this appointment she made use of the sugges- tion the clever Vilbert had given her; apparently she lied about her condition, and Jude changed his plan for going away and married Arabella. (This advice to tell a lie resembles Mrs. Endorfield's advice to Fancy.) Vilbert disappeared until Jude and Sue visited the Wessex Agricultural Fair at the height of their happiness. There Arabella, though married to Cartlett, was jealous of Sue, and Vilbert perceived it. He sold her a love-philtre. Again he disappeared. In her second seduction of Jude, Arabella did not, of course, use the silly philtre, but she did use something for which the philtre seems a kind of analogue-alcohol. Then, as if Hardy wished to make this analogy clear, Arabella poured the philtre into a glass of wine and gave it to Vilbert when Jude had chased him from the sick-room. As Jude died, Arabella watched the races with Vilbert's arm around her waist. 1169</page><page sequence="25">Hardy's "Mephistophelian Visitants" he had been meditating the treatment of the Napoleonic wars that he later published as The Dynasts, and he had made various outline schemes for this drama. Shortly after completing The Woodlanders, he meditated using something like a Mephistophelian visitant-perhaps in place of the later Phantom Intelligences-to bring Napoleon to his ruin. Commenting on his activities in November, 1887, Mrs. Hardy writes: "Another outline scheme for The Dynasts was shaped in November, in which Napoleon was represented as haunted by an Evil Genius or Familiar, whose existence he has to confess to his wives." But she adds: "This was abandoned.'"30 On the other hand, various critics have pointed out that some of the Phantom Intelligences seem to be Mephistophelian in origin, characteris- tics, or functions. Barker Fairley, for example, says that "The Spirit of the Years, the critic of the Overworld, is a close analogy to Heaven's commentator, [Goethe's] Mephistopheles."'13 Later he compares Mephis- topheles's comments on "the futility of it all, the endless circle, creation and decay" with "the wail of the Pities over the corpse of Nelson, their censure of the Will, 'Why make Life debtor when it did not buy?' and the reply of the Years, a more enlightened Mephistopheles."'32 John Livingston Lowes calls both Spirits Sinister and Ironic "mocking Mephis- tophelian Voices."'33 W. R. Rutland speaks of the Spirit Sinister "as a grimmer and more cynical Spirit Ironic." Commenting on the passage in which the obstreperousness of the Spirit Sinister goads the Spirit of the Years to call him "Thou Iago of the incorporeal world,"'34 Rutland asks: "Was the Spirit Sinister suggested to Hardy by Mephistopheles in Goethe's Faust? . .. the Spirit Sinister has just the tone of Mephisto in his lighter moods.... ".13 Aside from these varied suggestions, do any of the Phantom Intelli- gences play roles similar to that of the Mephistophelian visitants in the novels? To perform the function of interfering with the "normal" course of events is a little difficult for the Phantoms, because they are outside the human drama and view it as spectators, and because the human drama is manipulated by the Immanent Will anyway. And yet there are several suggestions that Hardy may have thought of his old device of 1872-1886 as he worked out The Dynasts. Hardy's statement about the Spirits of the drama invites the reader to discern what these Spirits signify. He says in his Preface: 130 The Early Life of Thomas Hardy, p. 266. 131 "Notes on the Form of The Dynasts," PMLA, xxxiv (n.s., xxvII, 1919), 408. 132 Ibid., p. 413. 133 "Two Readings of Earth," Yale Review, n. s. xv (1926), 524. 134 lago in the first edition was changed to Dragon in the "authorized edition." 13" Op. cit., p. 341. 1170</page><page sequence="26">J. 0. Bailey It was thought proper to introduce, as supernatural spectators of the terrestrial action, certain impersonated abstractions, or Intelligences, called Spirits. They are intended to be taken by the reader for what they may be worth as contriv- ances of the fancy merely.... These phantasmal Intelligences are divided into groups, of which one only, that of the Pities, approximates to "the universal Sympathy of human nature-the spectator idealized" of the Greek Chorus; . . . Another group approximates to the passionless Insight of the Ages. The remainder are eclectically chosen auxiliaries whose signification may be readily discerned.136 Several general observations may be made. All the Spirits serve ex- pository and interpretative functions in commenting on the scenes of the human action. All are limited in their activities by the Immanent Will; as the Spirit of the Years says: "ITS slaves we are: Its slaves must ever be!"137 Under this limitation we are to understand, I think, that anything any Spirit does to affect the human action is only an illusion. Yet, es- pecially in Part I, the Spirits do make efforts to turn the action with some illusion of success; in Parts II and III, this function seems held in check, as communications with mortals are less effective in altering their actions. Within these limitations, however, the Spirits do invade the human drama. Three of them resemble three aspects of the Mephistophelian visitant of the novels: the spirit Sinister as Satan or the Satanic aspect; the Spirit Ironic as his agent, a mocking Mephistopheles; and the Spirit of Rumour as a means of communication between the Spirits and mortals. These Spirits have, of course, their respective choruses. A relationship of The Dynasts to the Book of Job is obvious. In the first chapter of Job, the Lord agrees to bring disaster upon Job. The Lord says to Satan: "Behold, all that he hath is in thy power," but He adds: "only upon himself put not forth thine hand." The will of the Lord, Who has yielded to Satan's plea, allows disasters to fall upon Job. Satan may enjoy only the illusion that he brings them about. This situation is paralleled in the limitations of Hardy's Spirit Sinister. The elder Spirit of the Years tells the "fond unbelieving Sprites," especially the Pities, who would like to influence the Will for man's good, that they cannot "swerve the pulsion of the Byss." On this, the Spirit Sinister comments: "Good, as before, / My little engines, then, will still have play."138 That is, the Spirit Sinister does not need to lay hands upon man, for Its dream will produce the evil designs that lie in the Spirit Sinister's mind. In fact Its dreams produce designs so pleasing to the Spirit Sinister that this Spirit lays claim to them and has to be reminded by the Years that they are not his: 136 xxxi, vi-vii. 137 xxxI, 181.-I am disregarding Hardy's italics for the speeches of the Spirits. 138 xxxI, 8. 1171</page><page sequence="27">Hardy's "Mephistophelian Visitants" SPIRIT SINISTER Ay; begin small, and so lead up to the greater.

Thinking thou will'st, thou dost but indicate.l39 The failure of George III to respond to Napoleon's peaceful overtures is the first critical action in the play; if George had responded placatingly, it is implied, there would have been no Napoleonic wars. Though he has just been rebuked for claiming power to bring about evil himself, the Spirit Sinister cannot refrain from assuming some credit for this fateful decision; the Will brought it about because the Spirit Sinister "paean'd" It: SPIRIT SINISTER I saw good sport therein, and paean'd the Will For leaving lax so stultifying a move! Which would have marred the European broil, And sheathed all swords, and silenced every gun That furrows human flesh.'40 After the Spirit Sinister has made some gloating comments about events on earth that are going his way, the Spirit of the Years turns to him with the wish that It would enchain the Spirit Sinister. What the Spirit of the Years says identifies the Spirit Sinister as the one told of in "A grim terrestrial tale" and as the Spirit of absolute evil, that is, as Satan: SPIRIT OF THE YEARS 0 would that I could move It to enchain thee, And shut thee up a thousand years!-(to cite A grim terrestrial tale of one thy like) Thou Dragon of the Incorporeal World, "As they would say below there."'14 The Spirit Sinister has a companion, listed in the bracket with him in the cast of characters, the Spirit Ironic. This fellow does not claim to be an author of evil, but, like Mephistopheles, he is a mocker and rationalis- 19 xxxI, 16. 140 xxxi, 21.-The passage as quoted here suggests that the Spirit Sinister praised the decision rather than sought to influence it.

When the Spirit of the Pities is emotionally upset by the grim spectacle of Universal Will, and the Spirit of the Years speaks cold comfort, "Affection ever was illogical," the Spirit Ironic in a cynical aside mocks this emotion and includes a reference to its appearance in the process of evolution: SPIRIT IRONIC (aside) How should the Sprite own to such logic-a mere juvenile-who only came into being in what the earthlings call their Tertiary Age!L4 As a rationalist, he must agree with even the Spirit of the Pities when he speaks of the "intolerable antilogy / Of making figments feel." The Spirit Ironic says: "Logic's in that. It does not, I must own, quite play the game."'43 Once this frivolous jester at all things clashes slightly with the serious Spirit Sinister, who fears that mockery too blatant may shock the Will into awareness and so ruin his schemes: SPIRIT IRONIC ... The groping tentativeness of an Immanent Will (as grey old Years describes it) cannot be asked to learn logic at this time of day! The spectacle of Its instru- ments, set to riddle one another through, and then to drink together in peace and concord, is where the humour comes in, and makes the play worth seeing! SPIRIT SINISTER Come, Sprite, don't carry your ironies too far, or you may wake up the Uncon- scious Itself, and tempt It to let all the gory clock-work of the show run down to spite me!'44 The scientific basis for the rationalism of the Spirit Ironic is clear in his mockery of the Spirit of the Pities for wishing he might pray "To some Great Heart, to take away / This'evil day, this evil day!" The Spirit Ironic replies: Ha-ha! That's good. Thou'lt pray to It:- But where do Its compassions sit? Yea, where abides the heart of It? Is it where sky-fires flame and flit, Or solar craters spew and spit, Or ultra-stellar night-webs knit? What is Its shape! Man's counterfeit? That turns in some far sphere unlit The wheel which drives the Infinite?145 The Spirit Ironic mocks all human emotion. The Spirit of the Pities observes the gloomy faces at the Prince Regent's banquet and supposes 141 xxxI, 51. l4 xxxI, 103. 44 xxx, 140. 16 xxxn, 220. 1173</page><page sequence="29">Hardy's "Mephistophelian Visitants" that the guests may be thinking of the sick king imprisoned at Windsor. To this the Spirit Ironic says: "My dear phantom and crony, the gloom upon their faces is due rather to their having borrowed those diamonds at eleven per cent than to their loyalty to a suffering monarch."'46 He mocks also the idea that the dead may live again. When the Spirit of the Pities imagines, at Waterloo, that he hears the remonstrances of the dead: SPIRIT IRONIC Mere fancy's feints! How know the coffined what comes after them, Even though it whirl them to the Pleiades?- Turn to the real.147 The Spirits Sinister and Ironic make efforts to influence human action. When the Spirits of the Pities and of the Years agree to visit the debate in the English Parliament, in the guise of men, so that the Years may come to feel some sympathy for men, the Spirits Ironic and Sinister horn in to say that they will go, too, on the chance that the business will turn their way: SPIRIT IRONIC .. .I'll be the third of the incarnate, on the chance of hearing the tune played the other way.148 SPIRIT SINISTER And I the fourth. There's sure to be something in my line toward, where politi- cians are gathered together!49 They enter the Gallery of the House "in the disguise of ordinary strangers" and apparently join in the applause of the "Ironical Op- position."

Did not my clouded soul incline to match Those of the corpses yonder, thou should'st rue Thy saying, Fiend, whoever thou may'st be!'51 Ordinarily, however, the Spirits attempt to influence human action through the Spirit of Rumout and the other Rumours. The Spirit Ironic, for example, to spread discord at the Prince Regent's banquet, sends the Spirit of Rumour to scatter whispers through the assemblage. This time the Spirit of Rumour does not incarnate himself, but appears only as whispers of news up and down the table. A little later in the same scene the Spirit Ironic has his "Messengers" (presumably still the Rumours) call aloud in the voices of the Princess and of Mrs. Fitzherbert, who are not supposed to be present, to torment the Prince Regent, until the Spirit of the Years commands the Spirit Ironic to cease his "antics."'52 The Spirit of Rumour and his aides are, however, mischief-makers of their own accord, though apparently they are subordinate characters who have to have permission of the major Intelligences before they can act. When Napoleon has been crowned in Italy, but the news has not yet reached England, the Spirit of Rumour asks permission to spread the news among personages of fashion gathered in the house of a lady of Quality: SPIRIT OF RUMOUR Bid me go And join them, and all blandly kindle them By bringing, ere material transit can, A new surprise! SPIRIT OF THE YEARS Yea, for a moment, wouldst. With this permission, the Spirit of Rumour enters the group in disguise. Various persons feel that they know him and that he belongs there, though they disagree about who he is: " 'Why, Norton. You know Norton well enough?' . . . 'Nay, 'twas not he. Norton of course I know. I thought him Stewart for a moment, but-' " and so on.'53 When it is rumored 1175 '50 xxxnI, 192. 151 xxxI, 261. 162 XXXII, 236, passim. 158 xxxI, 42-43.</page><page sequence="31">Hardy's "Mephistophelian Visitants" that Napoleon has landed in southern England, two Phantoms of Rumour, at a "signal from the Chief Intelligences," enter the highway in the garb of countrymen and accost various pedestrians with the counter- acting rumor that Napoleon has not landed-as he has not. But they are unable to stem the panic.154 The Spirit of Rumour and his companions in this way serve the other Spirits to spread "good" rumors.l15 Apparently it makes no difference what kind of rumors they spread or what the effect may be.'5 That a compound of the Spirits Sinister, Ironic, and of Rumour has some resemblance to the Mephistophelian visitant of the novels seems fairly clear. Perhaps Hardy discarded the "Evil Genius or Familiar" he thought of in 1887, in favor of the scheme of a drama to illustrate the "pulsion of the Byss," but carried over into the new scheme something from the old. The "antilogy" of having causation both (1) automatic and (2) an illusion that it is the work of good and evil Spirits yields a com- plex result. In this connection, we may wonder whether the "good" Spirits, as well as the "evil," are not part of the concept of Mephisto- phelian visitant. Hardy was a monist; his Immanent Will impels the "evil" Spirits and the "good" alike. Patience like that of the Spirit of the Years and compassion like that of the Spirit of the Pities are promi- nent traits in Diggory Venn. Though Hardy's Mephistophelian visitants differ from one another in many ways, they have many common qualities. The most prominent is "the subversive Mephistophelian endowment, brains." Mrs Endorfield is a "deep body"; Sergeant Troy is a ready linguist and a brilliant wit; Diggory is quietly intelligent; William Dare is a prodigy of learning; Von Xanten seems to have superior intelligence; Farfrae's brains are played against Henchard's brawn; Dr. Fitzpiers is a scholar with a pas- sion for occult as well as scientific and poetic learning; and the Spirit Ironic is a rationalist versed in science. That Hardy thought of Mephis- topheles as a shrewd schemer is clear in The Hand of Ethelberta, where he says that "Lord Mountclere looked ... shrewd enough in his own opin- ion to outwit Mephistopheles."'57 Mrs. Endorfield suggests the clever strategy that saves Fancy; Troy gains Bathsheba's hand by the strata- gem of making her jealous; Diggory maps out and executes a whole campaign to frustrate Wildeve; William Dare practises a dozen or more clever stratagems, such as that of altering Somerset's photograph to 164 xxxi, 74-76. 16 See Pt. I, Act vI, Scene vii, an entire scene in which the Spirit of Rumour acts in the disguise of a young foreigner at the bidding of the Spirit of the Years. 16 The "good" Spirits also communicate directly with mortals just as the Spirits Sinister and Ironic do. 1" xxvi, 123. 1176</page><page sequence="32">J. O. Bailey make him seem a profligate; Von Xanten marries Margery to Hayward by stratagem; Farfrae succeeds by being coolly rational where Henchard is impulsively passionate; Dr. Fitzpiers schemes to have Grace run into his arms; and the Spirit Ironic sends the Rumours among men to confuse them. They do not mind lying. Mrs. Endorfield advises Fancy to act out a lie; Troy is never truthful toward women; Diggory conceals the truth from Thomasin; William Dare lies constantly; Von Xanten's stratagem is a deception; Newson deceives Susan for good ends, but feels no resent- ment when Henchard deceives him for bad ends; Dr. Fitzpiers lies to Grace about going to see Mrs. Charmond; and the Spirits Ironic and of Rumour spread false rumors. They have a mocking attitude. Mrs. Endorfield looks at Fancy with an expression of sinister humor; Troy mocks Boldwood by taking his money and then triumphantly throwing it into the road; in the gambling scene Diggory mocks Wildeve by repeat- ing to him what he had said to Christian; Dare leers with up-cocked eye; Newson throws down money for the skimmity ride because it will be sport; the Spirit Ironic jeers till even the Spirit Sinister shuts him up; but Dr. Fitzpiers, more Faustian than Mephistophelian, mocks only such things as simple faith and the church. They are all sceptics; they do not go to church. Mrs. Endorfield never attends church; Gabriel proves that Troy lied when he said that he sat in the gallery; apparently Diggory does not go to church; Dare would be inconceivable in church; Von Xanten apparently does not attend church; nothing is said about Newson and Farfrae in church; Fitzpiers objects to being married in church; and the Spirit Ironic is irreverent even toward the Will. Troy, Diggory, and Dare are gamblers; Troy spends his wife's money on the races; Diggory pivots his plan on winning a game of dice; and Dare constantly cons a "Book of Chances" and, working out a system, wins a bagful of money at Monte Carlo. Mrs. Endorfield, Troy, and Diggory wear red; strange fires reflect from Von Xanten's face and burn in his eyes; Newson and Farfrae are seen in lurid lights; Grace watches the lurid colors of Dr. Fitzpiers's laboratory. In some manner, Mrs. Endorfield knew all about Fancy's affairs; Diggory and Dare engage in spying and prying. All are outsiders, though Mrs. Endorfield is so only because she holds aloof and Diggory only as an itinerant. The suggestions of bastardy in Troy and Dare may belong to Hardy's conception of a villain, as in the archetype Manston of Desperate Remedies, rather than to anything Mephisto- phelian. The preceding data are not external evidence that Hardy contemplated the Mephistophelian design as a structural device. His note to provide Napoleon with an "Evil Genius or Familiar" is striking, but not conclu- sive. Perhaps Hardy simply created villains, and perhaps he gave them 1177</page><page sequence="33">Hardy's "Mephistophelian Visitants" Satanic traits and used the word "Mephistopheles" in reference to some of them only to color their villainy. After all, the Satanic traits of these characters are only suggested. There is nothing necessarily preternatural, for instance, about Diggory's luck in gambling on the heath, even when Wildeve's ace is followed by a zero. But, as Chew points out, "The dicing scene... might have been worked out to the same conclusion and with the same bearing upon the course of events, without such extraordinary fluctuations of fortune."158 Then why did Hardy suggest the preternatural in so many ways? First, he was interested in writing good, popular stories. He defined good fiction "as that kind of imaginative writing which lies nearest to the epic, dramatic, or narrative masterpieces of the past."'59 Among the notes he jotted down in July, 1881, he stated that the "purpose of fiction is to give pleasure by gratifying the love of the uncommon in human experience," and that "The writer's problem is how to strike the balance between the uncommon and the ordinary so as ... ;o give reality."1?0 This device of the Mephistophelian visitant lies near to a technique in epic, dramatic, and narrative masterpieces of the past; it gratifies the love of the uncommon in human experience, and it disguises the uncom- mon in characters that are human enough to give reality. Second, it seems that the device of the Mephistophelian visitant de- veloped in a natural way. Perhaps it was not connected with any idea of Mephistopheles in Under the Greenwood Tree; Mrs. Endorfield seems drawn from folk-lore and a source suggested below. Her scarlet jacket is just a flash of suggestive color. Functionally, she is simply "common sense" from outside the story, needed to turn the crisis. Perhaps the idea of Sergeant Troy in his scarlet coat developed from Hardy's vision of Mrs. Endorfield's scarlet jacket, but perhaps, as he worked on the character of Troy, he saw deeper possibilities and-without necessarily thinking of Mephistopheles at all-developed him as "the impersonator of Heaven's persistent irony." But it is difficult to believe that when he created Diggory Venn and William Dare and in connection with these characters used the words "Mephistophelian visitants" and "Mephis- topheles," he did not see the parallelism with the medieval character and make conscious use of it. His creating Dr. Fitzpiers somewhat in the like- ness of a modernized Dr. Faustus seems almost proof. Third, once he had got the idea, perhaps he found it a useful way to suggest that the spiritual forces formerly symbolized as Vices, Satan, 158 Samuel C. Chew, Thomas Hardy, Poet and Novelist (New York: Knopf, 1928), p. 85. 159 Thomas Hardy, "The Profitable Reading of Fiction" (1888), in Life and Art (New York: Greenberg, Inc., 1925). 160 Hardy, The Early Life of Thomas Hardy, pp. 193-194. 1178</page><page sequence="34">J. O. Bailey and Mephistopheles are still operative, even though they operate through human beings. The Mephistophelian visitant, in so far as he is this symbol from old legend, is taken over from an anthropomorphic, dualistic religious creed Hardy had discarded. But Hardy, though a monist, constantly used the terms God and Satan. His monism is apparent in the fact that sometimes God and Satan ap- pear to change places-as when Heaven is charged with irony, satire, or other malevolence-or to merge into the It of Hardy's Dynasts. This fact may explain how it is that virtuous, long-suffering, generous Diggory Venn may be identified as a Mephistophelian visitant. His good qualities are not inconsistent with his Mephistophelian qualities if he is the agent of a Satan who is also God and Who does not know the difference between good and evil. In a letter to Alfred Noyes, Hardy stated just this view: ... my sober opinion ... of the Cause of Things [is] ... that the said Cause is neither moral nor immoral, but unmoral: 'loveless and hateless' I have called it, 'which neither good nor evil knows."' This "sober opinion" explains how Hardy was able to suggest that one of his most admirable characters wore the livery of Satan. It remains to examine the sources for Hardy's Mephistophelian visi- tants. These sources are probably not simple. His debt to sensational novels is well known; Chamberlin notes the frequent presence of a "mysterious stranger" in popular fiction of the years 1840-1880.162 Weber has pointed out Hardy's fondness for the novels of Ainsworth,'63 and Chew says that William Dare "is of a type associated with the 'Gothic' novel."'64 No doubt some qualities of Hardy's Mephistophelian visitants derive from these sources, including his own first-published Desperate Remedies with its debt to the school of Wilkie Collins. Ruth Firor has pointed out that Hardy used folk-lore in a deeply imaginative way. Donald Davidson has written of Hardy's debt to bal- lads "where devils, demons, fairies, and mermaids intervene in human affairs."'65 He traced Sergeant Troy to "any number of later ballads" portraying intruding soldiers. Rutland says that "the consultation of Mrs. Endorfield by Fancy can be paralleled in the poems of Barnes."'66 161 Florence Emily Hardy, The Later Years of Thomas Hardy, 1892-1928 (New York: The Macmillan Co., 1930), p. 217. 162 Jo Hubbard Chamberlin, Thomas Hardy-The Influence of the Popular Sensational Novel, 1840-1880, Upon His Earlier Works (M.

Hardy records that "My father when a boy- chorister in the gallery of the church used to see her, an old and lonely widow, walking in the garden in a red cloak,"'67 and that "old Billy C- ... used to talk enthusiastically of Lady Susan O'Brien."'68 Her name Strangways, her aloofness, her walking in the garden while others were in church, her red cloak, and, presumably, the fact that she was superior in education to most of the inhabitants of Stinsford, all suggest that she may be the original of the portrait-if not the action-of Mrs. Endorfield.169 And Mrs. Endorfield, it would seem, was the archetype of the whole group of visitants. The specifically Mephistophelian traits of Hardy's visitants are equally difficult to localize in one source. One thinks immediately of Marlowe and Goethe, but Hardy's characters do not clearly resemble the Mephis- topheles of these authors. A possible source for some characteristics of Hardy's Mephistophelian visitants is the ancient Mummers' Play, or Play of St. George. In The Return of the Native, where Diggory Venn appears as the most striking of these visitants, a performance of the Mummers' Play is an important feature of the action. Some eighteen lines of the Play are printed in snatches, and the action between snatches is summarized. Not so well known is Hardy's full version of this Play "As aforetime acted by the Dorsetshire Christmas Mummers," privately printed by Mrs. Hardy in 1921 in an edition limited to twenty-five copies. In a letter to Professor Roger Loomis, granting permission to reprint this version, Hardy says that he "managed to concoct" it from "memories of it as acted in my boyhood."'70 This version does not include the Devil, Beelzebub, or Dragon found in various other versions, though it is possible that Hardy saw plays containing these typical characters. In Hardy's version (as in most) the action concerns a series of invaders who enter to challenge the hero: the Turkish Knight enters to challenge the Valiant Soldier and defeats him; Saint George enters to challenge the Turkish Knight and 167 Hardy, The Early Life of Thomas Hardy, p. 13. 168 Ibid., p. 213. 169 This conjecture is given collateral support by the fact that, according to Hardy's friend and student, Rebekah Owen, Lady Susan was the original for the dead Lady Elfride in A Pair of Blue Eyes. This novel began serial publication in the same year (1872) Under the Greenwood Tree was published. See Carl J. Weber, Rebekah Owen and Thomas Hardy (Colby College Monograph No. 8, Waterville, Maine: Colby College Library, 1939), p. 57. 170 Roger S. Loomis, ed., The Play of St. George, by Thomas Hardy (New York: Samuel French, 1928), p. 7. 1180</page><page sequence="36">J. O. Bailey defeats him; then the Saracen enters to challenge Saint George, who cuts off the Saracen's head. A Doctor who comes from the ancient countries of Asia and "Afric-ay" then enters to raise the dead with his magic draught. In this stylized folk-drama, especially in more elaborate versions than Hardy was able to "concoct" from memory in 1921, several items parallel characteristics of his Mephistophelian visitants. The first invading antagonist in Hardy's version, the Turkish Knight, is identified in some versions as the "Black Prince of Paradise"; in a version from north Somerset, he is called the "Black Prince of Darkness" who was "born in a fiery hole." Various versions call him a "black dog."'17 In Far from the Madding Crowd, "the devil smiled from a loop-hole in Tophet" when Troy's guile began to succeed; later, Boldwood calls Troy a "black hound." The Valiant Soldier of Hardy's version is, in other versions, called Beau Slasher, Bold Slaughterer, and Captain Slasher; in a general way, he suggests Sergeant Troy. Hardy could have got the idea for Troy's amazing sword exercise from the Sword Dance, related to the Mummers' Play. In Hardy's version, no character is dressed in red, but in other versions, various characters were reddened, at least in the face. "Beelzebub had a red mask at Ballybrennan, and the Fool's face, too, may be ruddled."172 The Doctor of Hardy's version comes from Asia and Africa, but in other versions he is from: Italy, Sicily, Germany, France, and Spain, Three times round the world and back again.173 Though William Dare's travels are left vague, he quotes proverbs of Italy, Germany, France, and Spain. In some of the versions collected by Tiddy, Beelzebub is a personage of indeterminate age, sometimes a jolly old man, sometimes a young man, and sometimes, as in the version from Longborough, Gloucestershire, a "clever young old man."'74 Wil- liam Dare is presented as an ingenious fellow who seems both old and young. In these ways, Hardy's fresh memories of the Mummers' Play, that he continued to remember well enough to write out a version in 1921, could have influenced his concept of Mephistophelian visitant. Another source for Hardy's generalized figure is, I think, the penny books and the puppet plays that Hardy mentions constantly. Hardy liked circuses all his life, and especially in his forties "attended all that came to Dorchester."'76 He describes a circus in Far from the Madding 171 See E. K. Chambers, The English Folk-Play (Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1933), p. 28. 17 Ibid., p. 85. 173 Ibid., p. 8. 174 See R. J. E.

Surely Hardy saw at circuses a great many puppet shows and, perhaps, purchased various of the penny books.'76 In The Woodlanders, Marty South's statement to Mr. Percomb, "You go on like the Devil to Doctor Faustus in the penny book," suggests that it was common in "Wessex" to know the books about Faustus hawked at fairs.177 If references in Hardy's works may be trusted, the puppet shows he had in mind por- trayed Vices, Devils, and Mephistopheles in fiery red. When Diggory appears on Rainbarrow, Timothy speaks of him as a "fiery mommet," or puppet-Devil in red such as Timothy might have seen at a circus. Hardy's references to puppet shows indicate that he watched them with close attention. In A Pair of Blue Eyes, he speaks of the "Punch- and-Judy air and countenance" of Swancourt, Elfride, and Knight as they come aboard a ship.178 In The Hand of Ethelberta, he speaks of Lord Mountclere's body as so frail that "what was going on inside might often be guessed without by the movement of the hangings, as in a puppet- show with worn canvas.... "179 Winterborne is described as standing in front of an oven "stirring about the blazing mass with a long-handled, three-pronged Beelzebub kind of fork,"'80 an image that, I should say, came to mind because it had been seen. In Tess of the D'Urbervilles, Hardy describes the herons standing in the water and watching Angel and Tess "by moving their heads round in a slow, horizontal, passionless wheel, like the turn of puppets by clockwork."'18 Besides these evidences that Hardy knew well the puppet-plays and penny books of the fairs, there is an incident in the Spies Faust Book and in A Laodicean that is not in Marlowe or Goethe. It is possible, of course, that Hardy invented the incident, but it is also possible that he got it from the Spies Faust Book or from some puppet-play or penny book that stemmed from the original legend. Dr. Faustus charms a great castle into existence for the Duke of Anholt, and then when the Duke has gone to his own castle, he looks back at Faustus's handiwork: ... and behold it was all in a flame of fire, and all those that beheld it wondred 176 The term may include the books of words for the toy theatres. See A. E. Wilson, Penny Plain Two Pence Coloured (London: George G. Harrap &amp; Co., 1932) for a description of the toy theatres. 177 One version of a Doctor Faustus for the puppet theatre, published in English in 1850, is given in Paul McPharlin, A Repertory of Marionette Plays (New York: The Viking Press, 1929), pp. 209-241. Two other versions in English, printed in 1847 and in 1887, are listed on p. 341. I suppose it is impossible to find out what particular versions Hardy might have seen at "Wessex" circuses or fairs or in London. 178 xvIn, 118. 179 xxvi, 121. 180 xI, 83. 181 I, 175. 1182</page><page sequence="38">J. O. Bailey to heare so great a noyse, as if it were great Ordinance should haue been shot off; and thus the Castle burned and consumed away cleane.182 With no apparent purpose, after the essential action of the story is over, William Dare burns De Stancy Castle, and Paula and Somerset watch it burn from a window of an inn some miles away, a blazing bonfire of smoke and flame. Even at a distance of miles, "Somerset fancied he could hear the crackling."183 Probably Hardy was also acquainted with the Vices or Devils of Renaissance drama and especially with the Mephistopheles of Marlowe. His biographers speak of his wide acquaintance with Renaissance drama. His debt to Shakespeare is very extensive; Weber's Hardy of Wessex lists more than a hundred Shakespearean quotations and echoes.184 Anderson has pointed out that, for a critical scene in The Return of the Native, Hardy turned to a scene in Webster's The White Devil and imitated it.185 Hardy does not refer specifically to Marlowe's Dr. Faustus, but the motto for Chapter III of A Pair of Blue Eyes, "Melodious birds sing madrigals," is from Marlowe's "The Passionate Shepherd to His Love." It seems reasonable, then, to assume that Hardy did know Dr. Faustus. Probably he was acquainted with Goethe's Faust, at least in English translation, quite early in his career as a novelist; and it seems certain that he had studied Faust carefully, perhaps in English, by the time he wrote The Dynasts.'8 His notebook for December 31, 1887, states: "Books read or pieces looked at this year: Milton, Dante, Calderon, Goethe . . . "-Goethe, most likely, in English. His "Candour in English Fiction" (1890) includes a footnote reference to Faust as one of several 182 P. M.

Anderson, "Hardy's Debt to Webster in The Return of the Native," MLN, LIV (1939), 497-501. 186 Probably Hardy did not read Faust in German, early or late, with any appreciation. At fifteen, "he attempted to teach himself German by subscribing to Cassell's Popular Educator," but he was doing so many other things at the time that he did not get very far with his German. Weber, Hardy of Wessex, p. 9.-He uses a German word or phrase now and then in his novels; Dare says "Horensagen ist halb gelogen" in A Laodicean, for example, and Hardy speaks of Mrs. Charmond's weltbirgerliche nature in The Woodlanders. But when the Hardys set out for Germany in 1876, Hardy still knew so little German that he pasted to the front cover of his Baedeker a home-made, 16-page phrase-book of simple ex- pressions and their German equivalents, including the numerals. Rutland conjectures that Hardy did not know enough German to read Faust in the original with appreciation, and in reply to my inquiry on this point, Professor Carl J. Weber wrote: "I'd agree with Rutland in thinking that he never acquired any real facility in the language." 1183</page><page sequence="39">Hardy's "Mephistophelian Visitants" named "great works of the past." Hardy's earlier Mephistophelian visitants had been created before these references. How thoroughly Hardy studied Faust before or during the period 1872-86 is impossible, I think, to ascertain. Probably Hardy got more of his ideas about Mephistopheles from folk- lore, the Mummers' Play, and the puppet-plays and penny books than from direct study of Marlowe or Goethe. None the less, it may be in- teresting to look at some of the parallels between Goethe's Mephis- topheles and Hardy's visitants. Mephistopheles appears in a scarlet vest, or all in red, and Hardy's Mrs. Endorfield, Sergeant Troy, and Diggory dress in red. Mephistopheles appears to Faust as a black hound, and "black hound" is one of the terms Boldwood applies to Troy. Mephis- topheles is a gambler; the Prologue in Heaven contains a wager. Sergeant Troy, Diggory, and Dare engage in gambling. Margaret has a nameless feeling that Mephistopheles is evil, and, aside from the general awe for Diggory, the characters in A Laodicean have this feeling about William Dare. Mephistopheles is represented as a traveller, and Sergeant Troy, Dare, Von Xanten, Newsom, Farfrae, and Dr. Fitzpiers are all travel- lers; Diggory is itinerant. Mephistopheles, appearing to Faust as a travelling scholar, is almost omniscient; he is a rationalist. These traits are prominent in Hardy's visitants, especially in William Dare and Dr. Fitzpiers. Mephistopheles represents the spirit of denial and mockery; this trait is suggested in Troy and is emphasized in William Dare. Mephistopheles states that he is: Ein Theil von jener Kraft, Die stets das B6se will und stets das Gute schafft.187 Sergeant Troy is similarly conceived as the "impersonator of Heaven's persistent irony"; and Diggory, as an agent of the "satire of Heaven."'88 At any rate, it seems clear that Hardy did make use, over a period of fifteen years, and again in The Dynasts, of an intruding force or invader to disturb the settled tranquillity of his main characters and to turn the current of their lives at critical points. This invader embodies various suggestions of Mephistopheles in his appearance, character, and be- havior. It is likely, perhaps, that Hardy intended the casual reader to see in him a symbol representing some operation of the Will in human life, and perhaps its irony in ordering the affairs of men. J. O. BAILEY University of North Carolina 187 Lines 1335-36. 188 I have not mentioned the Spirits Sinister and Ironic in this paragraph. The influence of Faust upon The Dynasts as a whole has been often pointed out. See, for example, Fairley, op. cit. 1184</page></plain_text>
