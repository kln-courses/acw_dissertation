<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ephraim Meir Sigmund Freud's Moses and His Reappearance: the Forgotten and the Unforgettable Reading Sigmund Freud's work on Moses again after twenty years has given me the opportunity to situate Freud at the beginning of a movement continued by a number of modern Jewish thinkers.1 As the author of Moses and Monotheism, Freud has been put on the couch for a thorough psychoanalysis by many an interpreter. He has been accused of writing Moses in his old age, a confused man, ill with cancer, who had failed to cope with his father and with his own Jewish past. These explanations are not to Freud's advantage.2 True, Freud himself hesitated to publish his Moses, which is a strange work, with many repetitions,3 and which suffers from a lack of stringent A previous version of this article appeared in E. Meir, Differenz und Dialog, Muenster: Waxmann Verlag, 2011, pp. 124—143. See for example Marthe Robert, D'Oedipe a Mo'ise - Freud et la conscience juive, Paris: Calmann-Levy 1974. Robert believes that by denying that Moses was a Hebrew, Freud wanted a different linage. In making Moses an Egyptian, Freud would have expressed his personal problem with the growing resemblance to his own father. Robert's analysis of Moses and Monotheism as revealing Freud's unresolved Oedipal relation to his father, is exemplary for the tendency to psychoanalyze the book. S. Freud, Der Mann Moses und die monotheistische Religion. Drei Abhandlungen was translated in English in 1955 under the title Moses and Monotheism. Throughout the article, I refer to the edition in the Studienausgabe Band IX: Fragen der Gesellschaft. Urspruenge der Religion, eds. Alexander Mitscherlich, Angela Richards, James Strachey and Use Grubrich-Simitis, Frankfurt a.M.: Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag, 2000, pp. 455-581. The repetitions in the book are blatant and Freud himself admitted it (pp. 550, 575).</page><page sequence="2">VI Ephraim Meir organisation.4 Yet, Freud's approach to Moses may be explained differently and may even underline his courageous struggle to cope with his Jewish heritage. Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi opted for this possibility and saved Freud the Jew. He rejected the interpretation that regards Moses and Monotheism as a repudiation of Jewish identity or ambivalence towards it.5 In this essay, I will distance myself, as did Yerushalmi, from the tendency to psychoanalyse Freud's Moses and Monotheism. I suggest reading the book ad meliorem partem, in an empathetic reading, as a testimony to Freud's exceptional handling of his own Jewish past. In the difficult period of the thirties, Freud felt he had to write this book in order to cope with the tradition that had formed him. In my analysis of Moses and Monotheism, I will try to uncover Freud's intentions and the inner logic of his reasoning, using the philosophical method rather than the historical one. Continuing his thought, I will attempt to imagine what he would have written had he had another year or years to live. Finally, I will show how the works of contemporary thinkers show affinities with Freud's thought in Moses and Monotheism and how he and his message have been revived by them, as a Freud redivivus. In Moses and Monotheism Freud reflected upon his own identity and built it. In the very act of the Bildung, he uncovered the origin of the Jewish people. He unravelled the mystery of the Jew. In his archeological approach with teleological consequences, he succeeded in showing the main, life-affirming characteristic of the Jewish people. He argued that the conscience of the commandment, "Thou shalt not kill" constitutes the collective psyche of the Jewish people. I. Freud and Buber: psycho-history and history of dialogue On the first page of his book on Moses, Buber regrets the appearance of Freud's book on the subject and considers it as totally unscientific, based on hypotheses with no foundation at all. Buber reproached Freud for his lack of historical interest. I discuss Buber's approach of Moses for a number of reasons. First, his approach clearly illustrates the tendency to negatively evaluate Freud's Moses. Both Buber and Freud deal with the works of the same exegetes, each from his 4 Part I for instance is about the fact that Moses is an Egyptian, Part II about the hypothesis of Moses as Egyptian. 5 Υ.

Freud sensed the lack of historical foundation in his own theory, which constituted the reason why Buber rejected Freud's standpoint and why in the course of time Freud himself endeavoured to give more historical substance to his theory. However, although he felt the weakness of this historical outlook, Freud's interest was not primarily in history, but in a rational, scientific Judaism that was conscious of the Oedipal complex.6 Neither was Buber first of all interested in history. He rather pointed the way to the dialogical kernel in Jewish existence, to the importance of meeting. Buber wanted to reach the historical kernel of the Moses saga, a saga he saw as resulting from a meeting (.Begegnung)7 in which a people enthusiastically remembered their great leader. He expected the reader of/listener to the saga to adopt a similar attitude. He emphasized an empathic approach as the prerequisite for a correct understanding of Moses' life. Buber endeavoured to go back to the popular, oral tradition that would offer a more or less unified picture of Moses and his activities as part of a history of faith (Glaubensgeschichte),8 a history of dialogue and meeting. Both Buber and Freud were critical of what was transmitted in the biblical text and did not take the Bible as a simple account of history. They were not interested in history in se, but in the nation's memory of foundational events. They shared a anti-magical attitude and were critical about cult. Each in his own way, they wanted to bring the reader to a change of mind: Buber wanted his readers to become dialogical persons, Freud wanted to transform people and bring them to a scientific, rational level, devoid of illusions. A comparison of Freud's Moses with Buber's Moses brings out more clearly the specificity of Freud's exceptional perception of Moses. In his book on Moses, Martin Buber was disturbed that the leading historian Eduard Meyer had denied that Moses was a historical person. Without falling into the opposite pitfall that takes everything written in the Bible as literally true, he critically approached the corpus Biblicum concerning Moses. Only the Exodus and the Revelation at Sinai might be historical: Moses' early history and the events after Sinai were qualified as legendary. In his effort to reconstruct history, Buber thought that Freud had no historical contribution to make on Moses' life. Moreover, in the framework of his holistic I want to thank Ronen Pinkas, for this remark. Pinkas thinks that Freud wanted to bring Judaism to the level of psychoanalysis and that he strived for a kind of psychoanalytic religion, a Judaism without illusions. M. Buber, Moses, Heidelberg: Lambert Schneider, 2nd ed., 1952, p. 19. as distinguished from Religionsgeschichte</page><page sequence="4">VIII Ephraim Meir thinking, Buber regarded the psychological approach as fragmentary. Psychology could not take into account the dialogical stance of the relating person and reduced the metaphysical meeting to infra-humane categories. Indeed, the thesis that Freud considered religion an illusion, an obsession and a neurosis is well known.9 However, Freud has more to say about religion, which remains for him a projection of psychological elements into the external world. In contrast to Buber's judgement, Freud's work on Moses may be seen as an important milestone in the psychic history of religious collective experiences. Freud's Anliegen Freud was interested in uncovering a truth that often sounded improbable (unwahrscheinlich).!0 In his reconstruction of the Jewish psyche, he was searching for psychoanalytic probability. This was far from anything accepted by historians at his time. Whereas Buber wanted to come to the historical kernel of the Moses saga, which he found in dialogue, Freud discovered a meta psychological truth, not a metaphysical one. He was striving for a rational investigation of reality, but his rationality was different than that behind Buber's dialogical thinking. For Buber, Freud's analysis was unhistorical just as the 'horns' of Michelangelo's raging Moses were. Whereas scholarly exegesis tended to deny Moses as a historical person or granted him only a shallow historicity, Buber insisted that Moses was a historical person. In the Graf-Wellhausen chronology, the Moses narratives in the Pentateuch were considered to be late creations. Buber, however, tried to prove that monotheism was not the result of a late stage in Jewish history. On the surface Buber and Freud seem to have nothing in common. But are they really that far removed from each other? Perhaps they are closer than one might think at first sight. Buber and Freud profoundly identified with Moses. For both, memory is important. Freud insisted on the memory of Moses' murder, how it was 'forgotten' and how the repressed returned. Forgetting and remembering characterize the collective unconscious. Buber wanted the reader to remember 9 See S. Freud, Die Zukunft einer Illusion, Leipzig: Internationaler Psychoanalytischer Verlag, 1928. 10 Freud's introduction to the 1934 manuscript draft of Der Mann Moses; Yosef Flayim Yerushalmi, Freud's Moses, p. 103; see also Yerushalmi's comment on this introduction, pp. 16-18.</page><page sequence="5">Sigmund Freud's Moses and His Reappearance IX the dialogical dimension in Judaism. Both were also interested in the genesis of religious life. Whereas Buber studied the history of the Jews as pioneers of dialogue, Freud sifted through the history of the collective psyche of the Jews.11 He uncovered the origin of the Jewish religion through his analysis based upon the Oedipal complex and the patricide, as explained in Totem and Taboo}2 In Moses and Monotheism, Freud applied the main thoughts of Totem and Taboo to the Jewish people. Both Buber and Freud underlined the ethical dimension in Judaism and saw monotheism as a demand for fraternal unity. Of course, these parallels do not blot out the main differences between the author of I and Thou (1921) and the writer of The Ego and the Id (1923). Freud wrote about the psycho-dynamics of the Jews, who remembered, forgot and recalled Moses' murder, thus creating a spiritual world with moral values: the return of the repressed was the victory of the vital element in Judaism. For Buber, the return of the dialogical was crucial in the great periods of renewal in Jewish history. Depth in reality for Buber is the presence that makes itself manifest in a dialogical attitude; for Freud, it lies in processes of the collective unconsciousness. Given these parallels as well as Buber's sharp reaction to Freud's Moses and Monotheism, I maintain that, just as Gershom Sholem misunderstood Buber in his interpretation of Hasidism, Buber misunderstood Freud in his approach to Moses. Freud, Sellin and Meyer In Moses and Monotheism, Freud refers to such liberal exegetes as Hugo Gressmann, Jean Astruc and Paul Volz. Generally speaking, he was sceptical about the deduction of historical facts from texts. He was familiar with the exegesis of his time and, more particularly, he was interested in the research results of Ernst Sellin and Eduard Meyer. In his theory on the origin of the Jewish religion, Freud based his analysis on the work of the biblical historian Sellin, who maintained that Moses was slain In this context, it is noteworthy that Freud first wanted to call his work "Der Mann Moses, ein historischer Roman". See his letter to Arnold Zweig dated 30 Sept. 1934; S. Freud, Briefe 1873-1939, ausgewaehlt und herausgegeben von Ernst und Lucie Freud, Frankfurt a.M.: S. Fischer, 1980; p. 436.

Buber rejected Sellin's thesis as totally unscientific: such a construction would be unimaginable. Moses was not a preliminary stage (Vorstufe) for another Moses, who would also undergo martyrdom. Buber wanted to give his own, Jewish, interpretation of Moses, distinct from the Christian exalting martyrdom. At the same time, he disqualified both Sellin's and Freud's theses. Later, when Sellin retracted his position, Freud uncritically said: "He was right the first time."13 The second exegete who greatly influenced Freud was Eduard Meyer, whose theory Buber refuted just as he refuted Sellin's theory. According to Meyer, the Jews adopted a new religion of a volcanic god, JHWH, probably from the Midianites. Moses, the son-in-law of the Midianite priest Jethro, was a legendary person related to the cult of Massa and Meriva, i.e. Qadesh. Freud links this Moses to the Egyptian one. Sellin found elements that point to Moses' violent death and a denial of his religion in Hosea and other prophets. He also argued that the hope of Moses' return was attested. Freud adopted Sellin's hypothesis concerning the slaying of Moses and accepted, with Meyer, Midianite influence. Moses brought his Levites, i.e. Egyptian scribes, with him, and these finally merged with the people. After the catastrophe of Moses' death, the new religion was confirmed in Qadesh. Moses, who had led the people out of Egypt, finally became identified with the son-of-law of Jethro, the later founder of the JHWH religion in Qadesh. The Egyptian and the Midianite Moses became one and the same person, Qadesh became Sinai-Horeb, and the JHWH religion became identical with the original Moses religion. In his analysis of Moses, Freud endeavours to go beyond what is written, beyond the different manipulations (Entstellungen, e.g. God's wrath at Moses when he did not circumcise himself and was saved by his Midianite wife) to uncover the repressed (das Unterdriickte) and the denied (Verleugnete).14 It was Moses who elected the Jews.15 His teaching and the memory of his murder would definitively constitute the characteristics of the Jewish people. In the process of writing his work on Moses, Freud wanted a more solid historical basis for his thesis. One may indeed criticize him for not having enough hard facts. This is what probably disturbed Buber the most. Yet, what 13 Yerushalmi, Freud's Moses, p. 83. 14 S. Freud, Der Mann Moses, p. 493. 15 S.

He explained this by describing how the trauma of Moses' murder was repressed, forgotten and remembered in the unconscious collective of the Jewish people. II. Freud's Moses and Monotheism The first and second parts of Moses and Monotheism were published in Imago}6 The important section III,2,C, entitled Der Fortschritt in der Geistigkeit, appeared in Internationale Zeitschrift fuer Psychoanalyse und Imago}'' The entire book was finally published by Albert de Lange in Amsterdam in 1939. Although the manuscript draft was ready in September 1934, Freud only gradually published the different parts. Why didn't he publish it right a way?18 First of all, because of the national-socialist political situation, and clerical domination in Austria. Father Wilhelm Schmidt was the Vatican's contact man19 in Vienna. He was against psychoanalysis and of course against Totem and Taboo. Freud was afraid that psychoanalysts would be bereft of their praxis and that his work would be censored.20 Moreover, he wanted a more secure basis for his entire analysis, with more historical evidence.21 Freud developed a critical attitude towards his own work. When in 1939 psychoanalysts were banned and he himself had to emigrate, Freud published his work, contributing to the understanding of the Jews' genius and of the development of civilization. There is a disproportion between the several parts of the book. The structure of the book itself is not well thought through. The first part is romanesc and intensive (romanhaft und intensive), the second part is laborious and tiring (muehselig und langwierig), the third abundant and fastiduous (gehalt- und anspruchsvoll).22 Freud felt that his work was not well enough documented, and that there were many hypotheses, guesses and probabilities. There are strong, but 23,1 (1937), pp. 5-13; 23,4 (1937), pp. 387^419. 24,1-2 (1939), pp. 6-9. See Marthe Robert, D'Oedipe a Mo'ise, especially the last chapter on Freud's Moses.

Freud, Briefe, p. 436.</page><page sequence="8">XII Ephraim Meir also weak sides.23 He knew his critics perceived the book as a female dancer on her tip-toes.24 Part I and Part II Freud' s thesis is that monotheism originated in Egypt during the reign of Amenhotep IV, who called himself Ikhnaton after the sun-god Aton, whom he considered to be the sole God. Ikhnaton distanced himself from magic and sorcery, from any anthropomorphic representation of God and from belief in an afterlife. After the death of this exceptional Pharaoh, the Egyptians returned to their old gods. It was the man Moses, of Egyptian stock, who became head of a conglomeration of Semitic slaves in Egypt, brought them out of slavery and offered them monotheistic religion. In this way, Moses saved monotheism from extinction and gave it to the Jews, who made the phenomenon consistent. He "created" the Jews.25 The assertion that Moses was an Egyptian was not Freud's essential point, it was only the starting point of his theory. Moses gave the Jews a demanding and universal God. However, the revolutionary, monotheistic religion of Moses was too much for the people, who rebelled and finally got rid of him. The memory of the killing was repressed. The former slaves made an alliance with the Midianites and adopted their volcanic deity. Aton, the God of Moses, and Adonai became identical. In a parallel way, Moses' deeds were identified with the deeds of a Midianite priest with the same name. With time, the submerged tradition won, and Adonai received the universal and spiritual qualities of Moses' God. The memory of Moses' murder was repressed, but returned and with it the lofty message of monotheism. Freud was not the first to suggest that Moses was murdered, as we have already pointed out, and neither was he the first to mention the Egyptian etymology of Moses'name,26 but he was the first to link Moses' name with his ethnic origin. Moses' father probably gave the theoforic name Ptah-Musa or Amon-Musa (child of Ptah or child of Amon), which was abbreviated later on.27 But why would an Egyptian turn to the Jews? Why did he become a lawgiver S. Freud, Der Mann Moses, pp. 491 and 498. S. Freud, Der Mann Moses, p. 507. In one of his letters, Freud wrote: "Moses hat den Juden geschaffen"', S. Freud, Briefe, p. 436. Philo and Josephus mentioned that the name is etymologically Egyptian. When the name Thotmoses was found in Tel El Amarna, Freud thought they had found his Moses.</page><page sequence="9">Sigmund Freud's Moses and His Reappearance XIII and a teacher? Egypt was polytheistic, believing in immortality and in Osiris, the god of the dead. The Hebrews on the contrary concentrated on earthly reality: they believed in one God and obeyed the law forbidding the making of images of Him. Whereas Egyptians loved magic and sorcery, Hebrews did not. Freud explains this apparent contradiction. He argues that, in the 14th century, monotheism and "intolerance"28 were introduced for seventeen years. Ikhnaton (= Gottfried, God is satisfied) fulminated against the Amon priests and relocated the centre of cult from Thebes to Tel El Amarna. Tutankamon, second pharaoh after Ikhnaton, returned to the ancient cult and to Thebes. However, during the reign of Ikhnaton, Aton was a universal god for the entire empire of Egypt and the symbol of the divine entity itself. Aton alone created the world and provided energy. He was never represented, and his cult did not tolerate demons and magic. This elitist religion was inherited by Moses who gave it to the Jews, together with circumcision (as Herodotus was aware). The basic credo was: Shema Yisrael, Aton is our God. Freud concluded that Moses gave his religion to the Jews, that he left his own people and found a new people who could accept the lofty idea of monotheism. The Bible mentions that Moses stammered. Freud explained this, by saying that Moses spoke another language, Egyptian. The Egyptian Moses made them into a holy people (Ex.l9:6). He was demanding and jealous, like his God. Yet, the Jews, "wild Semites,"29 could not stand such a highly spiritual religion. They got rid of the leader. There were times they regretted the act of the murder, as in Qadesh, at other times, they denied (verleugnen) the act.30 Freud underlines that the God of Moses was not a local, violent, wrathful God, but a spiritual and universal one, an ethical one. He has remained alive until now (bis in unsere Zeiten). The prophets held fast to this God and to the great Mosaic tradition.31 Their God wanted no ritual or magic, but Maat, justice. Freud wrote that the prophets were a great honour for the Jewish people and that the elite remained faithful to the God of Moses. He studied Jewish history from this standpoint, in connection with Totem and Taboo, which had appeared 25 years earlier.32 When he came to the end of Part II, he did not think he would have the sic S.

Handelman writes that Freud links the slaying of Moses to the problematic of sons killing the father.</page><page sequence="10">XIV Ephraim Meir power to finish the task.33 We are fortunate that Freud continued and completed the work. Part III: Understanding the Characteristics of the Jewish people The final, lengthiest and most important section of the book concerns "Moses, His people and monotheistic religion." The first section of this part offers two prologues: one dated March, 1938, written in Vienna before the Anschluss, and the other in London, dated June, 1938. In the first prologue, Freud mentioned the barbarism in Germany, praised the Catholic Church and her resistance, but also mentioned her distrust of psychoanalysis, which presents religion as neurosis. He wrote that he had not published Part III, because he thought psychoanalysis would be forbidden in Austria. However, in June of the same year, he wrote his second prologue, containing opposite claims concerning the Church. Because of the invasion of Austria and the problematic, inimical position of the Church, he left his native Vienna. Not only was his way of thinking persecuted, but he himself was endangered because he belonged to the Jewish 'race.' Freud first summarizes his "purely historical study on Moses" (rein historische Studie),34 as it appears in the second Part. But now, he adds some important psychological insights. Under the influence of the priests of the sun-god in On (Heliopolis), the idea of a universal God Aton came into being. The sun with its life-giving energy became the symbol of power of the sole God who created everything and reigns according to truth and justice. A man, perhaps named Thotmes, came into contact with Semites, chose them and provided himself with compensation for what he had lost. He brought them circumcision and separated them from others. These Semites rebelled and killed Moses (Sellin), they united with the Midianites (Meyer), and accepted their warrior god JHWH who vanquishes adversaries. They combined this god with Moses' pacifistic God. Spiritual religion, Freud explains in a way that reminds us of Buber, is therefore not the result of evolution. The monotheistic God and His ethical demands were not accepted in a first instance, but only later on, as was the case of the acceptance of Darwin's theory after it had been rejected. For Freud, this is an interesting example of mass psychology. The individual accepts the new, even if it takes time. Freud found another analogy with what monotheism did to the Jewish people in the traumatic neurosis of the individual. After a trauma too, 33 S. Freud, Der Mann Moses, p. 502. 34 S. Freud, Der Mann Moses, p. 508.</page><page sequence="11">Sigmund Freud's Moses and His Reappearance XV there is a time of incubation, of latency. Similarly, in Judaism it took time to accept monotheism with its ethical consequences. Here too, there is a psychological situation. According to Freud, there are subterranean traditions, as Sellin has shown, counter to official historiography, which became more and more powerful in the life of the people. The Moses religion left its traces: there was the memory of it, parallel with the powers of the Greek sagas that retain traces of the Minoic Mycenic culture of Crete. The Moses-religion returned, was revived, and survived. Jews went back to the original religion. Freud explained how the masses were greatly influenced, because the murder of the primeval father was repressed and the repressed returned in a forceful way. The masses retain an impression of the past in memory traces. The best parallel, however, for the return of such an event in the memory of the people lies for Freud in the psychopathology of neurosis. He goes into a long digression as to how a problem is latent, and how it resurfaces in a compelling form. Children between two and four have a sexual life, followed by a latent period as a consequence of a postponement. Later on, the trauma is repeated.35 The order is: trauma, refusal, latency and neurotic symptom. Humanity too, for Freud, has a prehistory that has been forgotten. The despotic father is killed by the brothers. But organization appears, duties are set, and this is the beginning of ethics and justice. The taboo of incest and the commandment of exogamy are accepted. Totemism, Ersatz for the father, came into being. The totem-meal with its negative commandments is, according to Freud, the first appearance of religion. This phenomenon is only one step away from the father-god, for Freud. Judaism and its continuation in Christianity are related to the father-religion with its chosen and its rewards. The Jews came to value the intellectual and the ethical. It is noteworthy how Freud deals with Christianity in this section of his essay. Paul, Saul of Tarsus, took up the theme of the conscience of guilt that was developed by the Jewish people. He talked about "original sin" and developed a message of redemption through the expiatory sacrifice of the Son. In holy Freud offers some examples. A man with dependency upon his mother seeks a wife on whom he is dependant. A girl who is aggressed may arrange her life in such way, that she provokes this aggression again and again. The trace then becomes manifest at a later period. In another case, a boy who observes and hears the coitus of his parents, manipulates his sex organ. His mother forbids this and warns him that, if he does not stop this, she will tell his father. In his later life, the boy became egoistic, an exact copy of his father: the repressed returned.</page><page sequence="12">XVI Ephraim Meir communion, the ritual of the totem-meal is repeated. Judaism, clinging to the Father, is the Father religion, Christianity the religion of the Son. In the last part of my essay, I will come back to Freud's position towards Christianity. According to Freud, there are reminders in the human being of what was once experienced: the murder of the father. This archaic heritage can become active and conscious. Moses' murder was one example, Jesus' murder represented another. In III, 2 Freud apologizes. He repeats himself and he knows it. He wrote Part I (thesis) and Part II (historical construction) in Vienna, and did not want to publish the rest concerning the genesis of monotheism. But it haunted him (quaelte mich) like an unredeemed ghost (ein unerloester Geist). In Austria he could not publish it, in England he had to do it. He first wrote I, II and III, 1 and, then, he decided to add to what he had written, with the inevitable problem of repetitions. But he nevertheless promises new and important material. Since Freud himself writes that there are more than mere repetitions, I will point out only what is presented as entirely new. In his historical-psychological research, Freud states that the people of Israel is still alive, with its own special characteristics and that it is rejected by others. The Jews are self-confident. They are optimistic, or in religious terms: they have confidence in God. They feel elected, like the privileged child of the father, as Joseph was among his brothers. Moses is responsible for the continued existence of the Jewish people.36 He was a "great man," in that he influenced the masses like a father who promised the Jews that they would be his dear children. They killed him, as in ancient times the divine king was killed. The prophets with their admonitions and their demands succeeded in returning to Moses' monotheism. And this, Freud concludes, became the main characteristic of the Jewish people. The spiritual, he writes in the crucial section that he published before (III 2,C), could grow, because the Jews had the idea of a great God. They were proud of their election and that the triumph of spirituality over the sensual was a renunciation of the instinct (Triebverzicht).37 The Superego as a replacement for the parent, causes one not to give in to the instinct by satisfying it. This provides a special satisfaction. Moses, the great man (der grosse Mann)38 played the role of the Superego in the mass psychology of the Jews. The spirit was set free. The 36 Ihm dankt dieses Volk seine Zaehlebigkeit; S. Freud, Der Mann Moses, p. 553. 37 S. Freud, Der Mann Moses, p. 559. 38 S. Freud, Der Mann Moses, p. 563.</page><page sequence="13">Sigmund Freud's Moses and His Reappearance XVII father, whose name one bears, is preferred over the mother, spirituality (1Geistigkeit) over the senses. A religion that renounces the instinct makes up the special character of the Jewish people. In totemism, the commandment not to kill exists, marriage must be exogamous,39 and it is accepted that brothers are equal. "Holy" is what corresponds to the will of the father. Moses made the people "holy" through circumcision, the symbolic replacement of castration and through it, they were ready to follow the will of the father. He gave the Jews a feeling of being elected. Although the JHWH-God also had his successes, the God of Moses finally triumphed and came to life again. In psychic life, it is possible to identify with the father, feel this as repugnant, and then come back to it again. Freud believes that, in a parallel way, the unconscious is also present in the psychology of masses. The believer takes part in the greatness of his god in the Moses-religion, which was rejected and forgotten, but which finally broke through and triumphed. It left permanent traces in the people. As repetition of the past, it is truth. The last pages of Freud's work again contain repetitions, but add some new aspects and some details. In Totem und Taboo he adopted Darwin's hypothesis of people originally living in little groups with a leader, who took the females and pushed the younger people aside. From Atkinson he borrowed the theory of the rebellion of the sons, as the end of the patriarchal system. From W. Robertson Smith, finally, he borrowed the totem theory, the clan of brothers, the totem-meal and exogamy. After the clan of brothers, the right of the mother, exogamy and totemism, there took place a "return of the repressed" (Wiederkehr des Verdraengten).40 Something of the past which has disappeared, reappears: the father again becomes head of the family, the totem-animal becomes God. First, one God is leader of other gods, than he becomes the only one. Only with the recognition of one God is there a return to the original father of the clan. In the collective psyche this rediscovery is enormous, as Sinai testifies. We are grateful to serve God. Only religious ecstasy can bring back the deep emotions of children. Seeking justice, the prophets brought back the conscience of guilt. It was not easy for the Hebrews to preserve in themselves the idea that they were the people loved by God. In this way, they were able to accept gladly punishment for sins as well as different renunciations of the instinct. According to Freud, it is not 39 Freud notes that this is in contrast with Egyptian Pharaohs who married their sisters. 40 S. Freud, Der Mann Moses, p. 577.</page><page sequence="14">XVIII Ephraim Meir possible to hide that enmity originally existed between son and father. Judaism brought this unease (Unbehagen) to many other people.41 III. Freud and Judaism I do not think that one can understand Freud's Moses and Monotheism without taking into account crucial Jewish elements in his life and without Freud's consciousness of his own otherness. He did not deny being a Jew, but he was largely estranged from the Jewish religion as it was perceived in his day. He was not a believing Jew and considered religion as an illusion created by men in a world that is not under control. For this rational man who believed in everything empirical, religion was associated with emotional infantile needs, just as children cope with reality. The image is not however completely negative: without religion, which puts off the immediate satisfaction of the instincts, cultural life is impossible.42 Freud saw his own stubborn perseverance in the development of the science of psychoanalysis as a Jewish quality. He did not falter, even though he was very critical and despite belonging to the few against the many.43 Moreover, he had a positive attitude towards the Zionist movement although at the same time he did not believe that the Christian or the Islamic worlds would ever be ready to leave their holy places in Jewish hands. He was also against Jewish "unrealistic fanaticism" and showed sensitivity to the needs of the Arab "local natives."44 He had himself suffered from incidents of anti-Semitism: at the age of ten, his father Jakob told him how he had been humiliated by an anti-Semite, his hat was thrown to the ground and he was urged to leave the sidewalk. When Freud asked his father how he had reacted, his father responded that he had simply continued on his way. We do not know what hurt Freud most: the humiliation suffered by his all-mighty father or his own first contact with anti-Semitism.45 In 1891, when he turned 35, his father gave him a beautiful leather-bound Philippsohn family Bible, with a Hebrew inscription dedicated to his Shlomo, in S.

In 1925, Freud wrote: "I have always had a strong feeling of belonging together with my people and have always nurtured it in my children as well."47 From 1934 on, according to Yerushalmi, Freud "drank from that well and sang to it": his father would not have been displeased with the result. In a late stage of his life, Freud came back to the Bible and to the beginning of monotheism. Thinking about Moses was something that Freud very much enjoyed doing.48 Contemplating Michelangelo's Moses in 1914, he felt as if he had seen the prophet come alive, so to speak. Twenty years later, he started publishing parts of his paper on the murdered father, which is more than just his last literary work. Here, he discovered Judaism as a life-giving force leading to civilization. In Moses and Monotheism, his only Jewish work, Freud expressed himself in a Jewish way. My understanding of Freud's Moses is based on his statement in a letter to Barbara Law dated 19.4.1936: "there is this "miraculous thing [...] which - inaccessible to any analysis so far - makes the Jew."49 Freud endeavoured to develop what was "miraculous," "geheimnisvoll" in the Jew. He wrote on the "return of the repressed" in a positive way: the lofty teaching of Moses, the ethical message of this great man, of this Other. He also articulated his own Jewishness, which he had been forcibly reminded of by the anti-Semitic prejudices of his time. In the thirties, Freud discovered in himself deeper layers of his existence as an Austrian Jew. He understood that Jews are inside various societies, but in a way remain outside, in contact with otherness. This brings a creative tension between what is and what can be, between general culture and Jewish tradition. The Jew represents the intimate and the secret, heimlich-Geheim, the known that is hidden and kept secret, repressed and experienced as uncanny, un-heimlich. The uncanny has to do with infantile complexes that are repressed and experienced again through an impression. Unheimlich is a kind of heimlich, of what goes back to the known from old. "Un" in the word Unheimlich is the indication of repression (Verdraengung, refoulement).

His bond with German culture was strong, there was certainly a symbiosis, but as other great Jews, he felt that his identity was not only that of someone belonging to the German culture. Although the symbiosis between German and Jewish culture was not complete, neither was separation total.50 In his self-examination and self-construction, Freud tried out new options in the nineteen-thirties. He became more aware of the Jewish components in his identity. In the constant construction of his identity, he felt that he had to reflect on his Judaism. One's nature is not immutable but neither is everything circumstantial or accidental. Freud was confronted with Unheimlichkeit, containing a Geheim, and, by studying it more closely, he was astonished at it. Something was disturbing and he clearly wanted to analyse that disturbing element, just as Jean-Francois Lyotard would later. He did not experience his identity as hybrid, but knew about an important aspect, about an "elsewhere," that belonged to his Judaism. Freud himself writes that his Moses and Monotheism was not destined only for psychoanalysts.51 He wanted to communicate to others his discovery of the meaning of Jewish existence. Freud and Religion Freud does not talk only about the obsessive character of religion, parallel with the rituals of the neurotic, but also about the relevance of the monotheistic tradition. Moses and Monotheism is a reflection on his own inner identity and on a certain psychological structure with which he identified, not a book about Biblical history.52 In it, he developed the idea of a patricide that caused unconscious guilt feelings. He presented Judaism as an enormous cultural power in which one recalls the forgotten that is never totally forgettable. Freud was brought out of Vienna by his colleagues after the Nazi occupation in 1938. He died in London in 1939. During the last years of his life, he spent much of his time thinking about his own Jewish condition.

He was aware that his theory of religion as linked to the murdered father was not new, since he developed it in Totem and Taboo, but nevertheless it was rather something new and fundamental for outsiders (eher etwas Neues und Fundamentales fuer Fremde).5i Apparently, it was important for him to write for a broad, non specialised public and to explain to them how his former insights could be applied to Jewish reality. For Freud, religion was the result of an early trauma of Oedipal murder, and the devouring of the slain primeval father by the horde of his sons. The trauma was repressed and remembered. Their consciences heavy with guilt, the father was worshipped as a totem animal by the people. Moses and Monotheism reveals the origins of monotheism. Although religion remained an illusion for Freud, it defined the Jewish character in an indelible way. Moses and Monotheism continues Totem and Taboo, in which Freud applies his psychological insights to archaic cultures. Other writings, such as Das Unheimliche54 and Unbehagen in der Kultur, may also be taken into consideration.55 There is something unheimlich, something strange and somewhat disturbing, in what is familiar, in what is heimlich. This happens for example when someone sees a wax puppet and thinks it is a living person or when you see yourself in a mirror and think - at first glance - that it is someone else.56 The experience of unheimlich - the 'un' is important in Freud's vision - reminds us of the reason why something is repressed. In parallel, Michelangelo's Moses became alive for Freud in an uncanny way. The guilt feelings worked in a positive, strangely familiar way and Freud became aware that he was linked to a great ethical tradition, one which brought about civilization. I agree with Moshe Ater who notes that Freud's "frame of mind" remained Jewish in Moses and Monotheism.57 S. Freud, Briefe, p. 436. S.

First, he might have written that Jews are conscious of the Law as both beyond lust and as anchored in lust. The libido as the principle of joyful love asks that reality be taken into account, and the Law has its roots in love. Eric Santner, in his beautiful work on Rosenzweig and Freud, has interpreted Freud in the light of Rosenzweig and vice versa.58 He writes on "the tension of an election,"59 which is inherent in Jewish life. In Moses and Monotheism, he argues, Freud put forth "a rich and highly speculative account of the genesis of a 'too much' which, as he saw it, shaped Jewish life according to the pattern of an obsessive-compulsive neurosis."60 Santner commented upon the excess which is present in Jewish life and which lends it its vitality. In this way he made explicit a thought that Freud had developed at the end of his life. Second, Freud might have developed the thesis that Jews are unheimlich, reminding us of something disturbing. When Das Unheimliche was published in the autumn of 1919, Freud considered the phenomenon of the uncanny not as something that appears primarily in art and literature, but also as a phenomenon in life itself.61 Thus, later, he might have characterised Jewish life as an uncanny life, a positive disturbance in the problematic, spontaneous development of the being. Third, Freud might have been less ambiguous towards Judaism as an autonomous existence, independent from Christianity. Like all other Jews, he was persecuted, and 1933 started a period of particularly barbaric persecution. During his life, he identified as a Jew, but wanted to be judged according to universal standards. Freud's problem was that he lived and worked in Viennese culture, with its dominant Christian Catholic religion. Sometimes in his Moses and Monotheism he looked at Judaism with Christian eyes.62 Freud notes that Paul of Tarsus, who brought redemption instead of election, Eric L.

Freud, Der Mann Moses, p. 536.</page><page sequence="19">Sigmund Freud's Moses and His Reappearance XXIII both continued and destroyed Judaism. He abolished circumcision and in this way returned to the universal Aton religion. Freud states that Christianity is a cultural regression.63 It is less monotheistic, with more rites. It is the renewed victory of the Amon priests over the God of Ikhnaton. On the other hand, Christianity is called progress (Fortschritt) from the point of view of the history of religions. It was seen as a progress concerning the return of the repressed. From then on, Judaism, in a way, is a fossil. Freud had no doubt that the essential Jewish character trait lay in its preference for the spiritual. We cannot deny, however, that some of his formulations concerning Christianity may sound problematic to Jewish ears. The slaying of Moses, Freud maintained, gave rise to the desire for the Messiah. Jesus also was murdered. This Moses redivivus came instead of the father. The "poor Jewish people" were accused of having killed God, i.e. not admitting that they had killed Him. In an unconscious reproach. Christians concluded: we did the same, but we admitted it and expiated for it. From the standpoint of Christianity, Freud writes that Jews cannot confess that they murdered God: they bear a tragic guilt upon their shoulders and pay dearly for it. It is noteworthy that Freud, in this context, writes on anti-Semitism. Minorities such as the Jews were perceived as strangers, as essentially different. Freud discovers deeper motives for anti-Semitism in the jealousy towards the Jewish people, their election and their circumcision, which recalls the much feared castration. Hatred of Jews, he says in a remarkable sentence, is hatred of Christians (Judenhass ist im Grunde Christenhass)64, and the Nazis attacked both Judaism and Christianity. If Freud had not been so persecuted, he might have been able to formulate a less ambivalent and a more autonomous viewpoint, less dependant on Christianity and more critical of it.65 The statement that Christians recognized the patricide in a way, whereas Jews were accused of not admitting to the murder sounds very ambiguous at first sight. Yet, let us keep in mind that he was describing a psychological reality. The Christian milieu in which he lived enabled him to analyse an anti-Semitism through which "the people,"66 the "poor S.

Freud, Der Mann Moses, p. 534.</page><page sequence="20">XXIV Ephraim Meir Jewish people" (das arme juedische Volk),61 who had preferred election over salvation, were the victims. He explicitly wrote that the Jews, who had repressed their patricide,68 also remembered it during good times. In his Moses and Monotheism he built a theory of culture, a point of view. In any case, we will have to remember that, when Freud talked about Christian "atonement" and the Christian consciousness of patricide, this was not a historical analysis, but a psychological one. Finally, we must not forget that for him, the Jewish people were to be praised for having remained faithful to the Aton religion, more so than Christianity. Although like any religion, the Jewish religion was a compulsive neurosis to his mind, it had also brought about something else, namely civilization. Freud perceived the Jewish religion as the more mature religion of the two. With his insight into the Jewish love of life and law, he might have developed a full blown theory on anti-Semitism as the hatred of conscience, a conscience that had its origins in Moses' very demanding monotheism. Affinities A number of thinkers show affinities with Freud's basic concern in his Moses and Monotheism and develop themes that Freud touched upon. First, Jean-Fran90is Lyotard continued Freud's thought. He wrote on the unforgettable forgotten and built further on Freud's thinking. He emphasized the "forgotten" and defined real history as "anamnesis." In his thought, the Jew represented the repressed, the object of psychoanalysis as "la recherche du temps perdu. "69 The "jew" - deliberately lower case - was, for Lyotard, the name that the West has given to unconscious anguish.70 The unforgettable is always forgotten. Freud, Benjamin, Adorno, Arendt and Celan would make great non-German Germans and non-Jewish Jews, stateless individuals who, in their ethical life, hate geo-philosophy and are always linked to exodus,71 to what brings a person out of the sameness, into contact with otherness. According to Lyotard, Freud belonged to those people who knew that ethics is not linked to a S. Freud, Der Mann Moses, p. 538. Ibid.

Id., pp. 150-151.</page><page sequence="21">Sigmund Freud's Moses and His Reappearance XXV place. I consider Lyotard's critical thinking concerning Heidegger's ontology and its lack of ethics as being in the footsteps of Freud. Hannah Arendt too contested Heidegger's ontology, pointing to the political sphere. She accentuated the importance of social organisation and politics and linked politics to ethics. For her, everything is political and social, including Adolf Eichmann's trial. A committed philosopher, she combined theory and action and called for a similar commitment from others.72 She did not abandon her admiration for Martin Heidegger, but perceived his problem clearly. It is difficult to understand why she pardoned Heidegger, who had continued to pay taxes to the Nazi party until 1945. In the nineteen fifties, Arendt returned to Germany for some time, living in Karl Jaspers' home. During that period, she also met Heidegger. Although she withheld passing judgement on him, she was also highly critical of him. She understood that if you condemn someone immediately, you become unable to see that you are missing something. If one claims that a certain kind of behaviour is not according to ideals, one will miss the dynamics of a real analysis. Arendt's Eichmann is a reaction to Heidegger.73 He was part of 'the Other' and she surprised him with her intelligence and energy. Finally, however, Heidegger could not integrate her into his life. Arendt thought that Heidegger simply could not see that he made an enormous error. She believed that he was naive in political matters and that he did not have a clue that the Nazis wanted him for their own purposes. Influenced by Jaspers, she took Heidegger into consideration and went further. Having learned from Heidegger's life story, Arendt contributed to an understanding of politics as the human effort to create equality between people. Her engaged thought is parallel to Freud's, which describes the contract between the sons in memory of their murdered father. The appreciation of the idea of equality and hence of the public domain is common to Arendt and Freud. Another thinker parallel to Freud is Emmanuel Levinas, who accentuated the commandment "Thou shalt not kill," which corresponds to Freud's emphasis on the role of the father. The I, he wrote, is "created," in other words, in relation to the father. The uniqueness of the I lies in the fact that he is elected to respond to the "face." Although Levinas did not like psychoanalysis, he wrote - as did 72 In 1940 she had married the political thinker Heinrich Bluecher, a communist, autodidact and anarchist, who took part in street demonstrations and was even suspected by his own Communist party. He greatly inspired Arendt. 73 Hannah Arendt, Eichmann in Jerusalem. A Report On the Banality of Evil, New York: Viking Press, 1965.</page><page sequence="22">XXVI Ephraim Meir Freud - on fraternity as being the result of the acceptance of the father. Fraternity is the result of the acceptance of an exteriority, a demand. The acceptance of the otherness of the Other is the basis for every sound relationship.74 In this respect, Levinas's thinking is a refusal to return to the same, in a humanising movement towards the Other, in respect of his alterity. In "Otherwise than Being," one is hostage of the Other, judged by an ethical height: The I is perceived as obsessed by the Other, as the one-for-the other, just as the superego is an integral part of Freud's concept of the I. Although Levinas himself was far removed from any psychological approach, his emphasis on the command "Thou shalt not kill" is clearly parallel with Freud's understanding of civilization and his interpretation of Judaism as a religion of the Father.75 Finally, like Lyotard, Jean-Gerard Bursztein takes Freud further. In his refined analysis of Nazism as a "social psychosis," this psychoanalyst describes the problem of a society that wants to get rid of the Law and its representatives.76 This thesis, in which he makes clear why the Jews were the first victims of the Nazis, could not have been shaped without Freud's profound insights into the problem of the denial of the Law. Monotheism: Violent Reality or Founder of Civilization? The impact of Freud's thought on Moses is clear again today in the current discussion of the work of Jan Assmann and Regina Schwartz.77 Assmann and Schwartz have built a theory of cultural pluralism: in global consciousness, the strange ultimately becomes familiar. The stranger is ultimately like me. This is opposed to the concept of a universal conscience that does not eliminate the uncanny or the strange.78 Although Assmann, like Freud, believes that monotheism came from Egypt, he does not link ethical conscience to Jewish Ε.

Assmann argues that the opposition between "us" and "them" is problematic and that differences are secondary. In his theory, monotheism is seen as potentially violent while polytheism would be much better. If, however, we continue Freud's thought, uniqueness or the uncanny, Unheimlichkeit is essential. The stranger is not just like me, he is not me, he is completely different, with his own unalterable characteristics and his not-assimilative otherness. The other man is other, Moses remains the stranger, and God too is the totally Other, the stranger, not like the I, but electing the I to an uplifted and exalted life. In a number of points, Assmann agrees with Freud, but to my mind, he does not sufficiently evaluate the otherness of the other, the difference between the same and the other, which is the basis for what I call "trans-difference," or the relationship between the other, who is always different to the self, and the self that is always different to the other.79 In one of his Jerusalem lectures in 2004, Assmann asserted that the text on the Berlin memorial for the rescue of Jews, "Remember what Amalek did to you" (Deut. 25:17) was violent: he chose that specific monument precisely in order to speak about violence. However, is this violence more violent than the cruel and anarchic violence in a psychotic society without the Law? Freud's thoughts developed in his Moses and Monotheism give us insights not only in the necessity of the Law but also in the uniqueness of the Jewish monotheist religion in which justice is central. It appears that for Freud, monotheistic religion was not only a problem, it also was an opportunity. In France today we are witnessing the prohibition of wearing overtly religious signs in public places. Certainly, secularisation is a positive development, and public life and religion should not be mixed. Yet, in the light of Freud's insights, we may ask if a society without any religious influence is necessarily less violent. Rereading Freud's Moses and Monotheism might awaken other alternatives. Of course, Freud ultimately believed that religion was an illusion, but he would not deny its historic contribution to the genesis of civilization as well as its undeniable contribution to the formation of the Jewish spirit. Late in his life, Freud discovered something in himself that could not be absorbed in generalities. In the context of the nineteen-thirties he explicitly wanted to research the specific character of the Jews. That is what he writes on 79 Ε.
