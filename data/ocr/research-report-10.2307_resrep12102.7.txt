<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> CHAPTER 2 TWO CULTURES The historical dimensions of the engagement of  anthropology with the U.S. military enterprise in- form the discussion of the confrontational atmosphere  which would come to characterize debate upon the  Human Terrain System (HTS).1 At times, professional  anthropology and anthropologists tessellated with the  strategic requirements of the U.S. military posture; in  other periods, the discipline and the military enterprise  were in opposed tangents. This fractious relationship  results from the fact that war is an extension of politics.  The political element of warfighting necessarily lends  controversial dimensions to each martial endeavor.  It is accurate to write that, where the controversial  political character of warfighting was greatest, there,  too, could be found the most tense and sustained op- position to the military enterprise from sections of the  academic community. Anthropology and archaeology  historically have been particularly entwined with the  long-range lens of protracted armed conflict. Where  conflict has most explicitly impacted and is impacted  by society, the call to the social sciences becomes loud- est. This historical tail is important as both context and  as a repository for analogous activities in the conver- sation regarding the HTS.  Anthropology “crystalized in the context of war. In  the United States, anthropology emerged as the state  sought to understand and administer native popula- tions in the Indian Wars.”2 This was in the middle of  the 19th century. Cultural anthropologist and mu- seum professional Dustin M. Wax argued that the  Bureau of Ethnology created by the U.S. Department  55 </page> <page sequence="2"> of Interior in 1879 afforded one such case.3 A staunch  critic of the HTS, Roberto González has gone further,  arguing for a direct link between work undertaken by  anthropologists during the European colonial era, as  information gatherers for indirect rule, and those ac- tions of the Human Terrain Teams (HTTs). González,  in his historical reference, singled out the interwar  work of British anthropologist C. K. Meek, who was  “charged with helping colonial administrators fine- tune a system of indirect rule” among Nigerian Igbo  following the Women’s Riots.4 War and anthropology have always existed in a  curious symbiosis. Anthropology’s “signature meth- odology of extended participant observation” in the  field—which would make its academic experts so  appealing to the HTS—was forced upon the Polish- born British anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski  by the onset of World War I.5 There has been “a long  history of entanglement between archaeology and  anthropology on the one hand and political interests  and the intelligence and military establishment on the  other.”6 With the onset of that Great War, anthropolo- gists and scholars of related disciplines in possession  of such obvious and invaluable regional expertise  found themselves as “key players in the new game in  town—espionage.”7 In 1914, T. E. Lawrence, later to  be popularized as “Lawrence of Arabia,” conducted  geographical surveys for the British military forces  in the Negev under the auspices of an archaeological  expedition. Dr. Montgomery McFate would later as- sert that his seminal account of that period, the Seven  Pillars of Wisdom, is “essentially an ethnographic text,  concerned with the customs and conventions of desert  dwellers.”8  56 </page> <page sequence="3"> In the U.S. military enterprise, McFate cites Har- vard-trained archaeologist Sylvanus Morley, discov- erer of the Mayan city of Naachtun, who was consid- ered the “best secret agent the United States produced  during World War I.”9 The application of ostensibly  peaceful scholarship for military activities aroused an  ethical debate, however. The nature of Morley’s work  for the Office of Naval Intelligence, much of which was  conducted under the cover of fieldwork, was rebuked  by Franz Boas in late-1919; at that time arguably the  preeminent figure in the field of anthropology. Boas’  letter to the The Nation suggested that unnamed an- thropologists “have prostituted science by using it as  a cover for their activities as spies.”10 But little came  from the letter and Boas’ other criticisms of the war,  save that he was censured “quickly and publicly” by  the American Anthropological Association in 1919.11  The military interest in anthropological expertise  did not abate after World War I. According to historian  Priya Satia, between the two world wars, there was a  preoccupation in imperial security with the accumula- tion of knowledge of foreign societies.12 The use of air- power by the British in Arabia to subdue the popula- tion did not depend solely upon economic or strategic  reasons, but was based on ethnological perceptions of  the inhabitants, such that agents involved developed  an “intuitive intelligence epistemology modelled on  their understanding of the Arabian population.”13 The  ethnographic work of those in possession of anthropo- logical expertise could influence policy in the regions  in which they operated and assisted the exercise of  military power, deciphering the social and historical  dimensions of foreign nations. The existential threat posed to the United States  by World War II enabled a systematic adoption of the  57 </page> <page sequence="4"> discipline of anthropology to the U.S. military enter- prise for the first time.14 The scale and scope of the  threat posed by her foes necessitated a proportionate  amplification of military intelligence in the United  States. Increasing the size of the intelligence apparatus  allowed the structured and sustained application of a  wider range of tools to problem solving than had pre- viously been the case. For the first time, there was “the  organized use of social science for understanding the  knowledge of war; that is, the systematic deployment  of social sciences to collect and analyze information  necessary for strategic military ends.”15 In 1941, the  American Anthropological Association passed a reso- lution placing its resources and skill sets in the service  of the country.16  In mid-1941, the U.S. Office of the Coordinator  of Information (OCI) was created by Presidential  Order—a civilian agency charged with centralizing  the existing intelligence architecture. The OCI was  restructured and renamed the Office of Strategic Ser- vices (OSS) in mid-1942.17 The charter of the OSS was  “to collect and analyze all information and data which  may bear upon national security,” reporting directly  to the President and the Office of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff.18 The OSS was divided into two broad sections.  The first, the Research and Analysis section, analyzed  and produced information pertaining to the war ef- fort. The second section used field operatives to pro- cure actionable information that could assist in mili- tary planning. This immense war effort saw myriad academic  disciplines involved in the fight. For example, the OSS  was the single largest government institution in which  geographers worked during World War II, with 129  employed at the same time at its peak.19 But the pro- 58 </page> <page sequence="5"> fession did not only impact war, it was also impacted  by its focus of study:  The very experiences of some of the geographers at  R&amp;A [Research and Analysis section of the OSS] as  they tried to apply their geographical training to war  altered their conception of geographical research,  helping to propel the discipline to a different form.20  Yet, the OSS had a number of systemic issues,  including the often indecipherable effect from their  products, which meant that the motivation to create  them inevitably diminished over time; and also among  the military, “A deep suspicion that academics cannot  contribute to war.”21  Such was the broad utility of anthropology during  a global war that a report by American Anthropologi- cal Association Secretary Fred Eggan to the American  Association for the Advancement of Science in 1943  noted that more than 50 percent of professional an- thropologists in the United States were engaged di- rectly in the war effort and “most of the rest are doing  part-time work.”22 But not all anthropologists em- braced using their expertise to assist the war effort;  echoing Boas’ concern during the Great War, Melville  Herskovits considered the ethical dilemma posed by  using ethnographic knowledge gained from a society  against that society.23 The end of the war led to de- partures from the military enterprise. In part, this was  a diminished need for expertise after the triumph of  the Allied Powers, but also it was in part because, in  the aftermath of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan,  atomic detonations, the ethical implications of what  had just been done in the name of freedom made  many social scientists seek immediate egress from the  military enterprise.24  59 </page> <page sequence="6"> SOCIETY AT WAR The strength of the Soviet Union as a rival to U.S.  hegemony in the immediate post-war period main- tained a need for social science expertise in the mili- tary enterprise. After the collapse of a crucial U.S.- Soviet Union summit in Paris on May 17, 1960, U.S.  Senator John F. Kennedy was moved to outline a  new approach to foreign policy based on a 12-point  agenda in which he argued the necessity to “increase  the strength of the non-Communist world.”25 It was  necessary, Kennedy observed, to act against a “lack  of long-range preparation, the lack of policy-planning,  the lack of coherent and purposeful national strategy  backed by strength.”26 The perceived threat to the  United States and her allies by the uptake of Commu- nism was exacerbated by the end of the colonial era.  In January 1961, Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev  had pledged his support for wars of national libera- tion around the world. Insurgencies on different con- tinents threatened American interests and strategic  projection of power.  The relationship of anthropology to the Cold War  fighting, according to Seymour Deitchman, who was  involved on military research programs at this time,  grew generally from “America’s increasing involve- ment, after the Second World War, in the affairs of  the former European colonial empires” and more ex- plicitly from Vietnam—a “long and difficult war in  a strange and far-off corner of the world.”27 America  was involved in multiple theaters in which its influ- ence and therefore its ultimate survival were at stake.28  By necessity, given the spectrum of threats faced, a  broad array of military plans was undertaken; from  nuclear strategy to irregular warfighting: at President  60 </page> <page sequence="7"> Kennedy’s request in 1961, Congress appropriated  approximately U.S.$120 million for “expansion of re- search and development programs having to do with  limited war.”29  There are three facets to the application of social  science techniques to warfighting which arise time  and again. The first is that there must arise a crisis in  conventional military planning which necessitates so- cial science tools; second, that there is a common con- sensus on a specific research field in which social sci- ences will be useful; third, that in that research field,  social sciences will be able to contribute meaningfully  in the search for a solution to the problem. That third  aspect—proving useful to the production of a military  solution—has been consistently difficult to prove,  both historically and in the contemporary military set- ting, with the result that soldiers continue to wrestle  with attempts to resolve the discrepancies between  promise and delivery. When social science is unpack- aged from the box and presented to the military enter- prise, measuring the effect of social science expertise  is problematic.30 Social science can be used to explain  cause or predict effect, but both human spheres are  subject to myriad variables and the study of human  environments situates researchers as a variable in the  very domain they study. This phenomenon whereby  social science affords a promise which is difficult to  measure in terms of actual utility has been an unre- solved problem at the heart of the complex historical  relationship between the military and the discipline of  anthropology.  The promise of social science as an aid to decipher- ing the complexities of the post-colonial world was  important to the U.S. military enterprise. A Defense  Science Board report published January 30, 1965,  61 </page> <page sequence="8"> recommended the foundation of the social and be- havioral sciences geared toward national security be  built up through multidisciplinary centers for basic  research in selected universities.31 In 1964, the U.S.  Army developed a specific project to examine how  communist-driven insurgencies might take root and  spread. Named Project Camelot, its mission was to ex- amine “the feasibility of developing a general social- systems model that would make it possible to predict  and influence politically significant aspects of social  change in the developing nations of the world.”32 It  was Camelot’s work in Chile which broke the project  to the media; in June 1965, Chilean newspaper El Siglo  ran the headline, “Yankees Study Invasion of Chile.”33  Even though Camelot was subsequently terminated, it  was seized upon as evidence by Senators Joseph Mc- Carthy, J. William Fulbright, and Michael Mansfield  of an improper and expanding grasp of Department  of Defense (DoD) on foreign affairs, and social scienc- es funding was imperiled as a consequence. Indeed,  more generally, Fulbright considered that counterin- surgency (COIN) techniques suppressed valid nation- al aspirations toward legitimate independence.34 Camelot has been of signal import in the diver- gence of academia and the military enterprise after  the Vietnam War. Professor Hugh Gusterson, placing  the HTS within a wide historical arc, has compared it  directly to the Camelot project, the latter he labelled, a  “lavishly funded initiative to mobilize anthropologists  and other social scientists to investigate the origins of  peasant radicalism and insurgency and devise strate- gies to pre-empt, contain, and repress revolutionary  movements.”35 Therefore, Gusterson saw Camelot as  an important historical precedent which legitimated  the evolution of the HTS; a powerful analogous model  62 </page> <page sequence="9"> promising to decode cultures. Maja Zehfuss suggests  that the controversy over the HTS recalls Camelot in  two ways: First, anthropologists are again embroiled in contro- versy over a project that involves few of them but  may have serious ramifications for their discipline.  Second, in objecting to HTS, anthropologists have  again framed the problem in terms of professional  ethics, now armed with an ethics code which has been  revised since its initial formulation (AAA [American  Anthropological Association], 1998).36 That first code of ethics by the American Anthro- pological Association had been created by anthropol- ogy’s relationship with the military: the use of an- thropologists as advisors to DoD in Southeast Asian  villages led to adoption of a code in 1971.37 This code  reaffirmed that the primary obligation of anthropol- ogists is to protect the subjects of their studies. The  strong reaction from anthropologists resulted from  possible violations of this obligation by anthropolo- gists who may not have protected those that they  studied.38  Dr. Robert Albro, a moderating voice in the anthro- pologists’ critique and chair of the American Anthro- pological Association’s commission investigating the  HTS has argued that “Camelot is often cited as Exhibit  A in why we don’t want to do these things.”39 Albro  points out anomalies in attempts at comparison. First,  Camelot did not employ anthropologists. Instruc-  tively, Albro observes that:  This means that there is something we have to notice  about the way that conversation has gone within the  community of anthropologists, which is that there is  a narrative about anthropology’s engagement, that is  slightly mythologised, a kind of a Just-So Story. We  63 </page> <page sequence="10"> are not altogether critically grounded about our own  stories in this matter. This is a pity because what our  stock and trade would seem to be among other things  is ethnographic, grounded methodologies in all areas  of our work.40  This febrile atmosphere generated by periods of  protracted crises coupled to the mythologized char- acter of Camelot and comparable Cold War programs  makes their invocation frequent.41  THE LONG SHADOW OF VIETNAM While Camelot was the most high profile social  science-related project by the Army, there were other  projects at that time. The RAND Corporation had con- ducted a study upon the motivation of Vietnamese  insurgents, VC Motivation and Morale, the nature of  which was raised in questioning by a congressional  subcommittee in 1965.42 Project Agile coordinated the  Advanced Research Projects Agency’s social science  work; Agile’s social science projects fared better than  Camelot, avoiding the scrutiny of Congress such that,  during 1966-69, its small-survey work was allowed  to continue. So too, Project Themis, a program to en- hance the research of smaller universities by govern- ment funding led to research submissions for foreign  area work to DoD.43  By the mid-1960s, U.S. involvement in Vietnam was  becoming increasingly complex, and organizations on  the ground now included the State Department and  the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Therefore, it  was inevitable that, as part of a rising commitment to  be seen to understand the intricacy of the situation,  in May 1967 the Civil Operations and Revolutionary  64 </page> <page sequence="11"> Development Support (CORDS) was created and “un- ambiguously placed the military in charge of pacifi- cation.”44 CORDS was placed directly under the com- mand of General William C. Westmoreland. One of  the programs under its umbrella was the Intelligence  Coordination and Exploitation Program, created in  July 1967 and in December 1967 it was renamed as  Phoenix. By 1970, there were 704 U.S. Phoenix advisors  in South Vietnam.45 Deployed segments were divided  into two broad units: Provincial Reconstruction Units  and regional interrogation centers. The program was  part of a counterterror strategy in Vietnam and tar- geted the human infrastructure considered responsi- ble for perpetrating the insurgency. At heart, Phoenix  was a targeted killing program to disrupt important  nodes within an insurgent network.46 Its structure was  proposed as the model for a contemporary program  by COIN expert David Kilcullen. To counter what he  saw as an emerging global Islamic insurgency, in a  2004 paper, Kilcullen proposed a Global Phoenix Pro- gram.47 Kilcullen saw the future as using covert opera- tions, small footprints, and highly specialized forces  to disrupt the nodes. Anthropologists and behavioral  scientists could be used; for example, to “exploit the  physical and mental vulnerabilities of detainees.”48  Instructively, Kilcullen identifies a mythology aris- en from scholarly attempts to characterize Phoenix:  Contrary to popular mythology, this was a largely  civilian aid and development program supported by  targeted military pacification operations and intelli- gence activity to disrupt the Viet Cong Infrastructure.  A global Phoenix program (including the other key  elements that formed part of the successful Vietnam  CORDS system) would provide a useful starting point  to consider how disaggregation would develop in  practice.49  65 </page> <page sequence="12"> Each separate national insurgency—part of a complex  whole: demands intelligence collection and analysis capability  at the lowest possible tactical level. Local commanders  must have the means to analyze and understand their  own environment, diagnose key local system elements  and the best means of attacking them, and communi- cate this understanding across the force.50  Against the backdrop of Project Camelot and Viet- nam, anthropology’s relationship with the military  has been fraught. Presciently, writing in 1966 on the  Malayan Emergency, Robert Tilman argued that:  While anthropological knowledge is now necessary to  national security, the ethics of anthropologists must  be taken into account. In addition to direct discus- sion and debate on using ethnographic information,  policymakers and military personnel must be trained  to apply anthropological and social knowledge effec- tively, appropriately, and ethically.51 Explaining the shift from a largely consensual  academy in World War II to a divided Cold War  camp, Gusterson views the change as a generational  one. Whereas the “good fight” against fascism was a  relatively unproblematic ethical enterprise, the Viet- nam War saw a young generation of anthropologists  invoke the stance of Franz Boas in 1919, questioning  the myriad “private bargains” undertaken between  anthropologists and the U.S. military enterprise.52  Beneath the long shadow cast by the Vietnam War,  the relationship between the academy and national  security has been eroded. It shows starkly how the  context of the moral dimensions of wars flavors the  tension regarding anthropological engagement with  66 </page> <page sequence="13"> the military enterprise. After the Vietnam War, there  followed a period of introspection on the nature of the  activities previously undertaken. Dustin M. Wax has  argued that anthropology’s segregation from the mili- tary during the Cold War heralded a rapid ascent to  maturity as a discipline; that emancipation during this  period from its martial shackles allowed anthropology  to develop “an understanding of transnational flows  of goods, money, people, and ideas; finally moved  past the obsession with assimilation to discover nu- anced interplays between cultures even in the face of  massive power imbalances.”53  This period consistently has been depicted in  severe terms. Albro argues that it presented a:  wholesale change in the relationship of the academy  particularly the social sciences, specifically the social  sciences, with some obvious exceptions such as ecol- ogy primarily, with regard to the military as a social  institution, as a public institution in American society  from the Vietnam era to the present.54  Thus, in Albro’s view, there subsequently has been  generations in which there have existed:  virtually no relationship, no personal connection to  the military as a social institution, amongst anthropol- ogists, at least among those that form the professional  voice that shapes agendas around what it is should  quote unquote as a pronoun or shouldn’t be doing,  how we need to be thinking about these things and  what our reasoning is around it and our ethical frames  for going forward.55  It was thus that when the HTS was created against  the backdrop of severe objection to the invasions  of Iraq and Afghanistan, the discipline of anthro-  67 </page> <page sequence="14"> pology was poised to afford severe critiques of the  military’s interest in their signature methodologies  and ethnographies. These broad strokes delineating aspects of the his- torical tail of the story of the HTS serve a purpose.  As Albro argues, the relationship between anthro- pologists and the military enterprise has “been a very  persistent intergenerational story and a dilemma that  anthropology has wrestled with.”56 Yet, while these  strokes show the baggage of history with which the  HTS was reluctantly but inevitably encumbered, the  program has no perfect historical analogy. For that  reason, to paraphrase Mark Twain, the HTS is not a  repetition of history, but a rhyme. The program is the  latest in an often awkward dance between the military  enterprise and the academy, and expanded beneath  the still long shadow cast by the war in Vietnam.  THE WEIGHT OF HISTORY Given the historical tail therefore, the HTS was a  compelling story colored by the recent past. The earli- est media reports framed the program as the acme of  an academic approach to military operations required  for successful COIN operations in Iraq and Afghani- stan. The expanded HTS depended, at least in part,  upon developing the program’s profile in the aca- demic community and public sphere in order to both  attract applicants and buttress funding justifications.  To raise its head above the parapet, however, was a  double-edged sword: increasing general awareness  of the program—being a controversial collaboration  between civilians and soldiers in a time of war—sub- jected the HTS to scrutiny. Using anthropological  methods led to consideration of the program within  68 </page> <page sequence="15"> a historical trajectory, characterized as the latest in  a series of difficult military engagements with the  academy. In addition, the nature and efficacy of em- bedded teams were questioned. González has been  critical of the HTS claims of reducing civilian casual- ties, and more widely critical of the Iraq and Afghan  wars, which he saw as colonial enterprises.57 González  called the favorable press reports that emerged con- cerning HTTs a carefully choreographed public  relations campaign.58  Indicative of the ease with which conflicting as- sessments of the program could proliferate, González  also labelled the HTS a secretive organization wedded  to the covert national security state.59 Objectively, the  HTS is one of the most public-oriented programs in  the U.S. Department of the Army. It was a prominent  program in the nascent COIN modality of military op- erations and recruited civilian academics through an  open process. There was no covert element in its cre- ation or propagation, as seen by the myriad accounts  relating to it, and the Department of the Army has  continued to engage researchers of the program in the  hope of better understanding its optimum function.  Unlike covert elements of the national security state,  its former members publish widely on their research  in academic journals, doing so originally largely as  part of an outreach program, and latterly as part of  neutral contributions to scholarship.  The ambiguous initial assessments from academics  lacking deep research of their subject makes the HTS  such a pertinent subject to study. Its profile, dispro- portionate to its small size, is a result of its compelling  character and its ability to polarize opinion. Few com- mentators on the program were to emerge apathetic.  American anthropologist David Price, who became a  69 </page> <page sequence="16"> key critic of the program, made a Freedom of Infor- mation Act request for the assessment which led to  Colonel Martin Schweitzer’s claim in congressional  testimony concerning the quantitative reduction in  kinetic activity. In February 2008, after recalibrating  the initial praise, the U.S. Army admitted that no such  records existed. It is difficult to overstate the dam- age caused by this admission, demonstrating as it did  that the capabilities of the HTS were being praised for  results that did not exist. The only positive outcome  was that the Department of the Army was transparent  enough to return the inquiry. This admission fueled  criticism and entrenched each side in the debate, mak- ing collaboration more difficult. In defense, and to his  credit, Schweitzer composed a personal reply to Price,  stating that the HTT under his command had focused  his operations on the population, not the enemy, and  further that the team operationalized the Pashtunwali  code—an orally communicated ethical template gov- erning social norms among Pashto speakers—assist- ing the armed forces in application of a specialized  COIN methodology.60  While the admission from the Department of the  Army exacerbated the criticism, the core of the prob- lem in the debate remained that the professional  academic anthropologists were not using their own  signature methodology—ethnography—in their ex- amination of the program. Instead, examination was  often cursory and superficial, with material extracted  from newspaper articles. These expert ethnographers  were failing to conduct ethnographies of the HTS. As  a consequence, their findings were often generalized  and served only to obfuscate understanding of the  program.  70 </page> <page sequence="17"> The outside-in-perspective further served to dis- tance not only the American Anthropological As- sociation from the military, but distance the military  from the American Anthropological Association.  What could have been an exercise in collaboration,  conciliatory research, and cross-cultural communica- tion instead quickly degenerated into entrenched de- fensive positions, from which occasional salvos were  fired from each side. This was greatly to the detriment  of each enterprise, for the HTS posed no threat to the  American Anthropological Association. In addition,  the HTS was a broad church of social scientists such  that critique from a small section of expert anthro- pologists ultimately could not terminate the program.  Ultimately these agendas, one of practicality, the other  of ethicality, existed on divergent platforms such that  throughout the lifetime of the program in Iraq and Af- ghanistan, the discourse between the two entities was  irreconcilable. Academic interrogation of the program was com- plicated by the domestic U.S. political setting at this  time. There was significant opposition to the U.S.  military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan. Invasion  of the former was seen in many spheres as the action  of an imperial power, and many of the detractors of  the HTS were staunch critics of the wider U.S. mili- tary activities. The HTS public profile was thus ham- strung before it started the race; being a high-profile  civil-military hybrid program focused opposition to  the wars on a single entity. Criticism was not simply  about the quagmire of deciphering ethical boundaries  in conflict zones; it was also tied to the concern that  here was a program which required civilian academic  expertise and was fielded in support of a controversial  occupation.  71 </page> <page sequence="18"> Of the program itself, academic critique crystalized  into three distinct categories; debate concerning the  ethics of the program; efficacy of the embedded teams;  and the place of the program in the larger historical  context of military engagement with the social sci- ences. The debate emerged on myriad platforms: the  program has been the subject of a poem, a documen- tary, two plays, popular and scholarly books, as well  as articles in academic scholarly journals including Se- curity Dialogue, Anthropology News, and Anthropology  Today, and military ones such as Joint Force Quarterly,  Small Wars Journal, and Military Review.61 Both staunch  criticism and robust defense of the program were  characterized by a degree of hostility because of the  perceived stakes—literally life and death—such that  there emerged a difficulty in developing constructive  scholarship on this historically important program.  This hostility ties back to the broad context of the per- ceived illegality of the Iraq occupation and the HTS as  performing a core function in that occupation. Public  opinion was turning against the military enterprise by  late-2006, and many polls showed that the majority  of the U.S. population were against the war in Iraq.  Focused critique served only to make the HTS more  opaque to scrutiny. Indeed:  the effects of the polarization of the ‘debate’ surround- ing the HTS probably made it more difficult for struc- tural problems inside the program to be fixed while it  was on the road from a proof-of-concept program to a  program-of-record.62 Media and academic focus narrowed on the pro- gram and its processes as a result of the deaths of three  HTT social scientists in separate incidents between  2008 and 2009. These high profile fatalities (Michael  72 </page> <page sequence="19"> Bhatia’s life and death formed part of the 2009 docu- mentary, Human Terrain: War Becomes Academic; Nicole  Suvege’s death was delineated in Nathan Hodge’s  Armed Humanitarians; and Paula Loyd’s death was the  focus of Vanessa Gezari’s 2013 book, A Tender Soldier)  amplified scrutiny of the program. The result was the  retrenching of the HTS management to external in- quiry exacerbating the outside-in-perspective. Subse- quent analyses inevitably oversimplified the program  and skewed analyses because of the complications in  garnering a spectrum of interviews and gaining access  to program documentation.  What is required, however, is that a social science  research program’s development not take place in a  vacuum, entrenched against outside critique. The  program suffered to some extent from focused criti- cism in this early period. Yet, the goals and processes  of the program were so novel that collaboration and  nuanced analysis and review from academics would  have been invaluable. Neither did the program’s de- tractors emerge unscathed. The academics suffered  from examinations of the program which were colored  by the backdrop of the U.S.-led invasions of Iraq and  Afghanistan, the countries where HTTs embedded.  As a result, the character of social science research  by these novel HTTs has been largely obscured in  literature.  THE “JAUNDICED EYE” Members of the professional anthropological com- munity were concerned at appropriation of their disci- pline for military utility, although there was little clear  evidence about who owned the origins of these social  science tools that they fought over. In addition, the  73 </page> <page sequence="20"> unearthly ballet of research meant that the program  remained largely unintelligible. Aware of this tension  between the academy and military for which the HTS  had become a focal point, in 2008, Secretary of Defense  Robert Gates placed the problem within a historical  trajectory, arguing that each enterprise:  continues to look on the other with a jaundiced eye.  These feelings are rooted in history—academics that  felt used and disenchanted after Vietnam, and troops  who felt abandoned and unfairly criticised by aca- demics during the same time. And who often feel that  academia does not support their efforts.63   Gates ultimately conceded that at least some of  the blame fell at the feet of DoD, because it fails to  explain fully the functions of many of its elements in  language which is accessible outside of the profession:  “Like academia, the Pentagon has its own, shall we  say, unique approach to the English language.”64  This language gap complicated expression of the  character and content of the program successfully  bridging military and academic languages. This is not  a facile bridge to cross. The term “human terrain” does  not appear in nonmilitary academic literature prior to  the program’s inception. Gates argued in that speech  that the program’s name “appears almost designed  to induce maximum paranoia.”65 This evaluation is  borne out by the evidence. However, existing schol- arship currently identifies the first use of “human  terrain” as being in 1968.66 Reporting on the threat of  social disaggregation from militant groups such as the  Black Panthers, the United States House Un-American  Activities Committee concluded that domestic guer- rilla forces, while asymmetric in their material and  logistical support, nevertheless “possess the ability to  74 </page> <page sequence="21"> seize and retain the initiative through a superior con- trol of the human terrain.”67 In fact, the first instance when the term was used  was in a 1967 memorandum from then-Director of  the CIA Richard Helms to National Security Advisor  Walt Rostow.68 In the memorandum on the situation  in Vietnam, Helms wrote of the requirement of forces  aligned with U.S. interests to dominate political influ- ence of the local population, and that, to achieve that  goal, it was necessary to target the “Human Terrain.”69  This human terrain, the “target of pacification,” was  regarded as “highly fragmented by race, regionalism,  religion, politics, and an inherent mistrust of ‘out- side’ influence and authority.”70 The term resurfaced  4 decades later in 2000 when retired Army officer and  military analyst Ralph Peters considered the human  terrain of a city as being the dominant factor in urban  COIN operations.71 Montgomery McFate and Janice H.  Laurence, in their co-edited volume on the program,  identify that true credit for the term ”human terrain  system” belongs to Colonel Joseph Celeski, who Mc- Fate had referenced in an earlier article.72  Use of the term “human terrain” for a military  project led to criticism from academics because of  that disconnect between the discourses of the military  and the academy. Roberto González suggested that  the phrase will have objectifying and dehumanizing  effects,” although no examples of how that might be  in practice were provided.73 For Price, the U.S. Army  “does not just want to understand the cultural envi- ronment it is working in, it wants to change it to its  liking, and anthropologists are to be the tools lever- aging needed cultural knowledge.”74 These critiques  were augmented by the public articulation of the  military customer of the program. In the words of  75 </page> <page sequence="22"> Schweitzer, brigade staffs were motivated by a de- sire to reduce kinetic activity, and, in doing so, better  achieve national objectives: “Ultimately, success will  require us to change the environment and to do that  will require a continued deliberate focus on the cul- ture and population of Afghanistan.”75 This reduction  in kinetic activity would reduce collateral damage,  affording improved security and engender increased  relations of trust with the population. Armed violence  in these settings has a deleterious impact on attempts  to communicate with the population. Such scrutiny of a relatively small piece of the U.S.  Army enterprise occurred because the HTS served as  a focal mechanism for a more diffuse debate being  held in the academy over the appropriation of social  science knowledge and anthropological methodolo- gies more specifically by DoD to assist in the conduct  of the military. In 2002, Price warned that America’s  challenges in Iraq and Afghanistan raised:  numerous ethical issues that must be confronted by  anthropologists and their colleagues—especially those  concerning the integrity of the discipline of anthropol- ogy, as pressures to harness anthropological knowl- edge of other societies for military purposes and other  objectives re-emerge.76  Price argued that a clash between the ethical guide- lines of anthropology and the strong desire to serve  the interests of one’s country would be inevitable, as  had been observed in recent history.77  The perilous historical trajectory of anthropol- ogy’s relationship with the military was invoked by  those scholars concerned at their discipline’s relation- ship with DoD. Stressing the gravity of the evolving  situation, Price cautioned that:  76 </page> <page sequence="23"> wars raise the stakes for anthropologists, exposing the  nature of our commitments and principles, and, as past  wars and colonial campaigns have shown, anthropol- ogists as a group have served both the oppressed and  the oppressors. Many aspects of our field’s relation- ship with power remain unresolved.78  This meant that as the conflicts in Afghanistan and  Iraq became more complex and the apparent anthro- pological character of military operations burgeoned,  each side in the encounter refused to offer a concilia- tory stance. Under the FMSO initial plan to make the  program conduct research which was then logged in  an open-access database, the relationship between the  program and academia would have been less treach- erous, but would also have created data which was  of little operational relevance to the BCT. Fondacaro’s  plan to use embedded teams directly to influence  brigades on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan am- plified the stakes and made the possibility of appro- priating the discipline a matter of existential concern.  Fondacaro’s position was formed from his experience  as a battalion and brigade commander, and then as  JIEDDTF-Iraq leader; that more data or tools would  be irrelevant, and that the only solution would be  embedded human operators working with the BCT  staff.79 Embedded expertise enduring beyond a unit  rotation would prevent the 10-year war being fought  1 year at a time.  The recruitment of social scientists for warfighting  was seen as part of a wider securitization of public life  and hence a necessary site for concerted critiques of  the developments.80 Elements within the social science  community, which Dan G. Cox, Assistant Professor of  Political Science at the United States Army School of  77 </page> <page sequence="24"> Advanced Military Studies, labeled a “small but vo- ciferous chorus of pundits and academics,” argued  that anthropology’s re-engagement with the military  risked changing the character of the discipline.81  HTS thus served as a principal site for the anthro- pological debate on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The program placed academic experts in roles de- signed to directly influence the direction of conflict.  There was a notable lack of abundant and system- atically analyzed evidence to support these claims  against the program, and, because the two sides had  now become entrenched in defensive positions, there  was difficulty in gaining access to the program to cre- ate new information based on interviews or program  documents.  Anthropology as a discipline existed in tension  with the program because the idea of the HTS un- der Fondacaro, if not execution on the ground, was  spun from an appropriation of the discipline’s sig- nature methodology, ethnography, for a purpose of  national security. To some within the anthropologi- cal community, this was unacceptable. As Lamb et al.,  note, anthropology as a social scientific discipline is  relatively small in size; there are only approximately  11,000 members of the America Anthropological As- sociation, compared to for example, 137,000 mem- bers of the American Psychological Association.82  In focusing on the HTS, the criticism by a relatively  small academic community concentrated on a single  program in the U.S. military enterprise. The criticism  made the concerted arguments against the program  more pronounced than had been the case against the  broader military ventures in Iraq and Afghanistan  precisely because it engaged anthropology’s signature  characteristics.  78 </page> <page sequence="25"> For its proponents, defending both the concept of  the program and the execution of the idea was more  than the protection of the HTS; it was rather the de- fense of population-centered COIN as a whole. The  HTS and COIN became linked such that it was nec- essary in defense of COIN to defend the work of the  program and flaws were covered up. Supporters and  proponents of the program considered it ethical, that  it helped to save lives through more focused and effec- tive operations, was not involved in collecting intelli- gence that led to kinetic targeting of individuals, and  was a key way for anthropology to become relevant to  the shaping of operations in the field, and eventually  policy back home. In doing so, the discipline could  move away from the abstract field it had become in  the wake of its retreat from government after the U.S.  ended its military involvement in Vietnam.83  The wide parameters of the debate hinted at the  program becoming the focal mechanism for a genera- tional debate on anthropology’s engagement with the  military. But larger still, and with important implica- tions for the durability of the discussion, it could be  seen as a conversation regarding the application of  scholarship to any and all exploitative ventures, es- pecially those with national security implications. As  such, it posed a question: should the demarcation be- tween the academy and the nonacademy be distinct  and impermeable? This was a conversation with a  lineage; most recently regarding the use of anthro- pologists in corporate contexts in the 1990s.84 There,  too, concerns were voiced regarding the use of data,  and the possible exploitation of research subjects  and degree of transparency in the context of corpo- rate competitiveness.85 That period of anthropology’s  tense engagement with corporate America was linked  79 </page> <page sequence="26"> explicitly when accusations of McFate having at one  time been a corporate spy emerged in 2008.86 The focus anthropology as a discipline exerted on  the HTS has parallels, even within the Iraq conflict.  The American Psychological Association had earlier  focused on the Abu Ghraib controversy as a catalyst  for concern, allowing discussion of the utilization of  academic knowledge in intelligence interviewing tech- niques as they were being integrated into a broader  spectrum of torture.87 That central concern and alarm  about its situation within the national intelligence ar- chitecture broadly paralleled anthropology and the  HTS, taking ethnography and situating its use within  the national intelligence architecture. This debate was  not new to the field, only to the field’s current genera- tion of scholars.  Collaboration or Confrontation? From the academic side, the debate surrounding  the program should have been nuanced and deeply  researched, as befitting the program. Social science is  the deep study of society not for the benefit of social  sciences, but for society. Instead, the examination was  superficial and the language inflammatory. As much  as there was cause to evaluate the program, the magni- tude of the attacks and the core use of newspaper arti- cles devalued what could have been a chance to move  forward collaboratively with the military. Instead of  collaboration, the site of the HTS debate unfortunately  was one of confrontation. This friction had the added  consequence of making intricate academic research of  the program more arduous as fragile bridges of trust  between the sections of the anthropological commu- nity in the academy and DoD were unceremoniously  burnt.  80 </page> <page sequence="27"> The core space for that vociferous debate was the  American Anthropological Association’s Commission  on the Engagement of Anthropology with the U.S. Se- curity and Intelligence Communities. There were two  phases to the commission’s life which were associated  with two broad studies: The first, published on No- vember 4, 2007, was chaired by James Peacock, Emeri- tus Professor at the University of North Carolina, and  developed from concern at the CIA posting an employ- ment advertisement on the American Anthropological  Association’s website for professional vacancies and  the Pat Roberts Intelligence Scholars Program.88 This  first phase attempted to delineate the contemporary  engagement between anthropology and the national  security structure in the United States.  The HTS was included in the report as the public  discussion around the program was escalating.89 In  the report, a peripheral but emerging debate among  the panel was the extent to which HTT fieldwork  could be conducted in alignment with the American  Anthropological Association Code of Ethics or a ge- neric review board, given that the research would  be for a military customer among a population in a  contested space.90 Importantly, the commission iden- tified a primary issue with embedded teams regard- ing the primary obligation of anthropologists to “do  no harm.” Seeking to answer if the teams were used  “for” or “against” the population, the panel wrote that  team research is “framed by the military as undertak- en to ‘protect’ studied populations, but HTS studies  also present risks of using cultural research against  studied populations.”91  The peripheral examination of the U.S. Army pro- gram compared to its high profile necessitated a sec- ond phase of the commission beginning in December  81 </page> <page sequence="28"> 2008, when the American Anthropological Associa- tion asked the Commission to review specifically the  HTS in order to develop a concerted stance regarding  members’ participation in the program’s activities.92  This review was chaired by Albro, Professor of An- thropology at American University, based on his posi- tion in the first phase.  The priorities of the commission changed between  the phases.93 The second report was preempted by  the American Anthropological Association Executive  Board’s statement censuring the HTS on October 31,  2007, which was not entirely aligned with the broader  conclusions of the American Anthropological Associ- ation committee.94 While that committee in the second  phase was consulted by the executive board, there  was pressure from the rank and file to make a state- ment on the HTS, and they went ahead and did that  at that time without engagement with the program  and relied instead upon journalistic accounts of the  program, as they termed it “information in the public  record.”95  The executive board methodological shortcomings  and its terse 800-word indictment against the program  exacerbated the deepening divide between DoD and  the discipline of anthropology, and, more broadly, de- graded the way in which the military perceived aca- demia because of the board’s absence of evidence. As  much as this quickly released statement served to high- light the concerns on the American Anthropological  Association’s Executive Board, it would also alienate  sympathetic elements in the military enterprise that  would, as a consequence of the absence of research, be  dismissive of the critique. The board expressed grave  concerns that responsibilities of HTT members might  lie with their units, and that they could fail to iden- 82 </page> <page sequence="29"> tify themselves as anthropologists rather than military  personnel; concerns identified in “the context of a war  that is widely recognized as a denial of human rights  and based on faulty intelligence and undemocratic  principles.”96 In addition, the board noted the difficul- ty of getting informed consent in contested spaces, the  use of information for targeting and the toxic spillage  for non-HTS anthropologists of anthropology’s asso- ciation with the military in this instance.97  The executive board statement gave superficial in- dictments of the program’s activities, despite the pro- found questions posed by the first phase of the com- mission. In this regard, the board’s assessment served  to detract from the ongoing investigation which was  later led by Albro. The board made the statement  without contacting the U.S. Army program and relied  on journalistic accounts. Thus, that hastily erected po- sition contributed to entrenching the polarization of  the debate because it could so readily be dismissed by  proponents of the program as an inquiry using exist- ing journalistic accounts. In addition, the board noted  explicitly the illegality of the conflicts in which the  program teams operated, such that the broader con- text colored the assessment of the program activities.  In that regard, the HTS was a focal mechanism for  a much larger debate. Also—as has been seen in the  historical assessment—the greater the controversy of  the conflict, then the greater tension that exists in the  relationship between professional anthropology and  the military.  The second commission’s report was notable in that  participants did interview HTS administrators at that  time, including Senior Social Scientist and Director of  the Social Science Directorate McFate, and asked the  program management a set of questions and request- 83 </page> <page sequence="30"> ed a formal response, which they received, with the  answers included in the commission report appendix.  That second commission was composed of members  from both academic and nonacademic arenas, as well  as being composed of academics from different dis- ciplinary commitments.98 These commission members  arrived at the discussion from different viewpoints  and with different priorities.99  The broad character meant that other members of  the commission focused on the questionable ability  of embedded team members to get documented, in- formed consent in a conflict zone—another key com- ponent of the Association’s ethics code. But the core  conversation within the commission centered on the  distancing of the HTS from any institutional review  board, the application of outmoded theory, and the  perceived absence of organizational transparency and  of the research itself. The commission’s report suf- fered from the inevitable clash of multiple viewpoints  and priorities, as well as a lack of solid, aggregated,  and mutually reinforcing evidence about the specific  activities of different teams. The report offered the  broad conclusion that HTT work in the field was not  professional anthropology and was in contravention  of “disciplinary ethics.”100 The crux of the commis- sion’s assessment was: When ethnographic investigation is determined by  military missions, not subject to external review,  where data collection occurs in the context of war, in- tegrated into the goals of counterinsurgency, and in  a potentially coercive environment—all characteristic  factors of the HTS concept and its application—it can  no longer be considered a legitimate professional exer- cise of anthropology.101  84 </page> <page sequence="31"> The commission was correct: In these contested  spaces, this was a different form of interaction with  the population, distinct and different from engage- ment with the population in an ethnographic sense.  In contrast to the short assessment from the execu- tive board, the commission was tasked with formulat- ing a consistent and explicit stance on participation in  the HTS for the American Anthropological Associa- tion’s members but spoke more widely to “any social  science organization or federal agency that expects  its members or its employees to adhere to established  disciplinary and federal standards for the treatment  of human subjects.”102 The commission was therefore  widening the lens of the debate from the narrow dis- cipline of anthropology to a broader discussion of  the use of any of the myriad forms of social science  in research involving human subjects. The HTS was  therefore the principal site in the Iraq and Afghani- stan wars for renewed debate on the appropriation of  a spectrum of academic expertise in order to influence  or shape foreign populations.  As a principal site for scholarly debate of the ongo- ing population-centered COIN effort, the commission  asserted that gathering sociocultural information to  aid commanders’ planning on the ground risked the  program being able to single-handedly define “anthro- pology” for DoD.103 This is a conclusion cloaked in the  dramatic context of a divisive war; a conclusion which  was unrepresentative of the reality on the ground and  the research being conducted and the position of the  program in the DoD enterprise. As the commission it- self notes, the program was “one development among  many.”104  The HTS as a social science program implemented  rapid assessments of local populations where high  85 </page> <page sequence="32"> levels of selective violence inhibited the ability to con- duct traditional ethnographies. Conflict forces rapid  change of populations over time. For the HTS in prac- tice to influence the planning cycle of a brigade, a team  would need to conduct rough and ready operation- ally relevant reporting of the host society in ways that  were distanced from professional anthropology. This  could be understood by detailed analysis of research  products from the field. The problem in 2008 and 2009  when the commission was conducting its assessment,  however, was that despite the “extensive body of in- formation about HTS in the public domain,” the “vast  majority has been generated not by HTS employees,  or academics, but rather by journalists.”105 It is the  journalistic accounts which have exacerbated the level  of uncertainty over the research conducted by HTTs,  and the character of the program. The commission  was thus forced to sidestep the bulk of the existing  material on the program. As the program was ongo- ing and without complete access to HTT research, de- spite many interviews with HTT social scientists, the  commission’s assessments can only be, as noted, ten- tative.106 The core problem identified by the commis- sion is a perpetual symptom of study of the program;  that there are conflicting viewpoints on the nature of  the program and the experiences of the fieldwork,  and the sources are often contradictory.107 In addition,  its wider relationship with the military enterprise of  which it was, unquestionably, a small, esoteric part  was uncertain.  The program’s direct relationship to professional  anthropology is largely tangential. The commission  notes that the 2008 Human Terrain Team Handbook de- scribes how research methods for embedded teams  could “include classic anthropological and sociologi- 86 </page> <page sequence="33"> cal methods such as semi-structured and open-ended  interviews, polling and surveys, text analysis, and  participant-observation.”108 This is a broad attempt to  reference the sociological character of the program,  but certainly does not risk defining “anthropology”  for DoD, or appropriating professional anthropologi- cal practices for the program or professional anthro- pology’s signature methods, for instance ethnography  and core concepts, for example, culture.109 “Culture”  was an abstract concept without resonance in the prac- tical requirements of HTTs, while “ethnography” as a  professional practice requiring hegemonic control by  the incumbent to ensure security on the ground and  12 to 24 months among the population was, by defini- tion, impossible circumstances for HTTs in Iraq and  Afghanistan. The commission quotes an unnamed  HTT social scientist thus: “This is not ethnography. It  is translating abstractions into actionable recommen- dations.”110 The core concern was on the fidelity of the data  gained from working in a contested space in the pres- ence of a military force. These concerns are well found- ed, and an unnamed U.S. Marine Corps commander  stated that in such environments, interviews could be  considered that the research “looks more like push  polling.”111 This unwittingly strikes at the heart of a  much larger tension in DoD and data analytics more  generally between qualitative and quantitative data  signals. The honesty of the data derived from qualita- tive assessments in areas experiencing high levels of  violence is questionable. That must be compared to  the absolute values in quantitative assessments of hu- man centers, such as the price of foodstuffs or illicitly  traded weapons. This concern thus resonates because  it is part of a broader debate in which quantitative  87 </page> <page sequence="34"> assessments are likely to win out over qualitative re- search modalities. Qualitative uncertainty is propor- tional to physical insecurity.  On the issue of the HTS as an intelligence asset,  the commission observed with some explicit uncer- tainty that there is “significant likelihood that HTS  data will in some way be used as part of military in- telligence, advertently or inadvertently.”112 In part,  the ambiguity is a product of the uncertain nature of  what “intelligence” entails. Evaluating Joint doctrine,  the commission observes that “intelligence is pretty  much any form of knowledge production.”113 That  all-encompassing definition raises larger, potentially  discomforting questions about all knowledge, even  professional scholarship in the public sphere, being  employed in intelligence production. But, in part, also  this question regarding the uncertainty on informa- tion and intelligence was also due to the commission’s  conclusion that: “There is significant variation in the  ways that HTTs interact with the intelligence elements  in their area. This seems to rely, at least to some extent,  on the inclination of the people filling social scientist  roles.”114 The ethical character of the research lay at  the heart of this argument. Research guarantees both  anonymity and the safety of participants, or it does  not.115 It is a clear binary state. Teams could choose to  cross over the line or not, with the ability to choose be- ing facilitated, if not dictated, by the laissez-faire free- doms experienced in these contested spaces found in  Iraq and Afghanistan.  The commission foregrounded the ethical character  of the program and ethics dominate the broader pro- fessional discussion.116 The commission observed that,  in the creation of the HTS, the American Anthropo- logical Association’s Code of Ethics, which identifies  88 </page> <page sequence="35"> the need for “the establishment of voluntary informed  consent, taking care to insure that no harm comes to  research participants as a result of HTS research, and  full disclosure to research participants what will be  done with collected data,” appears to have been ig- nored.117 This is largely anticipated, given the applied  nature of the research: McFate has observed that in  developing the research modalities for the team, she  consulted the Society for Applied Anthropology’s  Code of Ethics.118  The character of this applied social science research  being developed by the HTS was unique and posed  problems in relation to standardized professional prac- tice. The American Anthropological Association in its  close inspection of the program in relation to ethics  concluded that “so far as we can tell, HTS does not cur- rently use an IRB [Institutional Review Board].”119 At  the level of the combat brigade, where there was high  operational tempo in areas experiencing high levels  of selective violence by insurgents, this was likely un- feasible in these contested spaces. Research was often  dictated by the transport available; where the military  logistics determine the opportunity for research—for  example, route clearance or resupply convoys. An IRB  would thus have to have been staffed 7 days a week,  for every hour of each day, and had a panel available  to assess the research proposals in the U.S. and send  them back to each team; in the rapid evolution of the  program, this type of novel IRB system seems unlikely  to be able to implement. With longer research modes  in regions where there are less pronounced insurgen- cies, the IRB seems not just feasible, but a prerequisite  for the HTS were it to continue to evolve beyond the  conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.  89 </page> <page sequence="36"> The American Anthropological Association chose  the ethical dimensions of the research to critique most  heavily rather than the value of the work done. Albro,  consistently eloquent and considered on the conver- sation between the profession of anthropology and  the military enterprise, voices concern about the dis- cipline’s persistent use of ethics “as its stock in trade,  to talk about where anthropologists should be, what  anthropologists should and shouldn’t be doing and to  define the lines between academic anthropology and  mostly everything else.”120 Moreover, the American  Anthropological Association and senior professional  anthropologists in the United States were not united  in their broad assessment. The Network of Concerned  Anthropologists, a group of professional anthropolo- gists that included members of the commission and  executive board, gave a petition to the U.S. Congress  in 2010 in a bid to halt funding of the program. The  petition was signed by six of nine living former presi- dents of the American Anthropological Association,  meaning that a third chose not to take an explicit stance  against the program in this manner.121 This absence of  a concerted stance; the different investigative modes  of the board statement and the commission; the varied  concerns of those members of the commission; and the  rapidly evolving nature of the program being studied  each contributed to ameliorating the impact of these  fundamentally important concerns of professional  anthropology.  Effectiveness, however, rather than ethics, argu- ably mattered most to the military customer. On the  back of Schweitzer’s estimated quantitative assess- ment of his embedded team’s contribution to a reduc- tion in kinetic activity, which was presented as fact,  the need for careful investigation of the program was  90 </page> <page sequence="37"> implicit. Indeed, the trenchant position of the Net- work of Concerned Anthropologists arguably hin- dered equitable discourse, but their point that there  is no evidence that HTTs are effective points to the  singular problem in appropriating social science re- search modalities for combat zones. How do you mea- sure success? The arguments of the professional an- thropologists were further hindered by the difficulty  in offering homogeneous assessment of the program  when there was a spectrum of voices in the critique  and a spectrum of voices from the program itself, often  generating conflicting viewpoints, was pronounced.  In 2012, Albro and Gusterson wrote that they  stood by the 2009 conclusions of the commission, spe- cifically that the program contravenes anthropological  ethics and falls short of professional standards for eth- nography.122 Based on the commission’s findings, Al- bro and Gusterson also expressed concern at possible  plans to reconfigure the program to a shaping tool in  regions where insecurity may prove to be problematic  to U.S. interests, noting that research conducted in a  military setting lacks the integrity to be considered  professional anthropology and that compared to oth- er engagements between the military enterprise and  anthropology, “HTS is different because it threatens  the integrity of that core relationship between anthro- pologists and their subjects.”123  This dominant theme regarding the ethics of  the profession stems from a larger concern which is  grounded in the historical military engagement with  the social sciences, namely, the actual utility of aca- demic knowledge which was used to defeat insurgen- cies. This is why Albro is right to identify the particu- lar emphasis placed on ethical research forms as an  issue of importance in and of itself. Historically, social  91 </page> <page sequence="38"> science research methods and theoretical conceptual- izations are integrated into military epistemologies for  actionable benefit. But the relationship has not been  continual or one of constant progress or evolution. In- stead, the complex discrepancy between expectation  and reality regarding what social science research can  offer the military enterprise has meant the historical  encounter has been wrought by opaque experiments  often curtailed by consistently uncertain ends. The  overarching question when the engagement between  anthropology and war is taken as a whole is: To what  extent does social science research augment the op- erational picture?124 Across generations, that question  has never been adequately answered, and it is for that  reason that we find this intergenerational story con- tinuing. Surrounding the detailed assessments by the  American Anthropological Association’s commission  and the statement of the board, the specter of the op- position to the Iraq and Afghan wars inevitably hangs  heavily over the existing debate on the HTS.  Toward Pragmatism. Packaging anthropological knowledge in a form  which was both comprehensible and actionable re- quired the use of parsimonious frameworks for mod- eling the operating environment. Presciently, Price  had suggested there would be a selective uptake of  anthropological methods when he wrote:  There is much of anthropology that the military does  not want: the military does not want anthropologi- cal critiques of power, imperialism, or neocolonial- ism. It does not want empathetic understandings of  ‘the other’ unless this can be used as an ‘asset’ for   ‘leveraging’.125  92 </page> <page sequence="39"> What was taking place in the crisis of Iraq was a  rapid and selective uptake of social science. As part  of that selective uptake and a site for sustained debate  was the program’s utilization of structural functional- ism. This theoretical construct was a social model of  the environment which had been fashionable in the  1950s but was now perceived as being outmoded.126  For HTS, however, there was significant utility in the  theoretical framework because it models society as  symbiotic elements which aggregate to a single organ- ism. In this model, propagated by American sociolo- gist Talcott Parsons, culture, traditions, and institu- tions are organs within the societal body, the function  of each impacting the viability of the whole. Address- ing one to the detriment of any other would distort the  fragile equilibrium, generating imbalance such that  the societal structure is disturbed. These anthropomorphic and reifying tendencies  of the theory were attractive to a military enterprise  modeling insurgencies in a resonant manner. The  model utilizes a consensus theory in which a coherent  society is developed through the architecture of or- der, a balancing of interest in those interrelated mac- roscopic elements upon which the society functions.  Pertinent to the COIN doctrine being propagated,  structural functionalism had the added advantage of  foregrounding the role of culture in shaping the so- cietal edifice; values, norms, ideas, and beliefs are all  causally relevant. Culture is the binding force to the  extent that it “is seen as a patterned, ordered system  of symbols that are objects of orientations to actors,  internalized aspects of the personality system, and in- stitutionalized patterns in the social system.”127  The contemporary position of the academic disci- pline of anthropology with regard to this model was  93 </page> <page sequence="40"> at odds with its renaissance in the military, however.  The academy had consigned this system to possess- ing largely historical significance, comparative to its  situation in the 1950s and 1960s as the “primary orga- nizing paradigm for most of American sociology.”128  As a criticism, using the model decades later funda- mentally misrepresented the intellectual moment of  the discipline of anthropology. Instructively, in her  1994 doctoral dissertation, McFate had already noted  that there lay a discrepancy between the scholarly  discipline of anthropology and military application  of its models, but argued for its relevance to the mili- tary as a simplistic model encouraging understanding  and constructing an intellectual bridge between the  military and academia:  Although structural-functionalist methodology has  long been unfashionable within anthropology, the  oscillating equilibrium model (with the addition  of population dynamics and catastrophe theory) is  now being used in military operational research for  predicting the oscillating force-structure patterns in   counterinsurgency.129  It demonstrates an aspiration within the military  for modeling the character of warfare in complex en- vironments; in this instance, the variation of force-size  around a central value with respect to time.  Moreover, as Gezari notes in her examination of  the program, as a student, McFate “wrote papers ar- guing that structural functionalism was invalid be- cause it objectified and dehumanized the subjects of  anthropological observation. But the pragmatist in her  rejected this argument.”130 Pragmatism in stabilization  and enabling operations is paramount in successful  planning and execution of plans; where decisiveness,  94 </page> <page sequence="41"> assertiveness, and clarity by necessity win out over  uncertainty, deference, and detail.  Structural functionalism can be viewed as a step- ping stone for military engagement with sociocultural  expertise resident in the academy; a tentative step to- ward collaboration between two poles; one emphasiz- ing the production of knowledge for unity of purpose,  the other, granular exposition of knowledge for no  particular end. This theoretical model thus served as  a platform for the military to move ahead in their con- ceptualization of the human terrain. Indeed, as Gezari  notes, rather than a traditional military predisposition  to amalgamating disparate elements such as “poli- tics, economics, social organization or the ideas that  people have in their heads,” unhelpful in explaining  tribal systems, kinship organizations, religion, and the  fact that “not all tribal systems are Islamic and not all  of Islamic societies are tribal,” there was the necessity  to make a distinction in order to “clearly explain to  people in uniform what is going on downrange [in  Iraq and Afghanistan].”131 Structural functionalism  therefore offered an accessible academic language  that could clarify the embedded work conducted by  the HTTs, as well as engaging existing conceptual  frameworks which the military enterprise was utiliz- ing for assessment of social environments in which it  operated.  The bridge between theory and practice may re- quire compromise. Teaching structural functionalism  to model and make resonant the human environment  in complex contested spaces is one such compromise.  As McFate explains, structural functionalism “is pred- icated on looking at society as a holistic entity and the  view that all parts are all elements of the society at  some function” but importantly, it must be thought of  95 </page> <page sequence="42"> as “a heuristic model, not as an accurate description.  Some way in which to capture a bit of social reality and  make it explicable to people who do not know what  these words mean, it is not such a bad approach.”132  As much as a model is a compromise between clar- ity and detail, so the teaching of the model itself is a  compromise.  Social scientists on embedded teams thus repre- sented a first attempt to bridge the gap between the  academy and the military in person, albeit function- ing amidst the high operational tempo of stabilization  operations. To enable conversation and collabora- tion, HTS taught its recruits basic social theory, and  tracked with structural functionalism by making  “society” analytically distinct from “culture,” some- thing which the military historically had not tended  to do.133 Struggling to comprehend the character of the  insurgencies developing in Iraq and Afghanistan, a  structural functionalist interpretation of culture was  the de facto lens through which to identify and un- derstand societal constituents. Perhaps the model’s  single greatest limitation was an absence of quantita- tive methods which allowed the statistical represen- tation of data. This approach therefore foregrounded  qualitative assessments of the environment in train- ing which were subsequently brought into the field  environments. Ultimately, however, a model is an ab- straction of reality according to a certain conceptual- ization and that model can facilitate communication,  learning, and analysis about relevant aspects of the  underlying terrain provided that the categorization of  that terrain is expressed in a language which enables  understanding. The model shows the divide between the contem- porary academic setting and aspects of the teaching  96 </page> <page sequence="43"> and training in the HTS program despite the possi- bility that structural functionalism may experience  an evolving renaissance in scholarship more broadly,  even beyond the confines of DoD. As shown by Mc- Fate, there is value in its application in a military  setting. But as a misrepresentation of the contempo- rary paradigms of the discipline, the concerns of the  American Anthropological Association’s commission  regarding the narrative that the HTS is able to direct in  DoD have some resonance: The potential problem here is that, despite the fact  that HTS is just one modest program, among many, to  which anthropology might contribute in DoD—and in  the security sector broadly conceived—its notoriety is  shaping prevailing wisdom about what anthropology  is and what the role of anthropology should be among  military and security policymakers, in ways that might  very well be to the detriment of everyone else, or other  more constructive arrangements, collaborations, and  ethical applications of anthropological practice and  knowledge.134 Despite this tense historical engagement and  contemporary setting against the backdrop of con- troversial conflicts, the program gained funding and  expanded rapidly. Given the controversial nature of  its existence and the granular critique from the Ameri- can Anthropological Association, I ask why the U.S.  Army embedded civilians in military units in Iraq and  Afghanistan to conduct research using social science  methods. In Chapter 3, I examine the origins of the  program and its evolution into a proof-of-concept en- tity with a physical home at the U.S. Army Training  and Doctrine Command (TRADOC).  97 </page> <page sequence="44"> ENDNOTES - CHAPTER 2 1.
