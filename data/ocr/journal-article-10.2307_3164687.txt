<plain_text><page sequence="1">Immediate Reactions to Darwin: The English Catholic Press' First Reviews of the 'Origin of the Species' JOHN LYON INTRODUCTION English Roman Catholic reactions to the issues presented by Charles Dar- win's On the Origin of Species (1859) were as varied as the elements which made up the English Catholic community itself. Any reading of the Catholic periodical press in England during the years immediately after Darwin's epochal publication will bear this out. These reactions ranged from a simple reaffirmation of childhood formulations of the account of creation in "Genesis," to rather dis- ingenuous allegorical reinterpretations of the meaning of what "Moses"-and Darwin-had said. But disingenuousness usually presupposes that a certain time for reflection has intervened between the event and the interpretation. This article is not con- cerned with premeditated and schematized responses, disingenuous or otherwise, such as that of St. George Mivart.1 Nor is it concerned with the involutions of Newmanian logic as applied to "development" or evolution. Newman said much on the subject, in his usual ambiguous fashion, over the course of several decades. He appears to have said very little about Darwin, or Darwinism, or "natural selection," however.2 Other prominent English Catholics had little to say about Darwinism. Lord Acton habitually turned over scientific issues to collaborators on the Rambler or the Home and Foreign Review. And though Cardinal Wiseman had initially drawn a well-considered picture of the relations between science and religion, he remained largely silent on this issue.8 Manning made a few deprecatory 1.

Mivart's On the Genesis of Species appeared in the same year (1871) as Darwin's Descent of Man. 2. Newman's best-known comment on the subject was the following: "There is as much want of simplicity in the idea of creation of distinct species as in that of the creation of trees in full growth, or of rocks with fossils in them. I mean it is as strange that monkeys should be so like men, with no historical connection between them, as that there should be no course of facts by which fossil bones got into rocks. ... I will either go whole hog with Darwin, or, dispensing with time and history altogether, hold not only the theory of distinct species but that also of the creation of fossil bearing rocks."

And this response is best measured by the reviews of Darwin's work which appeared in the English Catholic press in the Spring of 1860, just a few months after the Origin of Species reached the read- ing public. There were three significant English Catholic periodicals at the time: The Dublin Review, the Rambler, and the Tablet.5 The Tablet never formally re- viewed the first edition of Darwin's work. Each of the other publications did, and a study of these two reviews is the main purpose of this article. The issues raised by the more perceptive of these reviews have remained as permanent re- minders of the unresolved-and perhaps unresolvable--conflicts occasioned for Christians by the encounter between quantified, probabilistic materialism as ap- plied to "natural history," and the Christian providential outlook. Something will be said about these issues in the second half of this article. The reviews under consideration were the work of two men, Richard Simpson providing the essay for the Rambler, and "Canon W. Morris" for the Dublin Review. Simpson (1820-1876) was a convert to Catholicism with a peculiar penchant for theological controversy. An accomplished linguist and musician, Simpson was for a time the editor of the Rambler, and remained Acton's closest associate in the "Liberal Catholic" publishing venture. After the failure of this undertaking, Simpson took himself to the study of Shakespeare and the com- position of historical studies, the most noteworthy of which was a biography of Edmund Campion.6 Morris, though much less well-known than Simpson, was an ecclesiastical figure of some reputation in English Catholic circles, and a fre- quent contributor to the Catholic press.7 The two reviews run so parallel in 4. Manning admitted that he was particularly opposed to the turn which science had taken in his day. It seemed to him to operate on the basis of a "brutal philosophy," namely, that "there is no God, and the ape is our Adnam" H. E.

Dwyer, "The Catholic Press, 1850-1950," in George Andrew Beck, ed., The English Catholics, 1850-1950 (London: Burns and Oates, 1950), pp. 475-514. The Tablet reviewed the sixth edition of the Origin in its May 25, 1872 issue. There were other Roman Catholic periodicals, such as Wilberforee's Weekly Register. Alvar Ellegard [Darwin and the General Reader (Goteborg: Elanders Boktryc- keri Aktiebolag, 1958)] never mentions this periodical in his extensive survey of the liter- ature. 6. Though a biography of Richard Simpson should be forthcoming shortly from the re- search of Fr. Damian McElrath, biographical information about him is available in the Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford, 1917), 18, p. 276; and in the Catholio En- oyclopedia, old or new editions. For the identification of Simpson and Morris as the authors of the reviews in question, two sources have been relied on: Josef L. Altholz, The Liberal Catholic Movement in England (London: Burns and Oates, 1962), p. 139 (Simpson); and the "General List of Articles, Vols. 1-118 (1836-1896)", Dublin Be- view, 118 (April, 1896), p. 489 (Morris). 7. The positive identification of Canon Morris is hampered by the fact that neither edition of the Catholic Encyclopedia nor the Dictionary of National Biography list a "W. Mor- ris" - other than the well-known author - whose career might approximate that of a Morris who composed the Dublin Review's review. One is left to conclude that the "W. Morris" named as the author of the review in the "General List" is simply a misprint for "John Morris," (1826-1893), a convert to Roman Catholicism and, after 1852, Canon of Northampton. This John Morris was for a few years Vice-Rector of the Rnglish College in Rome. He became a Jesuit in 1867. He was also a frequent contributor to the Dublin Beview and other Roman Catholic publications. See DNB, 13, p. 995; and CE (New York: Appleton, 1911), 10, pp. 576-577. Professor Altholz informs me that "about 79</page><page sequence="3">CHURCH HISTORY places that one might suspect that they were composed by the same individual, and it is at least theoretically possible that Morris saw Simpson's review before completing his own, for the Spring issue of the Rambler appeared a few months earlier than the similar issue of the Dublin Review. For this reason, the Rambler's review-and the Rambler's reviewer- will be considered first. I Simpson had given considerable attention to the general issues at variance between "science" and "religion" and to specific issues concerned with man's origin and the question of evolution in previous issues of the Rambler. For ex- ample, in 1850 he contributed a lengthy four-part article on "Religion and Moder Philosophy." Appearing in monthly installments between September and De- cember of that year, Simpson's article argued for the comprehensive nature of true religion. He cited Lactantius' De Vera Sapientia (iii) on the consequences of the separation of religion from reason, and the consequent compartmentaliza- tion of life: "The worship of the gods has not wisdom . . . because it has no moral precepts to give, no model of life to propose, no inquiry after truth, but only a form of worship requiring no exercise of the mind, but only the use of the hands. . . . Philosophy and religion are completely distinct; the professors of wisdom make no attempt to lead men to the gods, the priests do not think of teaching wisdom ... ." This was a sort of disjunction which appeared to Simpson to be tragic, and he consistently tried to avoid it. He saw in Roman Catholicism alone of moder forms of worship the actual binding together of these two realms of human endeavor. For Roman Catholicism held that whatever God has made is good, and its Creator may be worshipped through its use.8 There was a danger of obscurantism hovering over all religious belief, though, Simpson felt. But he argued that doubt had to be squarely faced, and not avoided by taking refuge in formularies, or by a simple refusal to admit the issues. Though cowards were victorious in the warfare with the flesh, intellectual doubt had to "be met fairly and openly, combated and turned out by force of reason."9 Just as he was no obscurantist, neither was he a simpleton. In the best of Catholic traditions, Simpson loved to make distinctions. He held, for example, that though Christians had to believe that God created all things out of nothing, they were not obliged to believe that this creation took any particular form.10 Simpson insisted further that in the interpretation of the inspired Scriptures we must be careful not to fall into literalness of interpretation. "If Josue says that the 'sun stood still,'" he wrote, "we cannot therefore conclude that the Holy Ghost meant to support the Ptolemaic system of astronomy."11 He held that the Church had no supernatural guidance in matters of physical science; but it was of the very nature of the Church's belief that faith and intellect were not ex- clusive functions. As a result of this situation, an immense and continual work of scientific interpretation had to go on, generation after generation, concerned 1860" Morris became Cardinal Wiseman's secretary, and thus it might be concluded that there is a semi-official character to his review. See Wilfrid Ward, The Life and Times of Cardinal Wiseman (London: Longman, Green, 1898), 11, pp. 255 ff., for men- tion of Morris' association with Wiseman. Though the nature of this association is not explicitly detailed there, Morris' association with the Cardinal seems to date from earlier than 1860. 8.

Though any particular inter- pretation of the meaning of Scripture would prove ultimately inadequate, it need not be entirely erroneous. And such muddling attempts at synthesis had to go on, for science must be translatable into religion, and religion into science. The second and third parts of Simpson's article were bent toward a recon- ciliation of the "Mosaic" account of creation, figuratively interpreted, and the under- standing of "moder science" regarding creation and the nature of the universe as embodied in Humboldt's Cosmos. Needless to say, Simpson felt that he succeeded in the task; but this question need not detain us here. In the final section of the article (December, 1850), Simpson took up some of his initial considerations once more, attacking the Pyrrhonsim, solipsism and subjectivism of modem phi- losophy, and insisting that Christianity alone measured things by an external standard-Christ.12 For Humboldt, as for moder science, religion was purely a matter of feeling. As a consequence, Simpson wrote, when "science" shows to such a man as Humboldt the discrepancies and contradictions within his system of belief, he is obliged either to choose reason (science) or stop thinking. For Humboldt, "Genesis" became a myth, and Christianity "despondent mysticism," and "fanaticism."18 Modem science viewed the church as a vestigial organ. The contemporary function served by religion was therapeutic: it was necessary for the "sanitary condition of the mind of the masses, as baths and washhouses, parks and cricket-grounds, are to their bodily health. The philosopher, or statesman, or merchcant, or physician, may fearlessly neglect it ... ."4 For Simpson, the rational empiricism in which Humboldt and "modern science" pride themselves could only provide a "classificatory inventory of the contents of the universe," a catalogue of the "number, magnitude, and specific differences of phenomena." The "religion of nature" which Humboldt proposed as fit for the modern man of science was, so far as Simpson could see, a pure obiter dicta. It no more followed from his premises than did the doctrine of the Trinity.15 Ten years later, in his review of the Origin of Species, Simpson would make exactly this same sort of disjunction between Darwin's scientifically verifi- able facts and his mythological conclusions. Simpson had a positive genius for getting involved in theological imbroglios and angering the Roman Catholic theological establishment. It is only what one would expect of him, however, for he had been an Anglican cleric before his con- version, and, by training, his talents had been bent in a theological direction. This 12.

On Sept. 18, 1861, Charles Darwin noted in a letter to Fawcett: "About thirty years ago there was much talk that geologists ought only to observe and not theorize; and I well remember someone saying that at this rate a man might as well go into a gravel-pit and count the pebbles and describe the colors. How odd it is that any one should not see that all observation must be for or against some view if it is to be of any service." (Cited in Gamaliel Bradford, Darwin (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1926), pp. 44-45.) It seems that Simpson wants to restrict Humboldt and other "rational empir- icists" to counting and describing. But what he is really saying is that you can not have it both ways: you can not get from rational empiricism to revealed religion, and only revealed religion can tell you about ultimates such as the creation of the world and the nature of nature. So if you want to issue authoritative statements about abstractions such as "religion", "science", and "nature", you must have recourse to revelation, or at least to metaphysics. It is simply dishonest to pretend to avoid metaphysics, and then sneak it in surreptitiously. And this is what Simpson accuses Humboldt of doing when he undertakes to speak about a "religion of nature," and what Darwin does when he speaks of "observation" having to be for or against some "view" if it is to be of any "service " 81</page><page sequence="5">CHUlkCH HISTORY tendency led him to contribute an article to the Rambler in 1855, for example, which bore the title: "The Immaculate Conception Viewed in Connection with the Doc- trine of Original Sin." His temerity in writing it, and the theological con- troversy it raised need not be an issue here. What is of more immediate con- cern is a comment which Simpson inserted in a lengthy letter to the editor of the Rambler (May, 1856) concerned with issues raised in his article on the Im- maculate Conception. In speaking of the state of nature and the nature of original sin in his letter, Simpson asked if it were not reasonable to assume that God inserted man into the organic world, a world which had been "progressing" through eons, making man but a slight step more advanced than the ape. Man would thus form but one more link in the great chain of being, and the analogy of being would not be disrupted by the anomalous insertion of a being qualitatively different from the rest of creation. The Christian view of man, on the contrary, refused to admit that man had only progressed in the past. He had fallen from some praeteratural state. Simpson's reply to his own question was that, insofar as man was merely "animal," a sort of progressive evolution was quite admissable. Adam was "simply the highest link in the animal series; he was not civilised man . . ." But insofar as man was more than animal, his creation was both miraculous and instantaneous. This sort of distinction, then, Simpson had worked out quite explicitly at least four years before his review of Darwin's work.16 When he came to review the Origin of Species in the Spring of 1860, Simp- son had behind him a decade of reflection on the issues which were to be raised in such a signal manner by Darwin's work. One by one, the problems which he had wrestled with concerning reason and faith came up in his reading of the Origin. Simpson asserted that the new form of infidelity of the day represented by Darwin's work-a true infidelity beyond the realm of Christian sectarian con- troversy-could only be met by ignorance or by argument, since forcible repres- sion was impossible. Though admitting the blandishments of ignorance, Simpson felt that "a blind confidence in the inert force of ignorance is sure to lead some minds to confound ignorance with simplicity of faith."17 From this confused premise it might logically follow that simplicity was the true hallmark of faith, and that that faith which needs "subleties of argument" to defend it cannot pos- sibly be either true or worth much defending. Then, using the word "liberal" in the same sense as Newman used the word in reference to his opponents at Oxford, Simpson pointed out that by thus leaving the door open for subtle argu- ments against the faith and simultaneously closing it against those who would defend the faith by means of reason, "dogma after dogma has been scratched out from the liberal Christian's creed."18 Thus ignorance was not the answer to the attack on Christianity launched by modern science. Argument must be haz- arded by the Christian apologist. Those who trust that all truth is one may enter 16. Ibid., 343. Three other articles which Simpson produced which are concerned with the same sort of issues as taken up here might be mentioned: "Galileo and His Condemna- tion," Rambler, 9 (Jan., 1852); "Literary Cookery," Rambler, N.S. 7, (March, 1857); and a review of Mansell's "Bampton Lectures," The Limits of Religious Thought Ex- amined, Rambler, N.S. 10 (Dec., 1858). 17.

Whatever facts Darwin had fairly established, were in- deed established.lg Simpson then undertook a brief historical discursus, the purpose of which was to show that Darwin's thesis (by which he meant, here at least, "evolu- tion," as opposed to "natural selection") could not be considered original. Mon- boddo, Lamarck, the author of the Vestiges of the Creation, and others are men- tioned as modem precursors of the idea that all forms of life developed from one primeval organism. Darwin's particular contribution, that is, "natural selection," Simpson thought quite unoriginal as well. He cited the famous passage in which Aristotle poses the question of whether the rain falls in order that the corn may grow, or whether the growth of corn is a merely accidental consequence of the rise, cooling, condensation and precipitation of water vapor.20 Simpson saw Darwin's thesis as lacking scientific rigor also. It was rather mythological than scientific, "for it professes to give an account of the origin of man, of animal, and of plants."21 This mythological strain, however, was mixed up with a peculiarly impressive array of scientific facts. For Simpson, the my- thology was quite fabulous, the facts most striking.22 There then enters into Simpson's review an analogy which he never quite carries to completion, though the elements of it are scattered throughout his ar- ticle. He is suggesting that the "fabulous" mechanism of natural selection which Darwin adduces as being responsible for the development of life is a modern equivalent of the "philosopher's stone." Simpson specifically mentions early in the review that there is as broad a gulf between Darwin's mythological con- clusion and his impressive collection of facts as there was between the conclusions and experiments of the alchemists.23 No argument could ever connect them. Later in his review Simpson wrote: "As Mr. Darwin believes that all organisms descend from one parent, so alchemists and chemists have believed that all ele- ments are only various forms of one primordial matter."24 Such assertions, Simp- son felt, were beyond proof. They might be believed, however. And though one must deny their truth, one might yet admit their utility as scientific hypotheses.25 From Simpson's point of view, Darwin compounded the confusion between truth and utility by adducing the utility of his hypothesis as proof of its truth. Simpson quoted Darwin's summation of the thirteenth chapter of his work as an illustration of this confusion. Darwin asserted that he would believe in descent with modification from common parents even if no other arguments favorable to this belief were forthcoming. Simpson then noted that he was not surprised to find Darwin asserting the logical as opposed to the inductive nature of his theory. Darwin obviously had not learned the scientific distinction between the truth and the utility of a hypothesis.26 It appeared to Simpson that a menacing gulf was opening up as a result of Darwin's work. On the one side one had the "new order of metaphysicians" (the positivists), who "refuse to allow that any thing which has physical con- 19. Ibid., 363. 20. Bambler, March, 1860, 363.

If the creationist admitted the premises of the positivists, Simpson felt that the former could not win any argument with them. Darwin only showed his dialectical feebleness by challenging creationists to explain the various "facts" he set forth. Once one admits that there is a scale of being and that it is gradu- ated, then it makes no difference whether we assume a common progenitor for all beings or assert that the scale is composed of distinct beings varying in degree from one another. Actually, Simpson said, similarity of structure ought not trouble the creationist. It was no greater proof of identity of origin "than morpho- logical similarity of crystallization in minerals need prove identity of their con- stituent elements." This same argument might be made for embryological sim- ilarities. It might indeed be fitting that the embryo of higher forms of life go through developmental stages in which it resembled lower forms. Just because at one stage of our development we look like worms, one may not conclude that we were worms.28 Between this new order of metaphysicians and the older order, then, an abyss of methodological difference was appearing. Simpson felt that the strug- gle against the positivists would have been difficult enough if the latter had been logical enough to restrict themselves to empirical procedures. But this they had not done. Like Darwin, they had jumped the gap between facts and metaphysical theory.29 Simpson criticized those reviewers of Darwin's work who had allowed the author to move from his splendid marshalling of facts to his fabulous con- clusion without noting the disparity.80 Simpson was also disturbed by those who, like Darwin, claimed that if one refused his hypothesis it then followed that one could not accept his scientific facts and the laws which such facts implied. Simpson then devoted a long section of his review to the proposition that the creationist theory need not imply the type of divine intervention which "spe- cial creation" had come to assume. Quoting the Fathers, Simpson concluded that "law and regularity, not arbitrary intervention, was the patristic ideal of creation."31 The laws of creation were such that creative activity was not exercised "by fits and starts, by catastrophes and miraculous interposition; but by an equ- able ever-present force, embracing all nature."32 For those who posited a di- vine creation of the world, all that they needed to assert was that the observable facts of the natural world were not the results of chance, or the results of some 27. Ibid., 371. But as we have seen, Simpson had suggested in his articles on "Reason and Modern Philosophy" that rational empiricists surreptitiously introduced a form of metaphysics despite their protestations to the contrary. 28.

This position, it was made clear, was not that genera- tive powers were inherent in nature, but that they were inherent in nature with- out reference to the power of God.84 Charles C. Gillispie has observed that behind the struggle over uniformitarian- ism in geology and Darwinism in natural history, the real issue was the tendency of these movements "to remove the hand of God from the course of events in the material world."85 Simpson's review might be cited as a partial proof of this assertion. Far beyond all sectarian lines, most Christians could never admit any hypothesis which reduced God to the position of a demiurge shaping matter already in existence. Nor, obviously, could they accept any cosmogony which omitted God entirely, or reduced him to some sort of vague, impersonal force. The Christian God, like the Jewish, has always been a "person." His eye has been on the sparrow, and not a hair falls from one's head without its significance and his fore-knowledge. What Darwin had done, of course, was to replace growth with design or purpose, by natural selection. There was no conscious end which the process served. Those who survived did so because they were the fittest. And they were the fittest simply because they survived.86 Though Ro- man Catholics could and did accept evolution, they were never really able to ac- cept natural selection.87 In his review, Simpson brought into action "the heavy artillery of Aristotle and the Fathers," as Willey has noted.88 Simpson blamed much of the popular apprehension over the discoveries of natural science on the bastardized view of Genesis brought about through the acute anthropomorphism of men such as Mil- ton. It had been Milton's assertion, for example, that before the Fall of man the beasts had lived without struggle. This had not been the traditional Ro- man Catholic view, Simpson pointed out. To illustrate the puerility of Milton's position, Simpson quoted St. Thomas, who had stated that it was altogether ir- rational to assume that animals now fierce and carnivorous had been gentle in Paradise.89 Simpson had little sympathy with such vulgarizers as Milton, and even less sympathy with the sort of anthropomorphism to which such private interpreta- tion led. After pointing out once more the failure of scientists to perceive the difference between the utility and the truth of an hypothesis, Simpson noted that theologians had acted similarly. They had often attempted to arrest the develop- ment of a science in the name of an unauthorized interpretation of Scripture. Such opposition was often but a screen for "idleness, ignorance, and timidity," 33. Ibid., 373. 34. Ibid. 35.

When a scientific principal made its way into popular opinion, and got mixed up with popular faith, then those who held such popular faith and opinions naturally opposed those who would change their convictions. Such upholders of popular religion showed no concern for "the difficulties and dis- tresses of the learned."40 Simpson continued distinguishing and uniting the realms of science and theology in his 1861 Rambler articles on "Reason and Faith."4 While insisting on distinguishing the methodology appropriate to each area (experiment and in- duction for science; authority or revelation for theology), he yet insisted on the necessity of each area for the other, and upon the necessary congruity of their results, properly understood. The proper order of things was destroyed when authority was intruded into science, whether the authority be that of St. Paul or Aristotle. Likewise, when dogma was made a matter of "experiment," the mind was deranged. Induction and authority were polar opposites, but they were the poles of the same mind.42 In Kantian terminology he worked out the relation of speculative reason to practical reason, of noumena to phenomena. It is beyond the scope of this article to follow Simpson's exegesis in these two articles in detail. But the general argument of these articles might be mentioned, and one instance of temporary inconsistency in his argument noted. Simpson maintained that the Church, or the theologian, had the right and the duty to speak out on issues not directly concerned with "faith, morals, or discipline." For otherwise it would be admitted that religion was simply senti- ment or subjective feeling-something of neither social nor scientific concern. When the Church does intervene in issues which are scientifically adjudicable, however, it does so with no guarantee of infallibility.4 When the Church prohibits the adoption of a scientific theory, it cannot ask for the interior assent of the believer to its prohibition, an assent like that he would give to an article of faith." Simpson then remarked-somewhat inconsistently with the main thread of his argument-that it is even to be hoped that the Church has outgrown the pen- chant for issuing such prohibitions, just as society has come to let the multitude of various opinions take care of themselves.43 This note of laissez-faire theology is immediately counterbalanced, though, by Simpson's suggestion that the Church must act as the nurse of the habit of faith Then, in a consideration somewhat extrinsic to his main argument, Simpson notes that if society "wants the Church to keep the uneducated masses quiet and virtuous through the influence of faith, society must agree not to mar her work by offending the faith of these masses." Ideas have consequences, Simpson is saying, and "the stewardship of ideas is as much a public trust as the stewardship of wealth."4" The Church, then, has the obligation of pronouncing on the tendencies of ideas as they are scientifically elaborated. And perhaps it is inevitable that it exceed its warrant in issuing injunctions and prohibitions in this area, acting as if it were infallible in matters of science. But the Church is not, and cannot be made so. The gist of Simpson's writings on science and theology seems to 40. Rambler, March, 1860, 374-375. 41.

Scientist and theologian meet on a muddy middle ground, the "darkling plain, where ignorant armies clash by night." Perhaps Simpson intuitively and inarticulately saw that the Darwinian hy- pothesis in biology was what could be called the ideological prejudice of the English middle class extruded upon the body of "Science." He saw "natural selection" as the biological equivalent of laissez-faire economics, and was revolted by this whole Democritian world-view which celebrated chance. Chancel + chance2 + chance8 . . . for him gave as a sum simply quantified nonsense. It never al- lowed one to speak normatively, even in terms of such "normative" concepts as "origins" and "species." What was at issue was not just "logic" or "facts," or "hypotheses," or the nature of induction, but the conflict of two great world- views, the "random" and the "providential," as Gillespie pointed out. Simpson's view of the nature of science had itself evolved somewhat since the time when he had composed a prudential defense of the Church's action in the Galileo case.47 There he was willing to defend the Church's action on the grounds of its social utility. Eight years later, he concluded his review of Dar- win's work with a quiet contrary exhortation. Though contemporary opinion is partially based upon the contributions of the timid and the ignorant, time has been the great antidote. It allows the worthless to wither and clarifies the wis- dom of the wise. Just so, Simpson felt, the true wisdom of his own age was largely inaudible because of the hubbub of the unnatural conflict between science and religion. Since the time of Roger Bacon, relations between the Church and science had grown worse, aggravated by the intolerance of the Church for men of original views. The increasing enmity of men of science for the Church, caused by this intolerance, illustrated the proverb that "A man can make even his own dog bite him." By becoming the champions of popular opinion, Chris- tian controversialists had tempted men of science into degrading opinions that were initially only paradoxical or novel into becoming real and conscious at- tacks upon religion.48 II The Dublin Review's consideration of Darwin's On the Origin of Species was in many respects as sensitive as Simpson's. Like Simpson, Morris noted the fluctuations in scientific thought through which a generation had just passed. The oscillations seemed to cancel each other out. Just a short time before Darwin, the literate had been told that the differences in human anatomy were so great that all men could not possibly be descended from one set of parents. Now Dar- win would derive not only all men but all animals as well from four or five prototypes. The genealogy of plants was to be similarly traced, and, ultimately, all forms of life would be derived from one primordial organization of matter.49 The Dublin Review also took Darwin to task for his jibes at creationists. For Darwin had his fun with those like Philip Henry Gosse who had proposed that God put fossils in the rocks to tempt geologists into infidelity and had created mammals "bearing the false marks of nourishment from the mother's womb."50 47.

The work seemed so genuinely valuable, so broad, comprehensive, dispassionate and perceptive, that Morris was grieved to see Darwin interject the "gratuitous" and "repulsive" idea of natural selection.51 Morris also perceived that the kernel of Darwin's contribution was that the theory of the role of competition for sustenance in nature did what the stock- breeder does with domestic animals.52 Though not objecting to the theory as such, Morris felt that Darwin carried it to absurd lengths; to a point, that is, where it came into contradiction with revelation.68 Morris was unwilling to make adaptation to environment, or the struggle for existence, into a universal law. He asserted that some forms of life seemed not to have changed much throughout the ages, and that any attempt to con- struct a genealogical chart of the development of life beyond the generic classi- fications was certainly unwarranted, particularly since the absolute evidence for the genealogical relation between species of a genus was not available.54 Ultimately there is grand confusion in this review. Although precisely what Morris meant by the "Mosaic account of creation" is uncertain, the confusion be- tween fact and theory on his part was as noticeable as Simpson had insisted it was with Darwin himself. Begging the question of what was science and what revelation, Morris insisted that Darwin's arguments, in so far as they were scien- tific, were quite serviceable to religion. But as soon as Darwin contradicted the Mosaic account, he posited a simply gratuitous hypothesis.55 Perhaps the underlying uncertainty behind many unfavorable reviews of Dar- win's work came out in the rhetorical question Morris asked his readers. "Is it an ennobling idea," he asked, "that a pedigree which ends with, 'who was the son of Adam, who was the son of God,' is to be supplanted by a descent, as long as you please, from some Ante-Silurian cellule?"56 In both the reviews, that of the Dublin Review and of the Rambler, the in- sistence upon the distinction between hypothesis and truth reminds one of certain features of the Galileo case. One citation will suffice to illustrate the parallel. Cardinal Bellarmine, replying to Paolo Antonio Foscarini (a Carmelite who un- dertook to defend the Copernican-Galilean system of the heavens) in a letter dated April 12, 1615, wrote advising Foscarini and Galileo to be content with "speaking hypothetically and not absolutely." To say that, if one supposes the sun immobile and the earth mobile, "celestial appearances are explained better . .. is to speak with excellent good sense and to run no risk whatever." The danger entered, Bellarmine insisted, when one wished to assert "that the sun, in very truth, is at the center of the universe and only rotates on its axis." This is an at- titude certain to rankle scholastic philosophers and theologians, Bellarmine warns, and it is certain to injure the faith by contradicting the Bible.57 It has often been pointed out that Darwinism, scientific or social, is the ideology 51.

Natural selection, or "survival of the fittest," is only the model of the actual struggle for goods and services ob- servable in the English "marketplace."58 Darwin, of course, admitted his debt to Malthus' formulation of the laws regarding the pressure of a potentially un- limited population upon obviously limited resources. Malthus' "Essay on Popula- tion" drew together several strands of thought for Darwin.59 Now, Simpson and Morris had admitted that it was of great utility for Dar- win to draw up a model of the operation of the "laws" of nature. It showed a high degree of imagination and might conceivably lead to other discoveries. But to postulate the truth of such a system was preposterous. Pierre Duhem has noted that it was possible to attribute light to a virtue of brightening, or to luminous corpuscles, or to luminary motion. By so doing, one was classified as either an Aristotelian, or an atomist, or a Cartesian, respectively. "But if one boasts of haviIng in that way added a particle to our knowledge concerning light," Duhem concluded, "he does not have a sound mind."60 Though both Simpson and Morris were apparently unaware of the social significance of Darwin's ideology, they were not unaware of the difference be- tween an intellectually consistent system of physical theory and a model of the same. They were also able to point out what seemed to them to be Darwin's un- warranted jump from facts supporting an evolutionary viewpoint to natural selec- tion-simple chance-as the sole logical explanation of the observed phenomena.6" III The role of the hypothesis was not the only question over which Victorian reviewers such as Simpson and Morris found themselves at variance with prac- ticing scientists such as Charles Darwin. Though a good case may be made for saying that the universe over which Darwin and the natural theologians fought was really the same universe, there were several substantive issues over which the sides did disagree. Walter Cannon has presented an apparently paradoxical point of view on this issue. Disagreeing with what he calls the "Lyellian tradition," Cannon sees the triumph of Darwinism as the triumph "of a Christian way of picturing the world over the other ways available to scientists." The real alternative to Dar- 58.

Others have seen the "necessitarian entrapment of man which evolutionary thought in the 1860's and 1870's sketched" as the equivalent "to the predestination of Augustine and Calvin, and derived from the same source." See Cannon, "Uniformity and Pro- gression," p. 229. Cannon goes on to say that Darwinism was, perhaps, the "transfor- mation into scientific theory of concepts derived from Protestant Christianity." See ibid., "Preface," unpaginated. Simpson was particularly aware of the appeal of Ro- man Catholicism's less rigorous views on salvation and predestination to those Europeans disenchanted with the Calvinist deity. 60.

What was unwarranted in "Darwinism" so far as Simpson was concerned was taken as unwarranted in it by the English press generally. As Ellegard has pointed out, Darwin's reviewers felt that induction was the "good, positive ideal which Darwin has deserted for its bad, negative counterpart, variously named hypothesis, theory, speculation, assump- tion, imagination, fancy, guess, and the like." See Alvar Ellegard, Darwin and the Gen- eral Reader, p. 189. For Simpson's insistence on the ogical rather than the inductive nature of Darwin's hypothesis, see Rambler, March, 1860, p. 370. He cites The Origin of Species, pp. 204 and 458 for proof of Darwin's self-conscious willingness to rely on logic rather than facts for "proof". 89</page><page sequence="13">CHURCH HlSlTORY winism was the uniformitarianism of Charles Lyell, Cannon thinks.62 Accord- ing to Lyell's system nothing unique ever happened. Lyell opposed Lamarck- ism and all other evolutionary theories for thirty years after the appearance of his Principles of Geology in order to "keep his universe free from Christianity."s6 Since the dependence of a species upon a particular environment had been com- monly accepted by scientists, any transformist theory in biology implied the same in geology. It was exactly this developmental thinking, Lyell believed, that was the "alien Christian tendency which had marred the whole history of geology prior to the work of James Hutton."" By the time that Darwin's scientific outlook was being formed, Christiax natural theology had adopted or assisted in the adoption of several concepts which were quite alien to Lyellian uniformitarianism. That laws of nature were more than mere observed regularities; that matter could not organize itself and had to be organized by an outside force; that organic beings were marvellously adapted to their environments; that the concept of "purpose" had meaning in biology; that each organ had its specific function for its own species; that "Malthusian superfecundity" served the general purpose of the system; that the past was his- torical (not cyclical); and that historical development in the past was a record of progress culminating in man, were all concepts which Darwin found in the in- tellectual milieu of his youth.65 What Darwin did, Cannon thinks, was to steal the thunder of the natural theologians. For he showed how the universe which was developed under the aegis of Christianity could run quite as well without the Christian God at all. Natural selection worked on the fortuitous variations of raw nature to assure that only those species survived which were adapted to the changing environ- ment. The process was progressive only in the sense that the changing environ- ment had consistently changed to allow more complex organisms to develop. And this too was fortuitous. Thus the true precursors of Darwin were not the deistic scientists Hutton and Lyell, nor the proponents of a developmental hypothesis such as Lamarck. They were rather Linnaeus, Paley, and Cuvier." "And it was because they were arguing in terms of the same universe," Cannon concludes, "that the Darwinians and the theologians could argue so heatedly."67 It does indeed seem to be the case that, as Hooykaas says, a Darwinian belief in progress is a secularization of ideas which have their origin in Scripture.6 "So long as scientific explanation did not become historical," Cannon has in- sisted elsewhere, "Christians could if they wished ignore its implications. A 62. Walter F. Cannon, "The Basis of Darwin's Achievement: A Revaluation," Victorian Studies, 5 (Dec., 1961), 109. This illustrates the fact that the simplicist division be- tween those for and against uniformitarianism cannot stand. Lyell and Hutton had been advocates of a strict uniformitarianism according to which action in the past differed from that in the present neither in degree nor in kind. Other geologists took a position called "Actualism". Actualism explained past events by present causes but allowed for variations in tempo and intensity. Such a position seems to be inimical to what Lyell was trying to maintain. See M.J.S. Rudwick's review of Hooykaas' Natural Law and Divine Miracle, in History of Science, 1 (1962), 83. See Reijer Hooykaas, Natural Law and Divine Miracle: The Principle of Uniformity in Geology, Biology, and Theology (Leiden, Netherlands: Brill: 1963), esp. pp. 3-14, 31, 43, 113, 140, 143-144. 63.

And the ideas which led him to do so were in great measure theological in origin. They "were of importance in shaping Charles Darwin's thought, especially because he did not always recognize them as theological ideas."70 It does appear that the universe which Darwin posits and the one which his reviewers such as Simpson and Morris accept is the same in those areas which Cannon has specified. What really divides Christian from would-be theist here are questions regarding the nature of miracles, the nature of causation and the meaning of chance, and the problem of evil.7 The problem to which Darwin set himself as shown by the title of his work, On the Origin of Species, he never really solved. But the origin of species could be a problem only in a universe in which species had a real existence. The com- mon assumption is that the only real alternative to the origin of species by means of transformation or evolution-the mechanics of which no one in Darwin's gen- eration could describe-is separate or special creation. According to this latter theory, as ridiculed by Darwin, Huxley and others, a rhinoceros, for instance, might spring out of the earth "fully armored in all of his half-ton being."72 This is such a fantastic method of creation that one would have to search hard for a proponent of it today. And one suspects that there were very few educated men even a century ago who would have been willing to defend such an outre and bizarre process. This is perhaps why it was proposed by Darwin and Huxley: it gave itself to ridicule and satire. Cannon has insisted that to the "geological parsons," who were supposedly the partisans of separate creation, "creation" simply meant, "They got there somehow." There was no theory of separate creation, Cannon points out, because there was no theory of creation. The emphasis was upon the adjective, separate. Even Lyell used the word "crea- tion" quite casually.78 Thus, as far as miracles are concerned, Cannon acutely points out that what the separate creationists really wanted was not to clutter up history with periodic miracles but rather to preserve "transcendent final causes, because with final causes they could make plausible the one great miracle in history on which Chris- tianity depends, and with it the miracle by which man is not merely a beast."74 The work of these geological parsons was as objective and empirical as that of the best in their generation. They wished, however, to add "the dimension of 69. Walter F. Cannon, "The Problem of Miracles in the 1830's," Victorian Studies, 4 (Sept. 1960), 31. 70. Walter F.

The classic idealist-empiricist quarrel over causes, in which Roman Catholics generally sided with the idealist position of William Whewell against the champions of empiricism such as John Stuart Mill, must be settled elsewhere.7 It might be pertinent to mention a few obvious facts here, however. Relying on the argument from design, Christian natural theologians had argued rather contradictory things. On the one hand, they insisted on the ra- tionality and unity of the universe.77 On the other hand, they felt that random- ness was "natural," "and hence probable, whereas local concentration of organ- ization is unnatural and improbable and hence needs to be explained whenever it occurs."78 This situation calls for "final caustation," though it be something as mysterious as "separate creation." Christians could not limit causation simply to a description of invariable sequence. So far as the problem of evil is concerned, once more the natural theologian and the working scientists found that they could often not agree. Donald Flem- ing has pointed out, and quite correctly, I believe, that Charles Darwin came to see himself as an analytic man, one "who set the atomizing vision of science above the integrating vision of art."79 Darwin had of course noted in his Auto- biography his growing disenchantment with music, graphic art, Shakespeare, poetry, landscape and novels which had unhappy endings.80 "This curious and lamentable loss of the higher aesthetic tastes" accompanied that development where- by Darwin thought his mind came to be "a kind of machine for grinding gen- eral laws out of large collections of facts."81 Why Darwin should have chosen the "atomizing vision of science above the integrating vision of art" is an interesting question. What makes a man an icono- clast? The answer to which Fleming comes on this point is that Darwin was motivated to reject the current icon of the natural theologians because of his detestation of suffering. For the "artistic vision" of the theologians had made God an accomplice, at least, in the agony of the world. And natural selection was the obvious denial of the universe as a planned work of art. "It would be tempting to say," Fleming concludes, "that Darwin turned against works of art because he had determined to smash the greatest of all."82 To the Christian, evil-like miracles and final causes-was mysterious. But it was, nevertheless. Man simply had no alternatives to thinking in these cat- egories. Loren Eiseley has noted that with the rapid acceptance of evolution, a dream world of design had perished. But the human hearts which had found 75. Ibid. 76. Apparently, however, there were Roman Catholics with whom a form of empiricism found great favor. See J. M.

Maurice in 1863, for example, Charles Kingsley wrote: "I am very busy work- ing out points of natural theology, by the strange light of HUXLEY, DARWIN, LYELL."83 Kingsley denied that Darwinism had done away with the argument for final causes. What had happened, Kingsley saw, was that God as a sort of "master-magician"-the God of semi-deistic orthodoxy tinkering with his uni- verse-had indeed been destroyed. The alternatives now were either a God work- ing everywhere and at all times, or else nowhere and never. The choice was be- tween "the absolute empire of accident, and a living, immanent, ever-working God."" Simpson, like all believing Christians, was an anti-imperialist in this absolute empire of accident. His opposition was neither sporadic, opportunistic, nor ad hoc. He opted for the only logical alternative to chance: the living, immanent ever- working God. Providence, transcendent final causation, and "the one great miracle in history on which Christianity depends" he knew he must preserve. And so he found "Natural Selection" a myth. It was a myth which had the power of all well-turned myths to capture the imagination.85 But it would be a catastrophe for us to be thus "forced to believe ourselves to be only developed apes."86 He opted for a sacramental union of matter and spirit, an interpretation of Scrip- ture not flowing primarily from the necessities of religious controversy or pre- dicated upon the "idleness, ignorance, and timidity" of exegetical expedients, and for a law of creation that is "an equable ever-present force, embracing all nature as the ocean embraces the land, and active throughout the whole duration of the world."87 Most Roman Catholics had no idea of how to respond to Darwin other than with a sort of inarticulate horror. So they remained silent. And silence was the essential Roman Catholic reaction to Darwin. Richard Simpson saw the issues, faced them as best he could, made what distinctions were possible, and then wrote forcibly of his perception. In so doing he opened up the possibility of a subsequent meaningful dialogue between the Catholic believer and the evolu- tionary scientist of Darwinian persuasion. 83.
