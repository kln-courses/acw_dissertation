<plain_text><page sequence="1">LATE BRONZE AGE GREECE AND THE BALKANS: A REVIEW OF THE PRESENT PICTURE SOME eight years after the appearance of my book in the SIMA series,1 the appearance of a similar book by Anthony Harding, and of several important articles by others, makes the time ripe to review the new material corpus and the progress of research on this field.2 CHRONOLOGY We may start with chronological questions, where there was a question mark at the end of my book. The updating of the Thera eruption prevailing now3 would be welcome to those who would like to reconcile the C-I4 and the traditional chronologies; and the present-day dendrochronological dates for central Europe would prefer a slightly higher chronology for Br D, where we find most of the 'classical' comparisons with LH III B. The shift, in general, would also leave more space for the Tumulus culture development in Br B and C, in which we have much less traditional evidence for mutual contacts between the Aegean and barbarian Europe. Despite repeated changes, the dendrochronologists from South Germany, Switzerland, and France now seem to feel safe for the Late Bronze Age there,4 and this evidence makes a more reliable impression than C-I4, while the deep core drilling in Greenland has also made advances. I should first stress that I am grateful that radiocarbon dates exist as a corrective view from another angle, but I would hardly consider them more reliable than other evidence. As for the Near Eastern connections of Aegean chronology, there have been good reasons to reject both major shifts and excessively minute refinements.5 No big jumps seem to be I For various information concerning new finds and studies I am especially grateful to Dr T. Bader, Dr M. Hajicosti, Prof. B. Hansel, Prof. A. Harding, Dr I. Kilian- Dirlmeier, Prof. P. Schauer, Dr T. Taylor, and Prof. E A. Winter. I would also like to thank Dr E.

Some degree of uncertainty in dating all archaeological find complexes (tombs, layers, and such like) are a common feature anywhere. It should perhaps be added that any system of chronology based on stylistic development should be a kind of guideline for those who would follow the same path later, not a fixed grid. This was also the case with Arne Furumark, whom I enjoyed meeting in person and hearing explain his point of view. The dogmatic interpretation of stylistic guidelines by less inspired followers often turns a wise theory into a caricature, which is only too easy to criticize. THE EASTERN BALKANS The northern penetration of the Mycenaean weapons in this area can be compared to the distribution of the LBA double axes of both genuine Mycenaean and peripheral types</page><page sequence="3">LATE BRONZE AGE GREECE AND THE BALKANS 219 (FIG. I).6 The new hoard from Radeni in Rumania,7 together with the Kriiovlin find and the Valditran treasure,8 mark the same area of sophisticated LBA gold toreutics as the zone of Mycenaean influence. The gold tableware and jewellery, including the new finds from Hinova in Rumania,9 remind one of the Homeric figure of Rhesos, the king richer in gold than anyone else in the Iliad (II. x. 436-41). The Mycenaean-type ingots from the Pontic coast of Bulgaria, and the LBA stone anchors from there, can perhaps be connected with the recorded tradition of a Thracian thalassocracy situated chronologically at the close of the Bronze Age.'0 Thrace also had much to offer in early times in the religious field, as shown by stories of Dionysos coming to Greece from the north, of Orpheus, and of the reputedly Thracian origin of several priestly families in some of the main Greek sanctuaries.11 In general terms, the culture of Greek Thrace seems to be closely related to that of southern Bulgaria (the 6erkovna and later Cepina groups according to Hansel),'2 and the same seems to apply to Thasos, Samothrace, and eastern Macedonia.'3 The 'Knobbed ware' from several sites in Greek Thrace seems to document a continuous cultural development in this area from the Late Bronze to the Early Iron Age. The results of the Bulgarian excavations in the south- eastern part of that country, notably in Malkoto Kale,14 along with the new sites in the island of Samothrace (both late bronze and early iron age) and the new discoveries of D. Triandaphyllos in eastern Thrace,'5 offer more possibilities of distinguishing local groups of this ceramic style. Malkoto Kale and surrounding sites show, generally, more features related to the Danubian tradition (softer shaping, more often fluted decoration, cf. FIG. 2), while the potteries of Greek eastern Thrace appear to be more restrictive in this sense, similarly to the sites examined in Turkish Thrace by M. Ozdogan.'6 The last-mentioned pottery groups, however, seem to be reasonably similar to the Trojan Knobbed ware, though earlier Trojan 6 Cf. Harding (n. 2), 127-30; AAE 30 f., 41-7; J.

Early Iron Age pottery shapes from Malkoto Kale, Bulgaria. (1-3) scale 1; (4-5, 7) scale 2; (6) scale 3. (After Thracia Pontica, 4 (1988).) pottery also shows some Balkan links. The exaggeration of some traits in Trojan ware seems to have frequent parallels among groups of immigrants living in a foreign milieu. That the pottery from Gordion also shows Balkan traits, but no more knobs, can either be the result of a further shift away, or recall the fact that the Phrygians came from a more western part of the Balkans.17 A parallel from the same territory is the much later Galatian ware, already lacking some qualities of the La Tene pottery, but still showing a generic resemblance.18 "7 G.

In the Axius valley, new publications of the Kastanas and Assiros excavations21 confirmed what had been mentioned in the preliminary reports. Kastanas shows more dramatic changes than Assiros. The changes in the former site (once an island in the Thermaic gulf) are contemporary with the appearance of the fluted ware (Macedonian Lausitz ware according to Heurtley)22 and with the transition from mud-brick to wattle-and-daub architecture, with different house plans and changes in agriculture (new kinds of plants) and cattle-breeding.23 This all seems to fit well into the general pattern of dramatic changes in the Aegean, while the Torone excavations have shown a Greek presence there from the Submycenaean period.24 North of the Greek frontier, good progress has been made in the study of EIA cemeteries, and at least some of the evidence has been published.25 A survey of the local pottery style has been published by A. Hochstitter,26 while the most important addition to the Epirote archaeology is the Vitsa publication by J. Vokotopoulou.27 What should perhaps be stressed again are the geographical conditions. The Balkan peninsula offers only a few relatively easy routes from north to south, and even the best of them, using the valleys of the Morava and Vardar, can easily by blocked even by small military units. The Strymon and western Macedonian routes are even more difficult.28 With a possible exception from the Struma valley, no new finds of Mycenaean pottery north of the present Greek frontier have been made, a feature contrasting with new finds of this class made as far west as Spain.29 '19 M.

BOUZEK THE NORTHERN BALKANS: RUMANIA AND THE CARPATHIAN AREA Thorough surveys, with lists of particular items, have been published for Rumania by T. Bader30 and for Austria by S. Hiller.31 There is a strong possibility that the Mycenaeans obtained some of their metals, most notably gold and copper, from as far north as Transylvania,32 and the number of objects dating from Br A 2(-3) in the eastern part of central Europe and the northern Balkans for which an Aegean inspiration is probable has been increased. The moulds for 'mycenaeanizing' daggers, the list of which has been enlarged by R. Wanzek,33 seem to confirm the early date of the Transylvanian rapiers and of the Perinari hoard (FIG. 3); they appear to date from Br A 2 (3)-B I, though some fragments of them were found among the scrap in later hoards.34 Trade and political relations on a more sophisticated level need collaborative partners. The study of fortified settlements in the eastern part of central Europe shows more developed social stratification and craft specialization than is usually found in prehistoric societies both earlier and later in this area. Fine metalwork and other special crafts were situated in proto-urban sites with fortifications, towers, and often rectangular networks of streets and house-blocks.35 Script-like signs and groups of them also appear in this area, probably having some mainly magical function, and the so-called 'loaf-of- bread idols' remind one of some sealings and tablets in the south.36 The sanctuaries were decorated with spirals in relief (FIG. 4).37 GENERAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE AEGEAN AND OTHER PARTS OF BARBARIAN EUROPE Relations of a more general character have been studied in several articles and one book by P. Schauer; another survey from his point of view is in his introduction to a Mainz conference volume organized by him.38 He sees the East Mediterranean influences in barbarian Europe in a very general way, usually not entering into detailed comparisons of particularities in style and execution of individual objects, and avoiding problems of individual historical events. For high conical objects of gold from Germany and France (Schifferstadt, Ezelsdorf, Avanton) he sees Hittite models, and similarly for some traits of central European funeral ritual and waggons.39 For the Urnfield symbolic waggons and their relation to the Aegean, two studies by 30 T.

Pare are important.40 Some new finds from Anatolia were added to the discussion by B. Kull,41 but without substantial new results for chronological comparisons. The search for metal was apparently an important reason for long-distance relations; even the Trojan war is sometimes seen in this context.42 H. Thrane has recently reexamined bronze age relations between Scandinavia and the Mediterranean.43 The chariot (FIG. 5) and the folded stool (FIG. 6) are derived from an ultimately East Mediterranean inspiration, but the relations were usually indirect, as is shown for bronze objects of similar inspiration taken over via central Europe.44 Much happened in the field of Italic relations with the Aegean and Cyprus; both appear to have been more intensive than was supposed earlier. Most notably, Sardinia has yielded many new finds,45 and Fratesina in northern Italy appears to have been a centre for transmitting glass technology to the Urnfield culture.46 Some LH III c pottery was manufactured in Italy. East Mediterranean relations with France and the British Isles have also been summarized, with more optimistic results, byJ. Briard, A. Harding, C. du Gardin, and G. Eogan.47 Notably, the richer amber finds from France, the crescent twisted earrings (FIG. 7), 'Cypriot' daggers, 'flesh-hooks' (FIG. 8), and glass objects48 offer more solid evidence than was available earlier. The pattern of distribution reminds one of the later Phoenician (and Phocaean) trade routes.49 Many more amber spacers are known from France, and the LH I-II amber most probably came to the eastern Mediterranean via that country (FIG. 9), while the distribution of Tiryns- type amber beads and intertwined gold 'wheels' (FIG. io) makes a central European route more probable for LH III B-c amber.50 40 Ch.

SOUTHWARD SHIFTS OF EUROPEAN 'CULTURES' IN THE EARLY URNFIELD PERIOD There are three shifts of the central European cultures to the south that can be recognized relatively clearly. The first is the penetration of elements deriving from the area around the eastern Alps to what became, under this influence, Protovillanovan Italy. This happened in Br D, when a similar shift of the Urnfield culture also arrived in Bosnia and Serbia (early Mediana), and Heurtley's Lausitz ware (now so richly known from Kastanas and Assiros)51 is 51 Cf. n. 21; AAE 19o f., 214 f.</page><page sequence="11">LATE BRONZE AGE GREECE AND THE BALKANS 227 1 2 3 4 0 5 FIG. 8.

Briard, in OABZ.) above all an offshoot of that province. It should be stressed that the weaponry and some elements of dress which became popular in these areas, as well as in South Italy and Greece, give the impression of deriving from final Tumulus (Br D I) tradition.52 The other impact was from the territory of the Gaiva culture in eastern Hungary and eastern Slovakia.53 This brought agricultural civilization up to the western Ukraine, but the culture also penetrated southwards along the Danube, where another province with predominantly fluted pottery was formed. This Danubian province, in turn, influenced the more southerly cultures, both in Bulgaria and Macedonia. In the field of bronze objects, we can see that the large province of the Urnfield bronzework, embracing the northern part of the Balkans up to Transylvania, and also Villanovan Italy, includes in the central Balkans only the Vardar and Struma valleys, and not the eastern part of Bulgaria and Greek Thrace, which were no longer parts of this koine.54 It is hardly an accident that the two territories most affected by an influx of population from the north are among those parts of the Balkans from which migrations to Anatolia are recorded in literary sources: that of the Brygi, who later became the Phrygians, migrating from the Axius valley to central Anatolia, and that of the Moesi from the Central Balkan-Danubian area to the north-western part of Anatolia. In their new territory the Moesi were called Mysi.55 52 Cf. S. Hood, 'Northern 'barbaric' elements in early Greek civilisation', Concilium Eirene XVI (Prague, 1982), iii. 98-103; AAE 242. 53 Cf. J.

PIERIA AND THE AREA OF THE GREAT LAKES The culture of early iron age Pieria, best known from the cemetery of Vergina but also from Dion and other places, is in many ways similar to the Greek Submycenaean. The identification of Vergina with the earliest Macedonian capital, Aigai, is now generally accepted. The funerary ritual relations are further supported by the identification of many EIA tumuli in central Greece and the Peloponnese;56 the metal objects and their selection are very similar, and the same can be said for the basic shapes of pottery, though they are handmade in Vergina, and wheel-turned and painted in Greece. Some fluted bowls and kantharoi from Vergina, however, show a resemblance to those from the Axius valley, and the pins, bracelets, finger-rings, belt-bosses, the earliest weapons, and the diadem all give the impression of being inspired ultimately by the latest Tumulus culture repertory.57 It is worth 56 R.

But probably the basic motifs of decoration were transmitted in other materials, such as textiles, in earlier times. They were usually meaningful symbols for their users: behind the koine of Geometric styles a kind of religious movement is apparently hidden, worshipping a solar deity and/or hero (cf. FIG. 5), which spread with the Urnfield cultures across a large part of Europe and also reached the Aegean and the Levant.60 BRONZEWORK AND POTTERY OF EUROPEAN INSPIRATION IN LH III B-C GREECE For fibulae, a survey by the late K. Kilian61 confirmed their chronological position and the fact that actual imports are fairly rare, as was shown earlier for other bronze objects.62 However, the inspiration for their production and the prototypes still seem to have come from the NW Balkan-North Italic province. A similar situation seems to have existed for pins, even if their homeland was situated slightly further north: they were probably ultimately of late Tumulus culture inspiration. The material collected by I. Kilian-Dirlmeier is very useful, but it has shown only how few and how late the Mycenaean predecessors of the new forms in Greece are.63 Her hypothesis of a local origin for the pins and the wearing of them is hardly acceptable. As far as gold jewellery is concerned, besides the Pylos diadem,64 the Delos sheet gold fragments65 show a European inspiration.66 New Sicilian finds in the Syracuse Museum confirm an East Sicilian participation in this koine,67 which also included symbolic objects connected with an 'Apolline' solar hero (FIG. 5). For the handmade burnished Ware, the discussion between D. B. Small and J. B. Rutter68 seems to me to have confirmed that there are much better arguments for accepting a foreign origin for this ware in the Aegean than an indigenous one. In addition, more traces of foreign influence on Late Mycenaean pottery are listed by Rutter than were recognized earlier.69 PROTOGEOMETRIC INCISED WARES IN THE AEGEAN The best parallels for the Attic Incised ware dolls come from the frontier area between Rumania, Serbia, and Bulgaria (Dubovac-Zuto Brdo-Qirna, etc.). This culture seems to have moved southwards in c.Iooo BC. The South Bulgarian Cepina group shows traces of this 60 Cf. J.

In Greece they have been found in cremations of women (along with clay beads, etc., also imitating wooden jewellery); they probably served some function in grave ritual, and can be connected with a religious movement.70 From the Greek islands there are several classes of incised pottery showing ornaments similar to painted Geometric vases, but mostly these motifs are in isolation, stressing their symbolic significance. They are known in different varieties from Naxos, Andros, the Dodecanese, and other places, and some of them seem to have remained popular until the seventh century BC.71 Those from the Dodecanese seem to be related to the so-called Dorian ware of the Argolid.72 Many of the ornaments follow the line of solar symbolism, known in Greece since the time of the destruction of Mycenaean palaces (or slightly before), and they may be an expression of a folkloric religious tradition of that kind in different parts of the Greek world, rather than directly linked together. Many of them are handmade, but some wheel-made.73 Even more interesting for our subject is the dark age Black Slip ware from the Aegean and Cyprus; it represents another pottery tradition, now mainly connected (for good reasons) with Sea Peoples, Pelasgians, and similar groups.74 Besides some grey ware of Italic character from western Crete, one Sardinian vessel was also identified there.75 CLIMATIC CHANGES Climatic development during the Late Bronze Age is now better known from central Europe,76 but we have at least some additional knowledge from the Mediterranean.77 A favourable, warm and relatively dry, climate was characteristic of most parts of central Europe 70 AAE 200 f.

BOUZEK during the Urnfield period, while there were years of drought in the Mediterranean, and also in the steppes of Upper Eurasia, at least for some time. However, more detailed observations from features dated by archaeological context and by dendrochronology show a more detailed picture of climatic development in central Europe: a dry and warm phase in late Br C, followed by a moist one at the beginning of Br D (connected with the Peschiera floodings of the North Italian lacustrine sites). Then came a rather long warm, dry period, from late Br D to the beginnings of Ha B I. From Ha B 2 on it was already too dry in some parts of the Hungarian plain, but still favourable in most areas (this was, in fact, the peak of the climatic optimum). This period was followed by a shorter cooler phase in Ha B I, and then by another dry phase with large-scale chernozem formations. The end of the Urnfield culture in Ha B 3 is again marked by a rapid shift to a cooler, moister (Atlantic) climate, which was one of the main causes of the disappearance of the Urnfield culture.78 This development was connected with a rapid rise of population in central Europe, halted for the first time by the Peschiera interphase, and then again by the drying up of some areas in the Carpathian cauldron during Ha A. Both phenomena led to shifts of the increased population. As the droughts in the Mediterranean brought serious problems to the LBA economy there, the balance of power between European barbarians and the Mediterranean civilizations changed.79 The already 'sclerotic' palatial system collapsed after attempts to resist, which included both the strengthening of fortifications and the integration of the first barbarians as mercenaries. The first attacks reported in the literary sources were by sea (Pylos, Ugarit, the Hittites); for the subsequent larger invasions by land there are no more written documents, only later traditions.80 ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL PARALLELS FROM COMPARABLE MIGRATION PATTERNS A comparative study of archaeological traces left after other invasions attested both archaeologically and historically may narrow the field of possible interpretations of the LBA evidence, by showing what can be expected after a given pattern of archaeological changes.81 In the case of invasion of a lower culture into a culturally more developed territory, much depends on the size of the invading group as against the native population. The complete eradication of the earlier culture is an extreme case, known only from small communities surrounded by a culturally different milieu (like Greenland's Vikings); this had hardly happened in history on a larger scale. When a large group of newcomers is nearly or completely in the majority in the new society, and where the remnants of the old population are of a lower social standing, the taste 78 Cf. J. Bouzek, 'Climatic changes: new archaeological evidence from the Bohemian Karst and other areas', Antiquity (in press); for Switzerland see M. Gamper and J.

The craftsmen of the old local population are made use of. Invading 'barbarians' do not like to do more work themselves than is necessary, so they readily make use of the more skilled natives who can be told what to produce and how, according to the new masters' will and taste. In such a case the artistic style changes more or less substantially, though it also adapts earlier available models and takes over those techniques of craftsmanship which are considered useful by the new lords, though not those which are too sophisticated for them. The Germanic occupation of France by the Franks may serve as an example. Small groups of warlike invaders usually influence armour, weapons, and male dress fashion, while larger groups, bringing their womenfolk with them, also affect women's fashions; nevertheless, the techniques of the local craftsmen are preserved. A complete change of population practically never happens in the case of settled agriculturalists.82 Even if, as a consequence of a cruel war, all men carrying weapons have been killed or have abandoned their country, most of their women and children will stay behind, so that about two-thirds of the former population remains. More often, however, even some of the male population surrender and are integrated into the new system in various ways. In Greece, there is the Dorian model of subjugated populations, strictly applied in Sparta and Greece, and the Ionian model of incorporating foreign elements into the 'normal' society without apparent difficulty while granting them almost equal, or equal, rights. As for language, there exists a rule that invaders without their womenfolk usually lose their language in two generations: everyone takes their 'mother tongue' from their mother. If the group is larger and brings its women with it, the language of the invaders does not disappear so easily: at the least, it will influence some features of the native tongue, even if the latter prevails, as in the case of the Germanic tribes in the Latin-speaking countries or the Protobulgars in Bulgaria. Larger groups which establish a long-lasting political domination may implant their language among the population invaded, as was the case, for example, in Hungary with the Hungarians or in Anatolia with the Turks. Using comparative evidence of invasions, we can fit the situation towards the end of the Mycenaean culture and after its fall into this model at virtually all points. There are close parallels, for example, in France and northern Italy towards the end of the Great Migrations period, and slightly later in Greece at the time of the Slavonic penetration.83 CONCLUSIONS Growing knowledge in several fields, such as climatic development and archaeological theory, seems to confirm the general feeling of many specialists dealing with this period of Greek and Balkan prehistory, even if their arguments were sometimes weak and have later been criticized. The holistic attitude, approaching questions from different angles, now appears one of the fruitful ways of enlarging our knowledge in different fields. In our present field, this 82 Cf. N. G. L.
