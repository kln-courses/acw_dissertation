Burleigh, Arie Schmidt, Martin Dotinga and Michiel R. van Ratingen First Technology Safety Systems, Inc. Copyright © 2007 SAE International ABSTRACT The WorldSID 5th percentile dummy, representing an average female, was developed in less than three years after the WorldSID 50th percentile dummy production release. This 5th percentile dummy was developed in the Integrated Project Aprosys (Advanced Protection Systems) under the European Commission Framework Program 6. This paper discusses the rationale for the WorldSID 5th percentile dummy design and development, and biofidelity evaluation results of head drop test, neck pendulum test and pendulum impact tests of the shoulder, thorax, abdomen and pelvis according to ISO TR9790 (ISO 1997) and Irwin (2002). The dummy was designed to host four units of 32 channel in-dummy Data Acquisition System with total 128 channel capacity. The head is constructed with PVC skin and plastic skull to simulate human head structure. The neck consists of a rubber design with metal discs, which can be tuned with rubber buffers. Super-elastic nickel titanium alloy, Nitinol®, was used for the shoulder, thorax and abdomen rib design. The Nitinol® material has a unique damping property, which provided enough damping effect for the upper torso structure. This unique property allows eliminating the traditional temperature sensitive polyvinyl base damping material. The pelvis has a polymer construction that simulates the human pelvic bone structure. The biofidelity evaluation results are presented in this paper. According to ISO TR9790 rating guideline, the rating scores are defined as: Excellent Biofidelity: 8.6 &lt; B &lt; 10.0 Good Biofidelity: 6.5 &lt; B &lt; 8.6 Fair Biofidelity: 4.4 &lt; B &lt; 6.5 Marginal Biofidelity: 2.6 &lt; B &lt; 4.4 Unacceptable Biofidelity: 0.0 &lt; B &lt; 2.6 The tests conducted show that the overall biofiedlity is rated at 5.5 according to ISO TR9790 specifications, and can be improved to 8.4 with further refinement. INTRODUCTION Less than three years after the WorldSID 50th percentile production release, a new WorldSID family member, WorldSID 5th percentile prototype was released in December 2005. The 5th percentile dummy was developed under European Commission Framework Program 6. First Technology Safety Systems (FTSS) is one of the 50 partners in the Integrated Project (IP), under the sub-project Biomechanics (SP5). FTSS, working with the industry safety experts within the partners in Europe and worldwide, carrying the expertise and experiences of over 50 years dummy development as well as the WorldSID 50th development, designed and manufactured the first five WorldSID 5th percentile prototype dummies. The five prototype dummies were manufactured for broad evaluation, two for Aprosys program in Europe, two for Transport Canada, and one for Occupant Safety Research Partnership (OSRP) in the United States. DUMMY DESIGN With the success of the WorldSID 50th percentile development program, the automotive safety industry expressed interest to develop a WorldSID 5th percentile dummy, representing a small female. Since the WorldSID 50th percentile dummy biofidelity rating ranks the highest among its predecessors, including US SID, BioSID, EuroSID-2, it is good to use the same design concept for the WorldSID 5th dummy design. However, due to the mechanical packaging limitation, a pure scale down can not be used due to the anthropometry difference between male and female. For example, the female has a much narrower waist line than a male. Furthermore, the load cell can't be scaled down either in proportion due to the mechanical design limitation. On the other hand, it is also to the dummy user's advantage to share as many sensors as possible to reduce the operation cost and avoid new sensor design, thus shorten the development time and reduce the efforts. The dummy was fully developed with 3D CAD, as shown in Figure 1. During the design process, finite element 506</page><page sequence="2">analysis was used to optimize the dynamic response at component level, such as the head. Figure 1, Complete WorldSID 5th CAD design HEAD The dummy head design consists of a polymer skull with polyvinyl skin. A cone shape core was designed to host the instrumentation. Due to the different position of the head Center of Gravity of WorldSID 50th male and 5th female, the cores are not identical. Key and slot arrangements assure correct positioning between the core and skull to avoid inadvertent assembly of the 50th male head on the 5th female core and vice versa. The instrumentation components of the head were carried over from the WorldSID 50th male dummy. It includes a linear triaxial accelerometer, which measures linear accelerations along x, y and z axes, three rotational accelerometers, which measure the rotational accelerations along x, y and z axes, a six axis upper neck load cell close to the Occipital Condyle joint to measure force and moment along three axes. The combination of one linear triaxial accelerometer and three rotational accelerometers allows calculating acceleration at any point of interest in the head. The skin features mark to locate the center of gravity in lateral projection and 15 degrees forward projection, to help set up in oblique pole tests. The head contains a dual axis tilt sensor, which assists accurate dummy positioning for test preparation. Figure 2 shows the design of the head structure. Figure 2, WorldSID head design and instrumented head core Finite element analysis was used to predict the thickness of the skin in order to achieve the biofidelity excellence. Based on the experience of modeling the WorldSID 50th head, the material properties were carried directly to this model. The results show a 7 mm skin thickness would provide excellent frontal biofidelity according to ISO TR9790, while a 15 mm skin thickness for the lateral biofidelity. A continuous surface was developed to ensure a smooth transition between the frontal and lateral side of the head. Figures 3 and 4 show the configurations of frontal and lateral drop test simulation correspondingly. Figure 3, Finite element analysis of frontal drop test Figure 4, Finite element analysis of lateral drop test 507</page><page sequence="3">Table 1, Summary of finite element analysis result Head skin . . .... Resultant ... . design . . thickness .... A . .. thickness ... . Accelerations A . .. frontal 7.0 275 g lateral 16.6 135 g With the finite element analysis results summarized in Table 1 , the manufacturing tooling was fabricated for the head, considering the ability to tune up the head performance. After the test of the prototype, the tooling was changed slightly to adjust the thickness of the skin to achieve the biofidelity requirements. NECK In ISO TR9790, the neck biofidelity requirement was developed from the sled test. There was no neck pendulum test criteria developed yet. According to the scaling parameters [Irwin, 2002], the neck was scaled down from the WorldSID 50th design. The neck consists of a molded rubber component with aluminum end plates and two spherical joints at top and bottom ends. The range of motion and joint stiffness is controlled by four rubber buffers at each end. Two of the four nodding buffers located at the front and rear of the neck are square cross section, providing stability of the neck along its longitudinal axis and controlling the flexion and extension impact response of the head-neck system. The circular section lateral buffers control the lateral stiffness of the top and bottom joints. Selection of harder or softer buffers allows tuning of the head-neck impact response within certain limits. To address user comment, the lower neck bracket features adjustment screws accessible from the front, allowing adjustment of the head position with the dummy being positioned in the vehicle. Figure 5, Neck design with frontal adjustable neck bracket SHOULDER The WorldSID 50th shoulder has a yoke design, which was intended to simulate the human arm range of motion. However, the yoke design has only two degrees of freedom and does not provide the human-like arm range of motion. In the 5th female design, a spherical joint was designed to add the desired third degree of freedom. The shoulder rib 10 degree tilt angle was maintained, which allows the arm joint to move upward, thus simulating the shrugging motion of the human shoulder. The addition of the spherical joint necessitated the shoulder load cell to be moved inboard of the shoulder rib. A dedicated light weight WorldSID 5th female shoulder load cell was developed for this purpose. A linear triaxial accelerometer was packaged and installed inside the shoulder load cell. This load cell in turn limited the space for shoulder deflection instrumentation. Due to the limitation of the space a string potentiometer was designed into the shoulder structure to measure the deflection instead of the IR- TRACC. The string potentiometer was also intended to address the durability issue, as it allowed installation of an overload buffer. The shoulder joint is fully encapsulated within the soft arm flesh, reducing considerably the initial spike seen in shoulder impacts. Figure 6, Shoulder joint design HALF ARM The half arm was designed with a polymer bone, molded inside a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) skin filled with Polyurethane elastomer. No instrumentation was designed in the half arm. The shoulder-arm joint friction can be adjusted by means of three screws accessible through holes from the side. 508</page><page sequence="4">Figure 7, Half arm and its bone design THORAX/ABDOMEN The thorax ribs were designed to follow the human contour to represent the upper torso. Each rib module consists of an inner rib and an outer rib. The inner ribs serve as the main load path from the thorax, while the outer ribs provide the continuous profile of the dummy. The upper torso design is symmetrical at the midsaggital plane. The thorax is represented by three rib modules on each side, while the abdomen is represented by two rib modules on each side of the spine box. As with WorldSID 50th dummy, this small female dummy's ribs are oriented on a horizontal plane, providing sensitivity to horizontally oriented loading condition in vehicle. Each rib of the impact side is equipped with an IR-TRACC to measure the deflection and a linear triaxial accelerometer to measure the rib accelerations. The accessibility of IR-TRACC mounting screws was improved, providing easy assembly and disassembly of the IR-TRACC and inner rib. Contrary to WorldSID 50th dummy, this small female WorldSID has an asymmetric IR-TRACC location with respect to the horizontal rib symmetry plane. Due to the smaller height of the ribs, central rib mounting position of the IR-TRACC was not possible (Figure 8). The small female ribs were designed initially with damping material. In the process of tuning the ribs to the desired response by reducing damping material thickness, the damping material was removed entirely and still the thorax ribs were too stiff. In the final test configuration the thorax inner rib height was reduced to 28 mm to meet the performance requirements (Figure 8). Figure 8, Rib Module As shown in Figure 9, the spine box is a sandwich structure with two steel plates and the data acquisition system sandwiched between. Two data acquisition system units (G5 version), manufactured by Diversified Technology Systems (DTS), are packaged inside the spine box, also linear triaxial accelerometers are designed at thoracic vertebrae T1, T4 and T12 locations. Rotational accelerometer along the x axis and a dual axis tilt sensor are designed inside the spine box as well. Figure 9, Thorax and spine box design PELVIS The pelvis design consists of a polymer bone structure with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) skin filled with elastomer. The left and right polymer bone structure is connected to centrally located sacro-iliac and pubic load cells. Also a rotational accelerometer (x-direction), a linear triaxial and a dual axis tilt sensor were designed in the pelvis. The hip joint has a ball and socket structure design. Similar to WorldSID 50th percentile male design, but scaled to small female proportionally, the lumbar has an omega-shape design to allow human-like shear motion between the pelvis and the upper body regions. All the load cells in the pelvis and lumbar area share the same designs from WorldSID 50th male dummy (Figure 10). 509</page><page sequence="5">Figure 10, Pelvis and pelvic bone structure LEG The upper leg bone structure was designed to represent the trochanter of the femoral bone as shown in Figure 10. In the femur bone shown in Figure 11, a three axis femoral neck load cell was designed with a dedicated smaller diameter and matching capacity to measure loads along the x, y and z direction between the hip joint and greater trochanter. A six channel WorldSID 50th dummy arm load cell was desinged at mid femur to measure the femur forces and moments in three directions. An additional DTS G5 data acquisition unit was packaged in each thigh, allowing the dummy to be equipped up to 128 data channels. The knee joint has a knee load cell on each side to measure the lateral knee contact force (Figure 12). It also has a knee potentiometer to measure the rotation of the knee. The knee instrumentation is carried over from WorldSID 50th male. The knee joint is designed to the same principle with small improvements to the WorldSID 50th male dummy, i.e. the friction contact surface was increased for better joint friction adjustment. The lower leg, shown in Figure 1 1 , was derived from the Hybrid III 5th percentile dummy due to project time and budget constraints. It is the intention to redesign the lower leg in phase II to have a similar structure to the WorldSID 50th. However, it is anticipated that such design would be challenging due to the even more limited space in the small female ankle joint. Figure 1 1 , Complete leg design Figure 12, Knee design TEST AND DESIGN REFINEMENT After the prototype dummy was manufactured, head drop test and lab pendulum tests were conducted to evaluate the dummy and refine the design to improve its biofidelity response. HEAD DROP To evaluate the biofidelity of the head, it was tested by dropping the head to a rigid plate from 376 mm height for frontal response and 200 mm height for lateral response as shown in Figures 13 and 14, respectively. 510</page><page sequence="6">Figure 13 head drop frontal configuration The frontal test results are summarized in Table 1 Table 1 , Head frontal drop test result summary Resultant Test Result at Center of Gravity (ISO TR9790 Spec 250 - 300 g) 1 244.2 g 2 235.7 g Avg. 239.95 g Figure 14, Head drop lateral configuration According to ISO TR9790, the lateral performance was specified on the skull surface of the non-impact side on a lateral axis through the center of gravity of the head. A calculation algorithm developed from rigid body motion kinematics was used to calculate the acceleration at the skull surface of the non-impact side. This method was validated with experimental measurement for the WorldSID 50th head development, see Appendix A for details. The lateral drop test results are summarized in Table 2. Table 2, Head lateral drop test result summary Resultant Calculated Acceleration at the Acceleratio Skull Surface of Non-impact Side n at Center of Gravity (ISO TR9790 Spec 107 - 161 g) 1 120.1 g 139.5 g ~~ 2 118.9 g 135.9 g Avg. 119.5 g 137.7 g The frontal biomechanical response requirements are not specified in ISO TR9790. The WorldSID small female frontal drop test specification is according to Hybrid III 5th female frontal head drop biofidelity. The test results show that the frontal drop result is slightly low and out of the specification of Hybrid III 5th female. The lateral test result is well within the specification of ISO TR9790 scaled according to Irwin [2002], It is the manufacturer's intention to improve the frontal impact biofidelity in the next phase of development. SHOULDER IMPACT The shoulder impact test was conducted with the full dummy. The arm of the dummy was oriented downward as shown in Figure 15. Figure 15, Shoulder biofidelity pendulum impact test After 5 iterations of tuning the shoulder and thorax ribs, the test results were plotted against scaled ISO TR9790 corridor as shown in Figures 16 and 17. Figure 16 shows the pendulum force, which is higher than the corridor, for the shoulder impact test at 4.5 m/s speed. Figure 17 shows the shoulder deflection measurement for the same test, which is lower than the lower limit of 511</page><page sequence="7">the corridor. It is obvious that reducing the stiffness can reduce the pendulum force and increase the deflection of the shoulder, thus improve biofidelity. Figure 16, Pendulum force of shoulder impact test at 4.5 m/s with 1 4 kg probe mass. Figure 17, Shoulder deflection of shoulder impact test at 4.5 m/s with 14 kg probe mass. THORAX IMPACT TEST The thorax impact tests were conducted with the arm in the up position, away from the pendulum impact path. The dummy setup is shown in Figure 18. The tests were conducted at two different velocities, 4.3 m/s and 6.0 m/s. The test results and scaled ISO corridors are shown in Figures 19 and 20 for 4.3 m/s test, and Figure 21 for 6 m/s test. It shall be noted that no damping material was fabricated to the ribs in the final design. From Figures 19, 20 and 21, the duration of the tests matches the corridor very well, which indicates that the Notinol's damping property is sufficient.

PELVIC IMPACT The pelvis impacts were conducted with full dummy at different speeds. ISO TR9790 requires tests to be conducted at 6 m/s and 10 m/s. However, due to limitation of the test probe velocity no test was conducted at 10 m/s. Further, no specified pendulum of 10.1 kg was available in this lab. The 14 kg pendulum could achieve up to 8 m/s maximum velocity. The dummy was set up for the test as shown in Figure 22. The test results are shown in Table 3 and plotted in Figure 23. The 14 kg probe test data was scaled to 10.1 kg pendulum mass according to Mertz (1984). The impact energy of 14 kg and 8 m/s impact is close to the 10.1 kg and 10 m/s impact energy (448 Joule and 505 Joule respectively).

If it is outside the corridor, but within the 1 corridor width, the test scores 5. If it is beyond the above, either high or low, the test scores zero. Weighting factors were defined for each type of test to calculate the overall biofidelity.

However, with some tune up of materials of the dummy, we could potentially improve the biofidelty rating to 8.4, as shown in the parenthesis. Since the completed ISO TR9790 evaluation is still in progress. These scores do not truly reflect the dummy performance, other than a good indictor before the dummy evaluation completion. Certainly, a lot of tuning and improvement need to be done in the next phase of development. CONCLUSION WorldSID 5th percentile dummy was designed to fulfill the shortage of the WorldSID dummy family. The design concept was developed in the WorldSID 50th program. Improvements were considered during its design process. Nickel titanium alloy, Nitinol ®, was used for the rib design. During the initial test of the development process, polyvinyl base damping material was determined unnecessary, and therefore was removed from the design. By removing this damping material, it eliminated the potential damping material debonding issue that we observed in the WorldSID 50th dummy development, and also reduced the dummy's sensitivity to the temperature change since the polyvinyl base damping material is by far the most temperature sensitive material used in the dummy design. According to the ISO TR9790 specification, all the tests conducted in the lab rate the dummy at 5.5 out of 10 scale, which can be improved to 8.4, corresponding to good biofideltiy, by further refinement without significant effort. A complete biofidelity evaluation program is in process in European APROSYS program and Transport Canada. The evaluation results will be published in the near future when data becomes available.
