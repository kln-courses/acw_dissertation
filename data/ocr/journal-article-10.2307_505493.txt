<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeology in Israel SAMUEL R. WOLFF This is the inaugural article in a projected annual AJA series on current archaeological research in Israel (fig. 1).' For the first article in the series, results from a number of excavations conducted in the several years prior to 1989-1990 have been included by way of introduction. In order to avoid duplicating material in reports published elsewhere, I have concentrated, although not exclusively, on presenting previously unpublished material.2 I have also included sections on ceramic provenience analyses, archaeobotany (written by Mordechai Kislev), and Dead Sea Scroll research (courtesy of Avigdor Hurowitz). Reports on other subjects such as archaeozoology and epigraphic finds will be included in future articles. An ambitious agenda of field projects has been approved by the Israel Antiquities Authority, with much of it undertaken by their own personnel. New projects have sprung up, some at tells never before excavated (Tel Jezreel, for example), and some at previously excavated tells (Beit Shean, Hazor, Gerisa, Beth Shemesh, Maresha). Many new projects, how- ever, deal with smaller sites, especially from the Neo- lithic, Chalcolithic, and Early Bronze Ages, and those from all periods in the Negev region. In 1989, 104 excavation licenses were issued as well as 67 permits for salvage excavations; in 1990, the numbers were 111 and 68. Many salvage excavations were begun as a result of the considerable building activity related to the absorption of thousands of Soviet immigrants. Excavations in Jerusalem (Pisgat Ze'ev), Ashkelon (Af- ridar), and Beersheva (Abu Matar, Ramot) are but a few examples of major salvage projects undertaken as a direct result of housing and road construction. Security considerations have not slowed down ar- chaeological activity. Occasional disturbances in the administered territories have limited or halted exca- vation and survey projects in these areas, with the notable exceptions being the excavations at Nahal Kana Cave by A. Gopher and T. Tsuk and at Mount Gerizim by Y. Magen, and the surveys and excavations by D. Amit and the late Z. Ilan in Judea. No shortage of foreign volunteers has materialized. The past two years have witnessed a flurry of ad- ministrative activity within the IAA, which has taken over all the duties of the former Department of An- tiquities as of 1 April 1990. Under the energetic lead- ership of Amir Drori, many major organizational changes have been initiated, including a new division of the inspection system; a reorganization of the unit for the prevention of robbery of antiquities; supervi- sion of underwater archaeological sites; expansion into new quarters; reorganization of the site conser- vation department; establishment of an Education and Information department; and initiation of a de- velopment program. Special emphasis has been placed on publication of excavation reports. In addi- I Israel refers to the modern state and the territories currently under its administration. Publication of this newsletter in AJA was made possible by the generosity of Norma Kershaw, the Judy and Michael Steinhardt Foundation, and the Endowment for Biblical Research, Boston, to whom the editors and I are very grate- ful. Research for this project was supported by a generous grant from the Dorot Foundation. I gratefully acknowledge the support provided by Amir Drori, Director of the Israel Antiquities Authority. I warmly acknowledge those excava- tors who generously supplied me with information and il- lustrations. I apologize to those whose work was not men- tioned here. The sheer magnitude of archaeological activity in Israel, as well as my desire to avoid duplicating reports published elsewhere, prevented me from mentioning all ex- cavations and surveys. I am also pleased to express my appreciation to Avigdor Hurowitz and Mordechai Kislev for their contributions. Isaac Gilead kindly highlighted for me many salient points regarding the prehistoric periods and provided many useful comments. I am grateful to Seymour Gitin, Director of the W.F. Albright Institute of Archaeological Research, for his aid in establishing this project and his helpful suggestions, and to Steven Rosen for his constructive comments. All photographs appear through the courtesy of the excavators except as noted. The map was prepared by Michael Miles. 2 Most of the site material cited below was provided to me by the excavators. Their reports are either quoted di- rectly or summarized (or both). If no reports were available to me, results were cited from published articles. Informa- tion on 'Atlit-Yam, Taiyiba, Nalhal Refa'im, Maresha, and Tiberias was excerpted from the pamphlet distributed by the Israel Antiquities Authority to participants of the Con- gress on Biblical Archaeology, June 1990. I have omitted all titles (e.g., Prof., Dr.) from this article because they provide a false impression of achieved level; a Doctor at an Israeli institution, e.g., is equivalent to an Assistant Professor in the United States. I apologize to anyone who might be offended by this omission. In deference to the contributors, all dates through the Hellenistic period are B.C.E. (Before Common Era) and for the Roman and later periods are C.E. (Common Era) unless otherwise stated. I remain responsible for any errors in translation or other misrepresentations of pub- lished or previously unpublished data.

Map of sites mentioned in the text tion, a board has been created to oversee the publi- cation process of the Dead Sea Scrolls. (For progress on Scroll research see below.) William Dever recently published an incisive dis- cussion of overall trends in archaeology in Israel.3 Among other things, he stated that "'biblical archae- ology' is getting a new lease on life. This is not the now-defunct 'biblical archaeology' of the classic era, of course, but a new, truly interdisciplinary inquiry, much more anthropological and sociological, which is producing useful, though sometimes radical, results in the integration of the artifactual and literary data." This new approach was especially reflected in the papers presented in the Pre-Congress Symposium of the Second International Congress on Biblical Ar- chaeology (Jerusalem 1990). The Congress itself, which celebrated the centenary of the first strati- graphic excavation in Palestine, that of Sir Flinders Petrie at Tell el-Hesi in 1890, was well attended and informative, even provocative at times. The proceed- ings will be published by the Israel Exploration Soci- ety. BIBLIOGRAPHY Site Reports. A wealth of new data has appeared in the past few years, with Israeli archaeologists being responsible for the lion's share.4 Final or detailed preliminary reports have appeared from the follow- ing sites, arranged according to the main archaeolog- ical horizon found at the site: Quneitra, Yiron Plateau, Negev prehistoric sites, Nahal IHemar, Shiqmim, Yar- mut, Hazorea necropolis, Tel Kabri , Gezer tombs in field I, Gezer field VI, Hazor, 'Izbet Sartah, Tel Qiri, south of Temple Mount (Jerusalem), Ophel excava- tions of K. Kenyon (Jerusalem), Tel Kinneret, Gezer Iron-Hellenistic ceramic typology, Tel Michal, Per- sian period at Tell el-Hesi, City of David (Jerusalem), Masada, Caesarea Maritima, Galilee boat, Damascus Gate excavations of C.-M. Bennett and J.B. Hennessy, Capernaum, Mampsis and Rehovot-in-the-Negev; in Hebrew, the Lower Galilee, Aphek-Antipatris, Apol- lonia and survey of the southern Sharon Plain, and Silwan necropolis (Jerusalem). Full references to many of these publications can be found in the ap- propriate entries below. A special word of praise goes to Aharon Kempinski and W.-D. Niemeier, whose four detailed preliminary reports on the excavations at Tel Kabri have appeared within a year after the conclusion of each season. Edited Volumes.

Archae- ological and Historical Relationships in the Biblical Pe- riod, edited by Anson Rainey (Tel Aviv 1987). The proceedings of a colloquium dedicated to the study of the Early Bronze Age was published in P. de Mi- roschedji ed., L'urbanisation de la Palestine a" l'dge du Bronze ancien (BAR-IS 527, Oxford 1989). Papers delivered in a 1985 symposium devoted to Iron Age topics were published in Recent Excavations in Israel: Studies in Iron Age Archaeology, edited by S. Gitin and W.G. Dever (AASOR 49, Winona Lake, Ind. 1989). The proceedings of two conferences dedicated to syn- agogue studies have recently appeared: The Syn- agogue in Late Antiquity, edited by Lee Levine (Philadelphia 1987) and Ancient Synagogues in Israel, edited by Rachel Hachlili (BAR-IS 499, Oxford 1989). Collections of articles by Benjamin Mazar,20 some translated into English for the first time, and the late William Culican21 provide convenient access to their work. Edited volumes in Hebrew include Man and Envi- ronment in the Southern Shefelah, edited by Eliahu Stern and Dan Urman (Jerusalem 1988) and Com- merce in Palestine throughout the Ages, edited by B.Z. Kedar, Trude Dothan, and Shmuel Safrai (Jerusalem 1990). Monographs. An excellent overview of the archae- ology of Israel was recently published by Amihai Ma- zar (Archaeology of the Land of the Bible 10,000-586 B.C.E., New York 1990). This book will be the most useful textbook and general reference volume for the next 10 years. One of the most influential books to have appeared recently is Israel Finkelstein's The Ar- chaeology of the Israelite Settlement (Jerusalem 1988). By employing a combination of ecological, ethno- graphic, and archaeological survey and excavation data (largely based upon the author's Land of Ephraim survey and excavation at 'Izbet Sartah), it represents the most comprehensive archaeological treatment of the perplexing issue of Israelite settle- ment to date. Rachel Hachlili's Ancient Jewish Art and Architecture in the Land of Israel (Leiden 1988) covers the Has- monaean (Late Hellenistic) through the Byzantine period. Three numismatic studies dealing with Ro- man coinage were published by Ya'akov Meshorer: Masada I. The Coins ofMasada (Jerusalem 1989); City Coins of Eretz-Israel and the Decapolis in the Roman Period (Jerusalem 1985); the The Coinage of Aelia Capitolina (Jerusalem 1989). Two recent architectural studies on Islamic archi- tecture in Jerusalem deserve special mention. A study of the plan and decoration of the early Islamic mon- uments constructed where the First and Second Tem- ples once stood was published by Myriam Rosen- Ayalon: The Early Islamic Monuments of Al-Haram al-Sharif (Qedem 28, Jerusalem 1989). Michael Bur- goyne (Mamluk Jerusalem, London 1987) has pro- duced a meticulous architectural study of the magnificent buildings constructed from 1244 to 1517 in Jerusalem's Old City.

WOLFF [AJA 95 which 10 have been published and 10 are in press. The Israel Exploration Society publishes Israel Explo- ration Journal (IEJ), Qadmoniot (Hebrew), and Eretz- Israel (Erlsr) (Hebrew and English). Tel Aviv (TelAviv) (English) is published by the Institute of Archaeology, Tel Aviv University. The Israel Museum's annual journal contains articles in English on archaeological subjects. The leading journals devoted to or empha- sizing the archaeology of ancient Israel published abroad are Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research (BASOR), The Biblical Archaeologist (Bibl- Arch), Palestine Exploration Quarterly (PEQ), Levant, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Palidstina-Vereins (ZDPV), and, in a more popular format, Biblical Archaeology Review (BibArchRev). Three relatively new periodicals containing schol- arly reports on current archaeological activity in Israel have appeared in recent years. Mitekufat Haeven (From the Stone Age), with its fully bilingual English and Hebrew format from volume 18 (1985) on, is concerned with the prehistory of Israel. In addition to articles and reviews, it features a convenient list of prehistoric sites under excavation. Excavations and Surveys in Israel (ESI) is the annual English translation of Hadashot Arkheologiyot, providing summaries of the most recent fieldwork in Israel. It is ajoint publication of the IAA, the W.F. Albright Institute of Archaeo- logical Research, the Nelson Glueck School of Biblical Archaeology of the Hebrew Union College, and the Israel Exploration Society. Michmanim, published by the Reuben and Edith Hecht Museum, University of Haifa, contains articles in English and Hebrew on a variety of archaeological subjects. Two additional new journals, Journal of Mediterranean Archaeology (JMA) and Transeuphratine (the latter devoted to the Persian period) also contain articles relating to archaeology in Israel. Museums and Archaeological Institutions. Highlights of the archaeological collection of the Is- rael Museum were recently exhibited in the United States and published in a handsome catalogue.22 The Israel Museum's Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age pavilions have been renovated and redesigned. Re- cent exhibitions on scarabs, coins of Aelia Capitolina, perfumes and cosmetics, Tell Aphek, and Nahial Kana were mounted--catalogues are available for all. The recently opened Tower of David Museum of the His- tory ofJerusalem does not contain artifacts but graph- ically portrays the history of the city through paintings, dioramas, computer graphics, holograms, models, etc. Finds from the City of David excavations, Jerusalem, will remain on display at the Institute of Archaeology, Hebrew University, until they tour the United States later this year. The Hecht Museum on the campus of the University of Haifa presently dis- plays finds from excavations at Horvat Rosh Zayit, Tel Nami, and Tel Akko. An exhibition entitled "Eynan-The Beginning of a Revolution" was re- cently mounted at the Stekelis Prehistoric Museum, Haifa. Four new on-site (or near-site) exhibits are espe- cially worth mentioning: 1) Daily life of the prehistoric inhabitants of the Mount Carmel Caves is popularly presented at a new on-site Visitor's Center; 2) finds from the excavations at Arad are handsomely dis- played at the Arad Visitor's Center; 3) a display of finds from Tel Miqne-Ekron is on view in a new museum at Kibbutz Revadim; and 4) one of the ex- cavated Byzantine houses at Qasrin was transformed into a living museum, providing a glimpse of domestic life in the Talmudic period (see below, fig. 48). The Museums of Israel23 is a handy guide for those interested in visiting archaeological collections housed in museums scattered throughout the country. Two milestones were celebrated in 1990 by local archaeological institutions. The W.F. Albright Insti- tute of Archaeological Research, the American School of Oriental Research in Jerusalem, celebrated its 90th year of active support of American research in the field of ancient Near Eastern studies. Among its major research projects are the Dead Sea Scrolls and the excavations of Ashkelon, Caesarea, Miqne- Ekron, Gezer, Lahav, Sepphoris, and Shechem. The Ecole Biblique, whose faculty, program, and unique library have made it a major center for research in ancient Near Eastern languages, literature, and ar- chaeology, celebrated its centenary. The Ecole contin- ues its scholarly activities with its excavations at the Amman Citadel and its Qumran and Bible dejerusalem publications. CURRENT EXCAVATIONS Overview. Exceptional preservation at the Lower Palaeolithic site of Gesher Banot Ya'aqov and the underwater village of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic period at 'Atlit-Yam portends well for future significant con- tributions. New information on Neolithic artistic ex- pression and cult is found in the recently published Nahal Hemar report. While important excavations continue at Shiqmim and Gilat, the Sataf excavations, 22 K. Howard ed., Treasures of the Holy Land (New York 1986). 23 By N. Rosovsky and J. Ungerleider-Mayerson (New York 1989).</page><page sequence="5">1991] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ISRAEL 493 outside Jerusalem, open a window on a secondary settlement zone in the Chalcolithic period. The dis- covery of gold bracelets at Nahal Kana addresses the issues of social differentiation and long-distance trade in the Chalcolithic period. The fortification system at Tel Yarmut and the temple at nearby Hartuv highlight the finds from the Early Bronze Age. Several excavations in the southern coastal plain provide new evidence for connections between Egypt and Canaan during the EBA. Regional projects of Douglas Esse (University of Chicago) and Moshe Kochavi (TAU), similar in methodology to that of A. Ben-Tor's Yoqne'am Project, will demonstate by means of excavation the interactions between the main city, satellite villages, enclosure sites, and ceme- teries. Excavations of the Middle Bronze Age fortifications at Tel Dan, Tel Kabri, Tel Gerisa, Tell Ashkelon, and Tel Haror have provided new variations on the theme of an earthen rampart covered by a glacis and topped with mudbrick walls and towers. The discovery of a Minoan-style floor at Tel Kabri sheds new light on Minoan-Levantine connections and provides an im- portant chronological peg. One noteworthy discovery from the LBA was that of collared-rim pithoi, tradi- tionally associated with Israelite material culture, in a 13th-century context at Tel Nami. Excavations continue to focus on the archaeology of the Sea Peoples. While many aspects of Philistine material culture are already known to us, new studies have attempted to define the Tjeker culture at Tel Dor and the Sherdan culture at Tel Akko and Tel Keisan. Excavations at Tell Ashkelon and Tel Miqne- Ekron shed light on Philistine urban centers while those at Tel Beth Shemesh, Tel Yarmut, and Tel Haror provide evidence for their presence in periph- eral zones. A Philistine "hearth sanctuary" from Tel Miqne-Ekron exhibits affinities with the Aegean world. Neutron activation analyses have determined that Mycenaean IIIC:Ib pottery, which announces the arrival of the Philistines, was manufactured locally at Tell Qasile, Tel Ashdod, and Tel Miqne. Excavations at the northern coastal sites of Akhziv, Tel Kabri, and Horvat Rosh Zayit (identified with biblical Cabul) reveal a Phoenician cultural presence in the Iron Age II, as might be expected due to their proximity to the Kingdom of Tyre and the biblical accounts describing the Land of Cabul that was ceded by Solomon to Hiram of Tyre (1 Kings 9.10-13; cf. 2 Chron. 8.1-2). Evidence for an even earlier Phoeni- cian presence was detected at Tel Dor. Excavations have brought to light Phoenician cities at Dor and Ashkelon in the Persian period, previously known only through literary sources. Also noteworthy is the Phoenician inscription on an Egyptian bronze situla from the Persian-period temple at Har Mispe Yamim. Outstanding discoveries relating to Iron Age cult were made at Tel Dan and Tel Miqne-Ekron. Those from the latter site were related to its olive-oil indus- try, the largest known from the ancient Near East. Imported Greek material, primarily pottery, found in Israel in recent and past excavations, is being stud- ied by Jane Waldbaum (University of Wisconsin-Mil- waukee). The Greek material ranges in date from the ninth/eighth through the fourth centuries and is com- posed of mainland Greek and East Greek types. An important aspect of her study will be the scientific analysis of material referred to as East Greek, includ- ing domestic and transport wares, with a view toward determining significant groupings of material and possible proveniences. Her work is being conducted in collaboration with Richard Jones (British School of Archaeology in Athens) and Joseph Yellin (HU). The unveiling of a spectacular city at Beit Shean (ancient Nysa-Scythopolis) dominates the list of Ro- man- and Byzantine-period discoveries. Its architec- ture, art, and town planning exhibit a distinctly Roman pattern whose Classical appearance contin- ued, with alterations, into the Byzantine period. Religious structures based on the basilica plan con- tinue to be surveyed and excavated in quantity. Recent surveys conducted by Z. Ma'oz brought to light 25 synagogues in the Golan Heights, while those by the late Z. Ilan revealed approximately 60 synagogue sites in the Upper and Eastern Galilee and 20 in the Judean Shephelah. Excavations at the well-preserved syn- agogues at Meroth and Qasrin were completed in 1987; those at Horvat Sumaq continue. Ecclesiastic buildings were excavated at Tel Jezreel, Mount Geri- zim, Jerusalem (Mamilla Street, "Third Wall"), Ash- kelon, Horvat Karkur 'Illit, Be'er Shem'a, Beersheva (Abu Matar), and the Cities of the Desert-Oboda, Nessana, and Rehovot-in-the-Negev. A totally differ- ent religious architectural tradition, that of open-air mosques, has come to light in a number of excavations in the Negev. PALAEOLITHIC-EPIPALAEOLITHIC 'Ubeidiya. Excavations at 'Ubeidiya, where the old- est traces of man in the Near East have been discov- ered, renewed in 1988 and 1989 under the direction of Ofer Bar-Yosef (Harvard University), Eitan Tcher- nov (HU), and C. Garin (French Research Center, Jerusalem). The emphasis of the present excavations is on archaeozoological and palaeontological analyses. Recent research suggests that occupation at the site dates to ca. 1.4 million years B.P.</page><page sequence="6">494 SAMUEL R. WOLFF [AJA 95 Gesher Banot Ya'aqov. Na'ama Goren-Inbar (HU) renewed excavations at this site in 1989 and 1990. Finds from the 1989 season included basalt and flint tools and a wild elephant cranium. Preservation is such that wood, including a piece 1.5 m in length, and seeds have been found throughout the site which dates to at least one-half million years B.P. Kebara Cave. Excavations of the Middle and Up- per Palaeolithic units were conducted throughout the 1980s under the direction of Ofer Bar-Yosef (Har- vard University), B. Vandermeersch (Bordeaux Uni- versity), and Baruch Arensburg (TAU). In the 1983 season a burial of a young male Neanderthal of the Middle Palaeolithic period was uncovered. Radiomet- ric evidence indicates that this Neanderthal, dated to ca. 60,000 B.P., occurs later than H. sapiens from Qafzeh Cave (ca. 90,000 B.P.), which precludes that he is modern man's progenitor. Quneitra. The final report of the excavations at this open-air Mousterian site, directed by Na'ama Goren-Inbar (HU), was recently published (Qedem 31, 1990). This site can be compared to Fara II in the Western Negev (see L'Anthropologie 92 [1988] 797- 807), excavated by Isaac Gilead (BGU), in that both are Middle Palaeolithic open-air sites with living ho- rizons upon which relatively well-preserved faunal remains and conjoinable artifacts were discovered. Ohalo. As a result of the current drought, the level of the Sea of Galilee has fallen considerably. The receding shoreline brought to light a Kebaran site named Ohalo, located at the foot of Tel Beit Yerah. The most recent season, directed by Dani Nadel (IAA), produced a skeleton dated to ca. 19,000 B.P. The very existence of the site at that location dem- onstrates that the level of the Sea of Galilee was lower than most scholars had previously thought. Palyno- logical studies confirm that Israel was dry and prob- ably cold, coeval with the last glaciation in Europe. Neve David. A human burial was excavated at this large site by Daniel Kaufman and Avraham Ronen (both UH). This is the first known Geometric Kebaran burial. A.N.

Rectangular structures from Yarmukian phase of Pottery Neolithic. "Part of a Pre-Pottery Neolithic A structure, with a rounded mudbrick wall, was unearthed. Finds in- cluded many flint, basalt, and limestone tools and implements (fig. 2). The location of these remains at the elevation of at least 242 m below sea-level clearly contradicts the hypothesis of the so-called Beisan Lake. The main contribution of the Gesher assem- blage lies in its unique clean context, its very short time span, its early date, and its tool combination. The finds from Gesher point to the problematic nature of the definitions of the Sultanian and the Khiamian, and stress the need for better criteria to distinguish cultural entities in the first stages of the Neolithic period in the Levant."

Excavations conducted by Tamar Noy (Is- rael Museum) determined that this site was occupied in two short phases of the early PPNA (beginning of the eighth millennium).

The architecture of the dwellings, which includes the earliest well so far discovered in the ancient world, the lithic tool assemblage, and the ra- diocarbon dates indicate a date of ca. 8100-7500 B.P. Floral and faunal remains indicate that the village economy was complex, based on diverse food re- sources that included hunting, incipient herding, fish- ing, and farming. These most probably enabled year- round occupation. More important, however, is the fact that 'Atlit-Yam is among the first communities to yield evidence of maritime activity."

They yielded rich flint, faunal, groundstone, shell, and bone tool assemblages from the PPNB pe- riod. See Mitekufat Haeven 22 (1989) 82*-92*. Nahal Hemar Cave. The final report of this im- portant PPNB site was published by O. Bar-Yosef and D. Alon ('Atiqot, English Series 18 [1988]). Finds in- clude a rich flint assemblage that was imported to the site consisting mainly of unretouched blades and the "Nalhal Hemar knife"; bone spatulas, shuttles, awls, and a hook; wooden objects, a sickle consisting of flint sickle blades inserted into a curved haft made of a caprine horn and held in place by an adhesive made of resin; shell, stone, plaster, and wooden beads; the remains of an anthropomorphic plaster statue; four anthropoid bone figurines; a nearly complete stone mask and a fragment of a second; outstanding ex- amples of cordage, basketry, and fabrics; and six hu- man skulls bearing a net-like covering of asphalt.

WOLFF [AJA 95 of both daily life and ritual activity of a particular Neolithic social group." Palmahim. Two Neolithic sites were excavated by Avi Gopher (TAU) at Palmahim. He reports that "these sites, whose features included wind shelters, stone installations, and hearths, with the main finds being groundstone tools and flint implements, are part of a series of small ephemeral camps of Neolithic groups that exploited the rich resources of the area. The many arrowheads indicate hunting activities and the scrapers and burins represent camp activities. The fairly large group of sickle blades was most probably for harvesting grains, but we have no evidence for domestication. Both sites were occupied in the PPNB and some stage of the Pottery Neolithic periods." Tel Dan. Avraham Biran (HUC) reports: "Evi- dence for the existence of a Pottery Neolithic settle- ment at Tel Dan was first uncovered during the 19th season of excavations at the southern part of the site. Remains of a wall and floor were found above bed- rock. Four occupation levels were documented. Flint tools, jars, bowls, a high-footed basalt bowl, and an infant jar burial were found. The settlement at the time seems to have extended over most of the site, as additional remains were found 200 m farther to the north during the 23rd season of excavations in 1989." See Mitekufat Haeven 20 (1987) 91-113. Sha'ar Hagolan. Excavations conducted by Yosef Garfinkel (HU) produced for the first time substantial architecture belonging to the Yarmukian phase of the Neolithic. "Rectangular structures constructed on stone foundations were discovered, including a mon- umental structure built of stone walls I m wide and preserved to a maximum height of 60 cm (fig. 3). In addition to the many pottery vessels, flint tools, stone artifacts, one obsidian item (the first one reported from a Yarmukian site), figurines made on pebbles, and fragments of clay figurines were found." Tel 'Ali (Khirbet esh-Sheikh 'Ali). Previous exca- vations at this site have established one of the most complete stratigraphic sequences from the seventh to the fourth millennium. Renewed excavations by Yosef Garfinkel (HU) have exposed the following sequence: "Stratum I-Ghassulian Chalcolithic. Stratum II-a pre-Ghassulian phase, differing from the Wadi Raba Culture, as represented by the pottery assemblage of the site of Munhata. Stratum III--a Pre-Pottery phase in which some of the flint tools are typical of the Pottery Neolithic. This stage could perhaps be iden- tical with the phase designated PPNC at 'Ain Ghazal (Jordan). The data collected from both Sha'ar Ha- golan and Tel 'Ali will help clarify the chronological framework of the various stages within the sixth and fifth millennia, their material culture, economic basis and settlement pattern in the Central Jordan Valley." Nahal Zehora I and II. Two sites located on the southern fringes of the Jezreel Valley were excavated by Gopher. Both yielded material belonging to the Wadi Raba phase of the Neolithic (mid-fifth millen- nium); Yarmukian and another component were also identified at Nahal Zehora II. Both sites yielded rec- tangular architecture built of stone, mudbrick, and plaster. The well-preserved faunal assemblages con- sisted of mainly domesticated animals-sheep/goat, cattle, and pig; fish, equus, and fallow deer were also discerned. A fetal burial in ajar was exposed in Nahal Zehora II, buried outside a house. A report on Nahal Zehora I appeared in BASOR 276 (1989) 67-76. Eilat. A burial site from the Late Neolithic-Early Chalcolithic periods, located on the western outskirts of Eilat, was excavated in 1988 and 1989 by Uzi Avner (IAA) and Y. Hershkovitz (TAU). Avner reports: "Nineteen tumuli were identified, of which nine were preserved for excavation. They were well built, with large stones forming a burial chamber, usually circu- lar, 1.5-3 m in diameter, surrounded by additional stone circles. Standing stones, or massebot, often in pairs, were attached to the outside or were found inside the tombs (fig. 4). (For Avner's interpretation of these standing stones, see TelAviv 11 [1984] 115- 19; BiblArch 53 [1990] 133-36.) The burials were secondary and included more than one individual. Next to several tombs the remains of hearths were discovered (fig. 5). Sixty-five hearths were detected around two of the tombs in an area of 15 x 40 m. A stone installation was found on the eastern side of one of the tombs. Its bottom was paved by flagstones, upon which the remains of a wooden trunk were found standing vertically (fig. 6). This is the remains of a sacred tree representing a chief fertility goddess (in biblical Hebrew-the 'Asherah'), which was responsi- ble for reincarnation of the dead. "Finds included a crescent-shaped arrowhead of transparent quartz, two Neolithic 'winged' arrow- heads, grinding stones, Chalcolithic flint scrapers, and beads made from shell, faience, and copper. Ten calibrated 14C samples yielded a full sequence of dates ranging from 5400 to 4200 B.C.E." Overviews of the Neolithic period by O. Bar-Yosef, G.O. Rollefson, and J. Cauvin were published in Pa- ldorient 15 (1989). See Nahal Kana below. CHALCOLITHIC Taiyiba. A salvage excavation directed by Yosef Porath (IAA) brought to light a Chalcolithic burial cave. It had been previously robbed but several areas remained untouched. Porath reports that "the burials were secondary burials in ceramic ossuaries and in several large kraters.

The ossuaries were crowded together on the ledges along the cave walls and on the floor. Funerary offerings of pottery were placed on and around the ossuaries, including v- shaped bowls, small bowls, chalices, cornets, and jugs. Painted decoration is prevalent. Some of the ossuaries bear delicate geometric designs. The facades of the house-shaped ossuaries are decorated with schematic human faces-a prominent nose and modeled or painted eyes." Additional ossuaries were unearthed in the 1990/91 winter season at Kissufim (details unavailable). Nahal Kana. Avi Gopher and Tzvika Tsuk (TAU) excavated a cave site in the Nahal Kana region that yielded surprising and unparalleled finds. The cave was occupied in the Yarmukian phase of the Pottery Neolithic (sixth millennium), the Chalcolithic (fourth millennium), and the EB I period (late fourth/early third millennium). The Neolithic finds included a rich assemblage of pottery vessels. What was apparently a 4i777' Fig. 8. Sataf.

Numerous frag- ments of ossuaries, pottery, and basalt vessels, and objects of ivory, bone, turquoise, and metal were found in the Chalcolithic layers. The highlight is a group of eight hammered circlets, two of solid gold, the others in electrum, a gold alloy. This is the earliest appearance of gold in Israel and among the oldest in the world. The EB finds included pottery vessels and one bronze dagger. A brief report was published in CurrAnthr 31 (1990) 436-43 and an exhibition, with catalogue, was held at the Israel Museum. Sataf. The first stratigraphic sequence of Chalco- lithic date in the central hill country has been revealed at Sataf, an agricultural terraced landscape located west of Jerusalem (fig. 7). Shimon Gibson (Institute of Archaeology, London) reports that three Chalco- lithic phases of activity have been exposed (fig. 8). The pottery is similar to the Ghassulian assemblages known from southern Palestine: v-shaped bowls, churns, and cornets. Since the survey yielded no ma- terial from this or the subsequent EB I period, one may expect that other protohistoric sites remain bur- ied under later agricultural terracing. Such sites will change our understanding of the settlement distri- bution in the hill country during these early periods. An important discovery is the identification by Caro- line Grigson of camel foot bones from a Chalcolithic context at Sataf. This is by far the earliest and most northern siting of camel. It is hoped that radiocarbon dating will support the date (cf. JAS 16 [1989] 355- 62). See Levant 23 (1991) and IEJ 40 (1990) 223-26. Tell Halif (Lahav). Joe D. Seger (Mississippi State University) reports that excavations in 1989 at site 101 "provided clear confirmation that phase 10 was, in fact, Chalcolithic in date." Occupants from this phase lived in a cave whose roof had subsequently collapsed, thus slowing excavation progress. Grar. Isaac Gilead (BGU), in collaboration with Jean Perrot (French Center for Scientific Research, Jerusalem), conducted excavations at this large Chal- colithic settlement site between 1981 and 1987 (FA 16 [1989] 377-94). One main Chalcolithic unit with pits and mudbrick walls was revealed, representing a single occupation. A rich pottery assemblage was dis- covered, including small bowls with everted sides, medium-size jars, holemouth jars, "cornets," churns, and "Cream ware" jars. Petrographic analysis "indi- cates that almost the entire assemblage was locally produced." Other finds include 695 flint tools (24% sickle blades), limestone tools, groundstone objects, a seal, and a seal impression. Gilead characterizes the site as "a fully sedentary farming community . similar, in many ways, to the economy of the recent Levantine fellahin." He distinguishes the Nahal Be- sor/Grar cluster of sites from those in the Nahal Beer- sheva to the east. "They shared the same cultural background, but each group had its own modes of life . . . It is unknown yet whether these were two phases in a local cultural development or two contem- porary facies." Gilat.

"A site survey found Chalcolithic cultural remains extending over an area of ca. 120 dunams (30 acres), with the low-profile mound (30 dunams or 7 acres) rising up ca. 2 m in the center of this distribution. Seven phases of architecture belong- ing to two main sanctuary strata, II and III, were excavated in areaJ/West. The main architectural finds were a domicile complex that may be identified as the residence of cultic personnel, and a room whose east- ern extent consists of an apsidal wall (fig. 9). The latter represents one of the earliest examples of this building style in Israel. Fragments of 13 violin-shaped figurines were found in area J. Ten burials were also found in this area, distributed throughout the phases. Excavations in area Y/East yielded poorer preserva- tion. Three vertical standing stones, or massebot, pos- sibly related to a kind of altar or offering table, were found in stratum IIc. A mudbrick lined "tub" was found in stratum IIIb. A nearby pit contained a wealth of pottery including some unique vessels shaped like large amphorae." See JMA 2 (1989) 163-221 and Erlsr 21 (Jerusalem 1990) 23-36 (Hebrew, with En- glish summary).

A series of bell-shaped subterranean stor- age pits, similar to those found at Bir Abu Matar, Bir es-Safadi, and Kh. el-Beter, were found associated with building period (BP) II with its rectilinear build- ings. In area Y, an open-air altar was defined. This large structure (ca. 2.1 m high, 5.2 m long and 2.5 m wide) was built against a terrace face that had been carved out of the natural loessial sediments. Steps led up to the altar. Two v-shaped bowls and a small mortar were found on its surface. The surface sealed a pottery cache that presumably served as a founda- tion deposit (fig. 10). A possible second altar was found nearby to the east. After seven seasons of field- work, subterranean rooms similar to those found at Bir es-Safadi and Bir Abu Matar were discovered in the 1989 season in area J (fig. 11). A tunnel led to a system of nine underground rooms and related fea- tures. Two main phases of use were discerned: the earlier consisting of three rooms, probably con- structed in BP III (the lowest) and the later including nine rooms possibly used during BP II.

Thus, there is clear evidence for a fairly long occupation at Shiqmim, which according to calibrated radiocarbon dates spans at least the period from 4200-3800. This includes three well-documented main architectural building phases. For the 1989 season, see IEJ 40 (1990) 226-28. Two syntheses of the Chalcolithic period have been published recently, one by T. Levy in BiblArch 49 (1986) 83-108, the other by I. Gilead in Journal of World Prehistory 2 (1988) 397-443. The main differ- ence between the views of these scholars lies in their interpretation of the evidence for social stratification, with Levy arguing for its presence and Gilead against it. A lively exchange by these two scholars and D. Esse can be found in the reviews and response of T. Levy ed., Shiqmim I. (BAR-IS 356, Oxford 1987) in Miteku- fat Haeven 20 (1988). See also Tel 'Ali and Eilat above, and Tel Jezreel below. EARLY BRONZE AGE Several examples of "enclosure" sites (sites situated on rocky spurs with cliffs providing natural defenses on three sides and an artificial wall on the fourth) have been identified in the Golan and Galilee regions. These sites have been interpreted as large animal pens. Recent probes at the enclosure sites at Gamla and Leviah are reported below. Gamla. Under the remains of the late city (see below), finds from the EBA were found in every field. Excavations in 1987-1988 led by S. Gutman in area B yielded several loci belonging to the EBA. D. Goren reports that "the finds consisted of hand-made pot- tery, large amounts of lithic material, especially EB sickle blades, basalt tools and weapons, and a possible votive bronze axe. The absence of Khirbet Kerak ware seems to indicate that the EB occupation was mainly during EB I-II." See Mitekufat Haeven 22 (1989) 115*"-28*. Leviah Enclosure. Moshe Kochavi (TAU) exca- vated this site in 1988 as part of the Land of Geshur project. Occupation seems to have occurred through- out the EBA, although architecture, consisting of "houses with rectilinear stone walls and stone-paved floors," is reported only from EB III. The presence of architectural remains within the enclosure signifies that more activities than grazing of animals were tak- ing place there. See ESI 7-8 (1988-1989) 111; IEJ 39 (1989) 1-17. Tel Kabri. A. Kempinski (TAU) and W.-D. Nie- meier (University of Freiburg) report that in area B, excavation of an oval building was completed in 1990. The building measures ca. 9 m in length and 4.2 m in width, with three central pillars. It had four floor levels, the latest of which contains Metallic ware, which is characteristic of the beginning of EB II. In a sound- ing to the east of the oval building, a secondary burial of an adult in a holemouth jar that was in turn placed within ajar was discovered.</page><page sequence="14">502 SAMUEL R. WOLFF [AJA 95 Qiryat 'Ata. Amir Golani and Eliot Braun (IAA) conducted a rescue season of excavations in the au- tumn of 1990. They report two levels of occupation. The uppermost, dated to the EB II-III horizon, con- sisted of disjointed architectural features and concen- trations of associated pottery. The lower level was better preserved, yielding two "sausage-shaped" buildings dated to an advanced phase of early EB I (as at 'En Shadud, Megiddo stages V-IV, and Tel Qashish). The larger of the two buildings (length ca. 16 m) was destroyed by fire. Its burnt mudbrick su- perstructure sealed numerous pottery vessels. The second smaller building (length ca. 10 m) was appar- ently abandoned, with much pottery left behind on its earthen floor. Tel Yaqush. The first season of excavations was conducted by Douglas Esse (University of Chicago) in 1989 (IEJ 40 [1990] 222-23). Stratified architectural remains from EB I, EB II, and EB III were identified (fig. 12). The ceramic finds included Metallic-ware platters, bowls, and storage jars (EB II), and all types of Khirbet Kerak ware (EB III). Similar repertoires can be found at nearby Beit Yerah. Over 200 flint sickle blades and groundstone tools attest to the ag- ricultural nature of the subsistence base of the village. Sataf. The EB I (=Proto-Urban B) remains are more widespread than those from the Chalcolithic period, implying substantial woodland clearance in the area of the two springs and concurrent terrace construction. If I. Finkelstein's survey27 and the Na.hal Refa'im/Manahat excavations push the invention and utilization of terraces back to the Middle Bronze Age, the Sataf excavations make it appear likely that they are even more ancient. Hartuv. Three short seasons of excavations by Amihai Mazar (HU) and Pierre de Miroschedji (French Research Center, Jerusalem) brought to light a unique cultic structure. They report that three strata were discerned, two dating to EB I (strata 2 and 3) and one sometime after EB I (stratum 1). Stratum 2 yielded a unique public building complex that in- cluded a broadroom, probably to be identified as a temple. Five flat stones may have served as pillar bases that supported the roof. Most important was a row of nine worked stone slabs found standing on their nar- row side along the inner face of the southern wall. These stones were probably originally freestanding (i.e., massebot) and were later incorporated into the building. Additional features found elsewhere in the complex include two well-carved stone jambs and a flat stone that may have served as an offering table or stela. The empty floors of stratum 2 indicate that the site was peacefully abandoned, with the inhabitants perhaps moving to nearby Tel Yarmut. In addition to the pottery vessels decorated in parallel reddish- orange stripes and those with incised decorations found around the necks of closed vessels, some sherds of Egyptian types, but produced in the southern coastal plain, have been identified. Tel Yarmut. Previous seasons at this 40-acre urban site revealed public and private structures surrounded by a massive fortification system dated to the EB II and EB III. P. de Miroschedji (French Research Cen- ter, Jerusalem) directed the seventh season of exca- vations at Yarmut in 1989. Work in area C attempted to clarify the sequence of occupation preceding its fortification. These probes confirmed that the first city wall was erected not at the beginning but some- time during EB II. In addition, a possible defensive structure consisting of an artificial slope abutting a heap of boulders (a rampart?) may indicate yet an earlier fortification system dating to the first half of EB II. In area E, a deep cavity located near the West Gate was partially cleared. It probably served as a rock shelter. The shelter was in use as late as EB IIIB, after which it was intentionally sealed with large stones covered with a layer of earth mixed with plaster. Excavations in area G were undertaken in order to clarify the plan and chronology of the houses previ- ously uncovered there. Five strata were identified: EB II (stratum G-V) was reached only in deep soundings; stratum G-IV dates to EB IIIA, while rich deposits from EB IIIB came from strata G-III and G-II (for- merly G-I). The latter stratum yielded a series of houses built on terraces and included a storeroom containing pithoi in situ and domestic installations. Yarmut thus provides us with excellent stratified EB II and EB III material that will serve to define further the ceramic typologies of these periods. Excavations on the Iron Age acropolis in 1989 dis- tinguished three strata dating from the beginning of the Iron Age to the 11th century. The 11th-century stratum yielded a kiln whose associated pottery in- cluded painted Philistine sherds. See P. de Miroschedji et al., Yarmouth I (Paris 1988) for a report on the first three seasons, and Erlsr 21 (Jerusalem 1990) 48"-61" for a discussion of the fortifications. Palmahim Quarry. Eliot Braun (IAA) reports on two seasons (1989-1990) of rescue work carried out at this southern coastal site.

Fig. 13. Palmahim Quarry. Aerial view. Note "sausage-shaped" buildings. (Courtesy Israel Antiquities Authority) the EBA were discerned. Stratum 3, the lowest, yielded evidence for a "sausage-shaped house," a type known from early EB I occupations at Byblos, Sidon- Dakermann, Yiftal.'el II, and Tel Te'o V, IV (cf. PEQ 121 [1989] 1-43). Gray-burnished ware bowls were identified from this stratum. Stratum 2 consisted of "a number of buildings arranged in what seem to be small, sometimes complex, mutually exclusive struc- tures. Included are two rectangular buildings, one an almost typical broadroom with internal bench and pillar bases. Other rooms are either rectangular, ir- regularly shaped, or circular (one ca. 15 m in diame- ter). On the basis of the well-ordered architectural remains, it would seem that there is considerable ev- idence for some form of central planning." This stra- tum can be dated to late EB I (=Arad IV). An incised serekh of an unknown king and a small amount of pottery of Egyptian inspiration were found. Stratum 1 reused and altered the walls from the previously abandoned stratum. The ceramics from it also date to the late EB I. Nissanim. A brief rescue excavation was carried out in 1989 by Ram Gophna (TAU) and Yuval Yeku- tieli (BGU) at this EBA site. Yekutieli reports that three layers of occupation were found in an excavated area of 40 m2. In the latest layer (1), one adult and two children's burials were excavated. Among other finds were two pieces of Khiret Kerak ware. This layer dated to EB III. Layer 2, which consisted of a half meter fill overlying a floor, dates to the beginning of EB I (=Far'ah site H, Taur Ikhbeina, for which see ESI 6 [1987] 99). No Egyptian imports were found. Layer 3 consisted of two small pits containing pottery belonging to the end of the Chalcolithic period or the beginning of the EB. "The faunal material from layers 1 and 2 indicate that the inhabitants were largely sedentary and had a mixed marine and land-based subsistence economy." Tel 'Erani. In 1988, Aharon Kempinski (TAU) and Isaac Gilead (BGU) completed their third season of excavations at this urban southern coastal plain site. Their goal was to check the stratigraphy of S. Yeivin's previous excavations and to add a multidisciplinary approach to the fieldwork. The directors report that the excavations yielded three phases of EB I (as op- posed to Yeivin's strata XI-V), a situation that agrees with the picture of southern Israel in general: an early phase (cf. Taur Ikhbeina, site H, Nissanim) with no architectural remains; a middle phase, which was the most active building phase; and a late phase, which dates to the time of the Egyptian King Narmer (cf. Arad IV, Palmahim Quarry above).</page><page sequence="16">504 SAMUEL R.

Phase 9, dated to EB I, was built over the Chalcolithic collapsed caves mentioned above. "A trash dump from this stratum yielded the heads and articulated vertebrae of three canines, large equid bones, and a cache of discarded clay jar and jug sealings bearing numerous impressions from a single stamp seal. The EB I dating of the cache is proved by its direct association with sherds of a large red-on-white striped EB I holemouth vessel and with a red-on-white net painted jar." Arad. After 18 seasons of excavation under the direction of Ruth Amiran (Israel Museum), fieldwork has ceased at the Bronze Age city of Arad. The site has yielded a remarkably well-preserved city plan from the Early Bronze Age. The last project to have been undertaken was the excavation of the water reservoir of the EB city and well of the Israelite and Herodian fortress (BibArchRev 13 [1987] 40-44). Early Arad II and III are due to be published soon by the Israel Exploration Society, the Israel Museum, and the Israel Antiquities Authority. See Suzanne Richard's overview of the EBA in BiblArch 50 (1987) 22-44. See also Nahal Kana above, Tell Ashkelon and Tel Beit Shean below. EARLY BRONZE AGE IV/MIDDLE BRONZE AGE I Jerusalem. Emmanuel Eisenberg's (IAA) excava- tions at Nahal Refa'im have provided us with our first glimpse of village life in this area during this transitional period. He reports that "the lowest stra- tum (III) consists of three phases, indicating a rela- tively lengthy occupation. The houses were aggregates of several rectangular rooms with walls constructed of fired mudbricks laid on stone foun- dations or directly on bedrock. Floors were usually of beaten earth laid on leveled fills. Typical features in the houses were sunken stone mortars, cup-marks, stone pillar bases, storage installations, and small paved hearths. "The two upper phases of stratum III provide evi- dence of violent destruction, indicated by many pot- tery fragments and valuable objects found in the debris of the collapsed houses. The pottery of this occupation is characteristic of the southern EB IV family." The excavation at Manahat, directed by Gershon Edelstein (IAA), neighbors the one mentioned above. Most of the MB IIB buildings were founded on the earlier EB IV/MB I settlement. Typical storage jars, cooking pots, and bowls of this period were found. A synthesis of this period by I. Finkelstein can be found in Levant 21 (1989) 129-40. The results of Finkelstein's soundings and tomb survey (over 1,100 shaft tombs!) in 1987 at Dhahr Mirzbaneh appeared in Erlsr 21 (Jerusalem 1990, in Hebrew, with English summary).

Preliminary Report of 1989 Season 4 [Tel Aviv 1990] fig. 11) Laish, a large jar burial containing the skeleton of a two- to three-year-old child and a stone-built tomb (ca. 4.0 x 1.7 x ca. 2.0 m) were found. The latter was devoid of skeletal remains but contained four com- plete MB IIB pottery vessels. Further information relating to the MB earthen ramparts was obtained in the 1988 and 1989 seasons at the northern end of the site. Here the stone construction serving as a core consists of an elaborate system that included a but- tressed wall built of stone with mudbrick superstruc- ture (fig. 14). Between the buttresses a stone fill extended some 5 m northward. Layers of earth and clay were deposited on the stone fill and against the brick to obtain the outer slope of the earthen ram- parts. See Erlsr 21 (Jerusalem 1990) 56-65 (Hebrew, with English summary). Gesher. Fourteen undisturbed MB IIA graves were excavated by Yosef Garfinkel (HU). "The graves were, with few exceptions, for primary single burials in which the interred was laid in a flexed position with his head to the east and his feet to the west. Two or three pottery vessels and sometimes a bronze object or a perforated bone were placed by each body. One calibrated radiocarbon date of 2138-1907 correlates well with the typological analysis." See Erlsr 21 (Je- rusalem 1990) 132-47 (Hebrew, with English sum- mary). Tel Kabri. Considerable excitement was aroused with the discovery of a painted plastered floor deco- rated in Minoan style at Kabri (fig. 15).28 The floor, painted in true fresco technique (buon fresco), was painted with a grid pattern of red lines that was intended to imitate stone paving slabs. Floral motifs were discerned in certain areas. The floor from Kabri, with its parallels from the Aegean, establish the con- temporaneity of late MB IIB with LM 1A and LC lA. The floors "show a purely Minoan iconography as well as technique" that "were executed by traveling Minoan artisans," according to W.-D. Niemeier (p. xx).

Middle Bronze Age fortifications on northern slope. W.-D. Niemeier report that the new excavations made it clear that the room with the decorated floor ex- tended some 10 m to the west and that it functioned as a ceremonial hall with entrances from the north, west, and east. On the floor was found a large "Choc- olate-on-White" krater, providing additional evidence that the palace should be dated to ca. 1600. In area T is "a large structure that appears to have been a tower joined to the glacis. It appears that there existed here an outer wall, 4 m wide, built of very large stones. This wall was built on the edge of the glacis, and it is possible that it was built at a later stage, after the inner wall (W400) was no longer in use." Tel Nami. Michal Artzy (UH) reports that "storage rooms and a well that can be assigned to the MB IIA habitation have been uncovered. The storage rooms were burned, thus preserving a good ceramic assem- blage and botanical remains, of which some legumes were shown to be imported. A scarab-sealed terracotta weight indicates the period of Amenhemet III of Egypt's 12th Dynasty. The relatively large well found at Nami East (i.e., east of Tel Nami, which is on a peninsula) was already put out of use during the period as could be seen by the ceramic remains found in it. The proximity of the well to the coast will no doubt aid in the establishment of sea level during the first part of the second millennium." Aphek. The 14-year field project at Aphek, di- rected by Moshe Kochavi (TAU) was concluded in 1985. Final publications are now being prepared un- der the supervision of Kochavi and Pirhiya Beck. Its stratified sequence of MB IIA pottery is now the most reliable one from Israel (see P. Beck, TelAviv 12 [1985] 181-203). Jerusalem. E. Eisenberg estimates the size of the Canaanite settlement at Nahal Refa'im to be 40-50 dunams (10-12 acres). "Structures of stratum II (MB IIB) were constructed of large field stones and boul- ders bonded with mud and straw mortar. Some walls were preserved as high as 2 m. In addition to five complexes of rooms, an isolated building containing several votive pottery vessels is identified as a temple. The finds from this period suggest that the population subsisted on agriculture, cattle and sheep raising, and perhaps the manufacture of metal tools. The major industry of the site, however, may have been pottery manufacture; local dolomite sands from mines at the site were used to temper clay, creating wares of su- perior quality." G. Edelstein estimates the size of the MB II settle- ment at Manahat at 30-35 dunams (7-9 acres). Do- mestic architecture was found in each area. The complex in area 800 consists of a row of connected rooms, each with its own courtyard. Storage jars,</page><page sequence="19">1991] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ISRAEL 507 11... t.0?.

In the 1920s, John Garstang theo- rized that the massive Islamic-Crusader city fortifica- tions of Ashkelon were built on a Middle Bronze Age rampart that enclosed an area of ca. 150 acres. This hypothesis was confirmed through excavations con- ducted in grid 2 by the Harvard University team, under the direction of Lawrence Stager. A section made through the ramparts on the northern edge of the site yielded a sequence of four stages of glacis constructions dating to MB II. Perched on top of the fourth-stage glacis was a mudbrick wall measuring 2 m in thickness and preserved for 14.5 m. The rampart was modified in the early Iron Age with the addition of a large mudbrick tower (fig. 16). A beautifully preserved MBA gate was also brought to light. Its mudbrick walls are preserved several me- ters high. The gate was stratigraphically related to the first and second glacis construction. It was cancelled by the stepped-course kurkar (sandstone) cobble gla- cis of stages III and IV. In a probe made to the south of the gate, walls from the EB III period were re- vealed, thus providing the first evidence for occupa- tion at the site in that period. Outside the ramparts, abutting the glacis, a series of storerooms dating to the end of the MBA (ca. 1600- 1550) were excavated. In one of these storerooms a lovely cultic calf figurine was discovered (fig. 17). The body of the calf, which stood 11.5 cm long and 11 cm high, was made of bronze, the rest copper. The calf was once completely covered with a thick overleaf of pure silver. It was housed inside a ceramic vessel with a doorlike opening that served as its shrine. Bovine iconography was associated with El or Baal, leading deities in the Canaanite pantheon, and was later linked with the worship of Yahweh, a practice con- demned by the Prophet Hosea and rival priests from Jerusalem. See L.E. Stager, "When Canaanites and Philistines Ruled Ashkelon," BibArchRev 17.2 (1991) 24-43. Tel Haror. The sixth season of excavations was conducted in 1990 at this site, identified with biblical Gerar by the director, Eliezer Oren (BGU). Previous excavation seasons were concentrated on the acrop- olis, yielding an impressive sequence of late Iron Age and Persian period remains that included a wide ram- part, a massive city wall, and a kurkar stone-capped glacis. Four different operations in the 1990 cam- paign dealt with the MB settlement, whose estimated size of 150 dunams (38 acres) ranks it as one of the largest sites in southern Canaan: 1) Excavations in the MBA cultic complex, the only one known from south- ern Canaan, that was discovered in the 1988 season</page><page sequence="20">508 SAMUEL R. WOLFF [AJA 95 in area K were expanded to the south and to the east of the large courtyard, attaining an exposure of ca. 500 m2. The area surrounding the square mudbrick altar yielded several favissae (avg. diam. 40 cm, avg. depth 40 cm) that contained votive ceramic vessels and animal bones, primarily crow and puppies, pre- sumably sacrificial victims. Adjoining rooms to the north and east of the altar were also excavated. Benches with offerings placed upon them, including many cultic vessels, attest to the ritual nature of these rooms. In several loci, collapsed mudbrick walls were found, one of which consisted of more than 20 courses that once stood more than 4 m high. 2) At the southern edge of the site, overlooking the Nahal Gerar, a well some 3 m in diameter was exca- vated to a depth of 11.5 m by Ya'aqov Nir and Iris Eldar. Perhaps as much as one-third of its original height has been eroded away. The upper 7 m was built of local sandstone; the remainder was cut through bedrock. The well was filled with a homo- geneous ceramic assemblage dated to MB II. Note that the wells of Gerar are mentioned in the story of Isaac and Abimelech, King of Gerar (Gen. 26.15-22). 3) The city's fortifications were sectioned near area B in order to better understand its construction. An MB earthen rampart was discovered, capped with a kurkar facing that was only partially preserved. A fosse (moat) was dug out at the base of the rampart, providing a formidable obstacle to those attempting to enter the city. 4) In area B, under the Philistine deposits, an MB burial was excavated. It contained the fragile remains of three infants lying next to each other and an adult, with only its legs preserved, opposite them. Offerings included two store jars, one two-handled deep bowl, and a juglet. Eilat. In the cemetery site already mentioned above, Avner reports that "a complete primary burial was found next to a wall-like structure, 5 m long. This burial is dated by pottery sherds to MB IIB. This is the first time that material dating to this period has been found south of Tel Masos and Tel Mallhata." See Tel Beit Shean below. LATE BRONZE AGE Tel Dan. The so-called "Mycenaean Tomb" (mid- 14th to beginning of 13th century), which contained, among other items, a beautiful charioteer crater, pro- vides a glimpse of the prosperity of the Late Bronze Age city, according to A. Biran. He reports that recent LB finds include "a well-laid 80 m2 stone floor, as well as a pottery figurine of a dancing man playing the lute, copper slag with a crucible and tuyere, and an oven." Tel Yin'am. Harold Liebowitz (University of Texas-Austin) reports that excavations in 1988-1989 exposed parts of three LB IIB period buildings (build- ings 5, 6, and 7). A rich ceramic assemblage and a large basalt vat were found on a massive flagstone floor in building 7. Tel Beit Shean. Amihai Mazar (HU) completed his second season of excavations on the tell of Beit Shean in 1990. He reports that his goals are "to study the sequence of second and late third millennium strata; to continue excavation of the sacred area, with an attempt to clarify whether the Iron I and LB II tem- ples continue an earlier tradition of sacredness in the same location; and to clean some of the previously excavated structures and to check the possibilities of reconstruction and preservation. Some of these goals were already achieved in the first two seasons. "The excavation of area R has revealed seven oc- cupation levels covering the period from EB III to LB IIA (Rowe's stratum IX). EB III (phase R7), with much Khirbet Kerak ware, was reached only in three small probes. An EB IV/MB I habitation phase (R6) is of a poor nature, of short duration, and perhaps seasonal. There is a gap between EB IV/MB I and the MB IIB/C periods. The MB deposit (R4-5) is thin and appears to represent a rather short span of time toward the end of the period. "Phase R3, the LB IA, revealed a building that appears to be a tripartite temple with porch, main hall, and holy-of-holies, but with an irregular plan and an indirect entrance. This temple demonstrates once again the validity of the principle of continuity in the location of cult places. Furthermore, it is now clear that the location of the sacred precinct preceded the establishment of the Egyptian stronghold at this town. The floors of the temple were found empty of finds except pottery sherds (including 'Chocolate-on- White'), two scarabs, and a fragment of a bronze statuette. Two special finds from phase R3 are a frag- ment of a bronze open vessel, probably a cauldron or laver, and a leg of a bronze figurine, most probably of the 'smiting god' type. "Phase R2 (LB IB=stratum IXB) represents the time when the temenos of stratum IX, as excavated by Rowe, was originally built. Its two building phases are denoted as R2 and R1 (LB IIA=stratum IXA). "Excavations were begun in 1990 on the uppermost part of the mound (area S). Just below the surface we uncovered a beaten earth floor covered with destruc- tion debris dating to the late 11th or early 10th cen- tury (=Megiddo VIA and Yoqne'am). It is possible that these destructions occurred during the conquest by David of the Canaanite cities in the plains ofJezreel and Beth Shean."

McGovern, The Late Bronze Egyptian Garrison at Beth Shan (Philadelphia). Tel Nami. M. Artzy reports that "during LB IIb, the peninsula was partially encircled by a rampart, on the summit of which a sanctuary was found. Among the many rich finds here are clear signs of local and foreign cult as well as a metal industry. Nami East served, at least during the end of the settlement, as a necropolis in which several types of graves were found. There are two complete collared-rim pithos burials, one of which contained a Mycenaean IIIB:2 stirrup jar (fig. 18). The finds include gold and silver jewelry, ivory pieces, numerous ceramics, and a large number of very well preserved bronze objects, several of clear cultic affiliation. These finds stem from var- ious Eastern Mediterranean provenances, all datable to the 13th century." Aphek. The results of the excavations of the 13th- century "Governor's Residency" (Palace VI) were re- cently displayed at the Israel Museum. The handsome catalogue describes the finds, which include rare cu- neiform inscriptions, an Egyptian faience ring and foundation deposit plaque, and a Hittite bulla. Tel Gezer. A problem-solving season was con- ducted by William G. Dever (University of Arizona) and Randall W. Younker (Andrews University) in 1990. Their goals were to clarify the construction techniques of the Solomonic Gate and adjoining "Pal- ace 10,000" and the date and nature of preceding strata, to reexcavate Macalister's "Canaanite Castle," and to locate additional dating evidence for the "Outer Wall." They report that the Solomonic gate and casemate wall date to the mid-10th century (red- slip pottery plentiful, red-burnish rare, wheel-burnish absent). "Palace 10,000" was secondary, dating to the mid- to late 10th century (red-slipped and red hand- burnished wares), exactly parallel to the outer two- entryway gatehouse excavated in 1984. Excavations in one of the casemates revealed two layers of thick destruction debris, the earliest attributed to Shishak, the latter to the Assyrian conquest. In field XI, the "Canaanite Castle" was determined to be post-MB IIC in date, supporting recent inter- pretations of the building as an LB II Egyptian-style residency. Directly north of the "Castle" and again some 30- 40 m to the east, several trenches were excavated against the inner and outer faces of the "Outer Wall." "In one cut along the outer face, under the two Iron Age phases and founded directly on bedrock stood a superbly constructed wall preserved ca. 3.75 m high. From the deeper fills, running down the lower face almost to bedrock and founding level, came 35 baskets of pottery with nearly pure LB II forms. We conclude that this lower face must have been built in LB II, then survived to form the foundation for the Iron Age wall." Dever and Younker have now shifted the burden of proof for the LB date of the "Outer Wall" to those who claim an Iron Age date (most recently I.

In Grid 38, located on the tell in the center of the site, where past seasons of excavation yielded stratified material from the Philistine occu- pation of the site (including Mycenaean IIIC:lb found in layers beneath classic Philistine painted pot- tery) and LB courtyard surfaces, a Late Bronze I (ca. 1500) mudbrick-lined vault was excavated. In the vault was buried an adolescent female in a flexed position. Grave goods included a Syrian bottle, two Base-Ring juglets, two bowls (one filled with food offerings-lamb and small bird bones), three scarabs, and two toggle pins. Tel Haror. Excavations in area L, located in the southeast corner of the site, yielded impressive archi- tectual remains from the Late Bronze Age. A large well-planned building from the latest phase (L-2: 14th century) contained a large quantity of Cypriot pottery and a bronze bowl with omphalos base. The impres- sive "buttressed building" of the earlier phase (L-3: 15th century) served as a public building or palace. Finds include a cylinder seal with geometric patterns and Cypriot WP6 pottery. Fragments of a massive building, whose size is indicative of a palace or upper class house, were found to the east of the "buttressed building." Stratigraphic data suggest that this building dates to the Middle Bronze Age. A wealthy collection of 13th-century pottery was found in the pit phase of area K. It included Egyptian- style cups and bowls, Cypriot WS3, BR2, and WSH, Mycenaean IIIB, and Levanto-Helladic wares. An os- tracon with hieratic script was found in one of the pits. The overall impression at Tel Haror (and elsewhere in Canaan) is one of a drastic reduction in the extent of the LB settlement as compared to the MB.

Several seasons of excavations re- vealed an Iron I central cultic high-place, probably related to the tradition of Mount Ebal described in Deut. 27.1-15 and Josh. 8.30-35, according to Adam Zertal (UH) (see BibArchRev 11 [1985] 26-43; TelAviv 13-14 [1986-1987] 105-65; for an alternative recon- struction, see A.

(Courtesy Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, Jerusalem) 42ff.). Work continued in the 1989-1990 seasons in the complex opposite the main complex (to the south- west). Two main features were revealed: a complex similar to a four-room house, dated to stratum II (ca. 1250-1200) and a storage area (opposite the ramp of the main complex) that was in use during strata II and I (until ca. 1130). Both features were supported by a retaining wall that consisted of large boulders. Eight collared-rim pithoi were found in the storage area, much like the situation at the cultic site of Shiloh. Tel Haror. Area B, situated on the western part of the lower site, at the foot of the acropolis, yielded a series of seven building phases extending from the Late Bronze Age to the end of the Iron I/beginning of the Iron II. Immediately below the modern surface were found stretches of a massive mudbrick wall (6.5 m wide) that belong to a substantial building, perhaps a fortress (phase B1, ca. 1000). Pits contemporary with this phase were excavated in areas K, L, and D. The ceramic assemblage includes Cypro-Phoenician pottery and blackjuglets. Decorated Philistine pottery, both monochrome and bichrome, were associated with floors and pits from phases B2-B4 (12th-1 th centuries), providing evidence for Philistine expan-</page><page sequence="23">1991] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ISRAEL 511 sion into the western Negev. Phases B5-B6, which date to the beginning of the 12th century, represent a pre-Philistine occupation that witnessed a fiery de- struction. A fragment of a 1 m-wide mudbrick wall provides a glimpse of the impressive architecture that will be reached in future seasons. See Tel Yarmut and Tell Ashkelon above. Iron Age I-II Tel Dan. A. Biran reports: "Four phases of the metal industry in the Iron Age were uncovered, the earliest dating to the beginning of the 12th century and the latest to the beginning of the 10th century. Circular stone installations, pots and hearths, stone vessels, crucibles, tuyeres, copper and bronze slag, bronze needles, two spear butts, and numerous pot- tery vessels, including a unique 'snake house,' were found.

A new excavation at Beth She- mesh was begun by Shlomo Bunimovitz, Zvi Leder- man, and R. Kletter (TAU) in 1990. Bunimovitz reports that "a long section through the northeastern corner of the site, the only area not disturbed by the earlier excavations, was opened. The first stratum encountered was an eighth-century 'residential quar- ter.' The presence of heavy stone basins, an olive-oil press weight, paved platforms, olive pits, and much broken pottery may rather suggest an industrial quar- ter (fig. 20). This stratum was destroyed, probably by Sennacherib in 701. The stratum found below this one consisted of spacious buildings dating to the 11th century. Below this, a burnt 12th-century monumen- tal building was exposed (fig. 21). It was completely covered by fallen bricks and ashes, among which a golden earring and other pieces of gold jewelry were found, as well as sherds of the beautifully painted Philistine tradition. This heavy destruction seems to be identical with Mackenzie's 'Red Burnt Stratum' of the early Iron Age. Future excavations will take place in the main section; in new areas in order to expose more of the eighth-century city; and at the northern slope of the site, adjacent to the Bronze Age cyclopean wall and at the lower terrace of the tell." Tel Miqne. Of the four main chapters in the history of Tel Miqne, identified with biblical Ekron, that ex- cavations have brought to light, two have been espe- cially illuminating. The first is the large fortified city founded by the Sea Peoples/Philistines in the 12th and 11th centuries whose architectural and ceramic finds demonstrate clear affinities with the Aegean world (fig. 22). The second main episode took place in the seventh century when the city expanded and became one of the most important olive oil production centers in the ancient Near East. The eighth season of excavations at Tel Miqne- Ekron, under the direction of Trude Dothan (HU) and Seymour Gitin (Albright Institute), was con- cluded in 1990. In field IV, located in the center of the mound in what the excavators term "the elite zone," an 11th-century palace or residence with cultic functions was excavated in prior seasons (fig. 23). In the 1990 season a 12th-century building was exca- vated (fig. 24). This building's most prominent feature</page><page sequence="26">514 SAMUEL R. WOLFF [AJA 95 is a hearth whose diameter is 2.6 m. Such "hearth sanctuaries" are known from the Aegean world and were transplanted to Miqne by its Philistine inhabit- ants. A handsome carved ivory lid depicting animals in combat was found in this field. A seventh-century monumental building discov- ered in this area yielded 15 inscriptions, some depict- ing entire words, others only one letter. Among them were six dedicatory jar inscriptions. One reads qds- l'frt ("sanctified to Asherah"). Another is "to Asherah" (l'?rt) (fig. 25). Three others read qds ("holy"). Other inscriptions apparently indicate the jar's volume or contents. These inscriptions were found in a building that also revealed horned altars and petaled chalices, which together attest to the cultic nature of the build- ing. No LB remains were found in this area, as op- posed to field I, where strata IX (15th-14th centuries) and VIII (14th-13th centuries) lie beneath the Phil- istine remains. In field III, excavations continued in the area of the gateway and the adjacent industrial zone (figs. 26- 27). The goal of the 1990 season was to section the seventh-century stratum in order to investigate the Iron I strata that lie below. The excavators were sur- prised to find an earlier Iron II phase, dating to the end of the eighth century, below the seventh-century stratum. A new field was opened on the Northeast Acropolis, called field INW. It was hoped that undisturbed stra- tigraphy would yield occupation bridging the gap from the 11 th to the seventh century, and indeed this was what was encountered. Seven Iron II occupa- tional phases now provide continuous occupation in this area from the 11 th/10th centuries to the seventh century. This evidence is critical for the identification of the site as Ekron, for only now can significant architectural phases be assigned to those periods (ninth-eighth centuries) that are known to have ex- isted at Ekron from the Old Testament and Neo- Assyrian inscriptions. Iron I: AASOR 49 (1989) 1-22; BibArchRev 16.1 (1990) 26-36 (T. Dothan); Iron II: AASOR 49 (1989) 23-58; BibArchRev 16.2 (1990) 32-42, 59 (S. Gitin). Tel Batash. George Kelm (Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary), expedition director, and Ami- hai Mazar (HU), field director, concluded the field- work phase of the Tel Batash archaeological project in 1989 after 13 seasons. Batash is identified with biblical Timnah, a Philistine site that figures so prom- inently in the Samson cycle as the home of his first wife (Judg. 14). This rich site yielded stratigraphic sequences ranging from the Middle Bronze Age to the end of the seventh century. The architectural finds ..

The carefully excavated stratigraphic se- quence of strata VI-X (LBA), which includes four destruction layers, and of strata III-II (eighth-sev- enth centuries), which are closely paralleled by the discoveries at nearby Tel Miqne, will contribute greatly to the refinement of the typological develop- ment of the region's pottery. See IEJ 39 (1989)108- 10 and BibArchRev 15 (1989) 36-49. See Tel Beit Shean above, Tel Dor below. Iron Age II Hazor. Excavations under the direction of Yigael Yadin in the 1950s and 1960s on the acropolis brought to light 21 strata spanning some 2500 years (EB II- Hellenistic). This included 10 strata from the Iron Age, providing evidence for the destruction of the city as a result of the Israelite conquest as related in the biblical narratives; a six-chambered gate and case- mate wall from the Solomonic era; pillared store- rooms/stables and water tunnel system, a citadel, offset-inset fortification walls of the ninth and eighth centuries; and a destruction layer attributed to Tig- lath Pileser III (732 B.C.E.) whose ceramic assemblage defines the second half of the eighth-century horizon in the north. Excavations under the direction of Amnon Ben- Tor (HU) were renewed in 1990 on the acropolis (fig. 28). Excavations were conducted in area A, at- tempting to clear up the stratigraphy in that area as it relates to Yadin's "pillared house" of stratum VIII (ninth century) and the "four-room house" of strata VI-V (eighth century).

At least three phases were discerned, one of which ended in a devastating conflagration. A large amount of pottery was found in all buildings (fig. 29). A glass bottle (Assyrian?) is also noteworthy. Excavations in area M, on the north side of the tell, north of the Solomonic gate, revealed the continuation of the solid fortification wall of the ninth century (stratum VIII). Several structures, partially built of ashlar blocks, are lined along a paved street that separates them from the city wall." Excavations will continue in both areas in the next campaign. The long-awaited text of Y. Yadin et al., Hazor III- IV, edited by A. Ben-Tor, was published in 1989. Tel Kinneret. The final report of the excavations, whose last season of fieldwork took place in 1985, was recently published by Volkmar Fritz (Kinneret. Ergeb- nisse der Ausgrabungen auf dem Tell el-'Oreme am See Gennesaret 1982-1985, Wiesbaden 1990). The Iron Age remains are the most impressive ones, including a rich destruction layer attributed to Tiglath Pileser III. Akhziv. Phoenician Iron Age cemeteries, which have been partially excavated in the past but for the most part remain unpublished, surround Tel Akhziv. Eilat Mazar (HU), with the participation of Patricia Smith (Hadassah Hospital-Ein Karim, Jerusalem), initiated a new investigation of the southern cemetery. Mazar reports that mapping and excavation of one built tomb was undertaken in the 1988 season. The tomb (figs. 30-31) contained material from the 10th through the seventh century, including the remains of some 40 men, women, and children. Three rock- cut shaft tombs were excavated during the 1989 sea- son, the most spectacular being "the Tomb of the Horsemen," which, despite having been robbed, con- tained four ceramic figurines, three depicting caval- rymen mounted on horses and one a drummer-lady, several ceramic vessels belonging to the Phoenician tradition of the eighth-seventh centuries, 11 arrow- heads, one electrum and 16 bronze earrings, and eight scarabs. This was a family tomb containing at least 13 individuals that was used for several generations, ac- cording to Mazar. Two seasons of excavation in 1990 yielded a built tomb containing 10th-century Phoen- ician pottery and an additional 10 shaft tombs that were largely robbed except for one seventh-century tomb preserving the remains of an elderly lady. Ex- cavations have been suspended pending final publi- cation of the material from the first three seasons.

Kempinski and Niemeier report that parts of the Phoenician city were uncovered in area E. "What was thought to have been a tower in 1989 can now be identified as part of the closing wall that continues all along the northern side of the site. A Phoenician decanter from the end of the eighth or beginning of the seventh century and a quantity of weights were found on the floor associated with this wall. After the destruction of the Phoenician city, the wall was rebuilt in the seventh century, but not along the fortification line uncovered at present." .Horvat Rosh Zayit. The fifth season of excavations at this site, identified with biblical Cabul, was con- ducted in 1990 by Zvi Gal (UH). Excavations contin- ued in the Phoenician fortress, where the western wall of the fortifications from stratum 2 (second half of the 10th-third quarter of the ninth century) was traced for 15 m. Vestiges of domestic buildings dating to the first half of the 10th century were found under the fortress. Three outlying areas were also excavated in 1990, yielding various constructions, including an olive press, dated to the eighth century. See most recently BiblArch 53 (1990) 88-97. Tel Jezreel. Recent construction activity at the foot of this large tell revealed a formidable ashlar-masonry wall. Since this site was the secondary capital of the Omride Dynasty (ninth century), one might expect that this wall was part of a royal architectural complex. In order to investigate this possibility, excavations were begun in 1990 under the direction of David Ussishkin (TAU) and John Woodhead (British School of Archaeology, Jerusalem), assisted by Gabriel Bar- kay (TAU). They report that the large wall was a retaining wall for a chocolate-brown fill that most riij-XI---ii:B -:i- :-?ii"'iii' 'itilp-i? '-"": -ii'-' ' i4'-_-:::i::iiiiii iii.ii--ii-ii.ri iiii:_ ; :: : iiii ii i iiii _ l i i ................. -:-::-:--:i--:::?:-::!! ;-a ._i.:" ''--- :iiiiiii -:iiiiii:-i---iiiii?i?- ? -iiiiiliii---.---i;_i::_ -?_,iiiiiiiiiii!ii::!ii_- ??;iiiii_!;?;: ?! i-iii:i-ii----iii~iii i L:... -i~iiiii~~iiiii -ii --iiiiii:ii?i.:?-: ?

WOLFF [AJA 95 likely supported a royal Iron Age enclosure. It was also determined that the entire site was surrounded by a rock-hewn dry moat, a unique feature for the Iron Age. A glacis-like structure consisting of gravel and chocolate-brown soil led down to the moat. Fu- ture excavations may reveal additional information concerning this complex. In addition, a Crusader church was cleared. Plans for future seasons are to finish excavating the church, to excavate the nearby main manor house (presently visible in the foundations of a 1948 village building), and to link the two structures in order to reconstruct village life in the Crusader period. A third site from the Chalcolithic period, located near the spring, will also be investigated in future seasons. Jerusalem Mamilla Street, area opposite the Jaffa Gate. As part of a massive redevelopment plan, the entire Mamilla neighborhood was leveled, providing an op- portunity to conduct salvage excavations. Within this framework, a team led by Ronni Reich (IAA) discov- ered two late Iron Age rock-cut tombs, three Hellen- istic inhumation tombs, a Byzantine chapel with crypt (see Byzantine section below), and a stretch of an Ottoman-period aqueduct that led to the Jaffa Gate. The Iron Age tombs were similar in plan to those found at nearby Ketef Hinnom (see below)-a rectan- gular burial chamber with rock-cut shelves along two or three sides of the central rectangular pit. Several steps lead down from the entrance into the pit. In both tombs, a rock-cut repository is located in the northeast corner. The tombs were full of debris, bones, and an abundance of artifacts. While both tombs contained a uniform repertoire of pottery dat- ing to the late Iron Age (eighth century, slightly earlier than those from Ketef Hinnom), tomb 5 continued to be used in the Babylonian-early Persian period (sixth- fifth centuries) and also in the Hasmonean period. A small tunnel was cut from the central pit to the re- pository in tomb 5. In it was found a terracotta figu- rine of a mounted horseman from the Iron Age. Two deep crevices in the same tomb yielded a ceramic bottle and a unique bronze carrot-shaped bottle from the Babylonian-early Persian period. Ketef Hinnom, opposite Mount Zion. Excavations directed by Gabriel Barkay (TAU) and sponsored by Bnai Brith were conducted in 1988 and 1989. Previ- ous excavations revealed, among other finds, an Early Christian church and an Iron Age rock-cut cemetery that continued in use after the destruction of the city in 586. The most outstanding finds were two silver plaques engraved with the Priestly Benediction (Num. 6.24-26). These plaques preserve the earliest known fragments of the biblical text (late seventh-early sixth centuries). Barkay reports that the recent excavations concen- trated on the area of the church, auxiliary service structures of the church located to the east, and Iron Age tombs and quarries to the southeast. Soundings beneath the Byzantine structures revealed earlier Roman/Hellenistic burials and quarrying activities, mostly dating to the Second Temple period and per- haps supplying stone to Herod's palace located across the valley. Under the church, the burials were dug into Iron Age and Persian-period fills. A coin of the Yehud type was found here, the first of its kind to have been discovered in a controlled excavation. In the southeast sector, under the Turkish-Ottoman ag- ricultural terraces and road, quarries were found to the east and an Iron Age multi-chambered burial cave, with its opening to the north, to the west. The eastern part of the tomb was damaged but the rem- nants of a repository were found containing intact pottery and jewelry. Periods of occupation at this site parallel those found nearby at Mamilla Street (see above). Tel Lachish. The siege of the Judean stronghold of Lachish by Sennacherib in 701 provides a vivid example of archaeological, biblical, and extrabiblical sources (Assyrian annals and reliefs) combining to illuminate one event in history. The destructions of stratum III by Sennacherib in 701 and stratum II by Nebuchadnezzar in 587-586 provide the archaeolo- gist with secure dates. As a result, the pottery assem- blages from these strata define the ceramic horizon of Judah for the eighth and seventh-early sixth cen- turies. Fieldwork has been concluded for the time being, pending the completion of outstanding publications, except for that accompanying the restoration work being carried out under the direction of David Us- sishkin (TAU) on the inner gateway, the outer gateway (the Bastion), the approach road leading up to the gate, and a stretch of the Iron Age city wall (fig. 32). Plans call for the construction of a visitors center that will house casts of the reliefs of the siege of Lachish from Sennacherib's palace in Nineveh. (The originals are displayed in the British Museum.) From the visi- tors center one will be able to see Sennacherib's siege ramp and enter the city along the restored approach road and gateways. Tell I;Ialif (Lahav). A limited excavation in field IV, directed byJoe D. Seger, was carried out in 1989. It yielded a cistern whose initial construction was dated to the Iron II. It consisted of a roughly rectan- gular chamber measuring 5 x 10 x ca. 4 m. It was subsequently reused in the Hellenistic, Roman, and</page><page sequence="31">1991] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ISRAEL 519 .......

"It is hoped that further investiga- tions will yield substantial information regarding the eighth-century Iron II city plan around the southwest side of the tell." See Tel Gezer above, and et-Tell below. PERSIAN PERIOD Har Mispe Yamim. Surveys and excavations at this mountaintop ridge site by Rafael Frankel (IAA) have revealed a small site enclosed by a modest perimeter wall. Bounded by this wall on the south was a broad- room temple; and on the west, a building complex where the entrance to the site may have been. Two altars were found in the temple. In the vicinity of the altar found in the northwest corner of the building, sheep/goat skulls and other bones were discovered. Two phases of use were distinguished. The first phase is dated to the Persian period, the second to the Hellenistic. The most spectacular finds were made before the excavations during a survey of the site. They include four bronzes: an Apis-bull, a leaping lioness, a ram couchant, and an Egyptian situla with a Phoenician inscription mentioning Ashtoret. They were apparently found on bedrock near the altar in the northwest corner of the building. Excavations revealed a lovely slate figurine depicting the Egyptian triad of Osiris, Horus, and Isis. These objects belong to the second, or Hellenistic, phase (photographs in HIadashot Arkheologiyot 95 [1990] 13-15). Tel Yin'am. H. Liebowitz reported "while the Per- sian-period strata excavated in 1988 and 1989 added little to our knowledge of Persian-period architecture, their excavation enriched our repertoire of Persian- period local, Attic, and East Greek pottery, thereby establishing Tel Yin'am as a site with an important Persian-period occupation." Tel Dor. Large-scale excavations continue at this important coastal Phoenician site. Under the direction of Ephraim Stern (HU), excavations have revealed evidence for a town of the Sea Peoples (Tjeker) that was perhaps destroyed by a Phoenician contingent in ca. 1050, as well as subsequent Iron Age, Persian, Hellenistic, and Roman occupations, including se- quences of gateways and fortification walls. The ar- chitectural and material remains from the Persian period are particularly impressive. For the latest re- ports in English, see ESI 7-8 (1988-1989) 43-49; IEJ 39 (1989) 32-42; IEJ 40 (1990) 12-30; and BASOR 279 (1990) 27-34. Tel Michal. The final report of this small but im- portant Persian-period site has appeared recently (Z. Herzog, G. Rapp, Jr., and 0. Negbi eds., Excavations at Tel Michal, Israel, Minneapolis 1989). Tell Ashkelon. Excavations of Persian levels con- tinued in three areas. In grid 38, an earlier phase of the previously excavated villa was uncovered. One</page><page sequence="32">520 SAMUEL R.

In grid 50, a fifth-century warehouse whose rooms contained smashed Persian store jars was excavated. Two "signs of Tanit" were found in this warehouse, one of bronze, the other bone. These should be added to the one bronze example found in 1989 in the same field and another found in 1990 in grid 38. These finds, along with Phoenician inscriptions, pottery, and architectural styles, testify to the Phoenician presence in the city, supporting the statement by Pseudo-Skylax that Ashkelon was a Tyrian city at that time. Addi- tional burials from the dog cemetery were excavated in 1990 (fig. 33). The tally at present stands at over 700 dogs, making it the largest dog cemetery ever found in the ancient world (see L.E. Stager, "Why Were Hundreds of Dogs Buried at Ashkelon?" BibArchRev 17.3 [1991] 27-42). Excavations in grid 57 continued to expose the lower Persian strata, re- vealing a substantial building and a street. A hoard from a late fourth century context yielded 18 Alex- andrian silver coins and one heavy silver bracelet. When the Persian strata at Ashkelon will be com- pletely excavated in coming seasons, they will yield one of the richest collections ever to have been exca- vated in Israel. Tell el-Hesi.

HELLENISTIC PERIOD et-Tell. This site, located 2.5 km north of the Sea of Galilee, has been identified by its excavator, Rami Arav (UH), as New Testament Bethsaida, a village elevated to a polis by Herod Philip (30 C.E.) and renamed Julias in honor ofJulia Augustus's daughter. A third season of excavations was carried out in 1990 in two previously opened fields. Area A, on the summit of the mound, yielded a massive stone build- ing measuring 20 x 13 m. Near its northeastern corner an impressive gate was discovered. In front of the gate was an Iron Age II floor that extended up to the stone building, indicating that the building dates at least from this period. A Hellenistic phase was also detected in which the function of the building may have changed. Note that the dates presented here differ from those published earlier (IEJ 39 [1989] 99- 100). Area B, 50 m north of area A, contained a spacious private house with central courtyard spread over 430 m2. This building also is dated to the Hellenistic pe- riod. To the south of the house a rectangular room was excavated that contained several intact vessels of the Iron Age II period. A special find was a terracotta figurine whose head is that of a god or king wearing an "Osiris" crown. Since et-Tell was part of the Land of Geshur during the Iron Age, it may be that this figurine represents a Geshurite king or god. Hellenistic pottery included a significant amount of Eastern Sigillata A. Coins recovered include a Tyrian silver stater from the mid-</page><page sequence="33">1991] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ISRAEL 521 4, . ...... .. Jo- Fig. 34. Mount Hermon.

Of interest are two coins attributed to Herod Philip (30 C.E.), son of Herod the Great and ruler of the Golan. Mount Gerizim. Mount Gerizim, the temple-city of the Samaritan sect, is perched on a mountaintop some 500 m above biblical Shechem/Classical Nea- polis/modern Nablus. The sequence of occupation revealed by Yitzhak Magen (IAA) and previous ex- cavators consisted of Samaritan remains from the Hellenistic period extending over more than 400 du- nams (100 acres); a citywide destruction level (except for area K, which was situated outside the city wall) attributed to John Hyrcanus (113-111 B.C.E.); a Ro- man temple to Zeus from the second century C.E.; a fourth-century Samaritan rebuilding of the sanctuary area; and a Byzantine church erected by Zeno in 484. Magen's excavations concentrated on the large Hel- lenistic settlement. The temenos wall was cleared a length of 130 m, along with two gates and a monu- mental staircase. The temple itself presumably lies under the Byzantine church. Approximately 60 in- scriptions in ancient Hebrew, Aramaic, Samaritan, and Greek script were found in secondary contexts in and around the Hellenistic enclosure and Byzantine church. Several well-constructed two-story private houses were also cleared (areas T, K, and A). Olive oil factories (crushing and pressing installations) were found in the latest phases in two of them (areas T and K). See Qadmoniot 91-92 (1990) 70-96 (Hebrew). Jerusalem. One Late Hellenistic tomb (not later than the second century) was excavated at the Ma- milla Street site by Ronni Reich. Reich describes this tomb as "a rectangular rock-cut trough, measuring 1.05 x 2.35 m, and 1.0 m deep. An elongated and narrow niche was blocked by ashlar masonry in a second stage of use. In the niche an intact spindle- shaped unguentarium, several sherds, and bone splin- i*llili vo w AO.A Fig. 35. Mount Hermon.

The trough contained a number of elongated bones found in situ, as well as a flask." Maresha. Excavations were conducted by Amos Kloner (IAA) on both the high mound and the lower city at Maresha. "Houses uncovered in the lower city, with stairs leading to a second story and passages leading to rock-cut water reservoirs, were built ca. 300 and remained in use until the end of the second century. On the high mound a tower whose walls were up to 3.5 m thick and 12 m high was excavated. It was built in the fourth century and was repaired several times, the last repair dating to the second century. West of the high mound, a complex of houses and rock-cut cisterns was excavated. Also excavated and cleaned was a spacious rock-cut columbarium, with about 2000 small niches hewn into its walls. About 40 columbaria existed in the city, dating from the third century. "A burial cave of the Hellenistic period (area 500)- attributable to Edomite-Phoenician inhabitants-was in use in the third century. Toward the end of this period, the Edomite population was converted to Ju- daism by John Hyrcanus I. "Eighteen oil presses have been recorded in rock- cut caves in the lower city of Maresha. An oil press containing three pressing installations operated by weights and one crushing installation was cleared in area 44. Maresha is known to have exported oil to Egypt and the coastal settlements in the Hellenistic period. "A subterranean complex (area 75), which included a spacious hall, was recorded (Hadashot Arkheologiyot 95 [1990] 68 [Hebrew]). Rock-cut installations and hearths were uncovered in the hall, which persisted in use from the eighth to the second centuries." ROMAN PERIOD Mount Hermon. Two Roman temple sites were excavated in 1990 by Shimon Dar (Bar-Ilan Univer- sity) in the framework of a regional study of the Mount Hermon region. The sites are named Har Sena'im and Qal'at Bustra. Previous seasons at Har Sena'im revealed an asymmetrical temple, whose in- terior measurements are 7.3 x 7.0 m, surrounded by a peribolos measuring ca. 40 x 30 m. The temple displays "Classical features" (pediment, column bases, pilaster, etc.) "in a pronouncedly local style." Several Greek inscriptions were discovered, including one on the base of a limestone statue "representing an eagle holding a snake (?) in its claws (fig. 34)." What sepa- rates this temple from others already known in the region is the method of adapting the periphery wall</page><page sequence="35">1991] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ISRAEL 523 :::-:1::::-:i:i::: :::: : : :: : :. ii--i:i?:-iii;:-?-_-:i~i-i~iil-~ii- i:,j - :- ii i : i:::::;::i:;:I:::: .:: ?_: ::: : : :: : ::::? : :"- -ii:i-i-i :------:-:_- ::: ::::: - - -::: : :: :;---::i~----?-??????sl~sl~s~??????? :B ??B&amp;*i~aar~oaaaa~i61rr~(~~:isi??P~~i-~~: ::-:::-::- i - . .. - : -i:ii . : ::: ?:::::: - :-- s ii-i i -i:i: -- :--:ilr;~:~:~4~d~.i~g~p~:lii-';,~'9~::-' ? :-::::-:---:I-:- ;:-__--::_-:-:--__:_:r i-i-:::::-$:?ali8;j~.-~'. ....:c Fig. 37.

Occasional finds from the Hellenistic and Early Roman periods suggest an occupation, perhaps already cultic in nature, at the site, but the temple and enclosure date to the second-fourth centuries, perhaps extending into the fifth century. At Qal'at Bustra, a well-preserved trapezoidal- shaped temple (ca. 8.8/9.0 x 11.6/11.9 m) was en- closed by a temenos wall measuring ca. 58 x 48 m (fig. 35). The foundations of a gate were found in the north wall of the temenos. Northwest of this complex a farm was investigated whose extent measured some 8-10 dunams. In future seasons the excavators will search for evidence for the presumed link between the temple and temenos and the farm. Its dates of occupation parallel those at Har Sena'im. Dar points out the striking similarity in architectural features and numismatic finds between the two sites. Kefar Hananya. A third season of excavation un- der the direction of David Adan-Bayewitz (Bar-Ilan University) was concluded in 1989. He reports that "a pottery kiln from the Late Roman period was ex- posed. It is a common Roman type with circular plan and round central pillar (fig. 36). Wasters found within and around the kiln consisted of cooking bowls and cooking pots (Kefar Hananya forms 1E and 4C). In the Early Byzantine period the area served as a dump for wasters from another unidentified kiln. It is estimated that this dump contained between 9,500 and 13,000 vessels, ca. 98% of which were Kefar Hananya forms 1E and 4C. Two plaster-lined basins that may have served as clay soaking pools were found ca. 10.5 m from the kiln. "In order to determine the extent of the settlement in each period, about 70 probes of 2 x 2 m were excavated to a depth of 20 cm. Preliminary study of the recovered pottery and coins showed that remains dating to the Roman period are found in a larger area than those of any other period." Gamla. Gamla is often referred to as "the Masada of the North" because Josephus Flavius describes a similar situation at both hilltop sites during the First Jewish Revolt-Jewish defenders committing suicide rather than falling into the hands of the invading Roman army. D. Goren reports that excavations in 1987-1988, directed by S. Gutman, yielded a large rectangular room (in area H), a plastered stone chan- nel, and the basement of a room with a corbeled roof from the Early Roman (Herodian) period. In addi- tion, a small hoard of 27 silver coins (fig. 37) was found in the street next to the olive press (known from previous seasons). "Among the coins were 18 Phoenician tetradrachms from the years 17-52 and nine silver provincial tetradrachms of Nero minted in Antioch in the years 61, 63, and 64. These coins were dropped on the street during the last hours before the city's demise in 67 at the hands of the Romans." Horvat Sumaq (Khirbet Summaqa). Shimon Dar (Bar-Ilan University) heads the excavation of a 20- dunam (five-acre) settlement at Horvat Sumaq on Mount Carmel. He reports that three building phases were discerned in the main area of excavation. The earliest was the synagogue, typical in plan and style of Late Roman synagogues in the Galilee-a monu- mental facade (facing east, toward the general direc-</page><page sequence="36">524 SAMUEL R.

Ceramic and numismatic evidence dates it to the third century. In the second phase, dated to the fifth-seventh cen- turies, the size of the building was reduced. It is uncertain whether the building continued to function as a synagogue. The final phase was a partial occu- pation in the Middle Ages (1 lth-15th centuries). An enclosure measuring 17-19 x 38-42 m was discovered opposite the eastern facade of the syn- agogue. Its periods of occupation parallel the first and third phases in the synagogue area. Additional exca- vations were conducted elsewhere on the rocky spur, including several storerooms containing many smashed storage jars in the well-preserved insulae of the residential area (southwest sector), a well with arch, an underground rock-cut cellar with two rooms, and two large wine presses. Sepphoris (Sippori). This city served as the capital of the Galilee in the first century B.C.E. It was home to Roman administrators, Jews, and Christians, and it was there that the Mishnah, the earliest codification of Jewish oral law, was published ca. 200. Two field expeditions are currently working at the site; one, the Joint Sepphoris Project (JSP), directed by Eric and Carol Meyers (Duke University) and Ehud Netzer (HU), the other by James Strange (University of South Florida) and Thomas Longstaff (Colby College). The prize find of the JSP was a Dionysiac mosaic of excep- tional quality that graced the floor of the triclinium of a Roman mansion (see ESI 6 [1987-1988] 95-97; 7-8 [1988-1989] 169-73). The mosaic was lifted and restored and is currently on display at the Israel Mu- seum. The University of South Florida Expedition excavated a private house (called a basilica by a pre- vious excavator), the stage of the Roman theater, and 25 underground chambers (cisterns and ritual baths); see ESI 6 (1987-1988) 97-98.

Architectural highlights include a Roman theater, a magnificent Byzantine bathhouse, colonnaded street, Roman tem- ple and nymphaeum (identified as such by an inscrip- tion carved on the architrave) (figs. 40-42), a central monument, of which only the platform was preserved in situ, municipal basilica, Roman portico, and Byzan- tine street with shops. Byzantine structures continued to be occupied after the Arab conquest in 634, when the population and the general condition of the city declined. The earthquake of 747 resulted in the town's destruction, and only minor rebuilding pro- grams were undertaken in subsequent periods. The most recent addition to the corpus of Roman statuary is a marble statue of Dionysus (fig. 43). Preliminary results through the 1988 season were published in ESI 6 (1987-1988) 7-45 and ESI 7-8 (1988-1989) 15-32; a popular article appeared in BibArchRev 16 (1990) 16-31. Caesarea Maritima.

They report that the most fruitful underwater sounding was in area K/2, "a huge mass of tumbled blocks at the northernmost tip of the main (western) Herodian breakwater. This season it was discovered that this tumbled mass was founded on a platform of hydraulic cement mixed with rubble laid in wooden formwork. The platform was formed within a wooden caisson that survived to a height of over 2 m (fig. 45)." Of the soundings on land, the most productive was in area TP, the Temple Platform, "the eminence within the Crusader city . .. upon which Herod the Great had constructed his monumental temple to Roma and Augustus." While only a fill layer up to 1 m thick was found from the Herodian period, the Byzantine phase was represented by a monumental structure with inner and outer octagonal foundations (fig. 46). The excavators identify this building as the Early Christian martyrium. "The martyrium did not continue into Caesarea's main Islamic phase (10th- 11th centuries) or into the Crusader phase (12th- 13th centuries), but was replaced by domestic and commercial or industrial occupation." A phase of Mamluk (14th-15th centuries) occupation was found in only one square (TP/4). Jerusalem. A salvage excavation of the IAA (Vas- silios Tzaferis, Nurit Feig, and Alexander Onn) was conducted near the American Consulate in East Je- rusalem. Previous excavators surmised that this was the site of the presumed Third Wall of Jerusalem as described by Josephus. Newly discovered well-built walls and foundations, including one large stone with marginal drafting that is typical of Herodian masonry, support this identification. G'vaot Reved. Excavations in 1989 at this small site in the Makhtesh Ramon were undertaken by Ste- ven Rosen (BGU) as part of a general research pro- gram on the archaeology of pastoralists in the Negev, initiated with the excavations at the early Arabic sites of Nalhal 'Oded and Har 'Oded (IEJ 39 [1989] 117- 20). He interprets the finds as "the remains of a number of nomadic tent encampments, dated by the associated pottery to the Roman period, possibly somewhat earlier. The site probably represents a win- ter aggregation encampment of pastoral nomads." That so many tent encampments are now being iden- tified and dated throughout the Negev makes it dif- ficult to defend the "no remains= nomadization" approach of Finkelstein and Perevolotsky (BASOR 279, 1990). See Cities of the Desert, Capernaum, and Ship- wrecks below. BYZANTINE PERIOD Qasrin. Excavations conducted by Ann Killebrew (HU) have yielded impressive remains of a village dating from the mid-fourth-mid-eighth century (strata V-IV) (fig. 47). The excavations have yielded a small public square adjacent to the synagogue, parts of three domestic buildings, the village water source, and four alleys. The domestic buildings consisted of a large multipurpose room, or triclinium (fig. 48), a storage room separated from the triclinium by a "win- dow wall," an upper story, and an outdoor courtyard. Six coin hoards were found in the stratum V houses. The largest consisted of some 9,000 bronze coins, dating to the mid-fourth century, including nuinerous coins ofJulian the Apostate (361-363) (fig. 49).</page><page sequence="40">528 SAMUEL R.

Caesarea. Site plan. Jerusalem. Rescue excavations under the supervi- sion of Aren Meir (HU) and Ronni Reich (IAA) were conducted outside the Jaffa Gate in anticipation of a new roadway. Two main periods of occupation were discerned: an extramural neighborhood from the Byzantine period, including a large structure that may be identified with St. George's Church, and a 13th- century Mamluk stratum above it. In addition, part of the moat of "David's Citadel" was reexposed, after having been buried in 1898 as part of the Jaffa Gate renovations carried out in preparation for Kaiser Wil- helm's triumphant entrance into the city. Plans are being drawn to allow access to the ruins that will lie under the new roadway. At nearby Mamilla Street, R. Reich reports that a small Byzantine chapel was unearthed at the foot of a rock scarp. The chapel had benches on each side and was paved with a mosaic floor featuring three crosses and an inscription that, when restored, reads: "Salvation for those whose name only Lord knows." Traces of fresco depicting an angel were found in the chapel's apse. While sectioning one of the benches, a deposit of 30 intact Byzantine oil lamps was revealed. A huge crypt, filled with human skeletal remains, was found cut into the rock scarp that formed one wall of the chapel. The crypt remained unexcavated. Reich tentatively associates the human remains in the crypt with the Persian massacre of 614. The excavation at the site of the Third Wall (see above) exposed the remains of a large Byzantine mon- astery (fifth-sixth centuries). It contained chapels, patterned mosaic floors, and a rock-cut crypt. "A small</page><page sequence="41">1991] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ISRAEL 529 Wol ?. iiR? ....... ...... Fig. 45. Caesarea.

Gibson and colleagues report that "the changes within the landscape, instigated during the Early Roman period, were followed through during the Byzantine period with the organization of the water system of 'Ein Sataf. Substantial terracing activ- ities belong to this period. Water collection pools were built within the network of irrigation terraces; these were used for the redistribution of irrigation water and imply a certain amount of land-use intensifica- tion." Horvat Karkur 'Illit. Pau Figueras (BGU) is at present excavating the church of a Byzantine village site near Beersheva. He reports that "the floor of the church was paved with limestone slabs, but two ad- joining rooms, including the baptistry, were paved with a mosaic floor with geometric designs. Under the church floor were found several tombs. They con- tained 11 skeletons: 9 adults, one juvenile, and one young child. The presence of so many tombs in a relatively small space is an unusual feature in a Byz- antine church in Israel, although it became more and more frequent in the West. So far there is no clear explanation for their presence, but it could represent a special veneration on that church of a famous relic. One side-room, probably one of the sacristies or pas- tophoria, contained a large quantity of crushed am- phoras and glass vessels. We assume that this room was inhabited after the church had ceased to function as such. An inscription found by the survey at the site mentions a certain '(Sala)manos, Presbyter of Mal(a)tha'; Malatha may be the ancient name of the site." See Horvat Sumaq, Beit Shean, and Caesarea above, Cities of the Desert and Capernaum below. CITIES OF THE NEGEV In order to control the trade route from Arabia to the Mediterranean Sea, the Nabateans established a series of towns in the Negev desert. These towns</page><page sequence="43">1991] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ISRAEL 531 ................ N i ii. ..... .. . .... ..?....... . .... . . . . . . ... . . .. .o : :i ...... Fig. 48. Qasrin. Interior view of the triclinium in restored Talmudic house B. thrived and expanded, especially in the Byzantine period. According to one study, the area of these cities ranged from 10 acres (Mampsis) to almost 100 acres (Halusa). Four of the six "cities of the Negev" were excavated in 1989-1990. Rehovot-in-the-Negev (Khirbet Ruh.eibeh). A new phase of excavations was begun in 1986 under the codirection of Yoram Tsafrir (HU) and Kenneth Holum (University of Maryland), see IEJ 38 (1988) 117-27; ESI 6 (1987-1988) 89-91. Excavations were conducted in area B, the southern part of the town, where Byzantine-period residential buildings were found; in area C, where stables dating to the second- third centuries, similar to those found at Shivta and Mamshit, were discovered; in area D, the central church, which may date as early as the second half of the fourth century; and area E, the atrium of the north church. In area T, the Byzantine cemetery, 34 burials were excavated under the supervision of Israel Hershkovitz. Unfortunately, the excavations had to be interrupted for security reasons. Tsafrir and Holum report that a small team was permitted to excavate for two weeks in the fall of 1990. "The objective was to excavate additional burials in area T, the Byzantine cemetery, to increase the total number of human skeletons recovered to a statistically signif- icant sample, and thus to permit publication of a full- length report on the cemetery, mortuary practices, and the physical anthropology of Rel.ovot's Byzantine population. The team recovered and stabilized in the field more than 30 burials, bringing the total sample to above 80. As in previous seasons, burial customs and the distribution of graves within the cemetery were also examined. The team identified but could not excavate a rectangular, highly decorated mauso- leum about 3-4 m in size."

The orthogonal building is most likely part of a monastic complex. Well-built terraced buildings characterize the remains of the residential quarter. The pottery from the latter two areas dates from the Byzantine period into Early Arab. Mampsis (Kurnub). In 1990, excavations under the direction of Avraham Negev (HU) were under- taken "to complete excavation of the market building (IV), the Khan (VIII), and a wing and the courts of a rich horse breeder's mansion (XII) (fig. 50). In addi- tion, two new buildings were discovered and exca- vated north of the Khan (XXII-XXIII) (fig. 51). They are interpreted as educational institutions, in the fash- ion of the Greek gymnasium, at which Nabatean ar- chitects and master builders got their training. Building XXIII is dated to the first century and Build- ing XXII to the second-third centuries. By the middle of the fourth century, both buildings were robbed out and subsequently served as barracks for the local militia until before the middle of the sixth century." Two volumes on Mampsis have recently appeared, both by A. Negev: The Architecture of Mampsis I: The Middle and Late Nabatean Periods (Qedem 26, Jerusa- lem 1988); and The Architecture of Mampsis II: The Late Roman and Byzantine Periods (Qedem 27, Jerusa- lem 1988). Oboda (Avdat). A. Negev reports that "the 1989 season focused on the search for Nabatean temples, the existence of which is known from remains of a large temenos, a large quantity of Nabatean decorated architectural stones found in later constructions, and a great number of Nabatean and Graeco-Nabatean dedicatory inscriptions. Efforts were concentrated on the acropolis (fig. 52) near the southwestern corner of the later fortress, where previous excavations had revealed traces of the Nabatean temple. The new excavations revealed a tripartite temple consisting of a porch in antis (ulam) of four columns, a cella (hechal), and an adyton (debir) whose southern wall preserved three niches for the idols of gods (fig. 53). This was probably the earliest temple at Oboda. It was used as a temple in the Roman period and was incorporated into the city's defenses in the times of Diocletian and Constantine the Great."

Excavations revealed a stratigraphic sequence extending from the early sev- enth to the early 11th century. Especially important are the sections on Late Byzantine and Early Arab pottery and Umayyad gold coins. More recent exca- vations exposed remains dating from the Roman and Byzantine periods. Public buildings were revealed, including parts of what may have been the central market and a bathhouse from the Roman period and a two-story building arranged around a central court- yard from the Byzantine period (ESI 7-8 [1988- 1989] 108-109). Tiberias. A salvage excavation directed by Alex- ander Onn (IAA) revealed a rich stratum dating to the Fatimid period (969-1033). He reports: "Three rooms of a house and an inner courtyard and well were uncovered. Two hoards of valuables were found concealed in jars under the floor on both sides of the doorsill in one of the rooms. The hoards contained gold and silver coins and gold jewelry, which included part of a gold ornament made in filigree and granu- lation technique, earrings, buttons, and gold rings set with jewels." Myriam Rosen-Ayalon (HU) has highlighted some recent activity in the field of Islamic archaeology.29 Included is the Sede Boqer project, headed by Rosen- Ayalon and directed in the field by Y. Nevo, which yielded desert dwellings dated by pottery to the sev- enth to eighth centuries, nearly 600 rock inscriptions from the seventh to late eighth/early ninth centuries, and an open-air mosque from the eighth-ninth cen- turies (see also ESI 7-8 [1988-1989] 163-64). Other open-air mosques have been found at Har 'Oded, located to the south of Makhtesh Ramon (IEJ 39 [1989] 120), at Be'er 'Ora, between Timnah and Eilat, and elsewhere in the Negev (BASOR 279 [1990] 69). See Beit Shean and Caesarea above for Early Is- lamic remains. Belmont Castle. Richard Harper and R.D. Pringle (British School of Archaeology, Jerusalem) completed their initial series of investigations in 1989. Harper reports that "a section cut across the north side of the castle served to relate the square central complex to the subcircular exterior curtain wall with its associated structures in the outer bailey. Excavation of the Byz- antine mosaic in the north range was completed. A large cistern, predating the castle, was also examined. 29 "New Discoveries in Islamic Archaeology in the Holy Land," in M.

See Crusader sites of Caesarea and Tel Jezreel above, and Caesarea and Jerusalem (Mamilla Street) above for Mamluk-Ottoman excavations. SHIPWRECKS Ma'agan Michael. The remnants of a shipwreck (13-15 m in length) were excavated in 1988 and 1989 off the coast of Ma'agan Michael (C.M.S. News 16 [1989] and 17 [1990]). Elisha Linder (UH) is the project's principal investigator, Jay Rosloff (UH) the field director. Rosloff reports that "the form and con- struction techniques of the Ma'agan Michael vessel's hull are nearly identical with those of the famous Kyrenia vessel of 300 B.C.E. The internal framing is quite different, however, and virtually unique. Whereas nearly all ancient ships were framed with floor timbers ... alternating with half-frames ..., our frames are constructed to run completely from one side to the other." The vessel, which was almost new when it sank, carried a single mast for a large square sail. The timbers are presently being chemically im- pregnated in anticipation of their reassembly for dis- play and additional study. A large portion of the estimated 12 tons of ballast stones that the vessel originally carried was removed from the site. Petrographic analysis on the ballast stones preliminarily identified at least seven types, five of which are foreign to the Levant or eastern North African coasts. Very little cargo was preserved. The main finds included ceramics, dating to the fifth or beginning of the fourth century B.C.E.; a tin ingot in bar form; and organic materials such as dunnage (from pistachio trees), baskets, ropes, and fig and olive pits. While the vessel's location and date would not rule out its identification as a Phoenician merchant- ship, the hull and the finds do not permit an attribu- tion to any particular nationality. Galilee Boat. In 1986 the remains of an ancient hull were discovered at an exposed area of the Sea of Galilee, near Kibbutz Ginnosar. Due to the expected rise in the level of the lake and overly eager treasure hunters, it was decided that the boat should be exca- vated in haste. The expedition, headed by Shelley Wachsmann (IAA), lasted 11 days. The final report of the excavation, which should serve as a model for all shipwreck sites, was published in 1990 ('Atiqot, English Series 19). The boat, whose extant length was 8.2 m, was a masted fishing boat constructed in the "shell-first" technique, being edge-joined with mortise and tenon joints. It is dated to ca. 100 B.C.E. to ca. 70 C.E. on the basis of construction techniques, 14C and pottery analyses. The boat is presently sitting in PEG solution at the Yigal Allon Center, Kibbutz Gin- nosar, where it can be viewed by the public. Caesarea Maritima (CAHEP). Avner Raban (UH) reports (C.M.S. News 16, 1989) that a wreckage site found inside the harbor basin was explored in the 1988 season. Although the hull was not preserved, several finds point to a third century C.E. date. North of the harbor, a Roman (Late Republican) merchant- man was explored. "The hull is of heavier construc- tion than any other known merchantman of the period excavated in the Mediterranean in the past and the only one in the Levant." CERAMIC PROVENIENCE STUDIES The following summary of scientific analyses pre- sents recent data that address peculiar regional prob- lems. It is hoped that the methodologies employed, if not the results, will be of interest to scholars working in other parts of the ancient world. The projects are listed according to the time period with which they are concerned. Petrographic analysis on Chalcolithic pottery and stone vessels from the Northern Negev determined that, with the exception of the cultic center of Gilat and the so-called "Cream ware," most of the pottery was manufactured locally. At least in this region, no large market centers distributed pottery and stone vessels.30 Douglas Esse and P.K. Hopke carried out a neutron activation analysis (NAA) with the hope of providing illumination on the subject of trade in the, EBA.31 Clusters of samples of Khirbet Kerak ware from the 'Amuq Plain and Khirbet Kerak (Beit Yerah) and Hazor in Israel imply that Khirbet Kerak ware was manufactured at Judeidah and Ta'yinat in the 'Amuq and at Hazor and Khirbet Kerak in Israel. The au- thors argue that Khirbet Kerak ware was produced not by itinerant traders, as others have suggested, but rather by a group of migrating people. NAA of Me- tallic ware and Combed Metallic ware from Egypt and Levantine sites including Byblos, Khirbet Kerak, Tell el-IHesi, and Tell H.alif indicates that some of the vessels from Egypt originated at Byblos, as historical references and Egyptian reliefs imply, while others apparently were manufactured in southern Palestine.

This project will be published in Un- tersuchungen der Zweigstelle Kairo des Osterreichischen Archiiologischen Instituts in 1992. McGovern has examined the ceramic, glass, and faience industries at Tel Beit Shean in the LBA and has concluded that "the Egyptians appeared to have controlled the industries at their most basic levels- the preparation and supply of raw materials, heavily tempered clays, and faience. The Palestinian ceramic specialists, whether voluntary or as a forced response, then adapted their techniques and were most likely responsible for technological and stylistic innova- tions."32 Recent analyses have demonstrated beyond doubt that Philistine pottery was manufactured locally in Israel. An analysis by NAA of Mycenaean IIIC:lb and Philistine bichrome pottery from Tel Miqne (see above, fig. 22) determined that all of the former and three of five of the latter were locally manufactured; the other two were manufactured at a site along the coastal plain.33 Similar results were deduced from a sample of Philistine sherds from Tell Qasile. The largest group of decorated and undecorated pottery from strata XI-X, including the cult vessels from the Philistine temples, were made locally.34 In addition to the Philistine sherds from Tel Miqne mentioned above, one Mycenaean IIIB sherd was shown to have a probable Cypriot origin. A neutron activation project dealing with collared- rim pithoi, mainly from Tel Dan, concluded that some vessels were manufactured at Dan while others were imported from four different sites.35 "Galilean" jars were also manufactured at Dan. Two collared-rim pithoi from Tel Mevorakh and one from Tell Qasile originated in the region near Mevorakh. The other samples from jars of this type could not be pegged to a particular locale. Of the three Cypro-Geometric sherds (WP I [ad- vanced] bowl, WP I [early] amphoriskos, and Bi- chrome I [advanced] bowl) from Tel Dor analyzed by means of NAA, two were determined to have origi- nated in Cyprus (one in the vicinity of Kition) while one (the WP bowl) was local to the region of Dor.36 A recent analysis by J. Gunneweg and H. Mommsen has determined that the pottery from the Edomite shrine at Qitmit, including the Edomite ostraca, is for the most part local to the Beersheva basin.37 A neutron activation project on stamped amphora handles from Jerusalem offered no major surprises but established a chemical fingerprint for a Rhodian group and a probable Koan group.38 One amphora of the Zenon Group tested out the same as a Knidian amphora from Tel Dor, which is not surprising, given that certain scholars have proposed a Knidian origin for that group.39 A project centering on local ceramic trade mecha- nisms in the Roman-period Galilee and especially in the region of Sepphoris provides an excellent exam- ple of textual, archaeological, and scientific evidence being used to elucidate intraregional trade patterns in antiquity.40 NAA has shown that most Galilean settlements and sites from the central Golan from the Early Roman through the Early Byzantine periods received the majority of their kitchen ware from Kefar IHananya. Sepphoris also participated in this trade, although their storage jars and specialty bowls and jugs came from Shikhin, a suburb of Sepphoris. Sep- phoris, then, was probably the central market where regional potters could sell their wares. NAA was used to analyze several flower pots from King Herod's winter palace at Jericho. These pots were found to have been local products, produced in the region of Jericho if not at the site itself.41 32 P.

"Ar- chaeobotany in Israel is divided into several branches according to botanical disciplines and plant organs, namely, fruit and seed morphology, wood anatomy, palynology, phytoliths, basketry, and cloth. Approxi- mately seven scientists are at present dealing with these areas, investigating such subjects as method- ological identifications of plant species by their seeds, stems, and leaves, vegetative tissues, pollen cells and arganels within the cell, as well as changes in climate, surroundings of the sites, beginning and development of agriculture, ancient economy, ancient trade, etc. "Pollen analysis, especially from sediments of Lake Hula, enabled a reconstruction of climatic changes in the Pleistocene and the Holocene. In addition, changes of the forest cover of the country could be traced. These subjects have also been investigated through the study of charred wood remnants. Thus, the development of olive horticulture in the Galilee could be dated to the Hellenistic period, and the original forest of the Sharon Plain and the role of aleppo pine in the early native cover of the country are discussed. "One of the most important investigations carried out recently was that on remains of vegetal food and other plants found at pre-agricultural sites such as Netiv Hagdud and Gilgal in the Jordan Valley, dated to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic period,42 and the Kebaran Ohalo II, some 19,000 years old, near the Sea of Galilee. Almost 100 different species that were iden- tified at these hunter-gatherer sites made it possible to better understand their way of life. One of the conclusions is that they used extensively wild cereals that grew abundantly in the region. "Israel is considered to be the cradle of Old World cereal agriculture, in particular wheat and barley, because their wild types grow naturally and abun- dantly in the country, and there is archaeobotanical evidence of domesticated types at local Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites. In addition, some of the most ancient pulse finds, such as horsebean, are reported from the Early Neolithic period.43 The data accumulated dur- ing the last years have enabled a reevaluation of a most interesting phenomenon of human develop- ment, the so-called 'Agricultural Revolution,' or in more up-to-date terms, the 'beginning of agriculture.' "It is now possible to distinguish between wheat and barley even by their phytoliths alone.44 While the common ancient variety of olive tree has not changed much through the ages, ancient grapes cannot be found anymore, not even among vineyards of tradi- tional farmers. "The archaeobotanical finds in Israel, a country situated between Asia and Africa and forming a tran- sition zone between the Mediterranean Sea and the Near East, can tell when plants, fruits, and other vegetal goods expanded to new regions. In addition to confirmation of the literary evidence, some rem- nants of cultivated plants, such as carob tree from the EBA and apricot from the Roman period, are the earliest attestations of these species in the region. These investigations have contributed to a better un- derstanding of the extent of the local flora as well as the development of the exotic flora of the country. "Archaeobotanical evidence has also helped in un- derstanding terms and plant names mentioned in ancient Hebrew texts such as the Bible and Rabbinic literature. One example is the reestimation of the volume of the most common unit of capacity, called olive's bulk, mentioned in the Rabbinic literature.45 Another example may be the attempts to describe in detail some of the ancient varieties of the 'seven spe- cies'."46 42 O.

WOLFF DEAD SEA SCROLLS Avigdor Hurowitz (BGU) provided the following succinct summary of current Dead Sea Scroll re- search. "Major searches for written materials in the Judean Desert terminated in 1965 (Masada),47 al- though more recent small-scale excavations still yield sporadic documents (e.g., a fourth-century B.C.E. le- gal text from the Jericho region).48 The last "Dead Sea Scroll" to come to light was the Temple Scroll from Qumran Cave 11, purchased by Y. Yadin in 1967 and published in 1977. This work constitutes an extensive rewriting of the legal portions of the Pen- tateuch and a virtual alternative to the normative Five Books of Moses. Its masterly publication, correspond- ing to the 30th anniversary of the Scrolls' initial dis- covery, sparked a renaissance of Qumran studies, particularly in the areas of Sectarian origins and Halakhah [Jewish law]. "More recently, the international publication team was reorganized with much still unpublished material (especially from Cave 4) being redistributed to younger scholars in Israel, Europe, and America. This restructuring has led to the publication in authorita- tive editions of several Pentateuchal scrolls, much important biblical material such as a 'pre-Deuteron- omistic' version of Judges 6, and numerous liturgical and legal works. Soon to be published in official form is a Halakhic Letter (4QMMT) that exposes the dif- ferences in interpretation of biblical law--especially in areas of calendar and ritual purity-that led to the secession of the Qumran Sectarians from the general community. This document may also hold the key for identifying the Sect.49 It is hoped that all the outstanding texts will be published by the end of the decade."
