Until the latter part of the nineteenth century numismatists thought that religious influences were mainly responsible for</page><page sequence="2">1925] BOOK REVIEWS 2I9 shaping the development of the earliest coins. But in the last decade of the century Ridgeway initiated a reaction by suggesting that economic factors were of great if not predominant import- ance. In the present work Herr Laum strongly supports the religious explanation. One way of attacking the problem is to trace the development of the medium of exchange back to the days of barter. Econom- ists have. invariably suggested that the obvious- difficulties of economic life in such a state would lead to the emergence of some one commodity as a commonly accepted medium of exchange and unit of value. Ridgeway supported this theory. Working mainly from literary evidence, he put up a strong case for believing that commodities were chosen for this purpose in each locality according to its economic resources. But the ox was a common and important form of wealth over a more extended area than any other commodity and, for this reason, gradually superseded many more local commodities as a unit of value and, less widely, as a medium of exchange. Herr Laum agrees to the extensive use of the ox unit, but does not agree to this economic explanation of its evolution. He thinks "it is impossible that the ox unit originated in trade " (p. I4), because he " does not see how the ox, because it was a commodity of superior attractiveness can have become the measure of value" (p. I6). His own theory reverts to the acceptance of the superior importance of religious factors. He believes that " the evolution of cattle as a medium of exchange originated in their sacred use" (p. I7). Out of early religion and, particularly out of the almost universally anthropomorphic conception of the divinity, arose the practice of making sacrifices or offerings, to expiate some misconduct or for the more general purpose of pacifying the evil spirit or of retaining the favours of the good. These offerings had a definitely economic function (Verkehrsform) and a commerce in religious offerings grew up. "The public religion must necessarily possess a normative character. In consequence the quality and, quantity of sacrificial commodities, as well as the kind of goods and ti-me of presentation are laid down. The well-being of the state demands that the divinity recognised by the state shall be satisfied by the presentation of his due offerings.. . . Nomos, by which later the state law was universally meant, signified originally the 'order of assessment' (of sacrifices). . . . In the sacred nomos is the beginning of the legal standard: here first the state prescribed a commodity and gave a guarantee of its quality and this com- modity selected and guaranteed by the state served as a valid</page><page sequence="3">220 ECONOMICA [JUNE means of payment. The relation of the state to its divinity is a legal one: the commodity selected by the state is equally a legally acknowledged medium of exchange" (p. 29). In early times the ox was the principal form of offering over a very wide area and, at least in some places, it is suggested that this arose out of the replacement of an earlier human sacrifice by the offering of an ox (p. 66). Later this substitution was carried much farther, and it became necessary to prescribe the equiva- lents of the fixed sacrifices in terms of the commodities being offered as substitutes. The substituting articles came thus to be valued in terms of the commodity they replaced: an official price list expressed in terms of oxen of a defined quality was the result. The measure of value established in this way for the regulation of religious obligations was used also for payments for the services of priests, and very soon the unit made thus familiar was trans- lated to the sphere of secular commerce. Token money, Herr Laum suggests, can only have arisen in the religious sphere, for " the substitution of valuable goods by value- less symbols had its origin and meaning in religion. In magic there was no distinction between object and counterfeit. Real goods and tokens were, in practice, the same. In order that tokens shall serve as payment, religion is necessary. . . . The transfer of sacred forms to profane commerce first called forth conflict between the substantial and functional elements of money" (p. 159). The origins of money can also be sought by examining specimens of the earliest coins. The representations (or types) on these coins were thought during the last century also to indicate their religious origin. Ridgeway, however, suggested that at least some of them were of economic significance and referred to the commodity which had been the staple product of the district and had for that reason been used as a medium of exchange before the introduction of coins or the precious metals. Herr Laum, however, thinks it impossible that the types bear any relation to earlier barter units. He asks (inter alia) why, in some places where the coin superseded the ox unit, only the head of the ox appeared on the coins, and will not hear of the head being used in later stages to represent the whole beast, nor will he listen to arguments based on artistic considerations. But although he insists on a religious origin for all these types, he seems to be in agreement with Ridgeway and others that it was the economic organisation of the temples that gave rise to some of the earliest coins. " The stamp notified that the piece of metal belongs to</page><page sequence="4">19253 BOOK REVIEWS 22I the god and is sacred to him . . t the necessity for the stamp arose out of (the desire for) economical realisation or investment of the bullion (by the temple authorities). At least that seems to me to have been one of the principal motives for the stamping of metal. In order to secure that the exact quantity and metal was paid back . . . and to make quite certain that it was the property of the god, a picture of the god was placed on the metal." . . . "Originally the stamp on the money signified no guarantee either of quality or quantity the type is a sacred symbol and thereon was based the credit which the money enjoyed" (p. I44). Where wealthy temples issued large quantities of ingots marked with the sacred symbol, the latter would become well known and render acceptable any ingot on which it appeared. But some of the earliest types, which are merely punch marks closely resem- bling our hall-marks, are now widely thotught to be the marks of private bankers, the symbol used by them being that on their private seals. While, therefore, some issues are undoubtedly of religious origin, it is more probable that both bankers and priestly colleges marked ingots that passed through their hands. Whether the mark of the banker of the temple became the better known in any locality depended partly on the number of ingots on which each appeared. The marks were probably taken as indications at first of quality and later of the quantity of metal in the coin, and their reliability in these respects would also influence their popularity. Later, when the business of issuing money had been universally nationalised, most of the publicly issued coins of the ancient Greek world bore effigies of religious significance, probably because to speak in terms of sacred symbols was to speak in a language universally read and respected. The remoteness of the period to which these theories relate means that they must of necessity rest on very meagre evidence and precludes positive statement in proof or criticism. They certainly call for examination by the anthropologist as well as the economist. The latter is inclined to question whether in primitive times religion played so exclusive a part in men's lives and to suggest that economic factors have always been of very great importance in shaping his conduct. They must have influenced his religious practices. They may often have been the substratum on which those practices rested and have influ- enced the form of sacrifices and the symbols regarded as sacred to the divinity, to mention the matters most relevant to the development of money. Theories which would put forward a single cause for so fundamental an institution of social life as</page><page sequence="5">222 ECONOMICA [JUNE money, set out under the suspicion of simplicity out of accord with the necessary complications of the problem.
