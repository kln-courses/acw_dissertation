<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Requirements, Reasons, and Raz: Legal Positivism and Legal Duties* Matthew H. Kramer During the last three decades, Joseph Raz has developed a number of important themes in jurisprudence and political philosophy. His work has branched out in many directions, but he continues to explore some of the central issues that have preoccupied him since his earliest major writings. This article examines just one aspect of Raz’s work, an aspect that is of special interest to anyone who seeks to defend legal positivism. Raz has argued that judges’ statements of legal obligations—by dint of being such statements—are perforce statements of moral obligations as well. Even when a particular assertion declaring the existence of some legal duty is made by someone with no actual commitment to the moral bindingness of the duty, it carries on its face the implication that the duty is indeed morally binding. When judges and other officials affirm propositions concerning legal obligations, they ipso facto affirm or ap- pear to affirm propositions concerning moral obligations for compli- ance therewith. Raz, then, maintains that the meaning of the word ‘obligation’ in legal contexts is inseparable from the meaning of that word in moral contexts. Such a position is not easily squared with legal positivism— even when allowance is made for uncommitted statements, erroneous statements, and insincere statements—and indeed this matter consti- tuted one of the chief points of contention between Raz and his mentor H. L. A. Hart.1 After a few preliminary remarks, this article will begin by * This article is an abridged version of a chapter from my forthcoming book, Law without Trimmings: A Defense of Legal Positivism. I have made numerous modifications to en- able the abridgment of the chapter. I wish to thank Daniel Brudney, Gibran van Ert, Nigel Simmonds, and some anonymous editors and readers for their comments. Thanks are also due to Andrew Hamilton. 1. H. L. A. Hart presented his objections in his Essays on Bentham (Oxford: Claren- don, 1982), pp. 153–61, 262–68, and in his Essays in Jurisprudence and Philosophy (Oxford: Clarendon, 1983), pp. 9–10. Hart was responding to the following three works by Joseph Raz:Practical Reason and Norms (London: Hutchinson, 1975), pp. 123–29, 146–48, 162–77, The Authority of Law (Oxford: Clarendon, 1979), pp. 153–57, and The Concept of a Legal System, 2d ed.

We shall then consider in greater depth the line of argument to which Hart was responding; and we shall likewise examine some alternative lines of argument with which Raz has sought to support his position. On the whole, this article will side with Hart against Raz, albeit with some important modifications and am- plifications of Hart’s ripostes. As will be submitted, there are both simi- larities and differences between the meaning of ‘obligation’ in legal settings and themeaning of that term inmoral settings. Though the simi- larities are far from unimportant, the differences are momentous. This critique of Raz’s stance will reject some of his specific claims and will impugn his account of legal pronouncements. Certain of his theses which are directly connected to that account will therefore also be challenged (at least implicitly and in part). However, most of Raz’s theo- retical framework is not in question here. Nothing in this article casts doubt on his overall model of practical reason or on his powerful argu- ments about the absence of a general obligation to obey the law, for ex- ample. My critique is an effort to resist the undue extension of his theo- retical framework rather than to assail that framework itself. Still, although many elements of Raz’s thought go unquestioned here, the points actually at issue are of central importance to present-day and Norms are to the 2d ed. [Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1990].) Raz most directly responded to Hart in ‘‘Hart on Moral Rights and Legal Duties,’’ Oxford Journal of Legal Studies 4 (1984): 123–31, pp. 129–31. For some secondary works that take largely or wholly favorable views of Raz’s stance on this matter, see Steven Burton, ‘‘Law as Practical Reason,’’ Southern California Law Review 62 (1989): 747–93, pp. 769–71; J. D. Goldsworthy, ‘‘Detmold’s ‘The Unity of Law and Morality,’ ’’ Monash University Law Review 12 (1986): 8–26, pp. 17–18, and ‘‘The Self-Destruction of Legal Positivism,’’ Oxford Journal of Legal Studies 10 (1990): 449–86, pp. 453–62; Leslie Green, ‘‘Law, Legitimacy, and Consent,’’ Southern California Law Review 62 (1989): 795–825, pp. 797–800; Andrei Marmor, Inter- pretation and Legal Theory (Oxford: Clarendon, 1992), pp. 45–47; Michael Moore, ‘‘Au- thority, Law, and Razian Reasons,’’ Southern California Law Review 62 (1989): 827–96, pp. 837–38, 840; Stephen Perry, ‘‘Interpretation andMethodology in Legal Theory,’’ inLaw and Interpretation, ed.

Lest there be some unclarity, I should note that the Razian thesis which I oppose in this article is a thesis about the meaning of any obligation-asserting legal statement. Like Raz, I focus on that question of meaning rather than on the sorts of conversational implicatures explored by H. P. Grice. </page> <page sequence="3"> Kramer Requirements, Reasons, and Raz 377 legal philosophy. Specifically, the aim of this article is to resist any elabo- ration of Raz’s ideas that would appear to close off the potential for a gap between statements of legal obligation and statements of moral obliga- tion. Because the elimination of the potential for that gap would be dev- astating to legal positivism,2 a challenge to Raz’s conception of jural state- ments is essential for the task of defending an alternative to natural law theory. Hence, by showing the tenability of the stance which Raz pur- ports to have refuted, this article seeks to reaffirm a positivist answer to questions about the nature of law. Two preliminary caveats are advisable here. First, my critique of Raz does not attempt to demonstrate that a certain feature has to be present in every legal system. It tries to demonstrate, rather, that a certain feature does not have to be present in every legal system; in other words, I try to demonstrate that some legal systems can be marked by the absence of that feature. More precisely, there is no suggestion in this article that statements of legal obligations cannot be statements of moral obligations as well. Instead, all that is contended is that statements of the former sort are not perforce statements of the latter sort. To argue that legal norms can be stark imperatives (as opposed to prescriptions) is not to argue— in the manner of nineteenth-century jurisprudential positivism—that legal norms are always stark imperatives. Likewise, when this article sub- mits that legal norms in themselves (in isolation from the sanctions at- tached to them) do not necessarily serve or profess to serve as reasons for compliance on the part of their addressees, it does not thereby sub- mit that such norms in themselves can never serve as such reasons. Second, a couple of points of terminology need to be clarified straightaway. (One or two further points of terminology will be clari- fied later.) Albeit Raz uses the term ‘norm’ in a manner connected with his overall account of practical reason, that term will be used more broadly here. It will cover not only general prescriptions (concerning how people ought to behave), but also general imperatives (concerning how peoplemust behave). A norm is any general directive that lays down a standard with which conformity is required and against which people’s conduct can be assessed. Never strictly confined to a single event or situ- ation, and therefore always applicable or potentially applicable to similar events or situations, a norm can be formulated at varying degrees of gen- erality. It can be a rule, a principle, a doctrine, a regulation, a broad 2. Although I shall not here investigate the dire consequences of Raz’s position for legal positivism, I should mention that those consequences are explored in Goldsworthy, ‘‘Self-Destruction,’’ pp. 473–78. While (in my view) Goldsworthy’s argument stands in need of some modifications, it goes a long way toward showing that Raz gravely threatens his own version of legal positivism when he insists that statements of legal obligations are statements of moral obligations. (For some of the most explicit instances of Raz’s insistence on this point, see The Authority of Law, pp. 37–39, 158–59.) </page> <page sequence="4"> 378 Ethics January 1999 decree, or some other sort of touchstone for guiding and appraising hu- man conduct—conduct which the norm is designed to channel by ren- dering certain acts or omissions mandatory. The last paragraph may seem to suggest that all norms impose du- ties. On the one hand, given that this article mounts a critique of Raz’s conception of legal obligations, those norms which establish duties do indeed receive most of my scrutiny herein. On the other hand, I certainly do not mean to imply that all norms impose duties. Myriad norms confer liberties, powers, or immunities—either instead of imposing duties or in addition to doing so. That such norms do not attract too much attention in this article is of course fully consistent with a recognition of their vital importance in numerous other contexts. Finally, as might be inferred from my pattern of usage so far, the terms ‘duty’ and ‘obligation’ will be employed interchangeably through- out this article. Although some analytical purposes can render advisable the drawing of a distinction between those words, the arguments below do not require any such demarcation. What this article highlights is a distinction between two types of duties (and thus between two types of obligations) rather than between duties and obligations. I. RAZ CONTRA HART H. L. A. Hart responded in the early 1980s to Raz’s conception of offi- cials’ statements. While clearly in sympathy with many aspects of Raz’s jurisprudence, Hart balked at the suggestion that ‘obligation’ carries the same meaning in legal and moral settings. He correctly maintained that Raz has reached such a conclusion through a reason-based approach to legal and moral discourse. That approach proceeds along the following lines (summarized very tersely here). When jural officials declare that a legal norm requires people to act in a certain way, they are declaring that people ought to act in the specified way. Now, because every ‘‘ought’’ statement in favor of a person X ’s adopting a certain mode of conduct is logically equivalent to a statement asserting the existence of one or more reasons for X to adopt that mode of conduct,3 the pronouncements of legal officials explicitly or implicitly assert that people have reasons to act in the ways that are specified by the prevailing laws. Statements of legal obligations are statements implicitly or explicitly affirming the existence of reasons for people to engage in the acts which the obligations require or to eschew the acts which the obligations forbid. Plainly, those reasons must be interest independent, since the obligations themselves are inter- 3. Of course, mutatis mutandis, a parallel point is true of ‘‘ought’’ statementsagainst the adoption of a certain mode of conduct by X. For Raz’s most sustained discussion of the logical equivalence between ‘‘ought’’ statements and reason-asserting statements, see Prac- tical Reason and Norms, pp. 29–32. I fully agree with Raz on this matter, as should be evident from Matthew Kramer, In the Realm of Legal and Moral Philosophy (Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1998), chap. 10. </page> <page sequence="5"> Kramer Requirements, Reasons, and Raz 379 est independent; that is, because legal duties frequently require indi- viduals to act against their own interests and preferred objectives, the reasons-for-action presented by those duties must be independent of those interests and objectives. If legal duties consisted only in prudential reasons-for-action—reasons tied to the interests of the people for whom they are reasons—then they could not amount to the sorts of require- ments which legal duties very often are. (Of course, the laws that estab- lish duties typically back them up with sanctions of various sorts. The avoidance of such sanctions will almost always be a prudential reason for complying with those laws. But the focus here is on the requirements of the laws themselves in isolation from the penalties that are attached to them. We are inquiring into the fundamental tenor of statements that invoke legal norms in their own right; we are not inquiring into the tenor of statements that concern the punishments inflicted when the demands of legal norms go unfulfilled.) Thus, statements of legal duties are state- ments of interest-independent reasons for people to behave in accor- dance with the terms of the duties. In short, such statements expressly or implicitly assert moral reasons for people to conduct themselves in particular ways.4 In response to this ostensible demonstration of the moral tenor of legal pronouncements, Hart was willing to accept arguendo Raz’s overall account of moral reasoning. However, he dissented from the notion that legal decision making is relevantly similar to such reasoning. He retorted as follows: I find little reason to accept . . . a cognitive interpretation of legal duty in terms of objective reasons or the identity of meaning of 4. This Razian argument rests on the assumption that interest-independent rea- sons are always moral reasons, which are thus contrasted with prudential reasons. Raz has sometimes suggested that certain commitments cannot be properly described as either moral or prudential, and that they likewise cannot be properly described as bothmoraland prudential. For an account of friendship along these lines, see Raz, The Authority of Law, pp. 253–56. Compare Raz, The Morality of Freedom, p. 33. Other scholars have appeared to take the view that certain institutional and social duties are neither moral nor prudential. See, e.g., Burton, p. 770. My own position on this question is supportive of the general analysis—the analysis of obligation-asserting legal statements—which I am attributing to Raz (and which I shall shortly oppugn, on other grounds). In my view, morality and pru- dence exhaust the realm of reasons. Other commitments and considerations, such as fa- milial and institutional requirements, can be classified asmoral or prudential or bothmoral and prudential. Numerous though the varieties of moral reasons and prudential reasons and moral/prudential reasons are, they do not make up additional basic categories. (A contrary position leads to exceedingly odd consequences. For example, Steven Burton seems to have committed one or both of two missteps. On the one hand, he appears to saddle Hart with a cognitive approach to statements asserting legal duties, notwithstanding Hart’s own repeated characterizations of his approach as noncognitive. On the other hand, Burton appears to conflate the reasons-for-action of legal officials [the law’s addressors] with the reasons-for-action of ordinary citizens [the law’s addressees]. However, I should mention that Burton later quite clearly avoids the second of these missteps [p. 774].) </page> <page sequence="6"> 380 Ethics January 1999 ‘obligation’ in legal and moral contexts which this would secure. Far better adapted to the legal case is a different, non-cognitive theory of duty according to which committed statements asserting that others have a duty do not refer to actions which they have a categorical reason to do but, as the etymology of ‘duty’ and indeed ‘ought’ suggests, such statements refer to actions which are due from or owed by the subjects having the duty, in the sense that they may be properly demanded or exacted from them. On this footing, to say that an individual has a legal obligation to act in a certain way is to say that such action may be properly demanded or ex- tracted from him according to legal rules or principles regulating such demands.5 As Hart made clear when expanding on these remarks, judges can and often do maintain that particular laws impose moral obligations. He con- tended merely that such a stance (or the pretense of such a stance) is far from unavoidable for judges and other officials: ‘‘I have only argued that when judges or others make committed statements of legal obligation it is not the case that they must necessarily believe or pretend to believe that they are referring to a species of moral obligation.’’ 6 Raz has replied to Hart by underscoring afresh the soundness of the reason-based perspective on legal duties. Because statements asserting that each person ought to do f are logically equivalent to statements asserting that each person has one or more reasons to do f, such state- ments must pertain to moral considerations or to considerations of each addressee’s interests. An addressor’s interests cannot themselves support pronouncements concerning how other people ought to act. A personX cannot correctly say that you ought to adopt a certain mode of conduct simply because it will be in his interest; in order to sustain his prescrip- tion, X will have to suggest that you have a moral responsibility to pro- mote his interests, or that your welfare is linked to his own. Thus, given that officials’ pronouncements concerning legal duties are pronounce- ments concerning how people ought to behave, and given that those pronouncements therefore affirm that people have reasons to behave in the prescribed ways, and given that the requirements of legal duties are interest independent, the reasons-for-action affirmed by official pro- nouncements must be moral reasons. Raz observes that Hart sought to escape this conclusion by denying the step in the argument where state- ments of legal duties are deemed to be statements of reasons-for-action. Raz rejoins: ‘‘This sudden Kelsenian twist to Hart’s view of legal duties implies that duty-imposing laws are instructions (or perhaps merely per- missions) to courts to apply sanctions or remedies against people who are guilty of breach of duty. Hart himself feels uncomfortable with the conclusion he has reached . . . as well he might. For if he is right then it 5. Hart, Essays on Bentham, pp. 159–60. 6. Ibid., p. 161. </page> <page sequence="7"> Kramer Requirements, Reasons, and Raz 381 follows either that it is not wrong to fail to fulfil one’s duty or that acting wrongly is not something one has a reason not to do.’’ 7 Having advanced this riposte, Raz recapitulates his well-known views about law’s claim to moral authoritativeness: ‘‘The decisive argument concerning the mean- ing of statements of legal duties is that the law claims for itself moral force. No system is a system of law unless it includes a claim of legitimacy, of moral authority. That means that it claims that legal requirements are morally binding, that is that legal obligations are real (moral) obligations arising out of the law.’’ 8 II. THE DEBATE JOINED In the discussions below, we shall look further at the Hart/Raz dispute and especially at certain strands of Raz’s rejoinder. Henceforth, however, my article joins the debate instead of merely recounting it. As will be- come apparent, the debate hinges on the question whether obligation- asserting legal statements must present themselves as reason-asserting statements. We shall be considering the chief lines of argument which Raz has adduced in favor of his position. This article begins its critical scrutiny by probing the set of theses on which Hart concentrated his at- tack; most of Raz’s other arguments are variously designed to bolster that set of theses. A. From Prescriptions to Imperatives If norms were inevitably prescriptive, and if statements invoking norms were therefore inevitably statements of prescriptions, then Raz’s concep- tion of legal obligations would surely be sound. Prescriptions (i.e., prac- tical ‘‘ought’’ judgments) set forth or presuppose reasons-for-action, be they moral or prudential. To address someone with a practical ‘‘ought’’ judgment is to contend—perhaps falsely or insincerely—that the per- son has either a moral reason or a prudential reason for behaving as the judgment prescribes. Hence, given that the requirements of legal norms are interest independent for each individual, the inherently prescriptive tenor of those norms would consist in their laying down or presuppos- ing (or appearing to lay down or presuppose) moral reasons-for-action. Statements of legal duties would indeed be, or purport to be, statements of moral duties. Hart was quite correct, then, in thinking that a rejection of this conclusion necessitates a partial rejection of Raz’s reason-based analysis of norms. Instead of following Hart in his reference to the etymology of ‘ought’, however, we should shift our attention to an altogether different auxiliary—the auxiliary ‘must’. Whereas Raz regards legal norms as in- trinsically prescriptive, they are in fact only contingently so. Some such 7. Raz, ‘‘Hart on Moral Rights and Legal Duties,’’ p. 131. 8. Ibid. </page> <page sequence="8"> 382 Ethics January 1999 norms are imperatives rather than prescriptions; their requirements are ‘‘must’’ demands rather than ‘‘ought’’ judgments.9 Unlike practical ‘‘ought’’ judgments, the ‘‘must’’ demands of imperatives do not nec- essarily lay down or presuppose reasons-for-action for their addressees (though the addressors of such demands undoubtedly have reasons for issuing them). Before exploring the prescription/imperative distinction in greater depth, we should return for a moment to the question of the meaning of ‘obligation’ in moral and legal contexts. In one important respect, the meaning of that word remains constant when we move from the realm of morality to the realm of legality. That is, both in the phrase ‘moral obligation’ and in the phrase ‘legal obligation’, the word de- notes a requirement imposed by a norm or set of norms. However, we discover a crucial shift in the word’s meaning when we ascertain the na- ture of the norms which impose the requirements; the requirements of moral norms are always prescriptions that constitute reasons-for-action for their addressees, whereas the requirements of legal norms can be stark imperatives that do not in themselves (i.e., in isolation from at- tached penalties) constitute such reasons-for-action. We have encoun- tered a shift or potential shift from the sway of ‘‘ought’’ to the sway of ‘‘must.’’ Now, in the ordinary sense of ‘imperative’, some imperatives are of course themselves moral injunctions.10 ‘‘Thou shalt not kill,’’ for ex- ample, is both an imperative and a moral prescription. Throughout this article, however, the word ‘imperative’ will be used more narrowly to indicate only those general commands that are not morally pregnant. As understood here, imperatives in themselves (i.e., in isolation from any sanctions) do not perforce lay down or presuppose reasons for their ad- dressees to act in accordance with their terms. By definition they do not set forth or presuppose moral reasons, and—given that many impera- tives require actions which are not in the interests of their addressees— they do not necessarily set forth or presuppose prudential reasons. Of course, some imperatives require actions that are promotive of their addressees’ interests. When a mother commands her young son to eat his broccoli, he has a prudential reason (apart from the avoidance of a spanking) to do as she instructs him. Other imperatives, however, are not promotive of their addressees’ interests. When a gunman commands 9. I have clearly benefited from reading D. N. MacCormick, ‘‘Legal Obligation and the Imperative Fallacy,’’ in Oxford Essays in Jurisprudence, ed. A. W. B. Simpson, 2d ser. (Ox- ford: Clarendon, 1973), pp. 100–130. However, a number of my specific analyses are very different from those of MacCormick, and in some respects my general aims are the oppo- site of his. 10. Indeed, Stuart Hampshire has contended that all especially strong moral prohi- bitions are best formulated as ‘‘must’’ demands. See Stuart Hampshire, Two Theories of Mo- rality (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1977), pp. 16–17. </page> <page sequence="9"> Kramer Requirements, Reasons, and Raz 383 his victim to hand over her money, her only prudential reason for doing so is to avoid being shot. In isolation from the gunman’s threat, the hand- ing over of money is not something which the victim has a reason to do. Thus, although imperatives can be in harmony with their addressees’ interests, they can likewise be at odds therewith. The interest independence of imperatives stems from the fact that they are products of the overwhelming superiority—the actual superi- ority or the presumed superiority—of the addressors over the address- ees. Because of this overwhelming superiority, the addressors of impera- tives will themselves frequently have no prudential reasons to cater to the interests of the addressees and will be able to disregard any moral reasons for solicitude. Their dictates will therefore be only contingently promotive of the addressees’ objectives and projects. In what does the overwhelming superiority consist? Within a discussion of law, of course, the factor that should be singled out is coercive might; for the most part, this article will take for granted that such a factor lies behind legal im- peratives. But, even given that any overwhelming superiority based on moral worthiness is excluded from consideration here (because of my deliberately narrow conception of imperatives), we should note that fac- tors other than overpowering strength can loom large in some contexts. For example, an exceptionally beautiful woman may so captivate her ad- mirers that she enjoys over them the sort of superiority which impels them to do her bidding. (In Turgenev’s great short story ‘‘First Love,’’ for instance, the protagonist unhesitatingly jumps off a high wall in con- formity to a behest from the young woman who has infatuated him.) Much the same can be true of an exceptionally handsome man or an exceptionally skillful athlete. Neil MacCormick has pertinently captured the basic structure of the overwhelming superiority that underlies effective interest-independent imperatives: ‘‘A has . . . power to, and is prepared to, inflict undesired harm on B without present risk of equal or similarly undesirable retalia- tion; there is at least some range of acts which B is prepared to do, how- ever unwillingly, in order to avoid suffering the harm whichA can inflict; and A and B both know all this, or at least suppose it to be the case.’’ An imperative is thus ‘‘an utterance which the speaker intends his addressee to take as expressing a will that the addressee do some act in recognition of the speaker’s superiority.’’ 11 (Although typically the person issuing the imperative will harbor an actual intention of the sort which MacCormick describes, ‘‘it is sufficient ifA knows, or ought to realize, or thinks it likely that B will take him to have the relevant intention.’’)12 As has been remarked in passing, the overwhelming superiority that serves as the basis for imperatives can be putative rather than actual. A 11. MacCormick, ‘‘Legal Obligation,’’ pp. 106–7, 108. 12. Ibid., p. 105, n. 11. </page> <page sequence="10"> 384 Ethics January 1999 person X can quite intelligibly issue a command to other people even if he enjoys no actual superiority over them. ThoughX is presumptuous in such circumstances, his dictate is not meaningless. Still, unless the others are deluded about X ’s actual position, or unless his command happens to be in harmony with what they perceive as their interests, they will al- most certainly not put his directive into effect. Actual superiority, rather than purported superiority, is prerequisite to the general efficacy of interest-independent commands. (Of course, if the addressees of X ’s presumptuous command are submissive because they are deluded about his position, then X enjoys an actual superiority over them—albeit a su- periority based on their misconceptions rather than on any factor which X has explicitly or implicitly invoked.) Before reexamining Raz’s conception of legal duties in light of this discussion of imperatives, we should ponder one more feature of the imperative/prescription distinction. Clearly, the surface form or mood of a statement is not always decisive in regard to the imperative or pre- scriptive tenor of the requirement which the statement articulates. Many sentences with imperative forms—for instance, many warnings such as ‘‘Look out for the sliding rocks!’’—will in most circumstances have the semantic content of prescriptions. Conversely, some sentences with pre- scriptive forms may be used as deliberately understated ways of articu- lating imperatives. Thus, although ‘ought’ is normally the auxiliary of prescriptions and ‘must’ is normally the auxiliary of imperatives, and al- though the surface form of a statement will often be a reliable indicator of its prescriptive or imperative tenor, the key to the prescription/im- perative distinction lies not in the grammatical mood but in the kind of requirement which a statement expresses. If a requirement is grounded in morality or essentially in the interests of the addressee, then the for- mulation expressing it is a prescription; contrariwise, if a requirement is grounded not in morality and not essentially in the interests of the ad- dressee but essentially or exclusively in the interests of the addressor, then the formulation expressing it is an imperative. Let us return now to Raz’s reason-based conception of legal obliga- tions. His chief argument involves the claim that duty-imposing legal norms prescribe certain interest-independent patterns of behavior to individuals, and that the norms therefore lay down or presuppose (or appear to lay down or presuppose) interest-independent reasons for the individuals to act in the specified ways. Statements invoking legal duties are therefore statements actually or ostensibly invoking interest- independent reasons-for-action—which means that they are statements actually or ostensibly invoking moral reasons-for-action. So runs the gist of Raz’s argument. The premise which will be denied here is that legal norms are always actually or putatively prescriptive; though such norms can indeed be prescriptions, they can likewise be stark imperatives (in my sense of ‘imperatives’). Legal obligations, which are the require- </page> <page sequence="11"> Kramer Requirements, Reasons, and Raz 385 ments established by duty-imposing legal norms, can be grounded es- sentially or exclusively in the interests of the officials who issue and apply the norms. In such circumstances, the addressees of the norms have no moral reasons and no prudential reasons (i.e., no punishment- unrelated prudential reasons) to behave in accordance with the norms’ requirements. As was explained a moment ago, we cannot tell whether legal norms are imperatives or prescriptions by looking merely at the grammar or vocabulary of their formulations. (Worthy of a passing remark, however, is the fact that—especially in statutes—the imperative auxiliaries ‘shall’ and ‘must’ get employed frequently.) Nor can we determine whether legal requirements are prescriptions or imperatives by asking if they are commonly designated as ‘obligations’. After all, the very matter in ques- tion here is whether a term such as ‘obligation’ or ‘duty’ carries the same meaning in legal and moral contexts. As has already been submitted, each of those terms does bear a uniformmeaning across moral and legal contexts in that it denotes a requirement imposed by the applicable norms. Whether the uniformity extends further, however, is exactly the point of contention which this article seeks to address. Raz maintains that the uniformity does extend further because the tenor of statements which assert legal duties is perforce prescriptive in much the same way as the tenor of statements which assert moral duties. He has attempted to shore up his position with some sophisticated arguments which we shall explore presently. For now, we need only note that one cannot sustain Raz’s view by simply pointing to legal officials’ use of deontic terms such as ‘obligation’ and ‘duty’. Any such terminological observa- tion would patently beg the question. Instead of focusing on superficial matters of terminology or gram- mar, we must inquire about the role of legal norms in the reasoning of their addressors and their addressees. Let us take another look at the key sentence from Raz’s rejoinder to Hart: ‘‘For if [Hart] is right then it fol- lows either that it is not wrong to fail to fulfil one’s duty or that acting wrongly is not something one has a reason not to do.’’ 13 In fact, Hart’s position does not entail either of these disjuncts as Raz formulates them, though it does entail a suitably modified version of the first disjunct. A defender of Hart need not and should not maintain that a failure to fulfill one’s legal duty is never morally wrong. Hart plainly did not oblige himself to deny that there are circumstances wherein the fulfillment of one’s legal duty can be morally obligatory. All that the Hartian analyst should insist is that a failure to fulfill one’s legal duty can in various other circumstances be morally permissible (i.e., ‘‘not wrong’’) and can be re- garded as morally permissible even by someone who perceives the legal duty as a legal duty. 13. Raz, ‘‘Hart on Moral Rights and Legal Duties,’’ p. 131. </page> <page sequence="12"> 386 Ethics January 1999 In the preceding paragraph I have assumed that Raz wields the terms ‘wrong’ and ‘wrongly’ to refer to moral impropriety. If instead he has used those terms to refer to strictly legal impropriety, then Hart’s po- sition entails a suitably modified version of Raz’s second disjunct. Acting in violation of the requirements of legal norms can be something which a person has no reason—that is, no punishment-unrelated reason—to forbear from doing. Consider the country of Despotia, where the govern- mental officials sustain their own lavish lifestyles by imposing legal obli- gations on the citizens to pay crushingly heavy taxes. Perhaps the pay- ment of taxes up to some modest level is morally obligatory for each Despotian citizen; but the payment of extortionate taxes beyond that level is neither morally obligatory nor promotive of any citizen’s interests. Thus, apart from considerations of staving off the infliction of penalties, each citizen in Despotia has no reason to forbear from committing the legal wrong of disregarding his or her duty to contribute to the public revenues above a certain level. Supporters of Raz would presumably respond by contending that the Despotian officials cannot assert both that the citizens are under le- gal obligations to pay extravagant levels of taxes and that the citizens have no moral reasons to pay. Officials cannot affirm that legal norms which impose legal duties are stark imperatives. Now, unless this pos- ited response is no more than a flagrant begging of the question, it has to derive from lines of argument which we have not yet probed. Af- ter all, this article has hitherto confronted only one main Razian argu- ment—the argument that officials who invoke legal duties are perforce implicitly or explicitly invoking interest-independent reasons-for-action. Serious doubts about that argument have emerged. In countries like Despotia, some of the norms which establish legal requirements are im- peratives rather than prescriptions. That is, in isolation from penalties, those norms do not constitute or reflect any reasons for their addressees to abide by the requirements which the norms ordain. Moreover, the Despotian officials do not mince words when they invoke the directives which they enforce. Their assertions of those directives amount to varia- tions on a circular theme: ‘‘You [the addressees] must do these things because the prevailing norms enjoin you to do them.’’ Thus, since the requirements imposed by the Despotian regime will be characterized by officials and other people as legal duties, the pronouncements that af- firm legal duties in such circumstances do not necessarily advert or pro- fess to advert to any moral reasons-for-action. Instead, those pronounce- ments in those circumstances can invoke demands as sheer demands. If Raz aims to expose the inconceivability or untenability of this pattern of official discourse, he will have to offer arguments beyond those which we have already plumbed. He has indeed propounded such arguments, to which we now turn. </page> <page sequence="13"> Kramer Requirements, Reasons, and Raz 387 B. Justification or Motivation Among the ways in which Raz has sought to defend his stance is his point- ing to the justificatory tenor of the statements whereby officials invoke legal obligations. When legal officials (especially judges) have to resolve disputes between people, and similarly when officials have to decide whether or not people should be punished for behaving in certain ways, they explain their decisions by reference to the legal duties which the relevant people have borne. These explanations of official decisions are not purely informational or theoretical; rather, they are practical and justificatory, in that they attempt to show that the mechanisms of govern- mental coercion—which implement the officials’ determinations—are being applied in a morally legitimate fashion. Because judges and other officials have to reach decisions that significantly impinge on people’s lives and well-being, they cannot purport to be involved in an innocuous activity (such as the making of jigsaw puzzles) that stands in little or no need of justification. They have to present their determinations as mor- ally legitimate and indeed as morally obligatory, in order to vindicate the far-reaching effects of those determinations on other people. Precisely for this justificatory purpose they cite relevant legal duties as the bases for their holdings. By contending that their holdings give effect to those duties, the officials establish or appear to establish the morality of what they have done. Yet this apparent conferral of moral authority rests on a supposition that the legal duties themselves are morally pregnant; unless the duties are deemed to bemorally binding, themere fact that decisions give effect to them will not be seen as carrying any moral significance. Hence, given that judges and other officials do explain their decisions in order to justify them, and given that their explanations refer centrally to legal duties, the officials must actually or ostensibly regard the duties as moral obligations. If the argument just outlined were successful, then the reason- based approach to statements of legal obligations would quite clearly be sound. As Raz observes, ‘‘While one can accept the law as a guide for one’s own behaviour for reasons of one’s own personal preferences or of self-interest one cannot adduce one’s preferences or one’s self- interest by themselves as a justification for holding that other people must, or have a duty to, act in a certain way.’’ 14 Gerald Postema develops this point: [Defenders of Raz’s position] argue that it is a necessary feature of law that it claims authority over officials and citizens, and that it plays an important role in the justifications of decisions and actions offered by official[s] and citizens. For this to be true, they argue, 14. Raz, ‘‘The Purity of the Pure Theory,’’ pp. 92–93 (emphasis added). </page> <page sequence="14"> 388 Ethics January 1999 self-identified participants in legal practice must believe that legal norms, regarded separately or collectively as a system, have some sort of moral justification—that the separate and special practical significance of legal norms is rooted in broader moral aims and values served by them, or by the system of norms of which they are a part.15 Here as elsewhere, of course, Raz avoids the mistake of confusing a claim-to-legitimacy with legitimacy itself. Though (according to him) a judge or any other official necessarily portrays legal obligations as morally significant by dint of invoking them in order to justify decisions, the portrayals and the justifications may ofttimes be inaccurate. Raz’s view of statements of legal obligations is quite wisely concerned with the tenor of such statements rather than with their truthfulness. None- theless, his appeal to the justificatory role of official discourse cannot withstand scrutiny—because it fails to apply to the very regimes wherein legal duties are most frequently and straightforwardly the products of imperatives. Officials in an evil regime may not concern themselves with justify- ing their decisions when they pass judgments on a variety of issues. Their preoccupation instead may be the reinforcement of incentives for com- pliance with the regime’s wicked laws. The officials indeed explain their heinous decisions by reference to people’s legal obligations, but their purpose in doing so might not be to demonstrate the decisions’ moral warrantedness; rather, their purpose might be to make clear that viola- tions of applicable legal requirements will indeed trigger punishments and that punishments are not inflicted on anyone who abstains from such violations. In emphasizing the connection between the breaching of duties and the incurring of penalties, the officials need not be moti- vated by a desire to establish that their rulings are fair. They may simply want to sustain people’s incentives for conformity to the law’s evil de- mands. After all, if the imposition of punishments is seen as bearing very little relation to the legal culpability or innocence of each person—in other words, if there is a widespread perception that sanctions are often levied against people who have behaved as the law requires, or if there is a widespread perception that sanctions are frequently not levied against people who have failed to fulfill the law’s demands—then the inclina- tion of the law’s addressees to abide by its requirements will dwindle. If people presume that they will often undergo penalties notwithstand- ing the lawfulness of their conduct, or if they presume that they will often escape penalties notwithstanding the un lawfulness of their con- duct, then a crucial motivation for their adherence to the terms of wicked laws will have been undercut. Thus, faced with the task of provid- 15. Postema, ‘‘Law’s Autonomy and Public Practical Reason,’’ p. 84 (footnotes omitted). </page> <page sequence="15"> Kramer Requirements, Reasons, and Raz 389 ing strong inducements for people to behave in accordance with the pre- vailing legal norms, the officials who administer those norms in a ma- levolent regime are well advised to explain their decisions by reference to citizens’ legal duties. Highlighting the correlation between nonfulfill- ment-of-duty and subjection-to-punishment is the means of promoting a pattern of incentives that will secure the efficacious functioning of a scheme of imperatives. Hence, even if we allow that publicly accessible explanations of offi- cial decisions are an integral feature of anything that counts as a full- fledged legal system, we should recognize that the explanations need not be presented as moral justifications. Both the actual purpose and the avowed purpose of the explanations can consist in the reinforcement of incentives for submission to evil dictates—rather than in the ascription of fairness to the decisions that apply those dictates. Of course, even within a monstrous legal regime, there is nothing inevitable about an eschewal of moral justifications; the people who run such a regime may well attempt to clothe their decisions in the garb of fairness, even while they also endeavor in a sterner fashion to foster appropriate motivations for compliance with their commands (along the lines described in my last paragraph). Slim is the likelihood, indeed, that every official will in- variably forgo the ideological advantages of moral justifications. Much more likely is that at least some officials will explain at least some of their decisions in ways that serve to engender an appearance of fairness. Nevertheless, the pursuit of such an appearance is a matter of political shrewdness rather than of conceptual necessity. Nothing rules out the mode of official explanation that was sketched in my last paragraph— that is, official explanation as the stark reinforcement of incentives for law-abiding behavior, with no pretensions to moral worthiness. Officials certainly can opt to account for their decisions in that nonjustificatory spirit, and at least some officials in wicked legal systems very likely do account for many of their decisions in such a manner. At any rate, whether or not the official statements of legal obligations in monstrous regimes are frequently marked by an absence of moral pretensions (and by an unembellished focus on the shoring up of proper incentives for citizens to obey the law), the very fact that those statements can quite intelligibly be free of such pretensions is sufficient to dispel the notion that officials who explain their judgments through references to legal duties are perforce thereby announcing moral duties. Instead of implic- itly or expressly characterizing legal norms as moral prescriptions, offi- cials can be striving to ensure the efficacy of such norms as imperatives.16 16. Correctly observing that Hart’s jurisprudential method consists in elaborating the central or standard case of a legal system, Jeffrey Goldsworthy has maintained that ‘‘a small ruling caste oppressing, with no claim of right, a larger helot caste, is a borderline case [of a legal system].’’ He accordingly asserts that anyone who portrays the claim-to-moral- </page> <page sequence="16"> 390 Ethics January 1999 C. Raw Evil and Legal Evil My response to the argument about moral justification may seem to run aground on another line of argument which Raz has advanced. Like many other jurisprudential theorists,17 he has suggested that a denial of the ineluctably moral tenor of legal discourse is tantamount to a denial of the distinction between law and the brute coercion of gangsters. This suggestion surfaces recurrently in his writings, though we shall look at only two passages. In The Authority of Law, Raz proclaims, ‘‘The law— unlike the threats of the highwayman—claims to itself legitimacy. The law presents itself as justified and demands not only the obedience but the allegiance of its subjects.’’ A similar declaration occurs in Ethics in the Public Domain: ‘‘By normal usage mere de facto authorities, authorities authority as an inessential feature of law has thereby ‘‘mistake[n] one of Hart’s secondary interests (the classification of borderline cases) for his primary interest in elucidating the inter-relationships between law, coercion and morality in the central case. To focus on very unusual and extreme borderline cases in analysing those inter-relationships must lead to distortion’’ (Goldsworthy, ‘‘Self-Destruction,’’ p. 459). This argument misconstrues the upshot of Hart’s method. Hart characterized the central or standard case of a legal sys- tem as an institutional structure consisting in a combination of primary and secondary norms (including norms of recognition, change, adjudication, and punishment). Border- line cases—such as international law or the law of primitive tribal communities—are soci- etal or intersocietal arrangements which exhibit some but not all of the attributes of the central case. At no point did Hart suggest that a claim-to-moral-authority is an integral fea- ture of the central case of a legal system. On the contrary, while certainly accepting that any standard legal regime involves authoritativeness, he did not submit that such a regimemust present itself as morally authoritative. Hence, a regime which does not so present itself but which does consist in a full-fledged combination of primary and secondary norms will not be a borderline case at all within Hart’s model; instead, it will be one instance of the central case. For the jurisprudential positivist, a regime of the sort which I have described is clearly a legal system, notwithstanding that it is equally clearly a wicked legal system. Pertinent here is Hart’s rejection of John Finnis’s insistence on treating moral commitment as an integral element in the central or focal case of the internal perspective of officials. See Hart, Essays in Jurisprudence, pp. 11–12. (For Finnis’s view, see his Natural Law and Natural Rights [Ox- ford: Clarendon, 1980], pp. 13–16, 234–37, and ‘‘Comment,’’ in Gavison, ed., pp. 62–75, pp. 67–69.) Though Hart did not explicitly extend his remarks to deal with claims-to-moral- authoritativeness along with moral commitment itself, such an extension is very much in keeping with the tenor of his riposte. 17. See, e.g., Robert Alexy, ‘‘On Necessary Relations between Law and Morality,’’Ra- tio Juris 2 (1989): 167–83, pp. 176–77; Marmor, p. 114; E.

When focused on moral authority rather than only on a claim thereto, this position goes back to Cicero and Augustine. </page> <page sequence="17"> Kramer Requirements, Reasons, and Raz 391 who rule over their subjects but do not have a right to rule, are included among authorities. Many have seen this as proof that an authority cannot be distinguished from a gunman by reference to a right to rule, for both may lack it. This is a non sequitur. While both may lack it, de facto au- thorities are characterized by their claim to have it. . . . It is the claim of legitimacy that is a condition of the possession of de facto authority.’’ 18 In these passages and in other similar statements, to be sure, Raz has carefully avoided conflating the claim-to-moral-authority with moral au- thority itself. He acknowledges and indeed emphasizes the potential for a gap between what is professed and what is actual. Nonetheless, he has erred in repeatedly insisting that an evil legal regime must claim to be morally authoritative if it is to qualify as a legal regime at all (by dint of being distinguishable from the nakedly coercive sway of a gunman). A claim-to-moral-authoritativeness is extrinsic, for the decisive difference between law and raw coercion lies not in any such claim but in the sway of norms. Whereas the ascendance of a gunman over his victims typically involves situation-specific orders rather than any general decrees or stan- dards, a regime of law must involve the reign and application of general norms if it is to be properly classifiable as a regime of law. To explore this thesis further, we should first glancingly note the distinction between the interaction of officials among themselves and the interaction of officials with ordinary citizens. Within a legal system, the first sort of interaction unavoidably includes ‘‘ought’’ judgments.19 When officials address one another in the course of assessing and coor- dinating their respective decisions, they inevitably issue prescriptions (sometimes in combination with imperatives, handed down from a re- gime’s upper echelons to its lower echelons). However, even when the prescriptions are delivered as reproaches, they are not necessarily moral in their tenor. That is, any criticisms and exhortations addressed by offi- cials to one another can be explicitly based on the interests of the offi- cials to whom the criticisms and exhortations are directed—as well as on the interests of the officials from whom the criticisms and exhortations emanate. In other words, the tenor of the normative interaction among officials can be starkly prudential rather than moral. I shall not develop or substantiate this point here, in part because I have argued for it at 18. Raz, The Authority of Law, p. 158, and Ethics in the Public Domain, p. 341, n. 2. For some similar statements by Raz, see The Authority of Law, p. 9, The Morality of Freedom, p. 26, and Ethics in the Public Domain, pp. 203, 221. 19. Even within the ‘‘perfect tyranny’’ brilliantly expounded by Gregory Kavka (in his Hobbesian Moral and Political Theory [Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1986], pp. 254–66), prescriptions will inevitably be issued by officials to one another—from the bottom up, or among officials of equal status, or sometimes even from the top down. (I should observe, incidentally, that Raz several times commits a misstep that has been ex- posed as such by Kavka’s discussion of perfect tyranny. See, e.g., Raz, ‘‘The Morality of Obe- dience,’’ pp. 736–37, andThe Authority of Law, pp. 28–29, 158.) </page> <page sequence="18"> 392 Ethics January 1999 length elsewhere,20 and in part because my focus in this article lies on the interaction between officials and ordinary citizens. Very different from the interaction of officials among themselves is the interaction between officials and citizens. Intercourse of the former kind, as has just been remarked, inevitably includes prescriptions (al- though the prescriptions can be mixed with imperatives and can be strictly prudential). By contrast, the relationship between officials and citizens can be one of stark imperatives and obedience. Both the prevail- ing legal norms and the applications of those norms can lay down re- quirements that are neither morally obligatory nor in the interests of the norms’ addressees. In such circumstances, the only reason for each citi- zen to comply with the norms is a fear of punishment; the norms in themselves, considered apart from the sanctions attached to them, do not present people with any reasons for compliance. How, then, does a wicked regime that issues stark imperatives to citi- zens differ from a gunman who issues orders to his victims? Like the gunman, after all, the officials in such a regime make demands that are solely in their own interests. As has already been suggested, the key dif- ference pertains to the means by which the demands are articulated and imposed. Whereas a gunman almost always issues his orders to a highly limited set of people for a highly limited stretch of time, a system of gov- ernance that counts as a full-fledged legal regime will have imposed its requirements through various sorts of norms (statutes, regulations, gen- eral decrees, judicial principles, etc.) that typically apply to indefinitely numerous people for long periods of time. Those norms together usually cover a far, far wider range of behavior than a gunman’s instructions. Legal norms are nearly always designed to steer the behavior of citi- zens along certain paths, and they serve as the touchstones for specific decisions by officials concerning alleged violations of the norms’ require- ments. To be sure, a gunman also seeks to direct the behavior of his vic- tims, and he probably tends to base his treatment of them on their con- 20. See the postscript of Matthew Kramer, ‘‘Scrupulousness without Scruples: A Critique of Lon Fuller and His Defenders,’’ Oxford Journal of Legal Studies 18 (1998): 235– 63. For some failures to recognize this point, see Raz, ‘‘Intention in Interpretation,’’ p. 261, and Ethics in the Public Domain, p. 207; Goldsworthy, ‘‘Self-Destruction,’’ p. 458; Neil MacCormick, ‘‘Natural Law and the Separation of Law and Morals,’’ inNatural Law Theory, ed. Robert George (Oxford: Clarendon, 1992), pp. 105–33, p. 114; Gerald Postema, ‘‘Co- ordination and Convention at the Foundations of Law,’’ Journal of Legal Studies 11 (1982): 165–203, pp. 197–200, and ‘‘Normativity,’’ pp. 97–98, 99; Philip Soper, ‘‘Law’s Normative Claims,’’ in George, ed., The Autonomy of Law, pp. 215–47, pp. 218–20. (This point is over- looked even in Jules Coleman, ‘‘On the Relationship between Law andMorality,’’Ratio Juris 2 [1989]: 66–78, pp. 71–72. Coleman denies that the normative interaction amongofficials necessarily involves duties of critical morality, but he presumes that it does perforce involve duties of conventional morality.) The importance of the prudence/morality distinction tends to be submerged by Raz when he defines ‘‘morality’’ so broadly as ‘‘to include binding normative considerations of any kind’’ (Ethics in the Public Domain, p. 254). </page> <page sequence="19"> Kramer Requirements, Reasons, and Raz 393 formance or nonconformance with his behests. But (as has just been mentioned) the gunman’s direction of his victims’ behavior is typically much more limited in its scope and much less systematic or regularized in its occurrence. The dictates uttered during a heist by a gunman are narrowly focused on certain specific instances of conduct to be under- taken by a small group of people who are temporarily in proximity with him; moreover, those dictates are hardly ever intended to be applicable to the victims after the brief period during which the heist is carried out. Laws, by contrast, extend to general classes of people and to general modes of conduct, and they typically last for long periods (often for in- definitely long periods). All or most laws have the general applicability and standing durability of norms. A gunman’s instructions, contrariwise, are almost always occasion specific through and through, and are thus devoid of some of the indispensable qualities—the generality and the durability—of norms. Furthermore, because the formulation and implementation of the gunman’s orders are far less systematic than the formulation and imple- mentation of legal norms, the likelihood of a close correspondence be- tween the stage of formulation and the stage of implementation is con- siderably greater in a legal system than in a heist. Unless a gunman intends to prey on future victims who will probably recognize him and who will know about his treatment of his current victims, he may well elect to shoot his current victims despite their having submitted to his bidding and despite his having suggested that he would let them go in the event of such submission. Ex hypothesi, he does not have to worry about impairing the incentives for his future victims to submit. A legal regime, even a monstrous legal regime, is quite different. As we earlier observed, officials have to be concerned about the effects of their cur- rent actions on the motivations of people in the future. If a legal system is known to depart frequently from the terms of its own norms by punish- ing lawful conduct or by conniving at unlawfulness, then citizens’ incen- tives for compliance with the norms will greatly diminish. Hence, given that wicked rulers will doubtless want their malevolent laws to operate effectively, they will have good grounds for insisting that the laws be en- forced in accordance with the terms thereof. A policy of strict enforce- ment is what best sustains incentives for obedience. Thus, law’s continu- ousness helps to ensure its regularity—which means that one distinctive feature of law (i.e., one feature that differentiates legal norms from a gunman’s commands) helps to ensure the existence of another indis- pensable feature. Of course, an organized-crime syndicate such as the Mafia might well exert control over most aspects of life in a certain region, with dic- tates that are just as broadly applicable and lasting as the mandates of a veritable legal system. Moreover, for reasons similar to those recounted in the last paragraph, the Mafia’s enforcers could seek to shore up </page> <page sequence="20"> 394 Ethics January 1999 incentives for obedience by giving effect to their organization’s decrees in ways that adhere closely to the decrees’ terms. Suppose that such an organized-crime regime—characterized by generality, durability, and regularity—does in fact prevail in some region alongside a more benign system of governance. Are we forced to conclude that the gangsters are legal officials who formulate and implement laws? And are we therefore forced to conclude that two conflicting legal systems reign over a single portion of territory? This article is not the place for a long discussion of the degree of efficacy that must be achieved by a scheme of governance before it is properly classifiable as the legal system that obtains in a particular area. Suffice it to say that the relatively benign regime mentioned in my last paragraph (henceforth labeled as ‘regime R’) must enjoy very little ef- ficacy in the region where the organized-crime syndicate has attained wide-ranging control over people’s lives. What is of crucial importance here is not whether the syndicate should be designated as a legal re- gime—a question that would oblige us to ponder the matter of effi- cacy—but whether such a designation should be withheld simply be- cause the syndicate does not lay claim to moral worthiness. As this article has contended, a claim to moral legitimacy or authoritativeness is not a decisive factor; instead, the key factors are the generality and durability of the Mafia’s norms, and the institutional regularity of the application of those norms.21 If the Mafia’s system of exerting far-reaching control does indeed very substantially partake of the key qualities just listed, and if it also meets some relevant test for efficacy (whatever that test might be), then it ought to be classified as a legal system. Or, at any rate, the appropriateness of such a classification should not be denied merely be- cause the Mafia’s officials make no pretensions to moral admirability. In other words, we should view the respective positions of regimeR and the Mafia in much the same way that we would view the positions of compet- ing factions within a country where a unified legal system has disinte- grated (perhaps Yugoslavia or Somalia during the early 1990s, for in- stance). If each faction establishes its wide-ranging ascendance in its own regions via a matrix of norms that exhibits the indispensable character- 21. These factors are three of Lon Fuller’s eight main conditions for the existence of a legal system. See Lon Fuller, The Morality of Law, 2d ed. (New Haven, Conn.: Yale Univer- sity Press, 1969), chap. 2. The other five of Fuller’s conditions would typically be satisfied even by a gunman’s situation-specific orders. Also relevant, naturally, is the breadth of the range of issues to which the Mafia’s norms pertain. Unless those norms encompass most aspects of human life, they do not together constitute a full-blown legal system. Here and elsewhere, of course, I am not suggesting that a full-blown legal systemmust closelymonitor and minutely regulate all or most spheres of human interaction. The comprehensive or nearly comprehensive reach of such a system can consist in the sort of regulatory control established by a laissez-faire regime that secures the workings of free markets through the elaboration and implementation of private-law norms. On the importance of such regula- tory control, see Kramer, In the Realm of Legal and Moral Philosophy, chap. 7. </page> <page sequence="21"> Kramer Requirements, Reasons, and Raz 395 istics of generality, durability, and regularity, then the question whether one or another faction operates the legal system in some particular area is largely or entirely a question about the efficacy of the faction’s sway therein. The absence of a claim to moral authority or legitimacy by the functionaries on either side is not determinative. Though the notion of an organized-crime syndicate as a legal re- gime may initially seem outlandish, the strangeness of the notion derives chiefly from the unlikelihood that such a syndicate will indeed establish a system of social control that exhibits the essential features of law. Gang- sters do not usually rule over virtually all aspects of social and individual life in a given region; and, even if they domanage to gain comprehensive control, they are likely to retain such power for too brief a period to develop a full-blown legal regime with its formal and institutional char- acteristics. Gangsters qua gangsters are in violation of the laws of an ex- istent legal system and are therefore bound to face considerable difficul- ties if they try to establish a legal system of their own that holds sway over numerous people other than the gangsters themselves. However, in the event that those difficulties are overcome by a criminal syndicate that exerts a comprehensive reign over the populace of some territory via norms that are general and durable and regularly applied, the evil reign of the syndicate should be designated as a legal regime irrespective of its being accompanied or unaccompanied by a claim-to-moral-worthiness. (Note, incidentally, that even when gangsters do not rule over the public at large, they might well institute a system of norms to regulate the sun- dry relations and interactions among themselves. Their intragroup ma- trix of norms might well partake of the sweepingness, generality, dura- bility, and regularity that are the hallmarks of law. Still, the question whether such a scheme of regulation should be classified as a legal sys- tem is not a question which I alone have to face. After all, the scheme of regulation internal to a criminal syndicate—as opposed to the scheme of regulation imposed by the syndicate on others—might quite predict- ably involve claims to moral legitimacy, at least in some instances.) Now, readers of H. L. A. Hart’s work will have recognized the quali- ties that have been singled out here as distinctive of legal systems. When reconstructing (and then criticizing) John Austin’s theory of law, Hart readily acknowledged that Austin’s model of the legal sovereign as a gunman-writ-large did not overlook all the differences between legal norms and a gunman’s dictates.22 Austin fully grasped that legal norms are general, in that they apply to general classes of persons and pertain to general types of conduct. He also was well aware that legal norms have a lasting or durable force, which differentiates them from the ephemer- ally operative orders of a gunman. He furthermore highlighted the im- portance of regularity in the application of the law, by which he meant 22. See H. L. A. Hart,The Concept of Law (Oxford: Clarendon, 1961), pp. 20–25. </page> <page sequence="22"> 396 Ethics January 1999 specifically the likelihood that sanctions would be inflicted in response to violations of the law’s commands. Austin’s views on the supremacy and independence of the legal sovereign, moreover, are very roughly akin to my thesis that the regulatory sway of a full-fledged legal system must en- compass most aspects of life (even if that regulatory sway is not actively exercised in regard to some aspects). In these significant respects, the analysis in the present section of this article resembles Austin’s approach to law. Does a response to Raz, then, necessitate a return to Austin—and a return to the many shortcomings in Austin’s jurisprudence? Quite plainly, there are some Austinian elements in my attempt to distinguish wicked legal systems from naked coercion. But the discussion here has in fact remained as warily distant from Austin’s account as did Hart himself. Not much has been said here about the nature of the legal sovereign, and certainly nothing has been said that would constitute an endorsement of Austin’s portrayal of the sovereign. Even more impor- tant, I have introduced a few key caveats in order to disown some of Austin’s worst missteps. For example, a warning near the outset of this article stressed that my focus on duty-imposing norms throughout is not to be taken as an indication that other sorts of norms—norms which confer liberties, powers, or immunities—are unimportant or derivative. My concentration on one type of norm simply reflects the fact that my target in this article is a conception of legal obligations (or of statements asserting legal obligations). Unlike Austin, the discussion here does not presume that the realm of law is exhausted by the norms which impose such obligations. Similarly, Austin’s own conception of obligations has certainly not received approval in this article. When a theory defines ‘legal obligation’ by reference to the likelihood of one’s undergoing punishment for a fail- ure to abide by the obligation, the account becomes susceptible to all the objections posed by Hart against Bentham and Austin.23 By contrast, my conception of obligations as requirements imposed by legal norms—re- quirements which may be imperative or prescriptive in their tenor—is Hartian rather than Austinian. Time and again, indeed, this article has emphasized that it is inquiring into the nature of obligations in isolation from the penalties that are appurtenant to them. To exist as a functional regime of law, a legal system has to give ef- fect to a large proportion of its norms on most relevant occasions; but virtually any such system will include some norms that are not very of- ten enforced when violated. Whereas an Austinian theorist must submit that no legal obligations are imposed by norms that are seldom imple- mented, my approach to this matter enables us to see that those norms do indeed impose such obligations (albeit largely ignored obligations). Like the legal obligations that are regularly given effect, the obligations 23.

Those precepts can abide as such, regardless of the extent to which they are implemented. Hence—given my conception of legal ob- ligations—even a regime of stark imperatives will always leave open the potential for divergences between being obliged to do f and having a legal obligation to do f. A complete failure to acknowledge any such divergences is one of the trademarks of Austinianism. What is equally significant, this article has explicitly (albeit briefly) taken into account the foremost variety of discourse which Austin ne- glected—the prescriptive discourse of officials who are addressing one another. Like Hobbes, Austin too often wrote about legal/governmental institutions as if each overall matrix of such institutions were a monolith. An anthropomorphic view of a legal system as an overarching person is bound to obscure the vital role of discussional and argumentative ex- changes among the people who operate the system. Hart’s comments on jurisprudential personifications of legal systems are highly pertinent: ‘‘We can push out of sight the whole official side to law and forgo the description of the use of rules made in legislation and adjudication, and instead, think of the whole official world as one person (the ‘sovereign’) issuing orders, through various agents or mouthpieces, which are habitu- ally obeyed by the citizen. But this is either no more than a convenient shorthand for complex facts which still await description, or a disas- trously confusing piece of mythology.’’ 24 In the present section of this article, the distinction between statements addressed by officials to one another and statements addressed by officials to citizens is crucial. As has been contended, that distinction marks the divide between a domain in which prescriptive statements are inevitable and a domain in which offi- cials’ directives can be pure imperatives. By collapsing the former do- main into the latter, and by neglecting to explore the character of offi- cials’ interchanges with one another, Austin did indeed largely obfuscate the immensely important role of prescriptive assertions in the applica- tion of legal norms by officials. This article has not committed a similar mistake. A final point of distinction between my approach and that of Aus- tin is closely related to what has just been said. For Austin, legal sover- eignty and thus legal authority consisted in laying down orders backed by threats of overwhelming force, in being habitually obeyed, and in ha- bitually obeying no one. The conception of authority operative in this article is much more complicated, for it eschews the disastrously con- fusing view of the state as a single man writ large. Legal authority is in part the legally recognized power (and liberty) to change or create or effectuate the entitlements which the law confers; and it is in part the legally enforceable right to the obedience of the law’s addressees. My 24. Hart,The Concept of Law, p. 110. </page> <page sequence="24"> 398 Ethics January 1999 description of the general normative power as ‘‘legally recognized’’ is meant to cover two points.25 First, the effects of the power are taken into account by officials when they assess one another’s actions with refer- ence to the prevailing norms. That is, the touchstones which officials invoke for gauging the correctness or incorrectness of their fellow offi- cials’ decisions will adjust in response to appropriate exercises of norm- creating or norm-altering prerogatives, which in turn are ultimately de- pendent on the general authoritative power of the system in which they operate. Second, the effects of the exercising of such prerogatives are likewise taken into account by officials when they pass judgment on the activities and disputes of citizens. Whether the norms on which the officials rely are imperatives or prescriptions (in regard to the citizens whose actions are judged), the applicability of those norms as the rele- vant bases for assessing people’s behavior is determined by the norm- creating and norm-modifying and norm-implementing prerogatives of officials—which, again, are ultimately dependent on the general au- thoritative power of the officials’ regime. When legal authority is so understood (in a manner that departs significantly from Austin), we can safely say that the law does necessarily claim authority in its workings.26 Pace Raz, however, the claim to author- ity is not perforce a claim to moral authority. My account of authority squares perfectly well with a legal system in which the following two con- ditions obtain: (1) the discourse among officials is starkly prudential, in that the criticisms and justifications exchanged by officials in connec- tion with their decisions are based overtly on the need to maintain the smoothly coordinated functioning of a system from which every official derives benefits, and (2) the norms invoked as the relevant standards for judging the conduct of citizens are sheer imperatives, and are invoked only to reinforce incentives-for-compliance rather than to establish the fairness of the decisions that apply the norms. In other words, my ac- count of authority squares perfectly well with a legal system which not only lacks moral worthiness but which makes no pretensions to such wor- thiness. An absence of moral pretensions is of course not a necessary feature of legal systems and is undoubtedly an extremely uncommon fea- ture. But there are no conceptual impediments to the existence of a legal regime that is marked by just such an absence. 25. Whenever I refer to a power in this discussion, I am referring to a normative power—a norm-based capacity to change or introduce or implement norms—rather than to a physical or other nonnormative power. (I should also mention that I have used the term ‘right’ in a morally neutral sense; I employ that term to refer to the legal protection bestowed upon one person by the imposition of a legal duty upon another. Such protection may or may not be morally estimable, in any particular situation.) 26. At the same time, one should not overlook the fact that the law’s demands for conformity with its requirements are of differing degrees of intensity. For an illuminating discussion, see Kent Greenawalt, Conflicts of Law and Morality (Oxford: Clarendon, 1987), chap. 2. </page> <page sequence="25"> Kramer Requirements, Reasons, and Raz 399 A legal system that does indeed lay down substantive norms which are sheer imperatives (and which are presented as such) will still be a fundamentally norm-structured regime. Its sway therefore differs cru- cially from the raw violence of a highwayman with his situation-specific orders. To some extent, the notable dissimilarities between the impera- tive-issuing regime and the highwayman reflect the dissimilarities be- tween an Austinian sovereign and a highwayman; one should not forget that Austin’s model of law included the indispensable features of gener- ality, durability, and—in a somewhat distorted form—regularity. In ad- dition, however, the differences between a legal system that enacts stark imperatives and a gunman who utters his orders are reflective of the dif- ferences between Austin’s conception of law and my own conception. Most of the shortcomings in Austin’s model are due to his insufficient attentiveness to the normativity of law. For example, as has been men- tioned, his theory largely obscures the inevitable and prominent role of prescriptions in the criticisms and exhortations that are addressed by officials to one another. Once these weaknesses of Austin’s jurispru- dence have been removed, the divergences between a wicked legal re- gime (brimming with imperatives) and a gunman become all the more apparent. D. Feeling Good about Oneself Raz has occasionally pursued a different tack in support of his view concerning the moral tenor of statements which assert legal obligations. Here we need to distinguish between two aspects of moral authority: moral legitimacy or propriety and moral bindingness. (The terminol- ogy here is mine, not Raz’s.) A legal norm is morally legitimate insofar as it does not require or authorize conduct that violates anyone’s moral rights. A legal norm is morally binding insofar as its addressees are mor- ally obligated to comply with its requirements or to acquiesce in what it authorizes. If a directive is legitimate, then the formulation and implementa- tion of it do not involve the commission of any moral wrongs. To main- tain that officials have set forth a morally legitimate norm is to maintain that they were morally at liberty to engage in such a course of action. If a directive is binding, then the formulation and implementation of it im- pose obligations on the people who are subject to it. To maintain that officials have set forth a morally binding norm is to maintain that its addressees are not morally at liberty to disregard its demands. Having separated these two aspects of moral authority, we can see that Raz has concerned himself chiefly with the second aspect when pro- pounding his notion of law’s claim-to-authority. Most of the time, his the- sis about law’s moral pretensions is a thesis about the law’s claim to be morally binding. In his view, statements asserting legal obligations are </page> <page sequence="26"> 400 Ethics January 1999 statements which assert or profess to assert moral obligations. Occasion- ally, however, Raz appears to take a different and somewhat milder ap- proach by emphasizing the first aspect of moral authority—the aspect of moral permissibility—rather than the second. This different emphasis is most clearly present (though not indis- putably so) in two quite recent works. In Ethics in the Public Domain, Raz declares: ‘‘I am taking it to be a necessary truth . . . that whatever people do they do because they believe it to be good or valuable, however mis- guided and even reckless their beliefs may be. Given that the courts are manned by people who will act only in ways they perceive to be valuable, principles of adjudication will not be viable, will not be followed by the courts, unless they can reasonably be thought to be morally acceptable, even though the thought may be misguided.’’ 27 In a footnote to the first sentence of this quotation, Raz adds, ‘‘Even akratic actions are under- taken because of the good perceived in them. They are akratic because the agent believes that on balance it is against reason to engage in them, not because they are done for no reason at all.’’ (He does then acknowl- edge that ‘‘the principle is overstated in the text and has to be modified to allow for pathological cases,’’ but he remarks that ‘‘this . . . need not detain us here.’’)28 A similar view surfaces in a recent essay by Raz on legal interpretation. There he contends that, ‘‘barring akrasia, [any deliberate human act] is done in the belief that the act is not against reason.’’ 29 These quoted passages are by no means entirely clear cut. Perhaps Raz is not distinguishing between the permissibility and the bindingness of authoritative decisions, and perhaps he regards his comments in these extracts as encompassing both of those aspects of such decisions. Still, to some extent the extracts do appear to presuppose such a distinction— with a focus on the side of permissibility. If so, then Raz has aligned him- self with Neil MacCormick, who has argued in some of his recent work that ‘‘there would be a pragmatic self-contradiction involved if a legisla- ture enacted a Bill expressly purporting to be for the implementation of unjust discrimination.’’ MacCormick endorses Robert Alexy’s notion that the workings of any legal system must implicitly or explicitly include a ‘‘claim to correctness,’’ and he declares that ‘‘the idea of legislation passed without even a pretension to correctness is a kind of absurdity.’’ 30 Let us proceed by pondering MacCormick’s remarks. 27.

MacCormick, ‘‘Natural Law and the Separation,’’ p. 112. For the whole of Mac- Cormick’s discussion of this matter, see pp. 110–18. For stances similar to his, see Alexy, pp. 177–82; Postema, ‘‘The Normativity of Law,’’ pp. 92–93; Philip Soper, ‘‘Legal Systems, Normative Systems, and the Paradoxes of Positivism,’’ Canadian Journal of Law and Jurispru- dence 8 (1995): 363–76, and ‘‘Law’s Normative Claims.’’ In the chapter from which this </page> <page sequence="27"> Kramer Requirements, Reasons, and Raz 401 His first and somewhat less important error lies in deeming the un- just-discrimination enactment to be pragmatically self-contradictory, as if it were akin to the utterance ‘‘I am not currently saying anything’’ (or ‘‘I am currently speaking a sentence that is not true,’’ which is thor- oughly paradoxical when spoken). Though a legislature’s branding of its own mandates as morally unjust would doubtless be strange and prob- ably imprudent, it would certainly not be incoherent or self-subverting. It would merely amount to the attribution of a moral status—the status of moral unjustness—to a legal enactment. Of course, if ‘unjust’ is taken to refer to legal injustice, and if MacCormick is suggesting that the legis- lature will declare its own mandates to be legally impermissible, then indeed the enactment will be pragmatically self-subverting.31 In that event, however, MacCormick is guilty of an ignoratio elenchi. No one disputes that legislatures implicitly or explicitly deem their own properly passed enactments to be legally permissible; the point at issue, rather, is whether they perforce implicitly or explicitly deem their enactments to be morally permissible. If we construe the term ‘unjust’ by reference to the relevant point of contention, then, MacCormick has gone astray in characterizing the posited enactment as pragmatically self-contradictory. He has committed an even more important error by assuming that people who do not claim to be acting legitimately will thereby necessarily claim to be acting illegitimately. Even if we agree that any genuine legal system is exceedingly unlikely to advance a claim of the latter sort, we are not obliged to accept that such a system must explicitly or implicitly ad- vance a claim of the former sort. Officials in a vile regime may simply display complete indifference to questions about the moral legitimacy or illegitimacy of their actions. Here the analogy between such officials and a group of gunmen is illuminating, despite the imperfections of that analogy in several other respects. The gunmen are exceedingly unlikely to announce, ‘‘We hereby issue a reprehensibly unjust demand article is excerpted, I discuss Soper’s position at some length. For the suggestion that moral permissibility is a necessary condition for legitimate authority (a suggestion with which I fully agree, as my choice of terminology indicates), see, e.g., Greenawalt, pp. 53–54; Rolf Sartorius, ‘‘Positivism and the Foundations of Legal Authority,’’ in Gavison, ed., pp. 43–61, pp. 55–56; M. B. E. Smith, ‘‘Is There a Prima Facie Obligation to Obey the Law?’’ Yale Law Journal 82 (1973): 950–76, pp. 975–76. 31. I am assuming that the members of the legislature view their enactments as legal enactments. An associate editor of Ethics has alerted me to the possibility that people who act as legislators might not see themselves as such and might not see their institution as a law-making body (because they subscribe to a misguided jurisprudential theory). In such circumstances, the legislators would not regard their enactments as legal enactments and would therefore not take for granted the enactments’ legal legitimacy. However, they would still see their operative enactments as partaking of some sort of normativity, and thus they would still take for granted some sort of legitimacy (which, of course, would not necessarily be moral legitimacy). Perhaps, e.g., the legislators would classify their operative norms as ‘‘schmegal’’ norms. In that event, they would presuppose the schmegal legitimacy of those norms. </page> <page sequence="28"> 402 Ethics January 1999 for your money!’’ But the improbability of this self-accusatory asser- tion—whether the assertion be compunctious or openly cynical— should not lead us to infer that the gunmen’s orders explicitly or implic- itly profess to be morally worthy. Instead, the gunmen and their behests will very likely exhibit a thoroughgoing lack of concern with the moral status of their conduct. Suppose that the leader of the gunmen pro- claims, ‘‘Hand over your money now!’’ Such an utterance does not por- tray itself as unjust. Should we therefore conclude that it implicitly por- trays itself as just? To discern in this imperative utterance an implicit moral self-commendation is to attribute to the gunmen a degree of moral alertness which they probably do not possess and certainlyneed not possess. If the immorality of their conduct were pointed out to them by one of their victims, they would very likely not respond by denying the charge. Their response, rather, would be ‘‘So what?!’’ Their dictates to their victims carry (or, at any rate, might well carry) the moral indiffer- ence of the ‘‘so what’’ response, rather than the pretended moral sensi- tivity of an implicit claim-to-legitimacy. Officials in a wicked legal regime may show the same unconcern about even purporting to be morally conscientious. On the one hand, as has already been discussed herein, the officials face some constraints and pressures which gunmen typically do not face. The persistence and regu- larity of the officials’ interaction with citizens are not usually character- istic of a gunman’s interaction with his victims. As a result, the officials may feel a greater need than do gunmen to depict their own actions as morally acceptable. On the other hand, there is no basis for thinking that officials in a monstrous regime will invariably feel a need to commend their actions in such a fashion. Though they are extremely unlikely to label the norms of their regime candidly as flagitious, they may simply exhibit indifference to the moral status of those norms. To be sure, a reticent disdain for the whole question of the morality or immorality of their institutions and decisions is not the only posture which evil officials might adopt; but it is certainly not an outlandish posture, which can never be attributed to them without ludicrousness. Hence, by failing to distinguish adequately between expressing-moral-disapproval and not- expressing-moral-approval, and thus by supposing that the only alterna- tive to an expression of moral disapproval is an expression of moral ap- proval, MacCormick has wrongly concluded that we must ascribe to any official utterance an implicit or explicit seal of moral self-approbation. We should recognize the possibility (a credible possibility) of a contrary state of affairs. A heinous legal system might not involve any claim-to- legitimacy, precisely because the absence of such a claim can be due to contemptuous indifference rather than to an overt disavowal. In sum, an official who freely embraces a normN while cognizant of </page> <page sequence="29"> Kramer Requirements, Reasons, and Raz 403 its immorality may deal with questions of the moral standing of her con- duct by contemptuously ignoring them. Instead of either falsely affirm- ing her moral endorsement of N or truthfully denying such an endorse- ment, the official may brush aside any discussion of the moral status of the norm which she has embraced. A curtly dismissive wave of the hand, rather than a negative shake of the head, may be the gesture which the official deems to be most suitable. (Of course, in a liberal democracy where officials are required to justify their decisions publicly, a brusquely dismissive wave of the hand will not suffice. An official who is aware of the injustice of her decision will very likely have to resort to mendacious affirmations of its justness. But my focus throughout this article is on monstrously illiberal regimes, rather than on liberal-democratic states. Indeed, one way of encapsulating the basic theme of my arguments herein is as follows: the benevolent features that characterize liberal- democratic legal systems are not present in all legal systems, and should therefore not be designated as essential for the existence and function- ing of law.) Thus, even if MacCormick were correct in thinking that a legisla- tive bill’s proclamation of its own injustice would be pragmatically self- contradictory, he would not have shown that every such bill must rest on a tacit or express affirmation of its own justness. Some legislative enact- ments might be endowed with that sort of affirmation implicitly or ex- plicitly, but other such enactments might embody a frosty indifference toward the matter of their own legitimacy or illegitimacy. We cannot presume that a lack of moral self-denunciation amounts to moral self- approbation. Evil officials in a vile regime who decline to avow the wick- edness of their measures have not thereby logically committed them- selves to the view that those measures are morally worthy. Their silence on the topic can be the silence of utter unconcern, rather than the si- lence of a feigned or sincere conviction of moral correctness. E. A Concluding Rebuttal: Attention to Specificity One other argument by Raz emerges most clearly in the course of his rejoinder to Hart. The key passage, quite concessionary in tone, is as follows: ‘‘It is possible that while judges believe that legal obligations are morally binding this is not what they say when they assert the validity of obligations according to law. It may be that all they state is that certain relations exist between certain people and certain legal sources or laws. Their belief that those relations give rise to a (moral) obligation may be quite separate and may not be part of what they actually say when assert- ing obligations according to the law. But such an interpretation seems contrived and artificial.’’ 32 As I have argued throughout this article, 32. Raz, ‘‘Hart on Moral Rights and Legal Duties,’’ p. 131. </page> <page sequence="30"> 404 Ethics January 1999 judges do not necessarily believe or purport to believe that legal obliga- tions are morally binding. Nonetheless, let us look closely at Raz’s re- marks and consider them in connection with benevolent regimes (or other regimes) wherein the officials do regard legal duties as morally obligatory. Raz appears correct in submitting that the benevolent officials’ statements of legal duties cannot typically be disentangled from their credence in the moral bindingness of the duties. When a judge an- nounces that someone is obligated to comply with a legal mandate, and when the judge views the mandate as morally obligatory for any people to whom it applies, he very likely does not see himself as making a state- ment about a purely legal requirement—a requirement that might or might not partake of moral significance. Rather, the judge presumes to be making a statement about a requirement which is morally binding and which derives its moral weight partly or wholly from its status as a legal duty. A legal obligation considered apart from its moral obligatori- ness will very likely not play a role in the judge’s reasoning or pronounce- ments. Yet, given that any efforts in these circumstances to separate the judge’s claim about the legally binding force of a duty from his claim about the morally binding force thereof are apt to be artificial and con- trived, a friendlier attitude toward Raz’s conception of legal duties may seem warranted. After all, Raz has firmly maintained that a judge’s view of the legal obligatoriness of a requirement cannot be asserted without a tacit or explicit assertion of the requirement’s moral obligatoriness. Since Raz’s position is borne out by the situation described in the present paragraph, we should perhaps wonder whether his stance is sound in a wide array of other contexts as well. To dispel any impression that Raz’s position is sweepingly applicable to all official statements of legal obligations, this discussion should dis- tinguish between law in general and specific systems of law. Such a dis- tinction brings with it a further distinction between statements about law generally and statements about the law in some particular system.33 When a judge or any other official asserts the existence of a legal duty, he is not typically presupposing anything about the moral status of legal duties generally; instead, he is presupposing something about the moral status of the duties in his particular system. If he regards or pretends to 33. This distinction is repeatedly drawn in Soper, ‘‘Legal Systems, Normative Sys- tems,’’ and in ‘‘Law’s Normative Claims.’’ However, my own discussion departs significantly from Soper’s analyses, which presume that every legal system is indeed characterized by a claim-to-moral-authoritativeness. Soper contends merely that such a claim typically arises from officials’ focusing on the substance of their own regime rather than from their focus- ing on the nature of law generally. Though such a contention is unexceptionable as far as it goes, it leaves in place the key tenet of Raz’s position: the notion that a claim-to-moral- authoritativeness is indeed an integral element of every legal system. </page> <page sequence="31"> Kramer Requirements, Reasons, and Raz 405 regard a duty in that system as morally binding (perhaps because of the content or significance of the duty itself, or perhaps because of the duty’s place in a legal regime which the judge deems to be morally binding as a whole), then his invocation of the duty is the expression of a moral judgment as well as a legal judgment. But the inextricability of the moral judgment and the legal judgment in such a situation does not obtain when we move to legal settings in which judges do not believe or pretend to believe that the obligations which they enforce are morally worthy. (That exactly such settings are possible is, of course, what this whole ar- ticle has sought to demonstrate.) When a judge implicitly or expressly engages in moral censure of someone for failing to abide by a legal obligation, he is not usually put- ting forward a jurisprudential thesis about the nature of legal obligations generally. Rather, he is usually putting forward a much narrower thesis. He may be setting forth a claim about the particular obligation to which he is giving effect, or he may be making a wider claim about the moral tenor of all the obligations that are imposed by the particular legal sys- tem within which he works. Still more broadly, he may be taking a view about the moral bindingness of duties imposed by legal regimes of a cer- tain type (e.g., liberal democratic regimes, where citizens directly or in- directly participate in the creation of laws). Only rarely will a judge have ascended to a jurisprudential level of abstraction, where his upbraiding of someone for a breach of duty is based on a thesis about the general nature of law and legal duties. Such a level of abstraction is hardly ever necessary. Moreover, it is rarely apposite—since a judge ordinarily has little aptitude for philosophical speculation far above a duty-specific or system-specific level. A judge typically trains his scrutiny not on law, but on the law. Hence, quite understandable is the inseparability of the affirmative legal assessment and the affirmative moral assessment that are involved in an official’s application of a perceivedly benevolent legal obligation. That inseparability reflects the following two facts: the obligation being applied or the legal system establishing the obligation is regarded (sin- cerely or insincerely) as morally worthy; and the official who applies the obligation does so with a focus on its specific substance or on the specific substance of the regime imposing it, rather than with a focus on the ab- stract character of the obligation as an instance of legal obligations gen- erally. In other words, given that the official who treats a legal duty D as a moral requirement has taken that stance because he esteemsD as mor- ally binding in itself or because he esteems the moral worthiness of the system in which D has a place, he does not take into account D’s legal status without taking into account its moral status. Because his focus lies on the specific tenor of a requirement or regime which he regards as morally admirable, he does not separate the matter of legal bindingness </page> <page sequence="32"> 406 Ethics January 1999 from the matter of moral bindingness. From his perspective of moral commitment, those two matters are indivisible—at the concrete level with which he is concerned. Of course, nothing debars a morally committed judge from ascend- ing to a jurisprudential level of abstraction at which he can grasp that the matters of legal bindingness and moral bindingness are distinct even within his own regime. But Raz is undoubtedly correct in thinking that judges do not usually pursue such a level of abstraction. To analyze legal reasoning in a way that depicts the typical judge as a sophisticated juris- prudential thinker would indeed be artificial and contrived. Much more troubling for Raz, however, is a quite different way in which an affirma- tion of legal bindingness and an affirmation of moral bindingness can become disjoinable. Instead of positing a credulity-straining regime of philosopher-judges who draw fine jurisprudential distinctions, we should think about a much more credible situation in which the officials who operate a monstrous legal regime do not affirm or pretend to affirm the moral bindingness of the requirements that are imposed by their norms. (Again, the quite credible possibility of such a situation is exactly what this article has endeavored to show.) To be sure, nomore than a judge who believes or purports to believe in the moral obligatoriness of the legal duties which he enforces, will the officials in a wicked regime be likely to focus on the general nature of law rather than on the specific substance of the law in their own system. We certainly have no grounds for thinking that evil judges will be more adept philosophers of law than benevolent judges. But, when the officials in a wicked legal system disjoin legal obligatoriness from moral obliga- toriness, they do so not by abstracting from the substance of their regime but precisely by remaining focused on that substance. They do not be- lieve that their norms are morally binding, and they need not profess to believe as much. Though they very likely do not go so far as to proclaim the immorality of the norms which they enforce, they may well exhibit arrant indifference toward questions about the moral status of those norms (by leaving such questions unaddressed). When these officials in- voke the vile norms of their system to explain their decisions, they do so—or may often do so—exclusively in order to reinforce incentives-for- compliance, rather than to justify the decisions as fair. Hence, evil offi- cials in these circumstances make statements of legal obligations without committing themselves implicitly or explicitly to the notion that the legal obligations are moral obligations. Because they concentrate on the spe- cific legal requirements of their regime while carrying out their respon- sibilities, and because they do not purport to look upon those require- ments as morally legitimate or binding, their assertions of the legal force of those requirements do not carry any implications about the moral force thereof. </page> <page sequence="33"> Kramer Requirements, Reasons, and Raz 407 In short, the argument by Raz in the passage most recently quoted above would be troubling only if he had established the truth of its initial premise—the premise that legal officials must hold or profess to hold the belief that the legal requirements which they invoke and enforce are morally binding. However, because this article has exposed the unsus- tainability of that premise, Raz’s argument is at best a demonstration of a point that applies only when the officials do indeed harbor or profess to harbor the aforementioned belief. At most, that is, the argument shows that officials who believe or claim to believe in the moral authori- tativeness of their legal system’s duties do not distinguish between legal obligatoriness and moral obligatoriness when they give effect to those duties. Such a conclusion, plainly, does not extend to situations in which officials neither affirm nor purport to affirm the moral authoritativeness of their system’s requirements. A line of reasoning applicable to benevo- lent or ostensibly benevolent legal regimes is not applicable to legal re- gimes that are undisguisedly wicked. In other words, the comments by Raz examined in this section are ineffective for their purpose unless his foregoing arguments have managed to prove that officials’ statements of legal obligations are perforce statements of moral obligations. The bur- den of this article has been to reveal that any such view of officials’ state- ments is untenable. </page> </plain_text>
