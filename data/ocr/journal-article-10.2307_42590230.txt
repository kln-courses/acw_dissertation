This result was inevitable because in general (a) "express" was seldom defined lucidly or adequately, (b) "emotion" was not clearly defined or analyzed, (c) no theory of emotion was presented or argued for, and (d) theories and definitions of meaning relevant to expression were not presented and analyzed. This paper is an attempt to define "express" and provide a sound theory of emotion upon which an adequate analysis of "express" can be</page><page sequence="2">22 The Meaning of Express in Aesthetics given. Not only emotion, but meaning, is said to be expressed. This re- quires a theory of meaning, which is therefore provided. It will in this regard be argued that music and the various arts can have and express meaning. It will also be shown how they can make assertions. Thus, the controversy regarding art as expression will be placed on a firm foundation for resolution. The situation is not hopeless as Harold Osborne will be seen to believe. In addition, Benedetto Croce's view of "intuition as expression" will be briefly analyzed in terms of the above clarifications. Introduction The expression theory of art is as controversial now as it has ever been. Osborne, President of the British Society of Aesthetics, advised abandoning the problem of emotional expressiveness in the arts: "Prob- lems that have no solution are problems to be repudiated."4 The linguists, David Crystal and R. Quirk spoke of "the absence of any definition of 'expressiveness.'"5 The descriptions used in aesthetics show the need for the clarification of emotion. For example, Forest Hansen points out the ambiguity of the psychological correlates of tonal tensions used in Ferguson's Music as Metaphor which are as follows: an image of experi- ence, a mingling of thought and feeling, emotions, a valuation of experi- ence, the characteristic tone of an emotion, a feeling, a mental state, elemental tensions, the subjective fact of feeling, spiritual states, etc.6 The result is ambiguity and confusion. One reason for this is that it has not been clear what an emotion is. Is it a feeling, cognition, product of the imagination, synthesis of feelings or emotions, or some fusion of these? Such confusion is illustrated by the following statement. Derek Matravers wrote, "One of the most intrac- table problems in aesthetics: that of specifying the relation between art and the feelings and emotions thus ascribed to them."7 The cognitive theory of emotion has helped to clarify that issue.8 There still remains the lack of clarity about what "express" means. R. Allen, for example, recent- ly argued that "express" as "arousal" really means three different things: (a) evoke, (b) communicate, and (c) provoke.9 He alternately refers to "express" as: to suggest, cause, embody, etc. But "express" means much more than that, and how it means that is still in question. Such equivo- cation undermines any analysis of art as the expression of emotion. Art is said to express meaning as well as emotion. To understand this statement, a theory of meaning and of emotion is required. Stephen Davies wrote, "Neither what it is that music means, nor the way in which music bears its meaning is readily apparent."10 Roger Scruton wrote,</page><page sequence="3">Shibles 23 "There are kinds of meaning which cannot be explained by normal se- mantic theories.,,n And his statement, "The meaning of a piece of music is what you understand when you understand it/'12 is circular. A. Meaning The traditional and commonly accepted view is that words stand for ideas, and this is called "meaning." Ideas are allegedly expressed (Latin: "press out") into words. Ludwig Wittgenstein, especially, has made it clear that ideas are pseudo-psychological entities, and therefore that meaning also is a mentalistic term.13 We can no longer uncritically hold that language expresses ideas or meanings. Nor for the same reasons, can art do so.14 A pragmatic, operational definition of thought is language-use. This may include self-talk, verbal utterance, or Wittgenstein's notion of a lan- guage-game. By thinking (cognition, intention, belief, etc.), we mean language-use. The task is now to develop a nonmentalistic theory of meaning.15 Words, on the traditional theory, refer not only to pseudo- psychological ideas, but also to objects. They stand for objects. And words are themselves objects: marks or sounds organized in a certain way. Meaning may accordingly be seen as a nonmentalistic association be- tween words and other objects. The meaning of "association" is grounded by the paradigm: I can and do relate, in whatever way, chalk which I see, with the marks "chalk." The sounds and marks of language are conve- nient and are infinitely diverse admitting of complex combinations.16 Computer programming is a similarly complex associating. Because virtually all objects are given associations, any object may serve as the basis of a language. However, not all would be equally con- venient to use. The question "Does art express meaning?" can now be answered. Art has connections for us. An abstractionist painting, show- ing areas of green, brown, and orange, becomes a farmyard with a trac- tor. A poem is a paradox or puzzle of connotations for us to figure out. Musical tone-poems are created by synaesthetic or imitative associa- tions. The above also generates an answer to Kingsley Price's question, "How does music differ from sand and wind?"17 They have different associations. The metaphorical deviations and juxtapositions in art become spe- cifically comprehensible. Each art has its own internal congruity (lan- guage context) such as that rendered by musical terminology, as well as external relationships (language-game contexts), including what the sounds remind us of. In a tone-poem both types of association are espe- cially required. On the other hand, a piece of music may be written with</page><page sequence="4">24 The Meaning of Express in Aesthetics no concern for the reaction of the human observer. If "music" by defini- tion means aesthetically valued sounds, music without concern for the listener may not qualify as genuine music. We sometimes say "That music has no heart." It may perhaps be called computer, mechanical, or incidental sound, though they may each have their own sort of magnifi- cence. Virtually all objects are given associations, but a language is not a language unless it is accepted as such. Similarly, if no standard of time (change) is recognized, there is no time.18 Mere change is not time, and mere association is not language. For this reason, music, art, architec- ture, dance, etc. are not languages. But because they have internal associations and have relationships with language they may be thought of as incomplete languages or extensions of our language. They are universes of relations, but not universes of discourse. Association is what is meant by "expressing ourselves" through any medium from voice intonation to the way we spend money or the way we dress. It is in this sense that we may understand John Dewey: "The act of expression al- ways employs natural material."19 We may say that art is the exploration of the limits of our language. Art is one form of meaning. Dewey says, "Science states meanings, art expresses them."20 Archibald Alison also presents a theory of association.21 Art does not refer to objects as a language refers to them. In this sense, Edmund Gurney is correct when he says that music is meaning- less.22 It may be nonreferential, but it is not meaningless. It does have associative meaning. And this does provide a certain kind of knowledge. It "says" nothing, but "expresses" much. This is also the case with par- ticles and interjections in languages, e.g., "well!", "um," etc. They are often said to be mere meaningless interjections, but in fact interjections are rich in associative meaning. They are said to say nothing, but rather leave little unsaid.23 In this respect, we may speak of a "language" of color, music, clouds, trees, taste, etc. Eduard Hanslick argued that music is a language we speak and understand.24 Bernard Bosanquet states, "Even an enjoyable color is not a mute gratification of sense, but is felt as an utterance."25 Leonard Bernstein sees music as a metalanguage - a language based on language and perception, but abstracted from it.26 The notion of "seeing- as" means that virtually all perception is related to our language. We cannot see a "Doric column" without these words. Because they do not understand language, cats cannot perceive "people," "art," or "music."</page><page sequence="5">Shibles 25 B. Emotion Because of its recent prevalence and broad-based support, the Rational-Emotive Theory, also called the Cognitive Theory of Emotion is defended here.27 The main features of this theory are briefly summarized as follows. 1. Emotion is not a bodily feeling. Emotion is not equivalent to feeling, as is commonly believed. Therefore, it is always misleading to say, "I feel x," where x is an emotion. It is more descriptive to say, "I think-feel x." 2. Emotion is a cognition which causes feeling. Emotion equals "cogni- tion causes feeling." Although emotions, as such, do not exist, "emotion" will be used to stand for "cognition causes feeling," for convenience. "Emotion" refers to both cognition and feeling to- gether. 3. Emotion can be radically changed, prevented and/or eliminated by changing the cognition. Thus, emotions are to this extent, neither necessary nor innate. This assertion is based on philosophical argument as well as recorded clinical experience. 4. Emotion can to some degree be changed by changing the feeling, e.g., by relaxation. 5. The emotive cognition is typically a value assessment. Negative evaluations produce positive emotions. 6. Emotion can be changed by changing the value assessment, e.g., we can largely eliminate anger, revenge, etc. 7. We cannot have the same emotion twice because cognition and feeling constantly change. It would be simplistic to say that a piece of music represents a certain emotion 8. Negative emotion is due to faulty assessments such as: (a) failure to accept the reality of the situation, (b) failure to understand that we can only do that which is within our power, (c) misuse of value terms, e.g., thinking that something is "bad in itself." 9. Emotion is not "released." It is not an entity. To change the emotion, the cognition must be changed. It is not the sort of thing that can be "released." This argues against "expression" as a release or catharsis. 10. Emotion is not a cause. "Cognition causes feeling" can be a cause. That is, if there is no anger as such, it cannot be a cause. 11. Because emotion is cognition, only we can cause our emotion. Objects cannot cause emotion. For emotion, the object must be perceived and evaluated. This creates difficulty for the view that the object expresses the artisťs emotion. 12. Because emotion is mainly cognition it requires awareness or consciousness. It also requires deliberateness if negative emotion</page><page sequence="6">26 The Meaning of Express in Aesthetics is to be avoided. 13. Because a statement is cognition plus feeling, any statement or judgment may be regarded as an emotion.28 14. Metaemotions are emotions about emotions, e.g., "enjoyment of the grotesque," "self-deprecation humor," "schadenfreude" ("malicious joy"). Required specific explanations of the theory will be given in connec- tion with the subsequent analysis. C. Expression According to the basic formulation of the expression theory of emotion, the artist unidirectionally expresses emotion to the perceiver through the object. The artist's emotion is expressed in the object which then in turn causes emotion in the perceiver. The literature usually limits the theory to this assertion. But the assertion "art expresses emotion" is ambiguous. Other and reciprocal formulations are also pos- sible such as the following. We may consider three sources of emotion: artist's emotion, the object as a source of emotion (emotive object), and the perceiver's emotion. The theory could be stated as: Art is the expres- sion of the aritst's emotion, perceiver's emotion, emotive object, or some combination of these. (a) The artist's emotion may be expressed by the emotive object and the object may be expressed by the artist. For example, the artist interacts with the object over a period of time. (Artist's emotion &lt; &gt; emotive object) (The symbols &gt; and &lt; may be read as "is expressed in," "causes," or or the meaning is indicated by the context. In the case of the cognitive theory, "cognition &gt; feeling," &gt; means "causes") In terms of "stimulus (S)-response (R) theory," this would be partly rendered by S- R-S-R-S.... The artist may try to bring out the emotion thought to be in the object which the object "expresses." (b) "Expression" may refer to the finished work, the moment of creation, the gerundive process of expressing, the whole process of creation, or the finished product. Dewey states "'Expression' equivocates between the act of expressing and the result expressed."29 (c) The artist's emotion may be largely based on or determined by the actual or imagined thoughts of the perceiver, and vice versa. (Artist's emotion &lt; &gt; perceiver's emotion). Viewers may perceive certain emotions in the object because they know which emotions the artist usually has or experiences, thereby circumventing the object as the bearer of objective emotion. Conversely, if art is the expression of the emotion of the perceiver, emotion may be largely based on the actual or imagined</page><page sequence="7">Shibles 27 thoughts of the artist, again circumventing the object. (d) The perceiver may project emotion into the object (cf. personifi- cation, depersonfication, anthropomorphism, etc.) Or the object may "express" emotion to the perceiver(emotive object &lt; &gt; perceiveťs emo- tion). Clearly, an object or animal does not express emotion as a person expresses emotion. (e) One may carry on an inner dialogue and development of emotion in and for oneself, to yield: artisťs emotion1 &lt; &gt; artisťs emotion2. The artistic process can be regarded as an experience or a learning process such as that advocated by a number of aestheticians. In these and other ways, the formula becomes: Artisťs emotion &lt; &gt; emotive object &lt; &gt; perceiveťs emotion, Artisťs emotion &lt; &gt; perceiveťs emotion, Artisťs emotion &lt; &gt; Artisťs emotion, perceiveťs emotion1 &lt; &gt; perceiveťs emotion2. The "intentional fallacy" is an example of the perceiver projecting emotion into the artist; the artist may declare an intention which may or may not be found in the work. The "pathetic fallacy" is that of projecting emotion into the object. Objects are somehow given the emotions of hu- mans. And because emotions include cognition, this would include cog- nition as well thereby creating a cognitive object. In the latter case the artisťs or perceiveťs emotion is projected into the object. It is a category- mistake to say that the object has or expresses emotion as humans express emotion. Only humans can give emotional associations to ob- jects. Whether or not animals can have aesthetic emotion remains pro- blematic because we do not have adequate access to their "languages." From the above it can be seen that our language systematically misleads us when we say that art, as an object, expresses emotion. Malcolm Budd states that it is a pathetic fallacy to think that the emotion is in the music.30 Nor does it help to say, as John Nolt does, that objects may not express, but only "tend to express emotions."31 Each element of the above formula, "art is the expression of emotion," admits of numerous qualifications such as the following: 1) Which meaning of "express" is being used? 2) Which theory of emotion is being used? 3) There are at least three different sorts of emotion: the artisťs emotion, emotive object, and perceiveťs emotion. Also, one in- dividual's emotion is different at different times and differs from emotions of others. Artist, object, and perceiver may be thought to be transformers of emotion, not carriers of the same emotion. 4) The artist may act as perceiver during or after creation of the object. 5) Emotions involved may be based on well-founded or poorly-founded cognitions.</page><page sequence="8">28 The Meaning of Express in Aesthetics 6) Objects in nature may be given emotional associations, though no artist created them. A viewer may assess any object as an aesthetic object. 7) The emotive object may surpass or fail to express what the artist intended to produce. 8) An artist unaware of the cognitive theory or a sound theory of emotion will tend to fail to "express" emotion adequately. A Freudian, for example, would tend to express that very theory into the artwork. One's philosophy is reflected in one's art. 9) The formula must allow for less atomistic interpretations. The artisťs emotion, emotive object and perceiver's emotion may unite or be integratively continuous with one another.32 10) The emotion may be normative or, on the other hand, personally experienced. 11) The emotive object varies according to the specific medium, e.g., music vs. poetry, and techniques used. 12) On the cognitive theory, among what maybe expressed are emotion, feeling, cognition, images, actions, perceptions, or sensations. Art expresses more than emotions. It expresses also cognitions.33 13) The perceiver may not look merely for the artisťs emotions.34 14) The perceiver may perceive a different emotion than that of the emotive object or the artisťs emotion. "The music is sad," may have different meanings for artist, emotive object and perceiver's emo- tion. One may observe emotion in an object, but need not experi- ence that emotion. "An onlooker may say, What a magnificent expression of rage!'"35 15) Neither artist nor audience need be the best judges of whether or how the object expresses emotion. Often artists, as well as critics, including the some of greatest such as Beethoven, are known to have unpleasant dispositions. We cannot look to them for a knowl- edge of how emotions work. 16) How do we see emotion in an object? This raises the formalist vs. expressionist controversy as to whether or not there is beauty or emotion in an art object.36 Croce's Intuition as Expression Intuire è esprimere ; e nienť altro (niente di più , ma niente de meno) che esprimere. - Benedetto Croce37 Croce states above, "To intuit is to express; and nothing else (nothing more, but nothing less) than to express." His view may be analyzed in terms of the foregoing distinctions. Feeling C sentimento ) is raw bodily sensation. It is not directly knowable.38 He opposes an atomistic view</page><page sequence="9">Shibles 29 according to which cognition is separated from feeling. Rather, he holds an organicist and Kantian view that there is no cognition without feeling, and no feeling without cognition. We never have pure sensation or pure feeling as such. They are like seeings-as. "The sweetness and freshness of a fruit" is not visual, but aesthetic.39 The aesthetic (aesthetic emotion) is a synthesis of cognition and feeling, or in Aristotelian terms, "formed matter" as the following model shows: Cognition Feeling form matter, object conscious unconscious unchanging changing active passive inner outside general particular intuition Cognized feelings. Cognition and feeling blend and synthesize. The whole determines the qualities of the parts like metaphor, which cannot be reduced to the literal. Not just reason or the demonstrable. Science gives concepts; art gives intuition. Direct and spontaneous. Unity of perception/sensations. Productive and formative associations. Only cognized perception. A new knowledge free from concepts or raw feeling is said to result. It is neither cognition nor feeling, but a novel unity. Although, as with the cognitive theory, cognition dominates the feeling gives it coherence.40 Intuition is expression is the aesthetic. Formless, indeterminate feelings are "filtered* (un filtro) through the unifying form of cognition. Intuition can also be a synthesis of concepts.41 The aesthetic transcends the mere conceptual and goes beyond narrow dualisms of mind vs. body, subject vs. object, reason vs. emotion, etc. It is to experience the sky without space and time. Classical cognitive and romantic emotion are united. In addition, intuition comes only when these combine into expres- sion: "Every true intuition is also expression." ( Ogni vera intuizione... è, insieme , espressione.)*2 There are also no ideas (cognitions) without expression. Croce was early to think of thought as a kind of self-talk or talk aloud (Le parole interne che diciamo a noi.).43 He apprehends here also the epistemologica! primacy of language. Thought (cognitions) and</page><page sequence="10">30 The Meaning of Express in Aesthetics feeling are only artificial abstractions which have meaning only in ex- pression and action based on it. This is similar to Dewey's contextualist theory of meaning and view of art as experience. We may compare it also to Wittgenstein's notion of a language-game which is a given, not further reducible or analyzable given. In expressing, one supposedly becomes conscious of what one thinks and feels. We only know what we think when we see what we say. The brute sensation becomes conscious and our thought becomes embodied. The aesthetic, for Croce, is a way of becoming aware. The aesthetic is knowledge, but not merely conceptual knowledge. It is more adequate, holistic, humanistic knowledge. To be rational is to be aesthetic and to be aesthetic is to be rational. As with the cognitive theory of emotion, feeling in this way comes together with cognition.44 E. The Meanings of Express As noted earlier, "art expresses emotion" cannot be intelligible un- less "express" is clarified. Stanley Speck states, "'Expression'... is itself a quasi-explanatory locution."45 Scruton sees form, imitation, and ex- presses as vague abstractions.46 Hansen notes that Ferguson in Music as Metaphor uses a great variety of terms for expression: "'Express' in 'Music expresses emotion,' is rendered as, to refer to, portray, represent, be a counterpart of, suggest, evoke, define, be comparable to, appear to characterize, reveal, utter, arouse, communicate, be a valuation of, invite comparison with, imply, intimate, reflect, resemble, and finally be a metaphor of."47 In one respect, a person or object can possibly in some way express all that one can think or feel. An examination of the word- field of "express" yields the following root meanings. "Express" may mean: 1. cause, 2. correlation, 3. effect, 4. imitate, 5. characterize, 6. release, 7. explain, 8. clarify, 9. create, 10. communicate, 11. symbolize, 12. render metaphorically, etc. In each case it is not the meaning but our assessment of the meaning which causes the emotion (cognition &gt; feeling). Art is said to express cog- nition as well as emotion, but as emotion includes cognition, to express emotion is already to express cognition. Stefan Morawski, among others, speaks of the expression of a mentalistic "subconscious."48 Romantics spoke of the expression of supernatural and transcendental states, and the "sublime" and spiritual. No support will be given here for either a subconscious or the spiritual. 1. Cause Express may mean "causes." On the cognitive theory, strictly speak-</page><page sequence="11">Stables 31 in g, neither artist nor object can cause our emotion. Only human cog- nition or evaluation can do that. Emotion is (cognition &gt; feeling). And where there is no cause there is no necessary causation. Emotion may then be produced or apprehended by: (a) cognition of the object, e.g., musical sounds, or (b) cognition of the emotion as being somehow present in the artist or object. The association theory of meaning suggests that emotion itself is not present in objects, but only qualities which we associate with emotion. It should be noted that the same historical criticisms which apply to the notion of cause, apply also to "express."49 2. Correlation "Express" may mean that the art object correlates in a somewhat regular way with our emotion. Cognition, feeling, and emotion vary for each object assessed or conceptually perceived. Our conception of one piece of music or work of art does not produce the same emotion as does another. On the other hand, the connection between a certain cognition and its accompanying feeling which constitutes the emotion can tend to be relatively constant. Settled revenge is due to constantly repeating the same negative dysfunctional cognitions. But because we do not have exactly the same cognitions, feelings or combinations of them twice, we can never have precisely the same emotions twice. Weak forms of correlation are: accompany, conjoin, associate with. Art may be accompanied by nonartistic associations It may have a high or low correlation with the emotion of the perceiver. "Art expresses emotion," becomes: art may or may not express some emotion or other regularly or irregularly. William Wimsatt held a cognitive view whereby we create an "objective correlative" in objects: "Poetry is.. .about the emotive quality of objects... presented in their objects and contemplated as a pattern of knowledge."50 Correlation in general may take place by means of custom, similarity, arbitrary stipulation, association, etc. Susanne Langer similarly holds that art is an abstract formal analogue of human emotion which we cognitively recognize.51 We need not actually experience the emotion in the art. 3. Effect "Express" may mean effect or affect. A synonym of "effect" is "influ- ence." Art influences the perceiver. The etymology of "influence" sug- gests that a mystical, occult power or fluid flows from the object. It refers to an indirect, intangible, unknowing (or knowing) production of an effect with or without force. Music as influence would accordingly remain mysterious. Art may similarly be said to "evoke." Synonyms of "evoke" are: persuade, urge, arouse, stir, sway, awaken, infect, affect, provoke,</page><page sequence="12">32 The Meaning of Express in Aesthetics excite, induce. What is central to evocation is that the artist or object need not imitate, reveal or characterize emotion. It need only bring it about. In this sense, we can say that it is the music which produces an emotion in us, not that the music is emotive. "Evoke" and its synonyms, e.g., provoke, and persuade, already include emotive import. Therefore, "Art expresses emotion/' and "Art arouses emotion," are circular. What is evoked or aroused in our emotion is basically the cognition.52 But on Stanley Schachter's activation theory of emotion, it is basically the feeling which is aroused, at least initially.53 Just how emotion is evoked involves both aesthetic feeling and aesthetic emotion, as well as value and meaning (associations). 4. Imitation If "express" means "imitation," a different picture emerges. How can art imitate emotion? (a) Art can imitate by re-presentation, mirroring, copying or duplicating. It merely reproduces it. For example, in a play, (b) Art can imitate by resemblance, simile or analogy. Peter Kivy states, "Music is expressive in virtue of its resemblance to expressive human utterance and behavior."54 This is also an animation theory.55 Some parts of the art object are like some parts of emotion, for example, the sounds of thunder, cymbals, or drums can be like the sounds of anger. The feeling experienced in an emotion can be like the feeling experienced in art. In music, this may be due to the perception of tone quality, tempo, etc. The art object itself may not seem in any way to resemble a certain emotion, but the emotion itself tells us that, for whatever reason, there is a resemblance. We say, "The music is joyful," and have no idea why. (c) Art can imitate by simulation. Music may be said to feign or fake emotion. It is not genuine emotion. Nor can art precisely imitate. It is not the same as the object reflected. It may be enjoyable because it is not what it seems to be. We may be interested to see how close art may come to its representation. If art imitates emotion, it shows it or fakes it, it does not necessarily arouse or evoke it. We simply sense that emotion is re-presented. Negative imitation such as parody, mocking, sham, satire (often biting irony), by definition involve negative emotion. But negative emotion is not aesthetic emotion. Mere unevaluated and uninterpreted imitation, as such, does not involve or produce aesthetic emotion. Imitation or assembly line production is not art. It is only the evaluation of imitation which can produce aesthetic emotion as, for example, naturalistic art or the enjoyment of camping. The appreciation of aesthe- tic emotion, is a metaemotion, an emotion about an emotion. The ability</page><page sequence="13">Stables 33 to copy a master or paint a natural scene to look real can be a great and admirable talent. In general, however, we do not usually find mere copying to be praiseworthy, and so to produce an aesthetic emotion. Since Aristotle, the meaning of "art as imitation," and so "expression as imitation," has come to be extremely diverse. Imitation may refer to observing, producing or having an emotion. On the cognitive theory, as was mentioned, we can never have the same emotion twice and so cannot represent or reproduce it exactly. All imitation becomes interpretation, including photography. 5. Characterization "Expression as characterization," includes the following synonyms: show, demarcate, identify, evince, formulate, present, caricature, panto- mime, typify, stereotype, sketch, outline, form, distinguish, illustrate, exemplify, epitomize, materialize, portray, render, interpret. Regard- less of how the artist or object characterizes emotion, to experience emotions requires cognition of such characterization which may produce emotion, [(cognition of emotion) &gt; emotion]. Art, including music, cer- tainly characterizes emotion. Again, it is not the characterization, but the assessment of it which creates aesthetic emotion. 6. Release "Express" may mean "release of emotion." Synonyms are: exclaim (interjection theory), vent, discharge, remove. On the cognitive theory, as mentioned earlier, emotions are not released, because they are not entities. To change the emotion, the cognition must be changed. Another meaning of "release" is merely to act violently. 7. Explanation "Express as explanation." The artist or art may account for, be the reason, motive justification or evidence for emotion. The artist may also betray the emotion as a symptom.56 For example, "Art expresses emo- tion" mathematically in music, or by the principle of the Golden Mean in painting. 8. Clarification This is to "express" as meaning: to make known, reveal, establish or direct attention to. For R. G. Collingwood, in the process of expressing one clarifies emotion.57 Art discovers rather than expresses emotion. Croce and Dewey hold similar views. The emphasis is on the activity, rather than on prior intention or result. Art, especially poetry and prose, has the rhetorical power to clarify emotion as well as thought. These</page><page sequence="14">34 The Meaning of Express in Aesthetics involve clarification by means of rhetoric and metaphor. Art can illumi- nate, exemplify, or interpret. As mentioned earlier, in regard to the question as to whether or not art can give knowledge, it clearly can. 9. Creation "Express" may mean "to create new emotions." Metaphor may be used not merely to render emotions, but to create new emotions. In poetry, literature, etc. emotional insight can thereby be produced. It is not, however, automatic. Our art is only as good as our thinking and ra- tional argument. A poem, for example, about time without the author having a sound knowledge about the philosophical theories of time, is certain not to be creative. But because metaphor allows us to go beyond our limited thinking, one may use metaphor as a creative tool to give insight, to break down previous categories and produce insight. These insights often come like the rain. In this way, the accidental artist can give at least some insight. But it is largely the metaphor which creates. 10. Communication "Express" as meaning "to communicate emotion." Synonyms are: to mean, refer to, suggest, hint, intimate, intend, encode-decode, etc. The question again arises as to whether or not or to what extent any of the arts is a language. 11. Symbolization Synonyms are: represent, typify, signify, stand for; be an icon or emblem. With synecdoche, for example, a part of emotion behavior may represent the entire emotion. With metonymy, something associated with emotion, such as high, quick sounds, may stand for the emotion. Kivy stated, "The musical characteristics conventionally associated with joy and sorrow are as easily identifiable and consistently applied as halo on saint."58 However, Budd rejects the idea that music symbolizes emotions.59 12. Metaphorical Rendering "Express" and its synonyms may be used metaphorically. Peter Mew uses "perform" metaphorically when he says that we can "perform an emotion."60 Kivy wrote, "The Saint Bernard is... metaphorically sad."61 Art may represent emotion by analogy and metaphor. As aesthetic emotion involves cognitions plus feelings, what especially is the nature of these cognitions? Art is fundamentally a translation, transformation, and transference. One universe of discourse is rendered by means of another. Metaphor is seen to be the basis of our language of emotion as</page><page sequence="15">Shibles 35 well as of our experience generally.62 Metaphor is seen to characterize art generally. It is the fundamental concept of rhetoric and involves at least the following techniques: synecdoche, metonymy, substitution, juxtapo- sition, parataxis, parable, allegory, fable, fairy tale, deviation, arche- type, irony, parody, personification, anthropomorphism, oxymoron, etc. Metaphors may be: fundamental or root metaphors, dead, mixed, ten- sion, unifying, omitting, repetition, etymological, visual, elucidating, therapeutic, concise, farfetched (conceit), synaesthesia, etc. Bernstein, for example, even defines music as the metaphorical jux- taposition and deviation of sound.63 And poetry is a paradigm case for the use of metaphor. Any analysis of reasoning, whether in the arts or sciences which does not take account of the metaphorical basis of thinking can hardly be said to deal with reasoning at all.64 The Aristote- lian syllogism and contemporary symbolic logic are as far from helping us to improve our thinking as mathematics is to helping us understand how ordinary language works. The failure of symbolic logic and transfor- mational grammar (structuralism) are two recent major casualties due to the failure to be able to deal with metaphor. Wittgenstein's attack on his own earlier work on symbolic logic, the Tractatus, showed in eloquent detail why symbolic logic is inadequate to the task of analyzing ordinary language.65 Rather, to understand ordinary language we must under- stand ordinary language. Recent work in suprasegmental linguistics, pragmatics, and informal logic provide support for this thesis. The word-field of "express" has been presented indicating a great variety of meanings. This means that it may be expected that its use will often be equivocal. Theorists have taken one or more meanings and constructed their own restricted theory of expression on that basis, e.g., expression as icon, as imitation, as release, etc. A theorist could be cited for nearly every synonym given above. In addition, a sound theory of meaning and emotion is required. These are often either not given or they prove to be inadequate. In sum, a sound theory of "art as expression of emotion" requires a solid analysis of art, expression, meaning and emotion. Toward this end, several specific approaches have been recommended here. Unless these are provided in ways not as yet found in the literature, expression theory will continue to have, as Osborne stated earlier, "no solution." Notes 1.
