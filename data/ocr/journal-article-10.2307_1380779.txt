<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY The inclusion of a key to the skulls of domestic as well as wild ungulates is a very good idea. The first common name listed is generally that given by Jones et al. (1979, Occ. Pap. Mus. Texas Tech. Univ., 17 pp.). For stability, this is good. However, some other common names were given nearly equal emphasis: for example, "Eastern Pipistrelle or Georgian Bat" (p. 44). The name Georgian Bat, along with Pink Bat (Myotis sodalis), Striped Gopher (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus), Chickaree (Tamiasciurus hunsonicus), and some others might better have been either further deemphasized or omitted entirely if not used as common names in Ohio. In the "Extirpated species ...." listing (p. 151), three categories are mentioned: extirpated species, those that presently live in neighboring states, and non-native animals that have escaped or been liberated in Ohio. Grouping the species under these categories would have been beneficial. The Bobcat is relegated to the extirpated species section. However, since there are photographs of three recent Bobcats from Ohio (p. 155), the latest in 1978, I would have included a species account for it. Gottschang implies it is an infrequent visitor. Some of the existing species accounts got slighted somewhat, for example, those of the Smoky Shrew, the Hoary Bat and the Fox Squirrel. However, these are mostly minor points. The book is well written, well edited, and overall a good job. It is relatively free of typographical errors. The author and publisher are to be commended.-JOHN 0. WHIT- AKER, JR.

Symposium of the Zoological Society of London, No. 45. Academic Press, London and New York, xv + 363 pp., 1980. Price $66.00. This is a book of papers presented at a symposium of the London Zoological Society in November 1978. The objective of the symposium as stated in the Preface was "to review the progress made in recent years in the main fields of mammalian olfaction and to produce a volume which represented a distillation of the progress." Stoddart brought together 13 workers from the United Kingdom, one from France, and one from Poland. Only two of them had material published in either of the volumes resulting from recent North American symposia on chemical signals (Miiller-Schwarze, D. and Mozell, M. M., eds. 1977. Chemical signals in vertebrates, Plenum Press, N.Y.; Miiller-Schwarze, D. and Silverstein, R. M., eds. 1980. Chemical signals in vertebrates and aquatic invertebrates, Plenum). So the authors are a fresh group. The papers fall into three groups: a general overview of evolutionary aspects (Stoddart), chemistry of odors (MacLeod), the olfactory system (Dodd and Squirrell), and odor-producing organs (Adams); the role of olfaction in social organization of carnivores (Gorman; Macdonald), lagomorphs (Bell), prosimians (Schil- ling), and ungulates (Gosling); and the role of olfaction in growth and maturation of Mus musculus (Cowley), and reproduction and/or reproductive behavior of murid rodents (Milligan; Marchlewska-Koj), the pig (Booth), and monkeys (Keverne). Many of the articles in the book mix recent research of the respective authors, the respective authors' own published work, and some literature review. In some cases this may be very welcome, as where Milligan pulls together his work on reproduction in voles. However, most of them do not provide a distillation in any one field. For example, Gosling presents a facinating account of interspecific defense guilds of African savannah ungulates which may be maintained in part by scent deposits, but he does not relate these findings to other ungulate assemblages. The mix of review and original observations is awkward in a few chapters because the details of the latter are not complete enough for a primary literature presentation. The chapters on the olfactory system, odor-producing organs, rodent reproductive physiology, patterns of scent marking among carnivores, and the pig could be used as introductory reviews at either the undergraduate or graduate level. The chapter on sex and scents in primates is not a review but nicely illustrates the plasticity of mammalian behaviors and its effect on the kinds of questions asked. Among important yet relatively unexplored topics discussed in the volume are interspecific associations mediated by olfaction, intraspecific variation in scent marking associated with intraspecific variation in social organization, and the relationship between fitness and scent marking. However, the symposium did not fully address current research in the field sensu lato. Inasmuch as the field of mammalian olfaction is extremely diverse, ranging from field studies to neurophysiology, perhaps that is asking too much and it may be considered unfair to have expected it even though it was promised. As Kleiman (1981, Science, 212: 155-156) pointed out, there is no review here of the role of the vomeronasal organ in reproduction nor of 186 Vol. 64, No. 1</page><page sequence="2">February 1983 the chemistry of glandular secretions. But, then, several areas which Wilson (1978, Science, 199:1058-1059) mentioned as being in the forefront of animal communication research in general are touched upon at various levels: the role of context in the meaning of signals, the physiology of the receptor system, the classification of messages, and their meaning. Work on the decomposition of the complex signals into components and the idea of evolutionary optimum design in mammalian olfactory communication are obviously further off. Most work on function still tries to relate some substance to some one function, without addressing other possible hypothesized functions. Most of the research concentrates on the sender and the signal, not the receiver. The lack of much truly interdisciplinary work among chemists and mammalogists is reflected in the current volume. Only one chapter is even co-authored. The two chapters on carnivores could have been combined. In general, the volume reflects the continuing attempt to be more explicit about scent communication in the field so that function can be understood from observation. It also shows a growing trend to mix observational studies with experimentation. It is therefore striking and unfortunate that three of the five papers on reproduction and growth in the laboratory deal with murid rodents (and one is on domestic pigs), whereas four of the five papers on social structure deal with larger mammals more easily observed in the field. The fifth, on the role of urine in prosimian territoriality, presents laboratory work closely tied to field studies. The book is well edited. Indexing is suitable and the binding is par for the symposia series. The chapter on "odour-producing organs" would have benefitted from the inclusion of binomial nomenclature. The term "pheromone" is used without definition. Its meaning and utility, currently topics of debate, could have been discussed in the chapter on evolutionary aspects or the one on odor-producing organs. The price of the volume to this reviewer is absurd. The volume will have limited use in teaching and research because of the varying degrees to which the papers are truly reviews and/or present new ideas, although it may be hard to score high on both of these simultaneously. The book should be read by all those interested in mammalian olfaction, social structure, and reproduction, and it can be read for pleasure by anyone interested in mammals.-FREDERICK J.

Mamm., 64(1):187-188, 1983 Murie, Adolph. THE GRIZZLIES OF MOUNT McKINLEY, Sc. Monogr. Series No. 14 USDI Natl. Park Service, Washington, D.C. xvi + 251 pp. 1981. $6.00. This book provides us with a broad view of life in Mount McKinley National Park, especially from the "viewpoint" of the grizzly. The reader gains a real confidence in the observations and conclusions of Adolph Murie, mostly because of his basic and deep sincerity evident throughout the book. Above all, anyone who knows wild animals, will appreciate the intricate and detailed descriptions of grizzly habitat and habits, even while being disturbed by the few quantitative data and systematic observations. The sheer magnitude of excellently reported detail gives one a sense of a surprising amount of quantitative data lying there, but "still wrapped in words." It will seem unfortunate to some, perhaps, that the information was not presented to serve long-term and modern day management needs. If more of the various types of data had been briefly recorded in tables, versus the sometimes rambling and repetitive individual accounts, the book could have saved the reader much time, and could have automatically made the information more complete and useful. Some of the lengthy, descriptive accounts add to the book, and were rightly retained, but they could have been shortened by presenting the hard data separately. The reporting style used, in fact, makes some portions of the book downright tedious. Moreover, some of the data presented are clearly weak because of the methodology employed. A re- searcher may find himself screaming silently for the use of a data sheet to systematically record the data "being watched." Some sections, such as the part on carcasses of killed bears (page 10), tantalize the reader with omissions; other sections, especially where unmarked bears are positively identified, or where a good set of data was not quantified and evaluated by the observer, make a trained researcher grimace. Several anthropomorphic presentations of data and grizzly behavior, e.g., ". . . the bears were always chummy .... ," or "(the cub) . . . was in disfavor .... ," and the misuse of the term cubs for subadults, only detract from the book, as does the scarcity of literature citations. Overall, however, the many magnificent descriptions of grizzlies going about their affairs will be appre- REVIEWS 187</page></plain_text>
