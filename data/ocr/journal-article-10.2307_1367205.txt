Naturegraph Publishers, Inc., Happy Camp, CA. 208 p. Hardbound $10.95, paper $6.95. This is a book for birders on the North Ameri- can owls, emphasizing the distinctive qualities of each species. Chapters on general topics are followed by in-depth species accounts. These are very informative, yet nontechnical and readable, albeit sometimes a little anthropomorphic. Illustrated with photographs, draw- ings, maps, and rather garish color paintings. Modest in size, appearance, and price, this book will be a useful aid in finding, identifying, and learning the habits of owls. Song Dialects and Demes in Sedentary Populations of the White-crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia leu- cophrys nuttalli).-Luis F. Baptista. 1975. Uni- versity of California Publications in Zoology Vol. 105. 52 p., 25 pls. Paper. This is a monograph on the genetic structure of populations, based on analysis of song variation in the so-called ornithological "white rat" in the San Francisco Bay area. After describing and comparing the song themes of each of the several populations, Baptista speculates on the origins and interactions of these groups. He then develops theories on the evolution, possible functions, and adaptive sig- nificance of song dialects. The material is well pre- sented and represents a valuable contribution to the understanding of gene flow and song learning in birds. Maps and sound spectrograms. North American Ducks, Geese &amp; Swans.-Donald S. Heintzelman. 1978. Winchester Press, New York. 236 p. $15.00. This is an elementary book designed to help hunters and birders to see and identify water- fowl. The chapter on identification provides brief, field guide-like treatment of each species, supple- mented with photographs. The book's longest chapter and chief asset is its directory of U.S. national wildlife refuges, which is furnished with many maps and photographs. Four short appendixes give additional information pertaining to waterfowl. The Fish and Wildlife Service deserves much of the credit for this book, a large amount of the contents having been compiled from its publications. The Sunbirds of Southern Africa also the Sugar- birds, the White-eyes and the Spotted Creeper.- C. J. Skead. 1967. A.A. Balkema, Cape Town. 351 p. $29.00. Available: ISBS, Inc., P.O. Box 555, Forest Grove, OR 97116. This handbook is largely devoted to the sunbirds (Nectariniidae) of its region; shorter sections deal with the sugarbirds (Promero- pidae) and the white-eyes (Zosteropidae). A few pages are given to Salpornis spilonota, a bird of very different habits. Each of the families is introduced with a comprehensive review that relates the southern African species to their kindred elsewhere. The spe- cies accounts are very full, covering appearance, biol- ogy, and taxonomy. Distribution maps, photographs, drawings, and ten color plates by John Perry. Fur- nished with the book is a 45 rpm record of sunbird calls and songs, edited by June Stannard. Well written and illustrated, this book is an important reference on nectarivorous birds. The Sulidae/Gannets and Boobies.-J. Bryan Nel- son. 1978. Published for the University of Aberdeen by Oxford University Press. 1012 p. $98.00. What a colossal volume! It is surely one of the largest single- author treatises in ornithology to have appeared in many years. The first chapter alone could stand as a respectable book on the North Atlantic Gannet, the best-known member of the family. Each of the eight other species is then treated, and a final chapter com- pares them all. The contents of each chapter are or- ganized as to: nomenclature and external features, breeding distribution and numbers, breeding ecology, and breeding behavior. This arrangement enables a reader to either get an integrated view of a species' biology or make interspecific comparisons. Nelson not merely provides a wealth of detailed information, but also masterfully analyzes and synthesizes it. The book is abundantly illustrated with maps, diagrams, photographs, and nice drawings by John Busby. Among the 19 appendixes are ones on fossil sulids by Harrison, and on the effects of pollution on sulids by Bourne, Bogan, and Wanless. This monograph will long be essential for learning about gannets and boobies. Moreover, its importance extends to general ornithological questions such as adaptive radiation, the significance of the colonial habit, the relations between feeding and breeding ecology, and the evo- lution of displays. Die Vogelarten der Erde. 3. Lieferung.-Hans E. Wolters. [1977]. Verlag Paul Parey, Hamburg. 80 p. Paper. Subscription DM 38. Available: Verlag Paul Parey, 2 Hamburg 1, Spitalerstrasse 12, Postfach 106304, Germany. This is the third part of a syste- matic list of the birds of the world (noted in Condor 78:149 and 79:138). It concludes the Piciformes, goes through the suboscines, and treats several of the lower oscine families. Type Specimens of Birds in the American Museum of Natural History. Part 2.-James C. Greenway, Jr. 1978. Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History, Vol. 161, Article 1. New York. 305 p. Paper cover. $20.45. This catalog, a reference for taxono- mists and curators, covers the families Otididae through Picidae. The preceding families were treated in Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., vol. 150, art. 3 (1973). Given for each type specimen are its original and present names, nature of the type, and brief history of the specimen. A Guide to the Birds of Venezuela.-Rodolphe Meyer de Schauensee and William H. Phelps, Jr. 1978. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ. 424 p. $50.00. Venezuela has nearly 1300 species of birds, more than 40%o of the South American avifauna. This book presents the information needed for identi- fying them, yet it is an ordinary-sized volume. The species accounts give English, scientific, and Spanish names, and concise descriptions of the appearance, range, habitat, and habits. Almost every species is shown in excellent color or monochrome plates by Guy Tudor and other artists. Facing-page notes by Tudor are helpful in pointing out field marks. The book will be invaluable for ornithologists in Venezuela, and will doubtless excite many others to visit there.</page><page sequence="2">RECENT PUBLICATIONS 457 Field Guide to the Birds of the Eastern Himalayas. -Salim Ali. 1978. Oxford Univ. Press, Delhi. 265 p. $15.50. Imagine a field guide that includes 17 species of partridges and pheasants, 17 cuckoos, 4 hornbills, 7 drongos, and 86 assorted babblers! The region covered by this guide ranges from humid low- land tropical forests to snowcapped mountains over 6000 m, all within a straight-line distance of about 80 km. This diversity of habitats accommodates an ex- traordinarily rich and diverse flora and fauna, includ- ing over 530 species of birds. Each species is here briefly described as to size, field characters, status, habitat, habits, and call; overall range is not given. Two-thirds of the species are shown in color plates by several artists. Commendably for such a book, it is small and sturdy. It is indispensable for the birder who is fortunate-and likewise sturdy-enough to visit its region. Systematics of Smaller Asian Night Birds Based on Voice.-Joe T. Marshall. 1978. Ornithological Mono- graphs No. 25, American Ornithologists' Union. 58 p. Paper cover. Supplemented with a 331/3 rpm phono- disc. $7.00 ($6.00 to AOU members). Available: Assistant Treasurer of the AOU, Dr. Glen E. Woolfen- den, Department of Biology, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida 33620. This monograph chiefly concerns the systematics of scops-owls (Otus) in Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Marshall describes details of the feathering, but owing to the cryptic coloration, he has found these properties to be much less reliable than the songs and calls in adducing the affinities of these birds. His paper also contains keys to species of Batrachostomus and of Caprimulgidae in the region, as well as a list of sug- gested amendments to Volume IV of Peters' Check- list. Map, drawings, sound spectrograms. The phono- graph record has been well produced and it effectively supports the author's findings. Late Miocene marine birds from Orange County, California.-Hildegarde Howard. 1978. Natural His- tory Museum of Los Angeles County, Contributions in Science No. 290, 26 p. Bone fragments from five sites represent at least 14 species of marine birds. New fossil species of Gavia, Puffinus, and Morus are de- scribed. Photographs. The California Condor, 1966-1976: A look at its Past and Future.-Sanford R. Wilbur. 1978. North American Fauna, No. 72. U.S. Dept. Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington, D.C. 136 p. Paper cover. Available: Supt. of Documents, U.S. Govt. Printing Office, Wash., D.C. Field work by Fred C. Sibley and Wilbur forms the basis for this report on the status of California Condors and the factors that affect their productivity. Drawing also on the litera- ture, specimen records, and sightings by cooperators, the document is authoritative and comprehensive. Its findings are important for attempting to avert ex- tinction of the species, but the Recovery Plan has been criticized by the Advisory Panel on the California Condor (1978. Audubon Conservation Report No. 6, National Audubon Society). Photographs, maps, and copious appendixes. Birds of Grady County, Georgia.-Herbert L. Stod- dard, Sr. 1978. Bulletin of Tall Timbers Research Station, No. 21. 175 p. Paper cover. Available: Tall Timbers Research Station, Rt. 1, Box 160, Talla- hassee, Florida 32312. Grady County is in the south- western corner of Georgia. The late Mr. Stoddard wrote this account of the status and habits of its birds, drawing on his and others' observations over forty years. Roy Komarek and Robert L. Crawford have edited the manuscript and added some material, in- cluding a list of voucher specimens and a tabulation of Stoddard's remarkable series of Christmas Bird Counts over 29 consecutive years. This booklet is a valuable supplement to T. D. Burleigh's Georgia Birds (1958. Univ. Oklahoma Press, Norman). An Annotated Check-list of the Birds of Illinois.- H. David Bohlen. 1978. Popular Science Series, Vol. IX, Illinois State Museum. 156 p. Paper cover. $2.00 (plus 750 postage and handling). Available: Illinois State Museum Society, Springfield, IL 62706. The last comprehensive list of the birds of Illinois was published by Smith and Parmalee in 1955 (Ill. State Mus. Pop. Sci. Ser., Vol. IV). The present check-list includes new information derived from reports since that time and from further study of previous records. Given for each species are its dates of normal occur- rence, status, documentation, habitat, and a summary of records. This carefully prepared booklet will be helpful to birders in Illinois and neighboring states. Birds of Southeastern Washington.-John W. Weber and Earl J. Larrison. 1977. University Press of Idaho. 66 p. Paper cover. Available: Idaho Re- search Foundation, Inc., University Station Box 3367, Moscow, ID 83843. This is an annotated checklist of the birds in four counties in the southeastern corner of Washington. Given for each species are its present status and selected records since the 1954 list by Hudson and Yocum (Research Studies of Wash. State Univ. 22). The Study of Raptor Populations.-Donald R. John- son. 1978. University Press of Idaho. 57 p. Paper cover. Available: as above. This is a syllabus for the study of population aspects of falconiforms and owls, concentrating on North American species. Chapters treat identification, census techniques, productivity, mortality, food habits, predation, energetics, migra- tion, and sexual dimorphism. The material has been well prepared, the rather brief text being supplemented with tables of various data and many references to the literature. It can be used either by classes or by individuals who are studying raptors on their own. Nesting Ecology of Canada Geese in the Hudson Bay Lowlands of Ontario: Evolution and Population Regulation.-Dennis G. Raveling and Harry G. Lums- den. 1977. Fish and Wildlife Research Report No. 98, Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. 77 p. Paper cover. $3.50. Available: Ontario Government Bookstore, 880 Bay St., Toronto, Ontario M5S 1Z8. The large populations of Canada Geese that winter in the Mississippi and Tennessee valleys have their major nesting grounds in the muskeg of Ontario. This re- port, based on three seasons of field study, presents and discusses findings on the birds' reproductive rates, habitat preferences, and density and spacing of nests in relation to the regulation of population size. Abundant data are given in many tables and figures. This material should be of interest not only to goose biologists but also to students of avian population dynamics and of the ecology of northern wetlands.</page><page sequence="3">458 RECENT PUBLICATIONS Observations of Mallards in the parkland of Alberta. -Michael F.
