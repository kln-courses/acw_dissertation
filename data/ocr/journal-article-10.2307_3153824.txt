By HENRY COLLINS MINTON. Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1902. Pp. xii+3I9. $1.25, net. THE theme of the book is, in the main, the cosmos, viewed as a mean between God and man. Corresponding to the second term of the title, there is only a brief enforcement of the thought that the divine revelation contained in the cosmos has an appropriate climax in the incarnated Logos. In respect of philosophical predilections the author indicates that he is on terms of fairly good fellowship with Professors Bowne, Ladd, and Andrew Seth. His point of view is that of a qualified idealism. While he says, with Bowne, " the world of things is so completely a world of ideas as to have no meaning except in relation to mind and consciousness," he says also : Truth is not in the thing only; it is not in the thought only; it is in the thing as the expression of the thought. Matter is more than " coarsened thought," as Amiel called it; but there is thought there first of all, and it is because of that thought that we can cognize matter and study it. In harmony with this conception of the world as the embodiment and expression of thought, the author vigorously antagonizes the agnostic platform. He repudiates the notion that the reason in man can do no better than to lead up to such a cul-de-sac as the antinomies of Kant. He thinks of Dean Monsel as slaying rationalism at the expense of slaughtering reason. " He threw out the child with the bath; he burned the barn to get rid of the mice." Benjamin Kidd's concession of ultra-rational sanctions to religion earns also from our author very scanty thanks. With Iverach he sees in ultra-rational sanctions nothing else than the irrational. Right reason must be perfectly consistent with true faith ..... To throw away reason for the sake of faith is to pay too high a price for the spurious faith which we get in the barter ..... No sane man can accept by his faith what he rejects by his reason. In all right knowing of the world Dr. Minton contends there is a harmonious blending of the inductive and the deductive. Empiricism has its place, but it must go to school to metaphysics before it can be safely licensed to do business. As the world presents itself to our inspection, it is characterized by order, harmony, and beauty. But with these are mingled opposing characteristics. While the dark and enigmatic features do not cancel the testimony of nature to a wise and</page><page sequence="2">RECENT THEOLOGICAL LITERA TURE 809 beneficent author, they do disfigure the fair face of the world and call for an explanation. That explanation is found in the fact of sin. The king fell, and the kingdom fell with him. .... The world we see is not God's world as God made it. Weeds and thistles, killing frosts and blighting mildews, venomous rattlesnakes, cyclones and earthquakes, wasting disease and death - all these belong to a world which the blight of sin has cursed. As to the nature of sin, it was rightly described by Tertullian as "the great interloper." " We abhor any philosophy which openly or covertly denies the truth that the sin which our moral consciousness unqualifiedly condemns is that which ought not to be." At this point evolutionary thinking is frequently a transgressor, in that it assumes to dispose of sin as an incident of human progress. In general, the fault of the more radical evolutionary theorist consists in stretching beyond measure his hypothesis and attempting to make it cover that which it can never explain. In the interpretation of man as a factor in the cosmos, Professor Minton finds occasion to score the monistic theory, as attempting to force us to let go of a contrast-that between matter and mind - which cannot be relinquished without reducing our thought to a mean- ingless blank. He emphasizes also the fact that human personality is to be regarded as essentially homogeneous with the divine, and there- fore as furnishing an authentic mirror of the same. With the inordi- nate dread of anthropomorphism which leads to a description of God as suprapersonal he has no sympathy. " We pay our highest possible tribute to God when we conceive of him as a person ..... To call God more than personal is to make him less." Strongly emphasizing the damaging effects of sin both upon man and upon his environment, the author naturally places much stress upon the function of special revelation. Among the four possible views as to the relation between special and cosmical revelation - namely, that the former is identical with the latter, or antagonistic to the same, or a substitute for it, or supplementary to and interpretative of it-he evidently favors the last. The book is eminently readable, being rich in pithy and quotable sentences. As to subject-matter, its treatment is rather broad. Well- worded affirmation is a more prominent element than close argumenta- tion. In a few instances the affirmations are not adapted to carry conviction to all sorts of readers. We find ourselves, for instance, put into an interrogative mood by the picture which is given of the deteri-</page><page sequence="3">810 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY oration of the cosmos as a result of the Adamic trespass - a deteriora- tion assumed to have been wrought, or at least initiated, at a particular point of earthly history, since Bushnell's idea of the "anticipative con- sequences" of sin is rejected. We had supposed it to be the common conviction of scientific investigators that the world never presented a more amiable aspect than at present, and that eras of extraordinary rigor and ruthlessness preceded the advent of man. Again, we are somewhat puzzled by the author's judgment that a special advantage pertains to the Reformed theology, inasmuch as it attributes to God a facile control over human minds, and so provides for the thought that the sacred writers were made the vehicles of an inerrant message. We had believed that the course of scholarly investigation for the last two or three generations had been compelling the recognition of the truth that personal points of view on the part of the sacred writers were not fully vanquished by the divine afflatus, that these writers required edu- cative expedients, as well as inspirations, to lead them on toward the divine standpoint, and that one and another of them gave expression to sentiments that needed to be improved upon, and unmistakably were improved upon at a later stage. Either we have mistaken the verdict of biblical science, or that verdict, instead of affording a basis of self- gratulation on the part of the champion of the Reformed theology, places upon him a specially onerous task to prove his proposition that divine agency, while maintaining due respect for the human constitu- tion, can easily and fully control human thinking. The proper induc- tion would seem to be that even God encountered great obstacles to the communication of his perfect truth, and needed to overcome them by the combined use of specially noble and receptive personalities and of age-long processes. Once more, we observe what looks like an uncanceled antinomy. The author stoutly maintains that sin is an interloper, something that ought not to be. But, on the other hand, he defers to the Reformed standpoint sufficiently to affirm that "the cosmical program, as divinely purposed, embraced Adam's fall." For God to purpose what ought not to be makes at least an appearance of an antinomy. Thus there is an opportunity to challenge some items, especially on the part of those whose eyes have not been well anointed with the genuine eye-salve of the good old Reformed theology. The book, nevertheless, gives admirable expression to many important truths, and may well claim a wide circle of appreciative readers. H. C. SHELDON. BOSTON UNIVERSITY.</page></plain_text>
