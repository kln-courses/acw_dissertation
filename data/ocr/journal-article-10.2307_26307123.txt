Box 1580, Albuquerque, NM 87103-1580, USA department of Anthropology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131, USA Abstract Matacapan, a Classic-period center in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, Mexico, is known for its strong stylistic affinities with Teotihuacan. The Comoapan complex is a ceramic-production area situated along the southern edge of Matacapan. Data from Comoapan indicate that pottery manufacture was large scale and intensive, with final products distributed outside of Matacapan and possibly beyond the Tuxtlas. These data suggest that models of Tuxtlas political economy emphasizing long-term Teotihuacan administration should be reconsidered. More reasonable is a perspective that views the Tuxtlas as a source of high-quality prestige goods whose distribution is administered by local elite. Teotihuacan, a pre-Columbian urban center in Central Mexico, is featured prominently in many discussions of Classic-period (a.d. 250-900) Mesoamerican political economy. Because of its impressive character, Teotihuacan is considered a primary force conditioning the Classic-period political and economic landscape throughout Mesoamerica (e.g., Blanton et al. 1981; Millón 1988; Sanders et al. 1979; Santley 1983). Accordingly, sites exhibiting various forms of Teotihuacan "influence" have been used to reconstruct the overall scale and intensity of Teo tihuacan interaction with groups outside highland Mexico (Drennan et al. 1990; Garcia Cook 1981; Pasztory, ed. 1978; Santley et al. 1986; Stark 1989, 1990). The Sierra de los Tuxtlas, located along the southern Gulf Coast of Mexico, is one area in which evidence for Teotihuacan interaction has long been documented (Coe 1965; Parsons 1978; Valenzuela 1945a, 1945b). Matacapan, a Classic-period center situated within the Tuxtla Mountains, is particularly noteworthy for the amount and variety of Teotihuacan-style material it exhibits (Coe 1965; Santley et al. 1984, 1985, 1987; Valenzuela 1945a, 1945b). Previous discussions of Matacapan characterized the site as a Teotihuacan "port of trade" or a "way station" along a trade route linking central Mexico with the Maya Lowlands (Coe 1965:704-705; Parsons 1978). More recent descriptions of the site have suggested that Matacapan housed a Teotihuacan commercial colony or enclave (Millón 1988:125; Santley 1983; Santley et al. 1987). Sites that reportedly contained Teotihuacan enclaves are often located in special-resource areas (Santley 1983, 1989); thus, research at Matacapan has generally empha sized specialized craft production, particularly ceramic manu facture (Arnold and Santley 1993; Pool 1990a; Santley et al. 1989). In this paper we focus on the largest-scale ceramic-produc tion area at Matacapan —the Comoapan complex (Arnold 1991a: 144-148; Kneebone and Pool 1985). The location, inter nal configuration, and artifact assemblage of the Comoapan complex argue for intensive pottery making. Although impor tant in its own right, the presence of this large, intensive pro duction area has wider implications for the political economy of the Tuxtla Mountains. In the following discussion we suggest that potters at Comoa pan produced ceramic vessels for export beyond Matacapan's immediate hinterland. We suspect that Comoapan-based pro duction was oriented toward at least two distinct markets. First, certain utilitarian vessel types were supplied to consumers throughout the Tuxtlas region. Second, we believe that Comoa pan potters may have produced containers for the transport of elite commodities, such as liquidambar or honey. These com modities probably circulated within the Tuxtlas but may have also been transported outside the region. Our position is that this production and distribution system was not directly admin istered or regulated by Teotihuacan, although central Mexican elites could have benefited from this economic interaction. Rather, we suggest that Matacapan supplied a variety of exotic, "wealth" commodities to elites along the south Mexican Gulf Coast and possibly highland Mexico. Furthermore, this ex change system exhibits pronounced resilience, as it apparently continued well after Teotihuacan "influence" waned at Mata capan and disappeared elsewhere in Mesoamerica. THE COMOAPAN PRODUCTION COMPLEX Matacapan is a Classic-period urban center located within the upper Rio Catemaco Valley of the Sierra de los Tuxtlas, southern Veracruz (Figure 1). The site includes a central core containing a complex of 62 civic-ceremonial structures and range-platform architecture covering approximately 2.5 km2.

The Sierra de los Tuxtlas with major sites indicated. additional residential and public structures are distributed out ward from this center; including this suburban occupation the site covers an area in excess of 12 km2 (Santley et al. 1987). The internal chronology at Matacapan is based on ceramic seriation and radiocarbon assays (Pool 1990a: 170-177; Santley and Ortiz C. 1993). Six phases (A-F) have been identified — the first two date to the Formative period and, following an apparent occupational hiatus, the latter four span the Classic period. Classic occupation at Matacapan began in the fourth century a.d. and continued until the end of the first millennium (Table 1). Ceramic production at Matacapan was both extensive and internally differentiated. Previous research identified at least three distinct levels of production activity distributed through</page><page sequence="3">Ceramic production and political economy 177 Table 1.

(1993). out the site (Pool 1990a; Santley et al. 1989). Furthermore, production scale and intensity increased through time at Mata capan; these developments are reflected by enlargements in the area devoted to production, increases in the density of produc tion by-products within dumps, and the growth of more highly specialized production areas (Arnold and Santley 1993; Knee bone 1990). The Comoapan production area is located on the southern periphery of Matacapan, at the confluence of the Río San Joa quin, Rio Bezuapan, and Rio Catemaco (Figure 2). Classic period occupation at Comoapan dates primarily to Phase E of the Matacapan chronology, ca. a.d. 550-650 (Pool 1990a:323 324). The Comoapan complex covers an area in excess of 4 ha and includes at least 36 kilns associated with nearby waster dumps (Figure 3). Although modern occupation now covers most of the site, partially destroyed kilns and dumps are readily visible on the modern-day surface. Kilns and refuse areas tend to cluster into distinct production units (see below). Given the presence of modern occupation, it is likely that additional pro duction units existed in the past but have since been destroyed or covered over. The modern inhabitants of Comoapan do not engage in pottery manufacture. Surface collections at Comoapan were made in two phases. Artifact-recovery procedures were the same in either case —all surface material was collected from provenienced, 3-x-3-m units. The Phase I sample targeted visible firing facilities and ceramic dumps; it contained a total of 46 collections and yielded over 12,000 artifacts (Kneebone and Pool 1985; Pool 1990a: 223). Phase I collections averaged 263 sherds per unit, for a mean density of 29 sherds per m2. Highest material densities were recovered from a dump context: one collection produced 1,875 sherds, for a density of 208 sherds per m2.1 In contrast, the Phase II surface collections employed a transect sampling design comparable to that used elsewhere at Matacapan (Santley et al. 1984, 1985). The Phase II sample was obtained to evaluate material patterning outside and be tween production units. This sample included 54 collections and generated just under 3,300 artifacts (Pool 1990a:223). An av erage collection from the Phase II survey contained 63 sherds (7 sherds/m2), although one sample yielded 1,016 sherds (113 sherds/m2). Thus, surface material from the Phase I collections provides details of artifact characteristics associated with pro duction activities while the Phase II collections better represent overall artifact distributions. Nine excavations also were completed at Comoapan (Sant ley et al. 1984). Six of these excavations were placed within a 150 m2 area designated as Operation VI (Figure 4). Work in Operation VI stratigraphically exposed the remains of four kilns and an associated waster dump (Kneebone and Pool 1985; Sant ley et al. 1989). Excavations within the dump produced over 33,500 sherds from approximately 6.25 m3 of fill, averaging 5,364 sherds per m3 (Arnold 1991a: 147; Pool 1990a:228). The three additional stratigraphic excavations were undertaken else where in the Comoapan complex to identify variability in kiln morphology and manufacturing activities. In total, more than 63,000 artifacts were recovered from the Comoapan complex. The artifact assemblage from Comoapan is noteworthy for the paucity of recovered residential debris. No architectural features were encountered during excavations, nor did we re cover faunal and botanical household refuse (Pool 1990a:301). Furthermore, surface artifact ratios at Comoapan are strikingly different from other surface-surveyed domestic contexts at Ma tacapan. Matacapan domestic contexts exhibit ratios of ceram ics to obsidian, figurines, and ground stone of 42:1, 333:1, and 1986:1, respectively. In contrast, the same ratios at the Comoa pan complex are 124:1, 524:1, and 8127:1. Domestic areas out side of Comoapan, therefore, contain almost three times as much obsidian, over 1.5 times as many figurines, and over four times as much ground stone relative to sherds (Santley et al. 1989:119). Obviously, pottery-making activities at Comoapan inflate the number of sherds recovered in comparison to other contexts. Given the lack of additional evidence to suggest do mestic occupation, and the character of ceramic production activities (see below), we believe that Comoapan was a nonres idential, specialized locality. EVIDENCE FOR CERAMIC PRODUCTION AT COMOAPAN In the following section we present the production evidence from Comoapan. Five production areas at Matacapan (includ ing Comoapan) have been the focus of previous analyses (Pool 1990a). For this discussion we compare rim-sherd samples from Comoapan with aggregate rim-sherd samples from the four other production areas at Matacapan.2 It should be noted that kilns occur in all five areas; thus, variations in the frequencies of wares, forms, surface treatments, and firing errors cannot be attributed simply to different firing techniques. Rather, we feel that these differences point to the unique scale and production organization of the Comoapan complex at Matacapan. 'The high artifact frequencies encountered at Comoapan do not appear to be an artificial product of trampling or breakage associated with the modern-day occupation (Kneebone 1990:186-187). Nor is the area under agricultural production, so plowing does not appear to be a factor. On average, sherds from Comoapan are larger than those re covered from collections in plowed fields made throughout Matacapan (Pool 1990a:222-223). Larger sherd size is consonant with kiln-firing loci, since potters often select larger sherds to cover and insulate the kiln while firing (Arnold 1991a:54). 2Most of these data derive from Pool's (1990a) comparative anal ysis of five pottery-production areas (including Comoapan) located throughout Matacapan. Pool's (1990a) research incorporates metric analyses of vessel forms and physicochemical analyses of ceramic pastes from these separate pottery-making locales. For a full discussion of the methods used to derive the rim sample, see Pool (1990a:196-216). Al though collapsing the data from the remaining four production samples may obscure some of their own internal variability, the sample presents the best data base for comparison with the Comoapan complex.</page><page sequence="4">178 Arnold et al.

The Comoapan production complex, showing locations of surface-collection units (after Santley et al. 1989). Our discussion is organized into four sections. First we con sider the evidence for the acquisition and preparation of raw materials at Comoapan. Next we discuss the evidence for vessel formation and decoration, and supply information on frequency of wares and forms produced at the Comoapan complex. Third, we describe firing techniques practiced at the site. Finally, un der the general topic of production organization, we treat the related issues of production output and the spatial configura tion of the production area. Raw-Material Acquisition/Preparation Four classes of raw material are important for pottery making: clay, temper, water, and fuel. All four were readily available to Comoapan potters. As suggested below, however, they may have exploited resources not utilized by potters elsewhere in Ma tacapan. The clay used at Comoapan derives from calcareous, kaolin itic clay-bearing sediments (Pool 1990a:307). Geological recon naissance of clay deposits in the southwestern Tuxtlas indicates that clay outcrops of this deposit occur within .5 km of Co moapan (Pool 1990a). X-ray fluorescence analyses of fine-paste ceramics from Comoapan suggest that these potters exploited a purer source of clay than their contemporaries working else where in Matacapan (Pool 1990a:259, 313, 324). Coarse-paste wares produced in Comoapan are usually tem pered with volcanic ash, quartz, and feldspar. In fact, volcanic temper is a defining attribute of Coarse Orange, the most com</page><page sequence="6">1 80 Arnold et al. Figure 4.

Volcanic ash occurs as beds and lenses in the alluvium of the Rio Catemaco valley, and is redeposited along stream banks. Due to the exten sive nature of ash deposits, the temper source exploited by Co moapan producers has not been located specifically. Judging from contemporary potters in the region, however, Comoapan producers probably exploited volcanic ash deposits within a ra dius of 1 km (Arnold 1991a:24). A unique characteristic of the Comoapan sample is the absence of macroscopic calcareous aplastics within the major fine-paste and coarse-paste wares (Pool 1990a:Table 12). Water, of course, is a central ingredient in vessel pastes as well as decorative slips and washes (e.g., Rice 1987a:54). The river adjacent to Comoapan supplies a close, dependable source of water, ca. 100 m away. Ash deposits in the Comoapan kilns were too fine to iden tify the type of fuel used in vessel firing. Elsewhere in Mataca pan, Pool (1990a: 241) encountered burnt leaf stalks and seeds</page><page sequence="7">Ceramic production and political economy 181 from the coyol redondo palm in kiln-associated contexts. Pris matic obsidian blades recovered at Comoapan would have been effective for trimming this soft fuel (Santley et al. 1989:119). Vessel Forms and Decorations Three wares constitute the overwhelming majority of excavated rim sherds recovered at Comoapan: Fine Orange (15.9%), Coarse Brown (15.8%), and Coarse Orange (63.4%) (Pool 1990a:301). As their respective names suggest, these wares dif fer primarily in the character of aplastic inclusions, surface color, and paste hardness. Although these wares were expressed in a wide variety of vessel forms throughout Matacapan's his tory (Santley and Ortiz C. 1993; Santley et al. 1989), within the Comoapan complex there are distinct patterns of specific form classes associated with specific wares. Forms. Over 80% of Fine Orange rims at Comoapan occur as flat-bottomed, low-walled dishes (Figure 5a). This pattern contrasts with the distribution of Fine Orange rims in produc tion contexts elsewhere in Matacapan, where plate and bowl forms predominate (Pool 1990a:290). Coarse Brown rims recov ered from the Comoapan complex were most often rendered as a restricted-neck jar (Figure 5b). Although they occur in rela tively low frequencies, Coarse Brown vessels of this form are found in production contexts throughout Matacapan (Pool 1990a:294; Santley et al. 1989:124). Coarse Orange pottery at Comoapan was most frequently produced in two jar types: a neckless form (Figure 5c) and a necked variety (Figure 5d). Coarse Orange neckless jars constitute over 30% of all rims from the Comoapan sample, while necked jars of this ware make up 26.5% of the Comoapan sample. Surprisingly, no other excavated production context at Matacapan exhibits more than 2% neckless or 7.5% necked Coarse Orange jars (Pool 1990a:295-296). Specific construction techniques are difficult to identify in the Comoapan assemblage. This unfortunate fact is the result of surface-finishing practices (e.g., wet-paste smoothing, bur nishing) that tend to obscure traces of earlier shaping techniques (Pool 1990a:270). Scraping, to shape and thin vessel walls, was the only forming technique that could be consistently identified. Despite this fact, indirect evidence exits for construction techniques practiced by the Comoapan potters. In the first place, evidence for mold-made pottery is equivocal. Although molds may have been used to form vessel bases, they apparently were not used to form vessel rims. Furthermore, no identifiable FORM 5 7 FORM 7 (a) / I V FORM 38 (C) m FORM 75 (b) (d) Figure 5.

Finally, a lack of mold-making techniques is sug gested by the general lack of metric standardization exhibited within the Comoapan assemblage (Pool 1990a:Appendix D). The use of molds is commonly associated with a dimensionally homogeneous assemblage within size classes (cf. Arnold 1991b). Laminar fractures occur in a small percentage of the Comoa pan sample; these fractures are usually produced when a paddle is used to form and thin vessel walls (Rye 1981:85). Coil-line breaks are evident, although infrequently, in both Brown and Orange coarse wares at Comoapan. These breaks usually occur at the base of the neck of coarse-ware jars. This manufacturing error suggests that the upper portions of jars were manufactured separately and then attached to the jar bodies (Pool 1990a:265). Surface finishing/decoration. Surface-finishing and decorative techniques are well developed within the Matacapan ceramic industry. These procedures include burnishing, polishing, paint ing, slipping, and incision. Like the above pattern for wares and vessel classes, however, the Comoapan complex differs from other Matacapan production areas in terms of the specific com binations of techniques. While some of this variability may be attributed to chronological differences within the entire assem blage (Santley and Ortiz C. 1993), much of it appears to result from specific production emphases at Comoapan. The Fine Orange sample from Comoapan differs significantly from other production-area samples in regard to surface treat ments (Table 2). Dry paste (including leather-hard) smoothing, found in over 30% of the remaining Matacapan production sample, is virtually absent from the Comoapan Fine Orange assemblage. In contrast, wet-paste smoothing is three to four times more common within the Comoapan sample than at other production locales. Scraping, present in 14% of the other pro Table 2.

Incised Fine Orange interiors are practically nonexistent in all production areas. Exterior incision, however, is more than seven times more likely to occur in production contexts outside of Comoapan. Finally, monochrome paints are almost always applied over slips at Comoapan; at the remaining production areas paints are more commonly applied directly to the vessel surface. Exterior brushing is unique to Coarse Brown pottery and occurs in comparable proportions in all production contexts (Table 3). Scraping, however, is more than twice as common in the Comoapan sample than in other production areas in Mata capan. Moreover, wet smoothing over scraping, evident in all other production locales, is completely absent from the Comoa pan assemblage. In total, Coarse Brown at Comoapan was pro duced using only three surface treatments and two kinds of surface coatings, about half the number for other production areas. The Coarse Brown assemblage at Comoapan is the "least variable," reflecting a "relative poverty of [manufacturing] tech niques" (Pool 1990a:282). Except for brushing, Coarse Orange pottery is produced with the same general suite of techniques used to manufacture Coarse Brown (Pool 1990a:283). Scraping, however, is much less fre quent in the Comoapan sample than in other production areas (Table 4). Moreover, Coarse Orange ceramics from Comoapan constitute the only production sample in which dry smoothing did not occur. On the other hand, interior and exterior slipping were 5 to 6 times more prevalent in the Comoapan material than at other production locales. As a corollary, painting directly on the vessel surface was approximately four times more common outside of Comoapan. As with the Coarse Brown data, the Coarse Orange assemblage at Comoapan is less variable than elsewhere, but at the same time suggests more labor-intensive production (Pool 1990a:284-285). Firing Technology As indicated above, pottery firing at Comoapan included the use of kilns (Figure 6). Excavations of several of these features show Table 3.

Kilns were constructed of puddled fiber-tempered adobe. Kiln interiors were apparently separated into a lower firebox (for fuel) and an upper firing chamber (for pottery). This division was accomplished with the use of a central post that supported a grate of plano-convex adobe "arches" running radially from the central post to the kiln walls (Figure 7). The vitrified interior walls of the firebox attest to the relatively high, sustained temperatures achieved within these facilities. Few in situ traces of the upper kiln walls were detected in any of the excavated facilities, probably due to erosion, modern oc cupation, or intrinsic structural weakness of the firing chamber. Wall fragments usually display a color gradation from the in Figure 6. Partially excavated kiln at Comoapan. Upper walls have been destroyed, but the central post, adobe arches, air vents, and firebox are still visible. Firebox Adobe Figure 7. Plan view, and cross section of Comoapan kiln. Cross-sectioned area marked as "B." terior wall surface to exterior, suggesting that the exterior por tions of the kiln may have remained relatively softer and less durable. Contemporary kilns in the Tuxtla region (also made with fiber-tempered adobe) exhibit a similar pattern of differ ential firing. The ratio of wall height to interior diameter for these modern kilns is approximately 1:1.21 (Arnold 1991a:54). Applying this ratio to the Comoapan facilities suggests a height of 1.82 m. Although most of the excavated kilns were partially col lapsed, one better-preserved example provides evidence for the possible manipulation of firing conditions. Access to the kiln's firebox was through a tunnel-like entrance approximately 30 cm wide. A large basalt stone was found blocking the entrance, sug gesting that the tunnel could be closed to control the flow of ox ygen and thus alter the firing atmosphere. In general, kiln entrances do not appear to be oriented toward prevailing winds, as reported for kilns in Nayarit (Bordaz 1964:45) and Puebla Tlaxcala (Abascal 1975:190-191). Rather, entrances are placed on the downslope side of the kilns, probably for protection from runoff produced by the torrential rains common throughout the region (Arnold 1991a: 18-20, 145; Kneebone and Pool 1985). Fire-related production errors, such as spalling and laminar fractures, are less common at Comoapan than elsewhere at Ma tacapan (Pool 1990a:Table 14). Only 25.9% of the Fine Orange ceramics from the Comoapan sample exhibited production er rors, while almost 50% of the Fine Orange from the remaining production areas contained firing mistakes. Moreover, modal hardness values (measured on the Mohs' scale) for the Comoa pan Fine Orange sherds are higher than the values derived from the other production areas. This pattern suggests higher firing temperatures and greater firing control (Pool 1990a:258). A similar pattern occurs for the coarse wares. Production er rors are less common in the Comoapan Coarse Brown sample (37.5%) than in the other production areas (52.81%). For ex ample, just under 10% of the Comoapan Coarse Brown was marred by fire clouds, compared to over 25% for the remain ing production areas. Within the Coarse Orange sample from Comoapan almost 75% of this ware exhibited no production er</page><page sequence="10">184 Arnold et al. rors. The comparable figure for Coarse Orange from the re maining production areas is slightly over 50%. Spalling occurs less frequently within the fine- and coarse-paste wares in the Co moapan sample, possibly resulting from the absence of calcar eous aplastics noted previously. Moreover, the modal Mohs' hardness value for Coarse Orange jars from Comoapan is 3.5, as compared with a 2.5 modal hardness value from the other production areas. Production Organization We use the term "production organization" in a generic way to combine the notions of scale (i.e., unit size and output), with the concept of mode (i.e., location and arrangement of produc tion activities) (e.g., Rice 1987a:170). Production organization obviously involves many of the topics already treated, but also includes certain aspects of the Comoapan complex that have not been discussed. Included here are production output, the spa tial arrangement of production facilities, and the distribution of the finished product. Each of these is treated below. Production output. The details of Comoapan's emphasis on specific forms and wares have already been discussed. This em phasis is manifest in the overwhelming production of one fine paste ware and two coarse-paste wares. Fine Orange was most commonly produced as a dish, Coarse Brown was usually ren dered as a necked jar, and Coarse Orange most frequently took the form of either a necked or neckless jar. Artifact densities are also relevant to the question of produc tion output. Surface collections and excavations at the Comoa pan complex clearly document the unusually high number of sherds present at the site. As noted above, a partially excavated dump at Comoapan produced subsurface densities on the or der of 5,364 sherds per m3. This figure is almost twice the av erage of the highest subsurface densities from production dumps in the four other firing areas that were studied in detail (2294.5 sherds/m3). A tentative estimate of the number of produced vessels can be derived from the excavated dump. Based on rim counts, and correcting for estimated rates of firing loss and midden size, the total Comoapan production output during the latter half of the Middle Classic probably exceeded one-half million vessels (Ar nold 1987:357-361). Translated into storage capacity, Coarse Orange jar production may have generated several million liters of storage during this same period (Kneebone 1990:238-239). The relation between the production and consumption of Coarse Orange also speaks to production output. The data sug gest that more Coarse Orange vessels were produced at Mata capan than were consumed by the site's inhabitants. Surface collections at Comoapan yielded 1,933 Coarse Orange sherds (sampled at .81% of Comoapan surface area) compared with 5,216 Coarse Orange sherds from nonproduction surface con texts in Matacapan (sampled at .46% surface area). After cor recting for the difference in sampling intensities the Comoapan figure falls to 1101.81 sherds. We must, however, also consider the fact that the Comoapan assemblage is the result of produc tion activities and primarily reflects the waste material gener ated by vessel manufacture. Assuming that only one-fifth of the vessels are represented (i.e., a 20% firing loss [Rice 1987a:Ta ble 6.1]) the Comoapan value increases to 5509.05, a figure greater than the value for the nonproduction areas at Mataca pan. Comoapan, however, was not the only production area that manufactured Coarse Orange ceramics (Pool 1990a; Sant ley et al. 1989). While admittedly coarse grained, this simple comparison supports the view that Coarse Orange production was directed toward a market that included consumers outside of Matacapan and perhaps the Tuxtlas region. Location and spatial arrangement of facilities. Comoapan is lo cated on Matacapan's southern edge, away from the majority of residential occupation. The lack of habitation debris suggests that Comoapan is a specialized activity area, although domes tic occupation may have occurred immediately outside the sur vey zone. The kilns and refuse middens at Comoapan cluster into eight discrete production units. Each of these units is composed of several kilns, often at regularly spaced intervals, situated around the margins of a central dump. Distances between kilns and dumps average approximately 6.5 m (Arnold 1987:254). The types of pottery made are relatively constant from unit to unit, with Coarse Orange the favored product. Some production spe cialization is suggested, however; the majority of Coarse Brown and Fine Orange were fired at only two production units in Comoapan. Evidence for nonfiring production activities within the production units is rare, although some equivocal evidence exists.3 At the same time, production-related tools such as ground stone (for processing clays and temper), polishing im plements, or molds are almost nonexistent in survey and exca vation assemblages. The overall ratio of kilns to dumps is almost 3.3:1. Thus, each waster dump constitutes the refuse deposit for at least three separate kilns. The fact that several kilns apparently contribute to a single dump within each unit suggests that many of the kilns within each production unit operated simultaneously. Ethno graphic accounts of production organization support this con clusion. Detailed accounts of the spatial arrangement of ceramic production underscore the effects of manufacturing intensity on the internal organization of production areas (DeBoer and Lathrap 1979; Peacock 1982; Siegel and Roe 1986; Stark 1984). Among nonintensive potters who use kilns, production debris often accumulates immediately around an individual firing fa cility. In fact, potters purposefully maintain such deposits next to the kiln and use broken ceramics as saggars and kiln lids (Rice 1987a:Figure 6.1). With the economies of scale brought about by intensified production, however, firing areas are organized in order to expedite refuse management (Arnold 1991a; Knee bone 1990). The result is a production unit in which several kilns contribute to a single dump. Thus, rather than a kiln-to-dump ratio of 1:1, simultaneous use of several kilns within a production unit increases the number of firing facilities relative to dumps. 3Two features encountered during the Operation VI excavations may relate to raw-material processing (Pool 1990a:230). Excavation re vealed two U-shaped drains carved from consolidated volcanic ash (laja) and laid end to end. Each block was 30 cm wide and together the two measured just under 1 m in length. A large rectangular block of laja cov ered the lower portion of the drain, and several pieces of broken tabu lar basalt covered the remaining portion. A basalt metate, resting on end, was found near the upslope end of the feature. A second feature includes a lens of volcanic ash encountered dur ing excavation and located near one of the kilns (Pool 1990a:230). This ash may have been used as temper. If valid, these two lines of evidence suggest that firing may not have been the only activity conducted at Comoapan.</page><page sequence="11">Ceramic production arid political economy 185 Discussion What can be made of these various patterns within the Comoa pan production complex? We believe that the separate lines of evidence, taken together, clearly indicate intensive ceramic pro duction, possibly at the level of a nucleated industry (Pool 1990a:301; Santley et al. 1989:120). Nucleated industries are ag gregates of independent workshops located within a particular area of the community (Peacock 1982; Santley et al. 1989:110). These workshops are characterized by high-volume production and, as a result, are situated away from areas of residential oc cupation (Nicklin 1979). The location of nucleated industries is also conditioned by access to distribution networks, such as riv ers, that facilitate the movement of finished products. The over all redundancy in production output at Comoapan suggests that these units were relatively autonomous, while material densities suggest high output and large-scale production. Finally, the spa tial association of kilns and dumps implies that kilns were used simultaneously within production units. This fact also implicates more-intensive ceramic manufacture. In a recent article, Costin (1991) suggested that a previous discussion of Comoapan (Santley et al. 1989:119) confused the size of the production complex with the scale of manufacture. Costin (1991:29) stated that Comoapan was interpreted as "a single, large-scale facility (manufactory) because of the wide ex tent of production debris (in this case, kilns and waster dumps)." It is clear from this statement that Costin (1991) has misun derstood the initial characterization of Comoapan. First of all, no conclusion was drawn to the effect that Comoapan was "a single, large-scale facility." To the contrary, Santley et al. (1989:119) state that "the kilns at Comoapan occur in clusters, often around a waster dump, indicating that the area was used by different groups of potters who fired pottery in separate batches. Work groups of this type are generally found in nucle ated industries" (emphasis added). Secondly, the identification of Comoapan as an area of in tensive pottery making was based on a combination of variables including the highly skewed production assemblage, the lack of domestic artifacts in surface and excavated contexts, and the area's strategic location along the Rio Catemaco (Santley et al. 1989:119-120). Coupled with the information presented above, it should be clear that Comoapan is organizationally different from smaller-scale production areas reported at Matacapan (Ar nold and Santley 1993; Pool 1990a; Santley et al. 1989). Thus, Comoapan is not a large-scale production area because of its size or the number of facilities; it is an area of intensive ceramic manufacture because the configuration of firing facilities and dumps are apparently organized to take advantage of economies of scale. Comoapan potters were concerned with production ef ficiency and attempted to use space in an efficient manner. An emphasis on efficient production is regarded as an important criterion of production organization: "For independent special ists, the primary factor determining the scale of production is efficiency" (Costin 1991:15). EXCHANGE OF COMOAPAN CERAMICS Given our interpretation that Comoapan was part of a large scale production effort geared toward the manufacture of util itarian jars, a reasonable question would be "where did all of these jars go?" The number of vessels produced at Matacapan certainly exceeded the consumption requirements of the com munity's population. Consequently, it is likely that Comoapan pottery was manufactured for distribution throughout the Tux tlas and perhaps beyond the region. This inference is supported by several lines of evidence. First, Coarse Orange, the primary ware manufactured at Comoapan, rarely occurs in abundance within domestic contexts at Mata capan or within settlements throughout the countryside (Sant ley et al. 1991). Second, although physicochemical analyses of Coarse Orange ceramics from rural Tuxtlas sites are pending, much of this pottery is morphologically similar to the material from Comoapan, suggesting a common production source. Transportation costs are a major consideration affecting the pre-Columbian distribution of ceramics (Drennan 1984; Has sig 1985). Ceramics are notoriously difficult to transport on foot —pottery is bulky, heavy, and fragile. Water-borne trans port, however, would have significantly reduced the cost of moving pottery vessels (Sanders and Santley 1983); for this rea son we suspect that Comoapan was positioned along the Rio Catemaco, the main water route leading through the Tuxtlas and down into the surrounding lowlands (Santley et al. 1989: 127). A portage would have been necessary to move the goods past the downstream waterfall at Eyipantla. Recent survey has identified a large site with monumental architecture at this spot (Santley et al. 1991). Utilitarian ceramics are perhaps the least likely kind of pot tery to be traded appreciable distances (Hassig 1985; Sanders and Santley 1983). Nonetheless, producers of utilitarian wares can acquire a reputation for manufacturing particularly desir able goods and thereby achieve a preferential market status and widespread product distribution. For example, potters in the highland Guatemalan community of Chinautla have earned a reputation for producing high-quality tinajas (water jars) (Reina and Hill 1978). Despite the utilitarian nature of this product, Chinautla tinajas are found throughout the region — according to Reina and Hill (1978:31), these jars are "one of the most char acteristic, famous, and widely used hand-formed vessels made in Guatemala." Comoapan products may have earned a simi lar reputation, albeit on a considerably smaller scale and with out the benefit of modern transportation. In addition to their regional distribution, a portion of the Comoapan ceramics may have circulated within an extrare gional exchange system. In this case, however, we doubt that the intrinsic desirability of the utilitarian vessel was a significant factor. Nor would the added efficiency of canoe transportation have been sufficient to offset the additional cost of long-distance exchange involving large quantities of pottery. Rather, it is pos sible that small numbers of Comoapan jars were used to store and transport wealth or prestige items beyond the Tuxtlas (e.g., Fry 1980:12). Ethnohistoric data support this possibility. In general, the southern Gulf Coast was considered a land of plenty by the early Spanish chroniclers (Coe and Diehl 1980a: 12; Sahagún 1961, cited in Stark 1974:204; Scholes and Warren 1965). Aztec trib ute lists echo that sentiment (Barlow 1949; Hassig 1985; Stark 1974). According to the Codex Mendoza (Scholes and Warren 1965:777), a wide variety of desirable commodities were ex tracted from Tochtepec, a province that included the Tuxtlas. Cotton, cacao, and the feathers of tropical birds are well-known tribute items from this region (Barlow 1949; Drennan 1984; Stark 1974). In addition, the Aztecs demanded liquidambar sap</page><page sequence="12">186 Arnold et al. (Scholes and Warren 1965:777), a medicinal tree resin used to treat a variety of ailments (Lackey 1986:214-215). The Tuxtlas is home to at least one species of the liquidambar tree: Liquid ambar macrophylla (Gómez-Pompa 1973).4 Honey is another commodity that may have required containers for distribution (e.g., Coe and Diehl 1980a: 14). Ceramic vessels produced at Co moapan could have played a role in transporting such elite liq uid commodities out of Matacapan during the Classic period. THE ROLE OF TEOTIHUACAN IN THE TUXTLAS POLITICAL ECONOMY Archaeological research at Matacapan has established strong ties between Teotihuacan and the Tuxtlas (Millon 1988:124-126; Santley et al. 1987). Survey and excavations at Matacapan have yielded large quantities of artifacts reproduced or "quoted" (Stark 1989:141) in Teotihuacan style; such items include talud tablero architecture, cylindrical tripod vessels, candeleros, and figurines (Kann 1990; Santley etal. 1985, 1987; Valenzuela 1945a). In fact, Matacapan exceeds Kaminaljuyu —the quintessential Teotihuacan affiliate (Sanders and Michels 1977) —in the quan tity and diversity of material that imply central Mexican con nections (Santley 1989:136-138; Santley et al. 1987). Before 1980, evidence from Matacapan suggested that Teo tihuacan-style material was confined largely to the central civic ceremonial portion of the site (Coe 1965; Ortiz C. 1975; Santley et al. 1984; Valenzuela 1945a). Thus, it appeared that a distinct, segregated "barrio" was responsible for the majority of Teoti huacan-related material. The possibility of such a localized oc cupation led Santley (1983) to propose that Matacapan supported a Teotihuacan commercial enclave, integrated within a macro regional production and exchange system dominated by Teoti huacan. Continued research at Matacapan allowed us to refine this initial thesis. Subsequent fieldwork demonstrated that Teotihua can-style material was not limited to a barrio; rather, these di agnostics were encountered throughout the site and in a variety of contexts (urban and suburban, elite and nonelite, specialist and nonspecialist) (Santley 1989; Santley et al. 1987). The wide spread occurrence of this material indicates community-wide connections with Teotihuacan, not the highly regulated inter action implied by the barrio model (Kneebone 1990:124). In addition to Teotihuacan-style material at Matacapan, probable Matacapan material has also been recovered from Te otihuacan. Tlamimilolpa (a.d. 300-500) deposits at the "Mer chant's Barrio" in Teotihuacan contain pottery that is very similar to the Red-on-fine-orange ware manufactured at Mata capan (Millon 1988:126; Rattray 1987). Red-on-fine-orange at Matacapan is considered to be a Phase D (a.d. 450-550) diag nostic (Pool 1990a:173). If correct, the appearance of Tuxtlas Red-on-fine-orange at Teotihuacan suggests a relatively rapid movement of this ceramic from the Gulf Coast to the central Mexican highlands. Models of Teotihuacan/Gulf Coast Interaction Interpretations of Teotihuacan's relationship with the Gulf Coast are varied (Stark 1990), but usually conform to one of three models: (1) imperial conquest, (2) commercial expansion, and (3) elite alliances (Santley and Pool 1993; Stark 1989:142). Imperial conquest implies an Aztec-like hegemony, in which Te otihuacan physically conquered and controlled key sites outside the Basin of Mexico. Tribute extraction, rather than territorial expansion, would be the likely impetus for this militaristic ac tivity. A model of Teotihuacan interaction founded on militarism is doubtful for several reasons. Foremost is the demographic issue —Middle Classic population size in the Basin of Mexico was probably too small to support long-term, distant military campaigns (Sanders 1989:214; Santley 1983:77; Stark 1989:142). Relatively brief forays may have been possible, but not the repeated excursions that characterized the later Aztec empire. Second, imperial conquest and tribute extraction is often accom panied by some degree of system reorganization. Although ev idence for Teotihuacan's involvement in restructuring settlement patterns occurs at sites closer to the Basin of Mexico, such as in Morelos (Hirth 1978), such evidence is lacking within areas that display the greatest amount of Teotihuacan influence (i.e., Kaminaljuyu [Brown 1977:354] and Matacapan [Santley et al. 1985, 1987]). The second model emphasizes economic prowess at the ex pense of military might. Santley (1983; Santley et al. 1986) has suggested that Teotihuacan monopolized the production and distribution of Pachuca obsidian, thereby supporting the site's administration through long-distance trade and "discriminatory pricing" policies (Sanders and Santley 1983:285-286). Evidence for intensive lithic production at Teotihuacan (e.g., Santley 1983; Spence 1986) is a central tenent of this commercial-expan sion model. Clark (1986) offers a third alternative. He disputes the lithic-production evidence from Teotihuacan and suggests that researchers have exaggerated the volume of Pachuca obsidian both at Teotihuacan and throughout Mesoamerica. According to this argument, the intensity of obsidian production and ex change at Teotihuacan was not sufficient to underwrite the ad ministrative costs of a large metropolitan center. Instead, Clark (1986:65-68) supports the position that "intermarrying elites" used Teotihuacan material (including Pachuca obsidian) as a status symbol. These prestige goods allowed elites to participate in a system of self-identification and sociopolitical self-pro motion. Both of these latter models make valid points. For example, it is likely, as Clark (1986) suggests, that initial estimates of ob sidian production at Teotihuacan warrant recalculation (Santley 1989:134; Santley and Pool 1993). At the same time, it appears that Clark (1986) has minimized the degree to which Teotihua can "influence" is encountered throughout Mesoamerica (Mil Ion 1988; Pasztory 1978). We find it difficult to attribute the extensive distribution of Teotihuacan-related material to the 4Lackey (1986:214) identifies Liquidambar stryaciflua as the species from which Aztec liquidambar was derived. Within the United States this particular species is usually characterized as deciduous. Miranda and Sharp (1950:318), however, indicate that Liquidambar stryaciflua in the southern latitudes is "not as clearly deciduous" as that found in the northern latitudes. Furthermore, in discussing a Liquidambar forest on the Veracruz/Puebla border, they state: "the abundance of tropical el ements in the . . . forest is probably due to its proximity to the lower altitudinal limits (about 1,065 m) for Liquidambar forests where they are usually adjacent to the tropical montane rainforest" (Miranda and Sharp 1950:322). Given the extensive deforestation that characterizes much of the Gulf Coast, we believe it possible that the Tuxtlas supported more than one species of Liquidambar in the past (Lackey 1986:215 216).</page><page sequence="13">Ceramic production and political economy 187 wishful thinking of "a small population of foreign elites" (Clark 1986:69). Thus, Santley's (1983:70) emphasis on the "extreme degree to which the economy at [Teotihuacan] was geared to long-distance trade" seems more appropriate. Both Santley (1983:110) and Clark (1986:65) agree, however, that exotics, rather than foodstuffs, were the focus of this ex change system. The difference, ultimately, is one of scale and perspective — Santley (1983) perceives a large-scale system and emphasizes the benefits to Teotihuacan. Clark (1986) advocates a considerably smaller exchange system and considers the po tential benefits to those participants outside the central Mexi can highlands. We believe that the most appropriate model for Teotihuacan "influence" in the Tuxtlas combines the best of Santley's (1983) and Clark's (1986) perspectives. Our position is that Teotihua can participated in an intensive and far-reaching economic net work that exchanged central Mexican obsidian and other items for exotic resources unavailable in the Basin of Mexico (Dren nan et al. 1990; Stark 1990:252). Teotihuacan elites would have used these prestige items for conspicuous consumption, for gifts, or for other activities. Similarly, beneficiaries at the other end of this exchange system would have used their Teotihuacan symbols in whatever way best suited their specific needs — socio political legitimization, political alliance, or economic benefit (Pool 1990b). We should not, however, expect these different groups to have employed their Teotihuacan material in the same manner or for the same purpose. Nor should we assume that Teotihuacan influence necessarily translated into Teotihuacan dominance. As the specific circumstances of each group varied, so too did the role of Teotihuacan symbols within their partic ular cultural system. Matacapan after Teotihuacan Teotihuacan had an obvious impact on the political economy of Matacapan (Millón 1988:124-126; Santley et al. 1987). In fact, the fourth-century development of Matacapan was prob ably tied directly to highland Mexican interest in Gulf Coast re sources (Pool 1990b; Santley et al. 1987). At the same time, it now appears that Matacapan became more autonomous during the Classic period than previously suspected (Santley and Pool 1993). This fact is perhaps best reflected in what happens at Ma tacapan after Teotihuacan influence wanes. The imitation of Teotihuacan styles at Matacapan declines appreciably after a.d. 650 (Santley and Ortiz C. 1993). At this time Matacapan underwent significant internal reorganization. This shift is apparent in an overall population decline and al tered patterns of settlement location and nucleation. Population estimates for the period following a.d. 650 at Matacapan are less than one-half of those during the site's apogee (Kneebone 1990:244; Santley 1989:143). Kneebone (1990:203) notes the dis continuous residential distribution during this time period, in which localized pockets of occupation are interspersed with emptier zones of equal or larger area. The central civic-ceremo nial portion of the site was largely abandoned and high-status activity appears to have moved toward the eastern part of the site (Kneebone 1990:212). The ceramic assemblage of the post-A.D. 650 site also under went pronounced changes (Pool 1990a; Santley and Ortiz C. 1993). Fine Gray ceramics dominated deposits. Tuxtlas Poly chrome, a ware found occasionally in earlier contexts, also be came popular and is an important diagnostic of this period (Pool 1990a:173). These trends suggest that reduced interaction with Teotihua can had significant repercussions for Matacapan's population. At the same time, a continuation, if not an intensification, of certain economic activities apparently occurred. In other words, Teotihuacan's demise did not sound the death knell for the political economy at Matacapan. Rather, the system quickly adapted to other potential markets and may have witnessed in tensified craft production (Arnold 1991a: 148—151; Kneebone 1990:245). To a large degree, the Comoapan complex foreshadowed this intensification. Less-intensive pottery making at Matacapan, however, also reorganized (Arnold and Santley 1993; Kneebone 1990:228-239). As noted above, the proportion of hectares con taining evidence for domestic occupation declined after a.d. 650. In contrast, the proportion of hectares containing surface evidence for pottery production increased approximately 11 % following a.d. 650. This change resulted in an estimated increase in production activity ranging between 60°7o and 170% at Ma tacapan after a.d. 650, with significant nucleation of pottery making activities (Kneebone 1990:232, 237). The increased importance of cotton production is also sug gested for this period (Hall 1989; Kann 1990). Spindle whorls are found throughout the site before a.d. 650 (Hall 1989). The ratio of spindle whorls to excavated ceramics during this period, however, is lower than the same ratio for post-A.D. 650 depos its. Furthermore, areas of the site that contain spindle whorls become increasingly concentrated through time, suggesting a greater nucleation of cotton spinning (Hall 1989). According to Hall's (1989) analysis, post-A.D. 650 weavers at Matacapan were participants in a "suprahousehold economic activity." The flow of cultural material into and out of Matacapan in dicates continued later Classic-period interaction with outside groups. For example, access to Pachuca obsidian following the "withdrawal" of Teotihuacan does not appear to be adversely affected. In fact, the per-capita consumption of both green and gray obsidian increased at Matacapan after a.d. 650 (Kneebone 1990:245; Santley 1989:140, 143). Later Classic-period trade wares also occur within the site. Excavations revealed increased frequencies of ceramics from the northern Veracruz center of El Tajin, as well as hollow, mold made figurines rendered in Lowland Maya style (Kann 1990; Santley and Ortiz C. 1993; Santley et al. 1987:47). The ceramic assemblage from Matacapan includes an imitation of Plumbate ware (Santley et al. 1992), a distinctive Pacific Coast trade ware. Plumbate probably originated during the Middle-to-Late Clas sic transition in Mesoamerica, but became a popular trade item during the Late Classic and Early Postclassic periods (Neff 1989; Neff and Bishop 1988). Excavated artifacts from Mata capan also include copper bells and rings (Coe 1965:711; Sant ley et al. 1992; Valenzuela 1945a), another indication of contact with the Pacific Coast toward the end of the Classic period (e.g., Hosier 1988). Finally, archaeological research at Patarata (Stark 1989) and La Mixtequilla (Stark 1990) to the west of the Tuxtlas shows a marked increase in the frequency of Tuxtlas polychrome during this period (Stark 1989, 1990). The presence of this material sug gests that Tuxtlas polychrome may constitute an imported trade ware (Stark 1989:147, 1990:272). Tuxtlas Red-on-fine-orange, recovered at Teotihuacan, is not reported from either area.</page><page sequence="14">188 Arnold et al. Thus, ample evidence indicates that Matacapan continued to engage in long-distance interaction following the end of Teo tihuacan influence. Moreover, an increase occurred in the scale and intensity of ceramic production and possibly other crafts. We suspect that the retrenchment of Teotihuacan presented new political and economic opportunities to a number of smaller pol ities located throughout Mesoamerica (Diehl and Berlo 1989: 3-4; Pasztory 1978:15-21). The Late Classic and Early Post classic periods are characterized by increased regional eclecti cism and more vigorous localized development (Diehl and Berlo 1989:3; Rice 1987b; Stark 1990:272). An integral component of this process would be an increased number of individuals competing for positions of prestige (Willey and Shimkin 1973: 459-462). This competition, in turn, would have promoted the acquisition of wealth items to substantiate developing status po sitions and establish social and political obligations via gift ex change (Brumfiel and Earle 1987:3; Rice 1987b:84). Thus, the demand for prestige commodities most likely increased, not de creased, during the post-Teotihuacan period. Matacapan may have served as an important production/distribution center for elite goods that circulated through the Tuxtla region and per haps moved elsewhere through Mesoamerica. CONCLUSION During the pre-Hispanic era, occupants of the Sierra de los Tux tlas region participated in an exchange network that distributed localized, highly desirable commodities to groups in highland and lowland Mesoamerica. In fact, this exchange system ex tended back to the Middle Formative period, when basalt from the Tuxtlas was used for Olmec monumental sculpture and do mestic ground-stone artifacts (Coe and Diehl 1980b: Appendix 2; Williams and Heizer 1965). Matacapan, one of the largest sites within the Tuxtlas, was involved in this exchange system dur ing the Classic period. In all likelihood the growth of Mataca pan during the early part of the Classic period was intimately tied to Teotihuacan interests in the available prestige items. Teotihuacan styles emulated at Matacapan and probable Ma tacapan material at Teotihuacan support the strong connections between the two. Data from Comoapan, Matacapan's largest pottery-making area, underscore the importance of production efforts. The Co moapan evidence indicates a large-scale and intensive production industry. Many of the wares and vessel forms that constitute the bulk of the Comoapan production assemblage are not common in contemporary domestic middens from Matacapan. Signifi cant differences in surface treatment and firing errors also dis tinguish Comoapan from other pottery-making areas identified at Matacapan. Finally, ethnohistoric sources indicate that de mand for elite commodities such as liquidambar and honey may have prompted a need for storage containers and increased the scale of pottery production. These diverse lines of evidence sug gest that a portion of Comoapan's output was destined for ex port beyond Matacapan's immediate hinterland and possibly outside the Tuxtlas. The ceramic-production industry at Comoapan continued into the later Classic period, a time when Teotihuacan influence was on the wane. In fact, overall levels of craft production at Matacapan actually increased following the decline in Teotihua can-style cultural material. Thus, Teotihuacan may have repre sented only one of several markets for goods produced in the Tuxtlas. In sum, it is unlikely that the Sierra de los Tuxtlas serviced only Teotihuacan. Rather, it appears that Matacapan was part of a far-reaching exchange system that encompassed a larger portion of Mesoamerica. Initial interpretations of Teotihuacan's influence at Matacapan included references to ports of trade and stop-over stations along a Teotihuacan-dominated trade route (Coe 1965; Parsons 1978). It makes little economic sense, how ever, to place a pedestrian trade route across volcanic moun tains when the region could be more easily skirted along the Gulf Coast (Kneebone 1990:107). Thus, we doubt that Mata capan's importance derived simply from it's location vis-á-vis trade routes. Rather, Matacapan apparently played a large role in the production and distribution of goods for Classic-period inhabitants of the Tuxtlas and possibly status-conscious individ uals elsewhere in Mesoamerica. RESUMEN El sitio de Matacapan del período clásico, localizado en la Sierra de los Tuxtlas, México, ha producido clara evidencia de interacción con Teoti huacán en el centro de México. Previas discusiones sobre Matacapan lo caracterizaron como un "puerto de comercio," una "estación de paso," o el locus de un "enclave" de Teotihuacán a lo largo de la ruta de comer cio dominada por México central. Este artículo evalúa estas carac terísticas utilizando la evidencia de manufactura cerámica intensiva en Comoapan, un área de producción a gran escala localizada en la periferia sur de Matacapan. Datos obtenidos en la prospección y excavación de Comoapan in dican que la manufactura intensiva de cerámica incluyó un restringuido repertorio de tipos de vasija. Tres vajillas fueron producidas prin cipalmente en Comoapan: Anaranjado Fino (Fine Orange), Marrón Grueso (Coarse Brown), y Anaranjado Grueso (Coarse Orange). Estas vajillas están representadas en un limitado número de formas de vasija: platos Anaranjado Fino y tres tipos de olla en las vajillas restantes. La comparación de las técnicas de manufactura representadas en Comoa pan con las técnicas presentes en otras áreas de producción en Mataca pan sugiere que los alfareros de Comoapan aparentemente explotaron depósitos de arcilla diferentes, enfatizaron diferentes técnicas de con strucción y acabado de superficie, y probablemente tuvieron mayor con trol sobre las técnicas de cocido de cerámica. En conjunto, estas líneas de evidencia presentan un argumento a favor de la manufactura cerám ica intensiva y a gran escala, quizás al nivel de una industria nucleada. La presencia de esta industria de producción intensiva sugiere que Matacapan estuvo envuelto en un sistema de intercambio a larga dis tancia, orientado hacia la exportación fuera de Matacapan, posiblemente más allá de los Tuxtlas. Además de proveer cerámica utilitaria, creemos que una porción de las vasijas fue utilizada para transportar cargas de productos para la élite, tales como miel y ámbar líquido. Nuestra eviden cia, sin embargo, sugiere que Teotihuacán no reguló o dominó esta in teracción económica a través del tiempo. De hecho, al mismo tiempo que la "influencia" de Teotihuacán desaparece de Matacapan, la indus tria cerámica, junto a otras actividades económicas, parece inten sificarse. Entonces, Matacapan no solamente sirvió como una "estación de paso" a lo largo de la ruta de comercio, sino que más bien jugó un rol activo en la provisión de objectos de prestigio a las élites tanto dentro de los Tuxtlas como probablemente más allá de esta región.</page><page sequence="15">Ceramic production and political economy 189 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The research presented herein was made possible by grants from the Na tional Science Foundation, Sigma Xi, the Mellon Foundation, and the Tinker Foundation.
