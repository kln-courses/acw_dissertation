This paper considers the nature and interests of the person and their relationships to the concepts of science and society; and analyses a conception of value used to balance the interests of science and research subjects. The implications of arguments opposing the primacy of the individual are set out to indicate their implausibility; while the primacy principle is described to show its necessity in any moral society. Finally, the importance of fully informed consent to participate is explained with the requirement that the individual human life provide the criteria of moral value for human life. The general question is whether the advancement of science is more important than the individual. Helgesson and Eriksson's title indicates they are against the principle that the individual shall be regarded as more important than science.1 The context one needs to understand this is that prin ciples guiding behaviour express values, positive or negative, and values are expressed in activity, mental or physical: to follow a principle is to attribute value to its realisation. They oppose 'the idea that the interests of the individual shall always prevail over the interests of science and society' (p 54). This is quite innocuous in one way, in a particular situation it leaves either as more valu able, but an implication is that such disparate interests are measured by one sort of criteria. We may note that none of the general statements on the pre-eminence of the interests of the individual quoted by Helgesson and Eriksson1 specifies an overriding of scientific purpose; but on the other hand, their balancing assumes the pre-eminence of science. Their perspective does not allow the clash of fundamental intuitive judgements, which directly contradict one another. It is important in this quandary to seek to outline an analysis that can be seen to account for the uncertainty over the meaning of the 'primacy principle' and to provide a possible solution. In outline, one may say that the primacy prin ciple seeks to capture the concept of the centrality of the person and how this influences the nature of medical guidelines. The primacy principle underlies such statements as 'the well-being of the human subject should take precedence over the interests of science and society' (p 54). From this basis and ostensibly to clarify the concept of the primacy principle Helgesson and Eriksson test a number of descriptions or definitions of it and conclude it is 'empty' or obfuscatory because it fails to meet their criteria. To see their approach, consider democracy and its primary principle that in a group the majority choose their laws. The principle would not be synonymous with the laws; or be immedi ately obvious for often committees or individuals would rule over dissenting majorities. From this apparent variety it may appear to some that a democracy is merely a more or less coherent bundle of laws. The failings Helgesson and Eriksson see in their attempts to describe the primacy prin ciple do not show there is no adequate definition of it. Consider a definition of the primacy principle: 'the human individual is the criterion of value in human life7. MORAL AND POLITICAL VALUE In a consideration of any ideal system the question addressed by its primary principle is why does it have its particular hierarchical structures or guide lines. The primary principle provides the criterion or criteria to develop or recognise the system as of a particular type. For example, the scientific society as an ideal system would primarily value the acquisition and use of particular knowledge and control, while the ethical society would primarily value a set of moral restraints in the care of the individual. In actual societies such ideals may be opposed and there would be many different areas of application of ethical principles, for example in business, or in medicine. One may see in such activities the vested interests or purposes of the actors seeking advantage against some principled standards. Other principles may be asserted, for example the pre-eminence of profit, or of knowl edge, but without the drive to create new systems we are left with a search for profit or knowledge in an ethical system. It seems that Helgesson and Eriksson are constructing the balance of interests between science and the individual within a social system in which scientific knowledge and practices form the predominant criteria of value and are superior to the value of the individual in that society. Their treatment of the guidelines In testing the meaning of the primacy principle shows this. In other words, Helgesson and Eriksson accept the criterion of scientific value to assess the elements in society and within the resulting system assess the value of the individual for her contribution to a scientific study. Within society, it is not just a matter of seeing how individuals can contribute to a scientific ideal. Clearly, the value of science to society is immense, and relative to the mass of people in a society the value of an individual may appear minimal, but we need to ask, regarding the balancing of such values, what the method or definition of the balance is. For a criterion of value based on the human individual has not been adequately considered for a direct comparison with a criterion based on the public benefit from science.2 J Med Ethics 2010;36:563-566. doi:10.1136/jme.2010.037390 563</page><page sequence="2">One is usefully led to the question of how the purposes and practices of science can occur within the boundaries of ethical requirements. It may be helpful here to set out the required concept of 'balancing7. It is paradigmatically the combined use of two separate and possibly incompatible systems of value. Such balancing may occur when the criteria of each of the systems have application to a dispute. Consider the value of the individual relative to that of its group; if the sanctity of the individual is paramount then other members of the group can gain no benefit from her, and if the value of the group is para mount then it cannot accept contrary action by any individual. Cooperation may occur when both sets of criteria underlying the value of each entity apply to the decisions, for example the free individual may freely accept the requirements of the group. In these cases the balancing is not a balancing of the economist's costs and benefits, which occurs when only one set of criteria apply to the exchange. The appropriate balancing is a method not an outcome. The required balancing is an acceptance and use of possibly incompatible criteria to guide one to a solution. It is important to recognise the public benefit from the ethical life, although it is perhaps commonplace to regard ethics as part of politics so that it would be thought that only political and legal standards exist and that these are right.3 Ethics in the form of a language of rights would then be a way of talking about political standards and the resulting satisfactions of a set of hierarchical desires through political action. One can maintain the moral point of view by seeing that politics is essentially concerned with groups and their powers. Politics is then seen to be guided by the variously interpreted ideas of efficiency and effectiveness; the general question would be 'does it work7? These measures do not apply to the ethical life; moral standards have no consequences to show their ineffectiveness, for example one may see this in the traditional idea that being morally just should occur although the heavens fall. From this it may be recognised then that the public benefit from the moral life is delivered through the individual; it is an appeal that power is not the only relationship between individuals. One sees from Helgesson and Eriksson's belief that the interests of the indi vidual shall not prevail over the interests of society that their perspective on the question is a political one, but this does not diminish their point of view, their arguments need to be addressed. THE VALUE OF SCIENCE AND THE PERSON They consider some examples4 of 'giving the individuals7 inter ests precedence... over the sole interest of society or science7 (p 54). We should notice that the point of a reference to 'the sole interest7 is to stress that the balancing is not merely a political decision in terms of the interests of the group, the interests of the consenting individual in the group need to be included. The balance in the situation comes from standards of morality applying to the potential or actual research participant. It may be a moral decision on the part of the research subject to consent to a particular trial to provide a social benefit rather than one for herself. Helgesson and Eriksson are mistaken to suggest that 'no research participants should be worse off...7 (p 54). It may be a duty of physicians to enrol participants 'even if no immediate gain7 (p 54) occurs. The important point is that the researcher waits on the consent of the subject; Helgesson and Eriksson's emphasis on 'a potential to benefit subjects...7 (p 54) shows again their political orientation. The weakness of their position is clear in their conclusion that 'every government should promote research that can be expected to improve healthcare7 (p 55), for this does not distinguish their case from governments that do not treat their citizens well: how research is conducted is as important as its results. There have been enough traditional examples of malicious governments using their citizens for future glory. From their perspective Helgesson and Eriksson conclude that because research need not benefit the participant then the balancing mechanism is not clear. They have not seen that the balance occurs when each individual acts freely for example when consent precedes action. To overcome a defence of the primacy principle, they suggest, 'We need to get a better grip of what the primacy statements of the guidelines actually have aimed for7 (author's italics, 55). It is fairly clear that Helgesson and Eriksson understand the primacy principle as the hidden meaning of the 'primacy7 statements of the guidelines. Therefore, their list of the criteria for such meaning in the guidelines as 'semantically and logically plausible... not redundant (that they say something beyond what is already stated elsewhere in the guidelines)... (and) fit all guidelines7 (p 55). They have already considered their first possible meaning of the primacy principle, viz 'only research with a direct positive balance for the research participants for instance in terms of well-being7 (p 55) and dismiss it for few 'are willing to defend this position7 (p 55). It is for them a 'contra diction in the guidelines7 (p 55); an inconsistency with 'well being... (and) non-beneficial experiments7 (p 55). Of course, we can see that this is not a contradiction; we do not have well being and not wellbeing: the compassionate or cooperative participant can experience wellbeing in the sacrifice. The guidelines allow this and so does the underlying primacy prin ciple, which shows their basis. Helgesson and Eriksson offer no argument to suggest the primacy principle is an underlying meaning to the 'primacy7 statements of the guidelines; they do not consider the primacy principle as a different type of state ment, as a requirement to hold the human individual as expressing pre-eminent value. Some see the pre-eminence of the human individual as an intuitive matter, that as a human being one simply sees that being human is the fount of all value. Of course, the idea of being human is at least ambiguous in terms of existence or of function and one may take either of these alternatives as a basis for valuing the human. They may even be an ultimate source of our distinction between ethics and politics: between how we treat the human being and what we expect from her. It is interesting that the relevant moral standards are largely a set of restraints on action towards others, for example not harming others, not taking advantage of people, not claiming more for oneself, while politics is the seeking and maintenance of power. Typically in the area of medical care the primacy principle has the role of guiding us to accept the existential characteristics of the person as the criteria of moral value; it is the perspective that the person does not have to reach any functional standard to be valuable as a person or to be treated with full respect. In the context of seeking the source of value Helgesson and Eriksson compare 'the interests of the individual... (and) the interests of science and society7 (p 54), but the claimed advantages or achievements of science are what are to be measured, they are not the only criteria to determine the issue: the reduction of pain or life saving are valuable because of the value of the individual. The researcher and subject face one another not merely as individuals but in a power relationship; the individual is confronted by an institution. The scientist indicates her consent to the process, but it is unclear whether the subject should have the same opportunity. These sorts of questions are not consid ered by Helgesson and Eriksson; they merely criticise a number of interpretations of the primacy principle to show that it has no 564 J Med Ethics 2010;36:563-566. doi:10.1136/jme.2010.037390</page><page sequence="3">^^^^H Response ^^^^H substantial use. It is interesting that their second interpretation of the primacy principle refers to researchers having a 'certain attitude vis-?-vis research subjects7 (p 55), which is respectful of them but not deferential to their interests. In their rejection of the second interpretation of the primacy principle, they adopt a patronising view of the research subject: they accept 'the importance of protecting the dignity and integrity of the person without agreeing... the individual should have precedence over research interests7 (p 55). This position is also taken by animal researchers who care well for their animals in addition to using them in experiments; the dignity of the animal does not protect it from being used. In the new context, Helgesson and Eriksson do not explain how the dignity and integrity of the subject is protected by her use in research. THE VALUE OF CONSENT In their statement of the third interpretation they move from attitude to 'certain minimum requirements7 (p 55) for research subjects. They openly contrast their position with that of the Nazis for not considering 'the research subjects7 interests, or human dignity, at all7 (p 55). Although historically, it seems that particular subjects in the death camps were relatively well treated and fed for use in certain experiments. They received what was necessary to bring them to a specified standard of health. Of course, the distance between the Nazis7s experi mentation and a view of the pre-eminence of science is infinite but they are formally comparable. The difficult issue here is that without fully informed consent there is no clear difference of type between recruitment to the proposed treatment of modern day research subjects and the victims of Nazi experimentation. The dignity of the victims had no relevance to the justification of the experimentation that was the perceived value of the Third Reich. Similarly, without the primacy of the individual as advocated in the Declaration of Helsinki, for example, modern medical research as envisaged by Helgesson and Eriksson is justified by its perceived benefits for the group excluding the individual. Considering a larger context, one may relate these conclusions to the question of what may strengthen representative democ racy. One may see that this largely depends on a gift of power to the citizens reducing their subservience, for example the Human Rights Act or the Freedom of Information Act. In a similar way, the principle of subsidiary strengthens the individual nation in a group of nations. A contrast to these exchanges of power is the idea of separate or expendable groups in society who may be used for the benefit of a majority; it is this that formally links the system of Nazi rule and the principle that science shall have priority over certain individuals. Rather more general than the first interpretation, their fourth interpretation suggests 'the entire system of biomedicai research7 (p 55) should benefit the individual. Given Helgesson and Eriksson's ambiguity about which individual they refer to, this could again be a justification for the Nazi's medical work. The ongoing difficulty with their economic perspective on benefit is that it is formed from ideas of efficiency and effectiveness, a matter of how does one build the new Jerusalem. They have not absorbed their casually expressed 'deontological constraint on what actions are permissible7 (p 55). In their consideration of the fifth way to understand the primacy principle they consider the requirement 'it is always the individual who shall have the final word on whether or not to participate in research (ie, whether or not to realise the interests of science or society)7 (p 55). This sets out the potential participants7 criterion for decision: my good or the larger good. This does not allow a comparison of the public benefit of science with the public benefit of the moral life or even of enlightened politics. The method begs the question and misleads the participant into pseudo logic. The anthropomorphic under standing of science is in the foreground here; society is seen as a leviathan whose interest does not include the potentially sacrificed individual. This runs counter to the Conference on Human Rights and Bioethics, which states: The interests and welfare of the human being shall prevail over the sole interest of society or science7 (p 54), that is any gain to society must include the relevant individual in the evaluation.5 Science or society understood as separate from the compared individual and directly comparable to the individual allows the good of science or society to overrule the good of the individual. It is unfortu nate that this is the logic and scope of the Nazi's argument for the Third Reich, and Helgesson and Eriksson's position shares it. An indication of the precariousness of their position is seen in their comment that 'every government should promote research that can be expected to improve healthcare7 (p 55). We can accept that this may be understood as a necessary condition of good government, but of course, it is not a sufficient condition of good government. Improving health care is not the only task for government; they have also to consider how it is done. It is important always to consider the lessons from Helsinki; the standards and dangers should not be forgotten. Any government that is not concerned with seeking the agreement of the citizen is not an attractive model for medical research. THE CRITERIA FOR MORALITY Their final interpretation of the primacy principle 'as a main guiding principle... (concludes that) it fails to serve as one7 (pp 55?6). Their example of such a 'guiding' principle that they reject is the 'whole convention... is inspired by the principle of the primacy of the human being, and all its articles must be interpreted in this light7 (p 55). Essentially the reference to the primacy of the human being in these sorts of examples is a requirement to use the characteristics of the human being to provide the criteria for any evaluation between a human being and something else.6 One sees here that the evaluation of a number of compared items is dependent upon the criteria chosen to make the evaluation. If, for example, one were to use the criteria of wooden and straight in determining the compar ative values of a pencil and a human being, the conclusion would be obvious. An effect of taking science as the only criterion of value vis-?-vis individuals is to justify the unconsented use of individuals for the public good.7 The primacy principle refers to the essential nature of the individual as it is expressed in freedom in a social context; while consent encapsulates and reflects social cooperation. In a society, ideals are shared through consent, which illuminates the idea of the person considered as an end and not as a means. Some bioethicists are concerned with the application of moral concepts to medicine; what it seems they may omit is the analysis and grounding of moral concepts in human life. One may note in this regard that there is no technical, as opposed to medical, reason for applying the concept of dignity to medical matters. The reason consent is important is because of the primacy principle that the value of the individual determines social relationships.8 Helgesson and Eriksson regard the primacy principle as a 'vacuous figure of speech7 (p 56) and therefore redundant because they see explicit ethical guidelines or regu lations adequately protect individuals. They think the only possible explanation of the primacy principle would be in terms of an elucidation of the meaning of the guidelines. They want an J Med Ethics 2010;36:563-566. do?:10.1136/jme.2010.037390 565</page><page sequence="4">^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 'ethically relevant, clear and non-redundant meaning... to protect research subjects. If not, there seems to be no good reason to cling to it7 (p 56). It is accepted by them that the current guidelines are not described by the primacy principle, so for them synonymy renders it useless. The title of Helgesson and Eriksson's article is Against the principle that the individual shall have priority over science', and the thought is that scientific work is more important or more valuable than the individual. If one considers particular medical advances that reduced suffering or saved many lives it is quite clear that medical science is a great boon to mankind, but why in these cases is science so highly regarded ? Precisely because of its beneficent results for so many individuals: the end in these cases justifies the means. One may acknowledge it is quite possible to value science merely as a system of knowledge without practical effects, but generally the high value of medical science is due to its use in human affairs. What Helgesson and Eriksson are comparing then is the valuable effects of medical science and the value of trial subjects used in gaining them. Their misleading criterion for value adopted here is the number of individuals benefiting: two is more than one, therefore science is more valuable than the individual. Now if one puts one penny in each of the hundred different bank accounts of a population one is benefitting more than one person, but this does not show that each member of the population had less than one penny in a bank account. Their initially plausible argument fails because they have not compared the value of the medical benefit in the individual case with the value of the individual. It is the value of the individual that is pre-eminent, that is, however we measure it the value of the individual guides us vis-?-vis her treatment in medical matters. Against Helgesson and Eriksson we may conclude that the primacy principle does have a meaningful role in ethical guidelines; in fact we may say that it is fundamental. When the criterion of moral value moves away from the individual no one is safe from the majority. Helgesson and Eriksson believe that guidelines are sufficient in an explanation of how to treat indi viduals in medical situations; they have not considered the source of the guidelines and the overriding importance of the individual human life providing the criteria of value for human life.
