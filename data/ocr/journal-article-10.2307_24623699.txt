This is surprising because both passen gers and crew typically had to endure poor hygiene, poor nutrition, and cramped quarters, especially on long voyages. All of these factors provided an excellent environment for the incubation and spread of disease. In contrast to ships, however, armies are commonly assumed to be likely human vectors for the spread of diseases, even if little or no evidence supports such an assumption. One such assumption concerns the army of Alexander the Great. Alexander the Great (356—323 bce) conquered much of the known world of his time. He was a consummate general, tactician, and statesman whose conquests led to the spread of Greek culture through out the eastern Mediterranean. Some paleopathologists, leprologists, and historians have now bestowed another dubious honor on Alexan der.1 They propose that members of his army may have contracted 1. R. T.

This opinion has been repeated without critical analysis since Johs Andersen first proposed it in 1969. Furthermore, Andersen proposed that Pompey's army brought leprosy to Italy after his campaign against Mithridates of Pontus in 62 bce.2 Yet the evidence does not support either assump tion. Instead, I propose that cargo ships carrying young slaves from India to Egypt were probably the conveyors of this disease to the Mediterranean world. Andersen's theory is based on his argument that the earliest written description of leprosy in the Mediterranean region dates to around 300 bce and the earliest osteological evidence for leprosy to about ce 500. Since publishing, however, the discovery of bones exhibiting leprous lesions from Egypt has pushed back the date of the earliest osteological evidence to about 200 bce.3 This does strengthen his argument because it places the earliest evidence closer to Alexanders time. However, Andersen's dating for the appearance of leprosy has not been universally accepted. A few scholars still believe leprosy appeared much earlier in this region, and the most ardent advocate of this theory is Mirko Grmek; he argued that ancient Egyptian, Mesopotamian, and Hebrew texts all describe leprosy.4 So, my argu ment is two-pronged: leprosy did not appear in the Mediterranean region before approximately 400 bce or so, and it traveled there via cargo ships, not via Alexander's army.

Leprosy, or Hansen's disease, is a slow, progressive, and chronic infectious disease, which is produced by the bacillus Mycobacterium leprae. It can be difficult to diagnose in its early stages because it produces four different forms: indeterminate, tuberculoid, borderhne, and leproma tous leprosy. The difficulty is further compounded because these different forms exhibit such a wide range of symptoms. Leprosy typically begins as an indeterminate form that can spontaneously heal, remain unchanged for long periods, or progress to a more severe form. Indeterminate leprosy produces poorly defined patches or mac ules that are slightly hypopigmented in darker skin and have a slightly reddish color in lighter skin.5 If the disease progresses, it may develop into the second form, tuberculoid leprosy, which is associated with rapid and severe nerve damage, resulting in a loss of sensation, local paralysis, loss of sweat and sebaceous glands, and hair loss. Skin lesions are few; they are macular, have sharp borders, and are hypopigmented. Typically, there is also an enlargement of cutaneous nerves and peripheral nerve trunks with localized infection that may ulcerate in the area of lesions. However, nerve damage is often limited and infection usually heals without treatment.6 The third form, borderhne leprosy, is an unstable form that is transitional between the tuberculoid and lepromatous forms, and it is divided into three subgroups: borderhne tuberculoid, mid-borderline, and borderline lepromatous leprosy. Borderhne tuberculoid leprosy produces skin lesions similar to tuberculoid leprosy but the lesions are more numerous and larger with less defined margins, and satellite lesions may also form. In this subgroup, there is also a possibility of rapid deterioration of nerve function leading to disability. The second 5· L. Κ. Bhutani, I. Nath, Ν. Κ. Mehra, and Ν. Η.

It produces numerous lesions that vary in size, shape, and distribution and have irregular borders. Lesions can also be macules, papules, or plaques. The third subgroup, borderline lepromatous leprosy, is characterized by small macules all over the body, which as the disease progresses become infiltrated. Peripheral nerve involvement is also widespread but is not as symmetric as in the lepromatous form.7 The fourth form, lepromatous leprosy, is the disfiguring form of the disease that most people associate with leprosy. In its early stages, however, it is typically insidious. Ill-defined hypopigmented papules or macules can appear anywhere on the skin but usually do so in cooler areas, such as the ears, center of the face, and extensor surfaces of the thighs and forearms. It progresses slowly but relentlessly, pro ducing plaques, nodules, and infiltrations. As the skin becomes infil trated it thickens, and nerve damage leads to a loss of sensation. This thickening in the face along with hypertrophied lips and nose, pronounced wrinkles, and a yellow cast to the skin are all characteris tics of the leonine facies or "lion face" associated with lepers. Also in the facial area, there is a loss of hair, especially the eyelashes and the lateral third of the eyebrows; the eyes are attacked, sometimes causing blindness; the ears may fall off; and the perforation of the septa and destruction of the nasal bone, nasal spine, and even central maxilla leads to the collapse of the bridge of the nose. This nasal destruction and severe throat damage result in a hoarse whisper. In the rest of the body, a loss of sensation usually appears first in the hands and feet, which then become swollen and deformed. These manifestations can then spread to the rest of the body (except the axillae, groin, and scalp). Persistent injury, due to a loss of sensation, along with the absorption of bone typically leads to a loss of fingers and toes.8 The wide-ranging symptoms manifested by leprosy, especially in its early stages, can make it difficult to distinguish from other condi tions. The ulceration of lesions on the face and limbs have been mistaken for symptoms of leishmaniasis, and the secondary infections seen in leprosy are similar to those exhibited by psoriasis, pellagra, η.

The macules, the horrible disfigurement of the face, the loss of fingers and ears, and a lack of swelling in the legs allowed classical physicians to easily distinguish lepromatous leprosy from other conditions, especially ele phantiasis. Leprosy was called elephantiasis graecorum and elephantiasis was elephantiasis arahum. Differential diagnosis is further simplified because elephantiasis is a tropical disease caused by infection from filarial worms. The habitat of these parasitic nematodes extends only as far north as Egypt.11 Therefore, when ancient writers describe the spread of elephantiasis or elephas to Greece, Italy, or other locations in the Mediterranean region, they can only be describing leprosy. The skeletal pathology of leprosy is also distinctive. In the maxillary alveolar process there is resorption of the prosthion followed by a bilaterally symmetrical resorption of the alveolae around the maxillary incisors, usually resulting in the loss of all front teeth (Fig. 1). The nasal bones are absorbed and the nasal aperture remodeled, and holes may form in the palate (Fig. 2), creating a wide and empty depression where the nose once existed. This horribly disfigured facial anatomy is referred to as fades leprosa,12 Pathologies of the hands, feet, and leg bones are also marked. Diaphyseal remodeling takes place in the proximal phalanges and in the metacarpals and metatarsals; it is bilateral but rarely symmetrical. In the hands, the terminal phalanges erode down to points as a result of concentric resorption, which results in a tapered appearance to the fingers. This tapered shape is commonly compared in appearance 9· Α. Carmichael, "Leprosy," in Κ.

It is a process that usually works its way gradually from the finger tip in, so that eventually the bones may completely resorb, leaving only stumps in place of fingers. In addition, the joints of the hands and feet may show various degrees of arthritis, subluxation, and dislocation. Similar deformities appear in the feet.13 In the long bones, periostitis with subperiosteal new bone deposits is common. Such periostitis has been reported in 78% of cases. Fur thermore, leprosy typically modifies the tibia and fibula, producing pitting and irregularities in the surfaces due to infection of the perios teum. This results in fine, longitudinally striated subperiosteal bone deposits. In addition, the tibia shows vascular grooves on the lateral surface, but the fibula is rarely involved to the same degree.14 13- Ibid., pp. 151—54. 14.

Of those suffering from leprosy, diagnostic skeletal pathologies will develop in 15—50% of the cases.

WAS LEPROSY PRESENT IN THE MEDITERRANEAN WORLD BEFORE 4ΟΟ BCE? There are many advantages to studying the spread of disease in the Mediterranean, including good bone preservation and long, rich medical and artistic traditions from which to draw. Medical evidence for leprosy from ancient Mediterranean sites, however, does not exist until relatively late, which is significant considering that an Egyptian medical tradition can be traced at least as far back as the beginning of the Old Kingdom (ca. 2686 bce). Imhotep was one of the earliest and one of the most famous physicians. He was held in such high</page><page sequence="8">292 Journal of the History of Medicine : Vol. 57, July 2002 m Fig. 3.

Furthermore, the great reputation that Egyp tian medicine and physicians enjoyed throughout the ancient world is reflected in a number of texts. Niqmad, the king of Ugarit, wrote to the Pharaoh Akhenaten (ca. 1352-1336 bce) and requested a physician because he lacked a capable one. During the reign ofRamses II (ca. 1279-1213 bce), Hattusili, the Hittite king, requested a physi cian to treat his sister's sterility.16 This high regard for Egyptian physi 15- I- Shaw and P.

According to Herodotus (ca. 484-425 bce), Darius, the king of the Persian Empire, employed the best physicians of Egypt.17 Fortunately, these ancient physicians have left behind medical texts describing various illnesses and treatments. Furthermore, hundreds of mummies and skeletal material have survived, which have proven to be an invaluable source of information on the health of ancient Egyptians.18 However, in spite of this large and varied amount of written and archeological evidence, no sign of leprosy can be firmly established in ancient Egypt. The only possible reference is from the Papyrus Ebers, a medical treatise dating to the sixteenth century bce. Bendix Ebbell, the translator, proposed that one entry in this text described leprosy. Although Grmek states that this interpretation is "ingenious and bold," he does concede that it has never been ac cepted.19 In fact, it was strongly criticized and implicitly rejected. The diagnosis simply did not fit the symptoms. According to Ebbell s translation, the text states that: If thou examinest Chons' big swelling on any limb of a man, and it is horrible when it has produced many swellings, and there arises in him something therein as if there were air therein, and it causes destruction of the swelling, and it is proclaimed in thy presence (i.e. it is as if its appearance calls out to thee): it is not like those swellings (previously mentioned), and it is motley-coloured and it produces carvings (?), and all limbs on which it is are heavy, then thou shalt say concerning it: it is Chons' swelling. Thou shalt not do anything to it.20 Andersen disagrees with Ebbell's interpretation, pointing out that these symptoms conform to those of gas gangrene. Gas gangrene is caused by a type of bacterium that produces gas and poisonous toxins as they invade human tissue. In affected areas, there is a sensation of heaviness followed by severe pain, due to the accumulation of gas or \η. Herodotus, Herodoti Historiae, Scriptorum classicorum bibliotheca Oxoniensis, C.

In about 80% of cases, these tissues produce crackling sounds as a result of gas bubbles forming under the skin, and in many cases it is possible to feel these bubbles. The swollen skin may also be blistered and red before progressing to a bronze, brown, or black color. The diagnosis of gas gangrene matches the Egyptian text much better than leprosy does.21 Other than citing Ebbell, Grmek admits "Without this evidence, there is no substantial sign of leprosy in Pharaonic Egypt (3100-310 B.C.). Paleopathical research makes its endemic presence most unlikely."22 Although Grmek concedes a lack of evidence in Egypt, he does argue that leprosy was known in Mesopotamia as early as the second millennium bce. Yet his evidence consists only of translations by Assyriologists, who have consistently translated the Akkadian terms saharsubbu, isrubu, and garabu as leprosy or a disease like leprosy. All we know of this condition is that it "covers the whole body" and those who are afflicted with it are banished and chased from the city and are forced to live "like wild-assess."23 Grmek hedges that this "disease is not necessarily leprosy in the modern sense; the evidence that exists is inadequate for a diagnosis." He goes on to argue, however, that key evidence to support such a proposition can be found in a Babylonian omen text (VAT 7525). He cites the translation by Kinnier Wilson, who writes "If the skin of a man exhibits white patches (pusu) or is dotted with nodules (nuqdu), such a man has been rejected by mankind." Wilson interprets this passage as a description of the tuberculoid and lepromatous forms of leprosy, but he also allows that since the ancient Mesopotamians did not have a well-developed nosology, "other diseases could be included in the 'leprosy' of the past, notably pellagra."24 Wilson understates the level of development of Mesopotamian medicine. Not only did they lack a well-developed nosology, but their idea of medicine was so intricately intertwined with magic that even the names of their diseases usually reflect the deity or demon that was thought to cause a condition.25 Another 21.

Although this interpretation has been consistently rejected by le prologists as being too vague, Grmek is undaunted.26 He feels that a careful review of the information about leprosy among the Hebrews supports his interpretation because both the "Babylonian evidence and the Biblical prescriptions have a common origin and elucidate each other."27 Until the 1970s, it was commonly accepted that the Hebrew word tsara'ath in the Book of Leviticus meant leprosy, but upon critical review it became clear that it did not. Tsara'ath exhibits a number of symptoms, the most common of which are "white spots," "white swellings," or "bright white spots."28 It is also commonly translated as "white as snow," but Ε. V. Hülse has pointed out that this last translation is in error and should be translated only "as snow."29 This translation reflects two qualities of snow, its whiteness and that it falls. Hülse, therefore, proposes that two symptoms of tsara'ath are the turning white and flaking off of skin. He goes on to point out that neither is a symptom of leprosy. Furthermore, the other symptoms described in Leviticus do fit a number of different ailments, including psoriasis, seborrhoeic dermatitis, favus, patchy eczema, and pityriasis While agreeing that none of these minor skin diseases mirror leprosy, Grmek tries to save his argument by postulating that the authors of Leviticus are concerned only with [leprosy's] initial, indeter minate stage. So, it is understandable that certain important signs of leprosy have escaped their attention. If such a practical definition of tsara'ath also includes some harmless skin diseases, isn't this because it seemed preferable to err in overestimating its severity rather than risk the consequences of dangerous diseases?31 The main flaw with this line of reasoning is that nearly all of the symptoms listed in Leviticus appear to be those of harmless skin 26.

Grmek, Diseases, p. 161.</page><page sequence="12">296 Journal of the History of Medicine : Vol. 37, July 2002 diseases. Although it is true that some symptoms of these diseases have been confused with leprosy, Grmek fails to cite any symptoms in Leviticus that are commonly confused with it. Furthermore, if the purpose of this section of Leviticus was to list any possible symptoms of leprosy in order to differentiate those suffering from this condition from those suffering from other ailments, as Grmek suggests, then conditions that are relatively easy to differentiate from leprosy should not be included. Yet Leviticus states that "When a man or a woman has a sore on the head or on the beard, [and] if it appears to go under the skin, and if it has thin, yellow hairs, ... —it is ringworm, a leprosy [tsara'ath] of the head or beard."32 This description is consistent with favus, which is a fungal infection that attacks hair and scalp and that can spread, albeit rarely, to other parts of the body.33 It is also a condition that is relatively easy to differentiate from leprosy. Therefore, if the purpose of Leviticus was to protect against the spread of leprosy, as Grmek contends, then this passage should not have been included. Furthermore, if a person was suspected of suffering from tsara'ath, he or she was typically quarantined for seven to fourteen days because the diagnosis was sometimes confirmed by the rapid spread of the condition; "on the seventh day . . . , if the mark is unchanged in colour and has not spread, then the priest must isolate him for seven days more; on the seventh day ... if the eruption still spreads, the priest must pronounce him unclean; it is a case of leprosy [tsara'ath] This is a critical symptom because leprosy is a disease that typically develops slowly over a long period, and any condition that spreads as rapidly as described in Leviticus is unlikely to be leprosy. In effect, these guidelines would be ineffective for limiting the spread of leprosy. Grmek s position is even more difficult to accept when we consider that tsara'ath is a condition that also attacks clothing and buildings.35 These passages in Leviticus are not medical texts. Instead, they de scribe various types of ritual uncleanliness that afflict human skin, cloth, leather, and the walls of dwellings. Because Grmek is aware of the weakness of his arguments, he does try one last stratagem. Grmek argues that "leprosy is the only chronic skin disease whose 32.

Ibid., pp. 121-22 [Leviticus 13.47-59].</page><page sequence="13">Mark : Seafaring and the Spread of Leprosy 297 seriousness justifies the social remedies of the Biblical legislation."36 In other words, leprosy would be the only condition justifying banish ment. This opinion is all that really connects the Hebrew texts with the Mesopotamian ones. However, his argument lacks merit simply because it is impossible to make such a value judgment about beliefs and attitudes that existed more than 2000 years ago. For example, according to Deuteronomy 21.20-21, if parents charge that their son "is a stubborn and rebellious fellow who will not obey our orders; he is a spendthrift and a drunkard," and then "all his fellow citizens shall stone him to death."37 Similarly, if a husband were to discover that his bride was not a virgin on their wedding night and no evidence indicated she was a virgin before the wedding, Deuteronomy 22.20-21 states "she shall be taken to the door of her father's house and stoned to death."38 Most people would agree that the seriousness of these acts does not justify such social remedies, but neither does it justify our assuming that we do not fully understand the behavior leading to the remedy. The only other texts written before Alexander's time that may shed light on this question make up the Hippocratic Corpus, which is a collection of medical texts, most of which are believed to have been written between 430 and 3 3 ο Β c ε .39 Many scholars who translate these works typically assume, with little critical evaluation, that leprosy equates with the Greek word lepra.40 A review of the texts clearly shows that this is not so. Instead, the Hippocratic descriptions of lepra indicate that it refers to a scaling of the skin, possibly psoriasis or a fungal infection, both of which are similar to the descriptions in Leviticus. Even Grmek agrees that the descriptions of lepra "suggest relatively benign skin ailments."41 The reason for the confusion among classical translators is due in part to a lack of medical training among them and to the evolution of the classical word lepra into the modern 36.

Therefore, the skin condition ancient Greeks called lepra was usually just assumed by scholars to be true leprosy without evaluating the information in the texts. Although Grmek agrees that lepra does not equate with leprosy, he does believe leprosy is still mentioned in these texts. He cites Galen, who proposed that the condition called "Phoenicians disease" in the Hippocratic texts was leprosy. While Grmek does concede that Galen is making a guess that cannot be proven, he still believes that it is the most plausible explanation.42 A guess is the best description of Galen's interpretation, because the only mention in the Corpus of this illness is that it is thought to be "one of the most deadly diseases."43 Galen's interpretation has not been accepted by scholars primarily because no symptoms of the condition are listed. Furthermore, leprosy is a slow, progressive, and chronic disease that most sufferers live with for years, and there is no evidence to suggest otherwise for ancient times. Leprosy simply does not fall within the definition of a deadly disease, which is probably another reason so few scholars ever cite this passage. As early as 1938, the leprologist James Doull pointed out that "Hippocrates makes no mention of the disease."44 Finally, anyone who has read these works cannot help but notice that these early Greek physicians had a keen interest in all types of conditions, from common ailments like colds to more deadly illnesses like tuberculosis, which is described in some detail.45 It therefore seems inconceivable that these early physicians would ignore a disease with such a wide range of distinctive symptoms. Even the ancients found this odd. Rufus of Ephesus (early second century ce) points out that "the ancients knew nothing of elephantiasis, and we must wonder that men capable of contemplating everything in the tiniest detail missed such a serious and common disease."46 Furthermore, in Plutarch's Quaestiones conviviales, a question that is pondered is whether it is possible for a new disease to appear suddenly.

He goes on to say that "It was only an exotic disease limited to eastern lands or sporadically arriving in Greece from them."48 For this to be a practical consideration, Greece would have to have been relatively isolated from these eastern lands. However, the evidence suggests otherwise. A permanent Greek trading colony was established at the Phoenician site of Al Mina in Phoenicia as early as 800 bce.49 Even Homer (ca. 750 bce) commonly mentions Phoe nicians in the Odyssey to the extent that Odysseus goes on a trading voyage with a Phoenician, and he tells a sheep herder he was brought back to Ithaca on a Phoenician ship. Furthermore, Homer points out that even when Phoenicians are asked to make haste while trading, they spend a full year in one foreign port before sailing on, and while in port, they sell their wares door to door.50 So even as early as the middle of the eighth century bce there was considerable interaction among Greeks and Phoenicians. Finally, The Histories by Herodotus is, to a large extent, a travel book describing in detail the various peoples living in the lands to the East, and he never mentions leprosy or any ailment that could be confused with it. In fact, all of the textual and archaeological evidence seems to indicate that contact was close between Greece and the East long before the Classical period, and these contacts only continued to intensify as time passed. Therefore, if leprosy was in fact Phoenicians disease and was a com mon ailment of Phoenicians, it should have spread to Greece long before the writing of the Hippocratic Corpus. Thucydides best illustrates how close these contacts were in the 47· Plutarch, Plutarch's Moralia, Loeb Classical Library, E. H. Warmington, ed., Ε. L. Minar, Jr., F. H. Sandbach, and W. C.

He states that it was thought to have begun "beyond Egypt in Ethiopia and then spread into Egypt and Libya, and into most of the King's land [Persian Empire]. It then suddenly struck Athens, first affecting the people of Piraeus."51 Piraeus was the port of Athens, and it is through this port that we would expect diseases brought by ship to arrive. Therefore, considering that the economies of the eastern Mediterranean were relatively tightly integrated via sea trade and considering that much of ancient Greece's economy was based on sea trade, Grmek's assertion that distance would have protected Greece from leprosy is without foundation. It should also be noted that by the first century ce Aretaeus of Cappadocia had written a relatively detailed description of leprosy, and from this time onward leprosy is typically described in medical texts.52 However, from long before the time of the Hippocratic Corpus to that of Aretaeus, there were no medical advances that would allow for a more effective diagnosis of this disease. If it had gone virtually unnoticed for centuries, what took place at this time that would explain why leprosy suddenly became so easy to detect? Quite simply, the evidence suggests that leprosy did not exist in the Mediterranean region before the fourth century bce, and the four centuries from when it was first described to the time of Aretaeus is consistent with the time necessary for it to have spread, been observed, and described in relative detail. Besides medical evidence, scholars have also looked for evidence of leprosy in artistic representations. Grmek reviews the various artifacts cited as evidence for leprosy from sites across the eastern Mediterra nean, but he rejects all examples except for a clay anthropomorphic jar from Bet She'an in Israel that dates to about 1300 bce. According to Grmek, it "shows features resembling facies leontina and strongly suggests a diagnosis oflepromatous leprosy."53 However, his interpreta tion is unconvincing because he ignores earlier studies of this same piece, all of which agree that this face does not represent an individual with leprosy; instead, it is probably an Egyptian dwarf god, possibly 51.

V. Hülse, who discusses this piece in detail.55 In contrast, artistic portrayals of individ uals suffering from various diseases do exist; the earliest artistic repre sentation of an individual with tuberculosis dates to the predynastic period of Egypt (before 3100 bce).56 Therefore, no known artistic representations portraying leprosy exist. Although Grmek fails to show that leprosy existed in the Mediterra nean region before the time of Alexander, his work has merit in that he marshals every shred of evidence that he can find and presents it in the most favorable light, but he is still unable to present a credible argument for its appearance before the time of Alexander. The failure of his argument therefore underscores the paucity of evidence for leprosy in this region before the fourth century bce. LEPROSY IN ANCIENT INDIA Andersen clearly presents stronger evidence that seems to suggest Alexander was responsible for the spread of this disease from India. The earliest evidence for leprosy comes from India and is found in a medical text entitled The Sushruta Samhita, which dates to as early as 600 bce.57 In this work leprosy or kushtham has a number of different forms. The most basic form, aruna-kushtha, is described as being "slightly vermilion-coloured, thin and spreading in its nature. A sort of pricking, piercing pain [is experienced in the affected locality] which loses all sensibility to the touch."58 This description is consistent with a mild tuberculoid form. The most extreme form exhibits a "contraction of the skin, local anesthesia, a copious flow of perspiration, swelling, and piercing or cutting pain in the affected part, together with a deformity of the limbs and hoarseness." Other symptoms include "breaking of the local skin . . . falling off of fingers 54- A.

The detail of description and categorization of the disease into various forms suggests it was fairly common in India and had been under observation for a considerable period before this text was written. The possibility that leprosy was widespread in India finds further support in the Arthasastra by Kautilya. This work, which is dated between 321 and 296 bce, is a manual on the art of government that was intended as a guide for kings and for maintaining the earth.60 According to the text, "if unwilling, the man (husband) may not approach a (wife) who is leprous or insane. A woman, however, shall approach a (husband) even of this type, for bearing a son."61 In regard to inheritance, "An outcast, a son born to an outcast and an impotent person are not entitled to a share, also an idiot, a lunatic, a blind and a leprous person." In regard to giving evidence, "The king, a Brahmin learned in the Vedas, a village servant, a leper . . . [shall not be cited as witnesses] except in the case of their own groups." This text also covers fines for the vilification of a person in relation to a serious malady such as "referring to leprosy, madness, impotence and so on, when it is true, false and contains ironical praise." Finally, knowledge of leprosy had even been integrated into magical lore. To harm someone, "Application all over the body of the bile and the liquid of the egg of a parrot is a means of causing leprosy," and for a cure a "decoction of the pulp of priyala is a remedy for leprosy."62 The fact that social guidelines concerning lepers were so well developed and codified and the evidence that lepers constituted a legally defined group suggest that leprosy had been pervasive in India for a long time. The explicit descriptions of leprosy in India, dating to 600 bce, in conjunction with a lack of persuasive evidence for leprosy in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Persia before the time of Alexander, support Andersen's contention. The only new evidence that has come to light since he published his work, as previously mentioned, has been the discovery of osteological evidence of leprosy in Egypt, dating to 59· Ibid., p. 40. 60.

This pushes the osteological evidence to roughly a century after Alexander's time. To argue that earlier osteological evidence has not survived is unconvincing when we consider that such evidence for tuberculosis is found in Italy and Egypt from as early as the fourth millennium bce.63 Therefore, Andersen is probably correct that leprosy moved from India to the Mediterranean countries about the time of Alexander. But I disagree about how it traveled. did Alexander's army bring leprosy home from india? It seems unlikely that leprosy traveled with Alexander's troops. In the first place, Alexander was not the first to invade India. The Persian king Darius undertook a similar expedition in 510 bce. Moreover, Indian troops fought for Darius s son, Xerxes, during the invasion of Greece in 480 bce and for Darius III against Alexander's army in 3 31 Β c ε .64 How then can we reconcile the possibility that Alexander's troops were infected during a campaign lasting less than two years when Indian troops failed to spread this same disease while serving in Persian armies from Mesopotamia to Greece for well over a century? If an army was able to acquire and spread leprosy so easily, then leprosy should have spread throughout the eastern Mediterranean far earlier than suggested by the evidence. In fact, neither army was a likely carrier because it is difficult for adults to contract this disease. Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease, which is also highly infec tious. However, T-cell-mediated immunity protects more than 95 percent of a population from it.65 Therefore, only about 5 percent of an invading army would be susceptible to leprosy. Furthermore, the susceptibility of soldiers to leprosy was even lower because adults between the ages of twenty and forty appear to be comparatively immune to leprosy. This is suggested by the rarity of infection among adult volunteers and by an infection rate of only 5 percent for spouses of lepers, even after years of sexual relations. In contrast, 60 percent of children living in a family with an infected member develop the disease as children or young adults.66 An army therefore appears to be an unlikely vehicle for the spread of this disease.

There appears to be some cross-immunity between the two diseases with tuberculosis taking precedence, making it even more difficult for leprosy to infect Mediterranean populations.68 The evidence suggests that tuberculosis first appeared in the Mediterranean region during the Neolithic period, and a description of this disease in the Hippocratic Corpus indicates it was still common in Alexander's time.69 Finally, if Alexander's army was responsible for the spread of leprosy, we would expect Persian and Mesopotamian populations to be in fected first because these are the countries to which his army returned after the Indian campaign. Shortly thereafter, troops returning to Macedonia and Greece would have spread the disease to these popula tions. Leprosy should therefore have appeared in Persia, Mesopotamia, Macedonia, and Greece at roughly the same time. Yet the ancient texts suggest that leprosy originated in Egypt. According to Rufus of Ephesus, it was "Straton, the disciple of Erasistratus, who gave us the basic knowledge of this disease (elephan tiasis), which he called cacochymia."70 Straton lived in Alexandria around 300 bce. Furthermore, the fact that he calls leprosy caco chymia— a general term for any illness—instead of elephantiasis or elephas suggests that a specific medical term for leprosy did not yet exist and that it was previously unknown to these ancient physicians. Rufus then goes on to describe some of the symptoms of elephantiasis, which in the early stages was called "leontiasis because patients give off a bad odor, their cheeks collapse, and their lips thicken." In later stages it was called elephantiasis, and the symptoms "consist of livid and black raised areas, especially resembling bruises; some are located on the face, others on the arms, and still others on the legs. It also spread to the back, chest, and stomach. At first these raised areas 67.

This ulceration was accompanied by the swelling of the lips, by a decay so extensive that sometimes the ends of the fingers fall off, and the ulcers never completely heal."71 As previously mentioned, the earliest osteological evidence for leprosy dates to about 200 bce, and these remains were recovered from the Dakleh Oasis in Egypt. Furthermore, according to Plutarch, "both elephantiasis and hydro phobia first made their appearance [in Greece] in the time of Asclepi ades." Asclepiades of Bithynia was a physician who lived around 100 bce.72 Yet even by the time of Celsus, who lived during the reign of Tiberius (ce 14-37), "elephantiasis whilst almost unknown in Italy, is of very frequent occurrence in certain regions."73 Finally, according to Pliny (ce 23-79), "elephantiasis did not occur in Italy before the time ofPompeius Magnus" (106-48 bce), and it "is native to Egypt."74 The first quotation by Pliny appears to be the only evidence to support Andersen's supposition that Pompey's army brought leprosy to Italy after his campaign against Mithridates of Pontus in 62 bce. However, there is nothing in the text to suggest Pompey was in any way responsible. Instead, it seems likely that Pliny, who was a military man, was dating the appearance of this disease by alluding to an important historical event. The ancient sources indicate that Egypt was thought to be the original source of leprosy and suggest that it spread very slowly throughout the Mediterranean. Approximately two centuries passed before it spread from Egypt to Greece and another forty or fifty years before it reached Italy, but even by the time of Tiberius it was still rare. In contrast, no evidence exists to suggest leprosy had infected the populations of either Persia or Mesopotamia. The only evidence we do have is the possible mention of leprosy in passages of the Vendidad and other Avestan books (Persian texts, 250—200 bce), but its identification is uncertain because the disease is never described.75 71.

LEPROSY TRAVELED TO ANCIENT EGYPT IN CARGO SHIPS FROM INDIA If Alexander and his men were not responsible for the spread of leprosy, then the most likely culprits were the seafarers who were taking advantage of the burgeoning trade that resulted from the formation of the Ptolemaic and Selucid empires. Many cities grew wealthy during the Hellenistic period. They include Seleucia-on the-Tigris, Antioch, Rhodes, Ephesus, Alexandria, Corinth, and De los, most of which were connected by sea.76 It was also at this time that we see direct evidence for trade between India and Egypt. Ptolemy Philadelphus (308-246 bce) imported women, spices, zebus (Indian cows), and dogs, while Ptolemy Philopater (ca. 244-205 bce) im ported marble for columns.77 Trade between Egypt and India was carried out by Arabian seafarers who would offload Indian cargoes and pick up Egyptian cargoes at the port of Aden, which is located on the southwestern corner of Arabia. Cargoes would then be sent by caravan to northern Arabia and trans-shipped to Egypt or would be carried directly to Egypt by sea.78 Ptolemy Philadelphus may have founded the two port cities of Myos Hormos and Berenice on the Red Sea coast to take advantage of this expanding trade.79 Women, cattle, and marble were cargoes most efficiently shipped by sea. Marble for columns would be too heavy and bulky to move by land, while large numbers of humans and animals would be difficult to feed and water on a long trek through the deserts of Arabia. What is most important is that at about the same time Straton describes the earliest case of leprosy in the Mediterranean region, slaves were being im ported into Egypt from India. Young women were probably in the greatest demand, possibly followed by children of both sexes. A child in India could be sold 76. W. W.

Furthermore, the conditions aboard ship during a long voyage from India to Egypt would be ideal for its spread. Leprosy bacilli appear to spread princi pally by discharge from the nose, but it may also be possible to inhale the bacilli. Nasal secretions remain viable for up to a week and in humid environments like the hold of a ship for up to ten days.81 In addition, the close confines of a ship, the tendency to huddle together at night to stay warm, and the sharing of communal meals would all facilitate the spread of this disease. The possibility of ships being efficient incubators is reflected in the variation of incidence for leprosy. One of the odd characteristics of leprosy is its increased prevalence near seacoasts and on islands, which led medieval and early-modern theorists to propose that a diet consisting of fish was a cause of leprosy.82 Therefore, a connection between seafaring and the spread of leprosy does appear to exist. Furthermore, if a person wanted protection, a stone engraved with the design of a ship was worn on the ring finger of the left hand.83 Another important factor allowing the spread of leprosy is its incubation period, which can last from six months to ten years, with an average period of three to five years before symptoms appear. Even the early stages of the lepromatous form are insidious, which made it difficult to distinguish this form from other nonspecific skin erup tions.84 This allowed leprosy to spread more easily. Therefore, an individual could contract the disease, be shipped to Egypt, and be part of a household for several years before symptoms started to appear. Furthermore, because a person s reaction to leprosy and the incubation period can vary considerably, it was possible that an in fected individual could manifest symptoms before the original carrier did. Under these conditions, it would be difficult to determine the source of leprosy. Unfortunately, we do not have any exact numbers for the importa tion of Indian slaves to Egypt, but this trade does have a long history. 80.

Slaves were used primarily in household service, and since concubinage was com mon, female slaves were prized.87 Slaves in these positions would have close contact with their master's family, making it relatively easy to infect a large number of people. Furthermore, in Greek Ptolemaic society, ownership of slaves was not based on class but on one's financial status. Therefore, such slaves would have been owned by the king at one end of the social spectrum as well as by any commoner who could afford one. Again, there are no exact numbers for the size of the slave popula tion during this period. However, commercial relations continued to grow, until by the first half of the first century ce, India was one of Rome's largest trading partners, with Egyptian traders living in India and Indian traders in Egypt. Moreover, Augustus received many embassies from India, and at about this same time, Indians were a common sight in Alexandria, allowing leprosy to be spread by visitors and businessmen.88 Even if the numbers of slaves were modest, it would not take a large number of them to spread this disease given their intimate place in the household. Furthermore, it is possible that imported Indian slaves may have had a higher rate of leprosy than the general Indian population. As previously mentioned, the various forms of leprosy were well understood in India by 600 bce, and laws were instituted to protect slave owners. These laws included fines for selling slaves 85.

Leprosy was also typically thought to be a hereditary disease before modern times, possibly because it is common for children living in a family with an infected member to develop it. Under these circumstances, a slave owner may have sold the children of a leprous slave even though they did not exhibit any symptoms. Although there is no direct evidence that this practice did take place, the fact that laws were instituted in India to protect slave buyers from unscrupulous sellers suggests such practices were not uncommon. Furthermore, we see similar parallels in other places and other times. Maliki law, one of the four Sunni schools of law, guarantees a slave buyer a period of three days to return a slave if he detects any faults. In the case of leprosy, this guarantee is extended to a year. Even with guarantees in place, a buyer was still forced to be vigilant because leprous sores were sometimes concealed.90 Therefore, it is well within the realm of possibility that Indian slave owners were knowingly shipping out leprous slaves. Finally, if we accept the premise that leprosy originated in the East and came to Egypt via seaborne trade, it may allow us to understand how leprosy spread to sub-Saharan Africa. The origin of leprosy is sometimes attributed to Africa, possibly as early as Pleistocene times. From there, it is thought to have spread to other lands.91 The problem with this theory is a lack of any osteological or textual evidence to suggest when leprosy first appeared Africa. Furthermore, if leprosy did originate in Africa, especially at such an early time, we would expect to see it appear relatively quickly in Egypt and then throughout the Mediterranean region instead of first appearing in India. Direct sea trade between Egypt and sub-Saharan Africa begins at the begin ning of the third millennium bce. As previously mentioned, the first description of a slave being imported to Egypt from East Africa dates to about 2650 bce. Such voyages from Egypt were undoubtedly 89.

If leprosy was endemic to Africa as early as the Pleistocene, as has been proposed, then it should have appeared very early in Egypt and northern Africa. However, as the earliest evidence for leprosy comes from the East, it seems likely that it spread to sub-Saharan Africa in the same way that it spread to Egypt, via sea trade. After offloading cargo at the Port of Aden for transit to Egypt, ships would then continue trading down the coast of Africa possibly as far south as what is today central Tanzania. From here they would catch the eastern winds to sail home.94 Therefore, leprosy probably spread at about the same time and in the same way to East Africa as it did to Egypt. Although we lack evidence for this scenario, it seems a more likely one than having it originating in Africa, spreading to India, back to Egypt, and then to the eastern Mediterranean region. Invading armies undoubtedly spread diseases far and wide during ancient times. Yet, we should not be complacent and automatically accept such a notion for every disease before evaluating the evidence. Alexander's troops were unlikely to have contracted leprosy because of age and a cross-immunity with tuberculosis. Furthermore, Indian troops served in Persian armies for more than a century and still failed to spread leprosy to the West. It is therefore improbable that Alexander's men would do so after less than two years in India. In contrast, leprosy appeared in Egypt at a time when slaves were being carried on small ships from India to Egypt, and it spreads most easily among children and young adults, a group not represented in Alexander's army but common among slaves. Furthermore, its spread among slaves would be facilitated by a long confinement in the damp hold of a small ship. Once arriving in Egypt, slaves could easily infect the children and young adults in the households they served. The 92.

If Alexander's men had brought it back from India, we would expect to see leprosy appear in Persia, Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece at about the same time as his troops returned home, but ancient texts state that leprosy was native to Egypt and from there it slowly spread north and west. The description of the pattern in which leprosy appears and slowly spreads throughout the eastern Mediterranean, in conjunction with its slow appearance in the medical texts is consistent for leprosy suddenly appearing and spreading from Egypt in the fourth century bce. Finally, higher rates of leprosy have been associated with coastal sites and islands. In fact, all of the evidence suggests that the most likely scenario for the spread of this condition was that it was brought to Egypt on countless small ships and, in this same manner, slowly spread throughout the Mediterranean region.</page></plain_text>
