Aniot) Youzimai is a widespread wheat landrace and has been used extensively in breeding programs in China. In order to assess the genetic variation between and within Youzimai accessions, samples of 31 landrace accessions of wheat, all called 'Youzimai', were collected from 6 geographic regions in China and evaluated using morphological traits, seedling resistance to powdery mildew, gliadin and microsatellite markers. Typical differences among accessions were observed in morphological characteristics. Forty-five (58.4%) of 77 assayed SSR markers showed polymorphism over the entire collection and total 226 alleles were identified with an average of 5.02 alleles per locus. SSR data indicated that the accessions from Hebei province were the most diverse, as evidenced by greatest number of region-specific alleles and highest diversity index. These accessions, therefore, probably experienced the most substantial morphological and molecular evolution as a result of various natural and anthropomorphic influences. On the other hand, differentiation in gliadin phenotypes was found among seeds within 80.6% of total accessions and average 61.5% of entire collections showed heterogeneous and comprised resistant plants in reaction to powdery mildew, suggesting the presence of a wide diversity within the wheat landrace. By developing an intimate knowledge of the available wheat genotypes, appropriate selections can be made for commercial application in order to conserve and exploit the diversity of the wheat landraces. Keywords: wheat landrace, morphology, powdery mildew, gliadin, microsatellite, genetic diversity Introduction Wheat, Triticum aestivum (L.) em Thell, is one of the most important food crops in the world and China has been proposed as a center of diversity for wheat (Yen et al. 1988).

Moreover, Chinese landraces have several characteristic traits, for example earliness, large numbers of grains per spike, high adaptability and long history of cultivation (Dong and Zheng 2000). However, with the increasing food demand and multiple biotic and abiotic stresses, wheat cultivars with higher yield potential are needed. The utilization of the genetic variation that exists in natural populations of landraces is an option to achieve this objective. The landraces of wheat have proved to possess a pool of useful genetic variability that can be applied to effective breeding programs all over the world. Previous studies have shown macro and micro-scale adaptive divergence of genetic diversity in wheat landraces at the agronomic (Dencic et al. 2000), protein (Routray et al. 2007) and DNA levels (Iqbal et al. 2009). Recent research has identified genes that manifest resistance to several diseases including powdery mildew (caused by Blumeria graminis (DC.) E. O. Speer. f. sp. tritici) (Huang et al. 1997), stripe rust (caused by Puccinia striiformis Westend f. sp. tritici), leaf rust (caused by P. recondita Roberge ex Desmaz. f. sp. tritici) (Obert et al. 2005) and fusarium head blight (caused mainly by Fusarium graminearum Schwabe) (Lin et al. 2006). Youzimai is a widespread wheat landrace that was grown mostly in southern Hebei northern Henan provinces and middle and western Shandong province in the 1950s, because of its distinct attractive appearance such as short stature, high yield potential, easy shattering, earliness, resisting flag smut and broad adaptability (Zhuang 2003). The annual maximum acreage of this wheat in China was 733,000 hectares. In addition to direct agricultural production, Youzimai has been used extensively in breeding programs, producing some valuable cultivars in China. At present, thirty-one wheat accessions known as Youzimai have been collected from 6 geographic regions by the plant resource investigation team of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS) and kept at the National Crop Gene Bank of China. However, little attention has been paid to their genetic diversity. The objectives of this study were to assess the genetic variation among and within Youzimai accessions utilizing morphological traits, seedling resistance to powdery mildew, gliadin and SSR markers in order to conserve and exploit the diversity of the wheat landraces. Materials and Methods Plant materials Thirty-one wheat landraces, all named 'Youzimai', were collected from Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian provinces (Table 1). Fig. 1 presents geographic locations of tested Youzimai accessions. Seeds of these genotypes were obtained from the National Crop Gene Bank, CAAS, Beijing, China.

A randomized complete block design with 3 replicates was used and plants were cultivated in a 2 m long and three row-plot trial at the experimental station of the Institute of Crop Science (116°2\ 40°22'), CAAS, Beijing, China. When mature, 10 plants were randomly sampled from each plot for evaluation of six agronomic characters: plant height, spike length, spikelet number, number of grains per spike, 1000-grain weight and spike number per plant. Mean, standard error, coefficient of variation (CV) and range of each trait were computed for each accession. Data were evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) performed using the general linear model of the SAS Cereal Research Communications 40, 2012</page><page sequence="4">98 LI et al.: Genetic Diversity of the Wheat Landrace Youzimai program (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Additionally, observations of seed color and survey of awn size were made. Resistance tests Due to the poor germination of certain accessions, each accession was represented by fifteen to twenty six plants to characterize reaction to powdery mildew in the greenhouse. Two powdery mildew isolates E09 and E23, which were popular in China, were used in this study. The inoculation was carried out when plants were at two-leaf stage by dusting conidia from diseased plants. After 8-10 days of incubation, the infection types were measured on the primary leaves of the seedlings when the susceptible check (Jingshuang 16) was full of spores. The infection types (ITs) were scored using a 0-4 scale from Sheng (1988), where 0 = no visible sign of disease, and 4 = well developed, freely sporulating colonies. Gliadin analysis For each accession, 30 seeds were analyzed to determine gliadin composition using acid polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis (A-PAGE), following previously described procedures (Metakovsky and Novoselskaya 1991). Gliadin phenotypes were separated based on their mobility into four zones of gel (i.e. a-, /3-, y- and co-gliadins). The frequency of various gliadin phenotypes within each accession, and different gliadin zones, was determined. A standard reference cultivar (Marquis) was used in this study. Microsatellite analysis The genetic variation of the accessions was investigated using 42 microsatellite primer pairs and 35 EST-SSRs primer pairs. Information on most markers was obtained from the GrainGenes website. EST-SSRs of XSWES markers were identified from Chen et al. (2005). Genomic DNA was isolated from mixed fresh leaves of 10 plants as previously described (Saghai-Maroof et al. 1984). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and amplification programs were performed as described by Wu et al. (2006) in a PTC-200 thermocycler (MJ Research, Watertown, MA, USA). PCR products were separated on 6% polyacrylamide denaturing gels and were visualized following silver-staining. Each amplified DNA fragment was scored as present (1) or absent (0). Polymorphic information content (PIC) was calculated for each primer using the following algorithm (Powell et al. 1996): Hk = I where Ps is the frequency of the fh allele at k!h locus. Genetic similarity and cluster analysis A SSR data matrix was used to compute J &amp; C genetic distance coefficients (Jukes and Cantor 1969) using NTSYS-pc version 2.1 software (Rohlf 2000). Distance coefficients were used to construct a dendrogram using the neighbor-joining method (Saitou and Nei 1987) in the NTSYS program.

Of the analyzed accessions, the awn were absent of the accession ZM92 from Hebei, the short awns (smaller than 2 cm) were detected in three accessions, namely ZM236 from Hebei, ZM6941 from Zhejiang and ZM7529 from Fujian, and the remaining 27 accessions had a long awn. The grain of six accessions, ZM417 and ZM831 from Hebei, ZM2793 and ZM2798 from Henan, ZM6941 from Zhejiang and ZM7529 from Fujian were red, and the remainder was white. ANOVA indicated that the genotypes were all significantly different for all six agronomic traits (Table 2). Based on the coefficient of variation (CV), several of the measured plant characteristics, including spike length, 1000-grain weight and number of spikes per plant, showed considerable variation (Table 3). There was less variability in plant height, spikelet number and number of grains per spike. The highest and the lowest CV were observed for 1000-grain weight and spikelet number, respectively. Thousand-grain weight varied from 19.09 to 33.58 and spikelet number varied from 15.00 to 19.38. Table 2.

Accession ZM6266 from Jiangsu was the most diverse, possessing as many as seven gliadin phenotypes. Total ninety gliadin phenotypes were observed across all accessions. On the other hand, based on the differentiation of gliadin phenotypes in the four gliadin zones (i.e., a-, /?-, y- and co-gliadins), five, 10,28 and 42 phenotypes were observed, respectively, indicating higher variability in the y- and &lt;y-gliadin zones. SSR analysis For analysis of genome composition among Youzimai accessions, 77 SSR primer pairs were selected. In general, forty-five (58.4%) of all assayed markers showed polymorphism over the entire collection and were scored for genetic analysis; in total, 226 alleles were identified. The number of alleles amplified by each polymorphic marker varied from two (Xgwmll3, Xgwm455, Xgdm98, Xcnl76, Xswesl23 and Xksum64) to a maximum of 13 (Xgwm334) with an average of 5.02 alleles per locus. Across the polymorphic markers, the polymorphic information content ranged from 0.06 (Xgwmll3) to 0.85 (Xgwm540) with an average of 0.55. The A (0.59) and B (0.58) genomes were found to have more introduced variability than the D (0.48) genome. Though the numbers of the collected samples are imbalanced in different provinces in the present study, we hope to show a few characteristics of variation among different regions. According to the regions of collection, these accessions were divided into four Cereal Research Communications 40, 2012</page><page sequence="8">102 LI et al.: Genetic Diversity of the Wheat Landrace Youzimai groups (i.e., Hebei, Henan, Shandong and others. Three accessions, including ZM6266 from Jiangsu, ZM6941 from Zhejiang and ZM7529 from Fujian province, were regarded as one group because all of them come from Southeast seaboard of China). Region-specific alleles were found in all groups (Table 6). Total eighty-eight region-specific alleles were identified, comprising about 38.9% of all of the amplified alleles. The greatest number of region-specific alleles was observed in Hebei (61), comprising 69.3% of all region-specific alleles. The numbers of region-specific alleles were 7,6 and 14 in other three groups, respectively. Not surprisingly, data from Hebei also generated a PIC value (0.574) comparable to the mixed group (0.573) where only one accession was collected in each region, but higher than the PIC values found in Henan (0.452) and Shandong (0.473).

The largest estimated genetic distance (0.485) was found between ZM2668 from Henan and ZM321 from Hebei. It was not possible to distinguish among ZM422, ZM417 and ZM456, which were all collected from Hebei, resulting in a genetic distance of zero without polymorphic loci among them. Cluster analysis classified the accessions into two major clusters (Fig. 2). The first cluster contained a main group of eight accessions collected from Hebei (Group I), and a small group of three accessions, namely ZM6941 from Zhejiang, ZM7529 from Fujian and ZM6266 from Jiangsu (Group II). The second cluster comprised a group of five accessions from Hebei (Group III), a group of ten accessions (Group IV) where three from Hebei, five from Henan and two from Shandong were mixed in this group, and a group of five accessions (Group V) where three accessions were from Henan and the other two come from Hebei and Shandong, respectively. Discussion Based on the available evidence, it appears that the original Youzimai accession has undergone considerable genetic evolution. Our data and those reported by Zhuang (2003) suggests that the original Youzimai had a long awn and white grain. The condition of the long awn has been maintained in 27 of the 31 investigated accessions, the exception being ZM92, ZM236, ZM6941 and ZM7529.

A dendrogram based on J &amp; C genetic distance using the neighbor-joining method from microsatellite markers, showing genetic relationships among the 31 Youzimai accessions Note: A Hebei; • Henan; ■ Shandong; ▼ Jiangsu; ♦ Zhejiang; A Fujian accessions were likely due to the mutation of the gene that controls awn phenotype. If the individual mutated plants in the original population proved to be prolific, vigorous and productive, it would have been preferentially selected and saved as seed for future crops. Pagnotta et al. (2004) argued that the landrace populations contain some common elements but also considerable diversity that allows adaptation to the erratic climatic conditions that characterize the region. Thus, landraces may have experienced processes of evolution, in spite of a possible common origin, generate genetically divergent plant material. He found that 'Haurani', a durum wheat landrace widely cultivated in Syria, gave rise to 58 novel Haurani genotypes under different environmental conditions. There were differences in spike density, glume color, lemma and awn among these various Haurani genotypes. Likewise, Grando et al. (2000) also found considerable variability in several characteristics among homonymous barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) landraces collected from different fields. SSR data indicated that Hebei had greater allelic diversity, including some region-specific alleles. Zhuang (2003) reported that Youzimai was a popular variety of wheat in southern Hebei province, northern Henan province and middle and western Shandong province in the 1950s. Vavilov (1926) and Doggett (1965) argued that there was a ten Cereal Research Communications 40, 2012</page><page sequence="10">104 LI et al.: Genetic Diversity of the Wheat Landrace Youzimai dency for a crop's diversity to be highest in its region of origin. With this assumption in mind, and based on the data gathered in this study, south Hebei is the most likely candidate for the original Youzimai cultivation sites, from which it diffused to other regions via normal trading and seed exchanges between farmers. In the current study, eighty-eight region-specific alleles were found in all collection regions. Similarly, Teklu et al. (2007) found the same number of region-specific alleles in 11 regions when analyzing the genetic diversity of 73 emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccon Schrank) landraces by 29 SSR markers. When 58 durum wheat genotypes derived from Haurani were analyzed using seven probes, 27 RFLP fragments were found to be population-specific for four regions (Pagnotta et al. 2004). The appearance of region-specific alleles from plants obtained in each collection region further suggests that regional genomes of the tested accessions underwent adaptive selection in response to environmental variables (Nevo 1998). Of course, some of the region-specific alleles may only be the result of genetic drift. Environmental conditions and anthropogenic selection may significantly impact the structure of genetic diversity, resulting in novel variations. In this study of the six agronomic characteristics, plant height and spike length were positively correlated with mean annual rainfall in the wheat growth period among different collection regions (r = 0.983 and 0.995, respectively) while spike number per plant was negatively correlated with mean annual rainfall (r = -0.979). Only spikelet number had a positive correlation with mean annual temperature (r = 0.989). No correlation was found between the PIC values of different regions based on SSR data and ecological parameters. Therefore, the absence of awn in ZM92, short awn in ZM236, ZM6941 and ZM7529, and red grain in ZM417, ZM831, ZM2793, ZM2798, ZM6941 and ZM7529 are probably due to genetic mutations that occurred and were propagated under given environmental conditions. Such relationships have been identified in previous studies. Lazaro et al. (2001), for example, found that the morphological characteristics in Spanish landraces of lentil {Lens culinaris Medik.) correlated well with regional climatic variables. Demissew et al. (2011) also argued that anthropogenic and natural causes influenced population genetic structure of Juniperus procera Hochst. ex Endl. in the Ethiopian highlands. Heterogeneity within wheat landraces may be a primary cause of genetic diversification in the Youzimai accession. We found that 80.6% of the accessions were heterogeneous for their gliadin phenotypes. Recent studies have identified substantial heterogeneity among wheat landraces according to analysis of the composition of high molecular weight glutenin subunits (Routray et al. 2007). According to Harlan (1975), the primal Youzimai population could be considered as a mixture of various genotypes which provided a relatively robust genetic pool that was utilized under new environmental conditions, resulting in adaptation and survival for some individuals and elimination for others. The present study also confirmed the values of wheat landraces as a genetic resource. Among 31 investigated Youzimai landrace accessions, twenty-six (83.9%) and nine (39.1%) showed heterogeneous and comprised resistant plants (ITs &gt; 2) to E09 and E23 powdery mildew isolates which was popular in China, respectively. This implied that these accessions are of potential value in breeding programs concerned with powdery milCereal Research Communications 40, 2012</page><page sequence="11">LI et al.: Genetic Diversity of the Wheat Landrace Youzimai 105 dew. Similarly, He et al. (2007) reported heterogeneity in related species and landraces of wheat with regard to their response to powdery mildew and strip rust. The dendrogram separated the accessions into two major clusters. In general, the accessions from the same geographic regions could be gathered nearly, for example group I and III. While some accessions from different geographic regions were mixed in several groups, for example group II, IV and V, suggesting that there was a frequent exchange of seeds and genetic materials among these regions. In conclusion, in view of the observed heterogeneity and genetic diversity within and among Youzimai wheat landraces, it is necessary to preserve the populations of Youzimai landraces respectively through a special management plan.
