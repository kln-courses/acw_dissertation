<plain_text><page sequence="1">Principal Aspects and Problems of Theology in Kievan Rus' GERHARD PODSKALSKY In the course of a lecture on the literature of Kievan Rus', a historian of Russian literature - an expert on the early Middle Ages - suddenly expostu- lated: "Kievan theology - is there such a thing?" Good Protestant that he was, he associated the concept of "theology" with the two standard courses offered at universities today: historical-critical exegesis, and systematic and speculative dogmatics. If we take theology to mean this particular use of language, then in Kievan Rus' there was no such thing. If we neverthe- less refer to "Kievan theology," we must use the concept in a more general sense, one that is more closely related to pluralistic, patristic modes of expression.1 Then theology becomes a Christian, spiritual dimension belonging to disparate literary genres, with a heavy concentration in the areas of homiletics, hagiography, and ascetics, together with the liturgical poetry that embraces all three sectors. The theology of Kievan Rus' is characterized by several limiting factors, for example, the often emphasized "falling away" from the classical tradition - Greek philosophy - in the old Slavic translations. But this theol- ogy possesses no specific characteristics, if we understand these to be themes or teachings absent from its principal source areas, either Byzantium or Slavia Christiana. My remarks are therefore concerned only with several known or supposed problem areas or principal themes that, within the frame of reference outlined, can be discovered in the literature that originated in Kiev. Any drawing of conclusions from these observations is, of course, provisional, due to the denial of access to the manuscripts. I. PROBLEMS IN THE THEOLOGICAL LITERATURE Whereas a whole series of disciplinary trials on matters of doctrine took place in the Byzantine church during the eleventh to thirteenth centuries - for instance, the trials of Johannes Italus and Eustratius of Nicea - it is remarkable that Kievan Rus' knew only a few, apparently minor, incidents of this kind. These include the temporary schism following the election (on 1 On this, see J. Stiglmayr, "Mannigfache Bedeutungen von 'Theologie' und 'Theologen'," Theologie und Glaube 11(1919): 296-309, especially 308f.</page><page sequence="2">THEOLOGY IN KIEV AN RUS 27 1 21 July 1147) of the second Rus'-born metropolitan, Klim Smoliatich; the debate over fasting on Wednesdays and Fridays (1157-68), which con- cluded with a compromise engineered by Constantinople and - the Rus' sources (Laurentian Chronicle, concerning 1164) to the contrary - cannot be called an actual ' 'heresy"; and finally, the two examinations - ending in a total rehabilitation - of the eschatological sermons of the monk-priest Avraamii of Smolensk (ca. 1150-1220),2 to which I will return later. I shall discuss these problem areas, as well as the polemics against the ' 'Latins," who were essentially all living abroad in the West. A. Ariani s m Apart from the problem areas noted, Soviet and other researchers in both the East and the West have speculated that there were other doctrinal defen- sive battles, e.g., christological ones, that might have led to conflicts with Arian or Arian-sounding heresies. The initial impetus for these specula- tions came from the translation into Old Slavic (in tenth-century Bulgaria) of anti-Arian sermons, for which a current need was postulated,3 and from Old Rus' sources containing Arian-tainted statements or polemical refer- ences to Arianism. The question is: by which avenue did Arian thought reach the Rus'? It is purely hypothetical to assume a connection here with the Arian Germanic tribes that had originally settled in Southwest Rus' (the Carpathians), for example, the Gepidae, who were conquered as early as 567. But we should consider the relevant passages in Kievan literature itself, first in writings by those suspected of Arianism. To start with, we have the second of the two professions of faith that Volodimer is said to have made when he was baptized, namely, the one that 2 See G. Podskalsky, Christentum und theologische Literatur in der Kiever Rus' (988-1237) (Munich, 1982), pp. 43-50. 3 We are concerned here with four homilies by Athanasius of Alexandria, although the Rus' manuscripts are later, dating from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. See A. Vaillant, Discours contre les Ariens de S. Athanase (Sofia, 1954), pp. 20-265; I. Dujcev, "Literatur und Kunst gegen 'Ariana haeresia' in Südost-Europa," Slovo 25/26 (1976): 203-211; I. Dujcev, "L'oeuvre de Méthode d'Olympe 'De libero arbitrio' et les discussions entre ortho- doxes et hérétiques," Balcanica 8 (1977): 115-27, esp. 116, fn. 1; A.

Kuev, "Arianstvo," in Kirilo-Metodievska Enciklopedija, vol. 1 (Sofia, 1985), pp. 103f. Even the reference to Bogomilism in Bulgaria cannot be proved. The same dating holds for an anonymous Rus' sermon on the fathers of the Council of Nicaea, "Against the Heretic Areios." See I. Kupriianov, "Pamiatniki drevnei russkoi slo- vesnosti," in Zhurnal Ministerstva narodnogo prosveshcheniia, 1854, vol. 84, section 2, pp. 180-82 (edition from the Sbornik of the sixteenth century).</page><page sequence="3">272 GERHARD PODSKALSKY goes back to the Byzantine monk Michael Synkellus (ca. 760- 846).4 The version in the chronicles, which is presumed to be more recent than the translation in the Izbornik Sviatoslava 1073 g. (though not dependent on it),5 contains several statements that are considered - due to the omission, interpretation, or translation of Greek terms - to be typically Arian, particu- larly the assertion that the Son is "similar in essence" to the Father {podoben sushchen) or the Holy Ghost " similar in perfection" to the Father and the Son (podobnosversheno ), whereas the Greek original has the well-known term "ójuooixnoç" for the Son and the Holy Ghost.6 But a comparison with other declarations of the same professions of faith, e.g., the recognition of the ecumenical councils, leads to the conclusion that the translator in no way had in mind a total Arian purging of the Greek text; presumably the editor of the chronicle just used an extant form of the source text, where the "Arianisms" were attributable either to a corrupt source ("ójiioíoDaioç" for "óuxxrúaioç") or else to the translator's lack of con- centration or skill.7 A passage in Kirill of Turov's first sermon to the monks also poses an apparent problem. There, in the explication of the parable of the halt and the blind, along with an allusion to Gen. 1: 26f., Christ is called a man "not as an image, but as a likeness {ne obrazom, no pritcheiu )."8 Are we to con- clude from this, as have the authors of a recent study,9 that here Kirill, who adamantly rejected Arianism in his canonical sermon on the Council of Nicaea (traditional for the Sunday after the Feast of the Ascension), himself fell victim to Arianism? Not at all, for Kirill was simply harking back to the exegesis (of Gen. 1: 26f.) formulated earlier by Clemens of Alexandria and Origen: it sets forth the idea that man has to travel an upward path from 4 Edition: B.

These warnings include Kirill of Turov's sermon on the 318 fathers of the Council of Nicaea, which, following the model of the Mother Church, found its appointed place on the Sunday before Pentecost in Kievan Rus' as else- where.12 A further warning appears in a passage in the Rus' version of the 4 'Wanderings" (Khozhdenie ) of St. Nicholas of Myra, a father at the Coun- cil of Nicaea.13 Finally, there is a slovo "On the Falling-away of the Latins" (referring to the intrusion of the word filioque in the Latin Creed as 10 See the excellent study by H. Merki, 'Ouoiûxjiç 6eü). Von der platonischen Angleichung an Gott zur Gottähnlichkeit bei Gregor von Nyssa (Freiburg, Switzerland, 1952) (=Paradosis, 7). 11 The situation was different in the second half of the fifteenth century when the then recently translated sermons of Athanasius (see fn. 3 above) could be used in Novgorod in the fight against heretics: cf.

Despite repeated claims to the contrary, made to the present day, for the pre-Mongol period we cannot name a single Bogomil with any degree of certainty; cf. Podskalsky, Christentum, pp. 44f.; K. Onasch's conjecture regarding Kirill of Turov (i.e., the connections with the history of heresy during the emergence of an anthropomorphic image of the Holy Trinity in Byzantine Slavic Orthodoxy, presented in "Ketzergeschichtliche Zusammenhänge bei der Entstehung des anthropomorphen Dreieinigkeitsbildes der byzantinisch-slavischen Orthodoxie," Byzantino- Slavica 31 [1970]: 243, fn. 2) has not yet been substantiated. 12 See S. Salaville, "La fête du concile de Nicée et les fêtes de conciles dans le rit byzantin," Echos d'Orient 24 (1925): 445 -70. On the text of the sermon, see I. P. Eremin, "Literaturnoe nasledie Kirilla Turovskogo," TODRL 15 (1958): 343-48. Kirill's sermon is based on an anonymous slovo (from "Zlatoust" or "Torzhestvennik") on the same topic: see Kupriianov, "Pamiatniki." This sermon, which concludes with an intercession for the Orthodox princes and the preservation of the faith from heresy, also mentions the legendary dispute of the 318 fathers of the Council with the pagan philosophers supporting Arius: see M. Jugie, "La dispute des philosophes païens avec les Pères de Nicée," Echos d'Orient 24 (1925): 403-410. 13 See Podskalsky, Christentum, p. 129 (on the editions of the above cited texts, see ibid., p. 127, fn. 584).</page><page sequence="5">274 GERHARD PODSKALSKY the cause of the schism of 1054),14 which indirectly accuses the Western church of Arian leanings; however, the details of Byzantine church history embedded in the text lead us to suspect that a Greek cleric was its author. B. Double Faith (Dvoeverie) For the church of the Rus', the problem of a double faith was far closer to everyday concerns than were the speculative discussions about Christology and the Holy Trinity. Along with the major vices of usury, fornication, drunkenness, and violence - and often combined with them - the extremely long-lived evil of dvoeverie was among the most frequently attacked sins of newly converted Christians.15 To be sure, a famous preacher like the abbot Serapion, later Bishop of Vladimir, could on occasion demonstrate to Chris- tians ad óculos how exemplary the pagans' observation of natural moral law was,16 but the continuance of pagan cultic or superstitious practices (e.g., sorcery) was roundly condemned by the church. As yet we have only fragmentary ideas about the old Slavic pagans - as we have about the not- yet-Christianized tribes of Central Europe - gleaned from Christian writings against them or contemporary Arabic sources,17 but the common practice of dvoeverie has been clarified by artisan-made amulets, among other things.18 In the original Kievan literature, dvoeverie can have two meanings: the con- cept usually refers to the simultaneous practice or merging of Christian and pagan cultic forms; but in several passages it also means an indecisive vacillation between the Latin and the Greek-Byzantine rite (in cities where 14 Podskalsky, Christentum, pp. 260f. (on the edition of the above cited text, see p. 259). On the problem of filioque, see my article, "Filioque," in Lexikon des Mittelalters, 4, no. 3 (Mun- ich, 1987), cols. 449f. 15 How deeply rooted non-Christian beliefs and reliance on the various forms of prophecy among the common folk really were, and would remain right into our own times, is shown in the Ukraine by the almost exclusively pagan customs surrounding the Feast of St. Andrew the Apostle: see B. G. Mykytiuk, Die ukrainischen Andreasbräuche und verwandtes Brauchtum (Wiesbaden, 1979); see also F. Haase, Volksglaube und Brauchtum der Ostslaven (Breslau, 1939). 16 See Podskalsky, Christentum, p. 106 (slovo 5; on the edition of the text cited above, see ibid., p. 105). 17 See M. Espéronnier, "L'évolution cultuelle des Slaves du VIIe au XIIe s. suivant les textes arabes médiévaux. Croyances et rites," Cahiers de civilisation médiévale (Xe -XIIe s.) 27 (1984): 319-27. But even though the Christian church issued repeated warnings about "for- bidden books" (otrechenniia knigi - writings on sorcery, the use of medicinal herbs, astrology, auguries, etc.), mention of titles or censured passages was frequently omitted (except for the Apocrypha). 10 Concerning the zmeevki, i.e., medallions worn around me neck and decorated witn representations of Mary or the saints on one side and, on the reverse, with the head or body of the Medusa in a circle of serpents (hence the name "zmeevki"), see J.

Further- more, a question discussed in the nineteenth century and even more intensely in recent Soviet historiography,19 is whether Christianity de- stroyed a religious and culturally intact pagan world by "baptizing the Rus' " (in 988), or whether it simply replaced the vestiges of a pagan world that had already become an empty shell. The converse of this question revolves around the insoluble question of the depth of the nadir that the Christian religion reached in the first centuries of Rus' history and subse- quently.20 In light of the lack of source materials (particularly for old Slavic paganism, which is not the case for the Graeco-Roman world), we can hardly expect to find a universally acceptable answer to the questions raised here. Yet we can hope to contribute to the basis and quality of the discus- sion. Of the written evidence for dvoeverie, which contains many parallels to the history of the conversion of the West European peoples,21 only the most important documents are discussed here. Of small concern to us is the por- trayal of mythological figures, pagan divinities and rituals, magic and fes- tival customs, marriage laws, eating customs, and all those practices (pro- phecy, funeral feasts, etc.) typically belonging to the "double faith" as they are addressed in the sermons and church laws;22 what is important is what the church could offer to counter against this ever-latent subculture. In the canonical questions and answers of the Novgorod deacon Kirik (b. 1110), Bishop Nifont threatened with a powerful "Woe [unto you]!" both the offerings of food to the nature gods Rod and Rozhanitsa and the violators of their prohibitions.23 Regarding the blessing of the funeral feast (kut'ia, Gr. KOMußov) - whose pagan origin led to its radical suppression in the 19 Thus, for example, in Academician B. A. Rybakov's Kievskaia Rus' i russkie kniazhestva XII -XIII vv.

Compared to Western canon law, the punitive measures in the Old Rus' canon law for remaining attached to paganism were decidedly mild. Metropolitan Ioann II of Kiev (1076/77-1089), in the name of "church doctrine" - and thereby differing from earlier dictates of Western and Eastern canon law - expressly rejected the corporal punishment of magicians and sorcerers ("witches"), even in cases of extreme recalcitrance; as an antidote he recommended "straighten- ing out their thinking" (vouGeaicciç ércioxpecpEiv) by stern rebukes.27 That parainesis (exhortation) was the prime weapon in the fight against dvoe- verie is evident from the relevant sermons, the majority of which are anonymous. Some of these were wrongly attributed to Feodosii Pecherskii: an admonitory sermon on God's punishment contains among other things a condemnation of minstrels (skomorokhi ) and of the playing of gusli and rusalias,2* as well as of chronic drunkenness, which was seen as a vestige of paganism. Another sermon "on the true faith" describes and condemns (following Elijah's fight against Baal, 1 Kings 18: 17-40) the frequent occurrence of dvoeverie among the neophytes who retained their faith in the pagan pantheon after being baptized ("worse than heretics and Jews"), as expressed - especially at weddings29 - in games, songs, dances, and 24 See J.

In a series of other slova on the same theme,31 the role of Byzantine sources, for instance, is not explained clearly. A firm rejection of the Latin faith - firmer than in the canonical questions and answers - is contained in an epistle of the igumen Feodosii Grek (d. 1 156)32 to Prince Iziaslav (Msti- slavich); there the term dvoeverie is still qualified by the designations krivo- vernye, chuzhdaia vera, bliz eresi, etc. But in spite of the urgent admoni- tion to avoid contact, charitableness toward those of a different faith was not only permitted, but encouraged.33 On the other hand, Bishop Serapion of Vladimir (d. 1275) reported that innocent people had been burned at the stake, the judges of whom had fallen victim to belief in sorcery (or supersti- tion).34 Apart from Metropolitan Ioann, Serapion is probably the hierarch who, in his cursory consideration of the history of man (slovo 4 and 5), relied most fervently on the sober judgment and engaged humanity of his listeners. Given this fundamental attitude, he could point out to his own generation the contrast between the diabolical perversions found among Christians (e.g., the practice of "trial by water") and the high moral level of the pagans; his superior intellectual and spiritual caliber is also evident in his sovereign familiarity with Holy Scripture and in the excellent rhetorical structure of his sermons.35 To summarize, official church representatives combatted dvoeverie (of any stripe) both with discipline, through admonitions to contain it and through relatively mild punishments, and with doctrine, almost exclusively 30 Edition: A.

Viskovatyi, have to date been neither accepted nor refuted. Furthermore, con- cerning questions of the authorship of polemical works in general, we have to consider the fact that this literary genre is clearly, and not accidentally, linked to the native Greek clergy in Rus'; see G.

It is difficult to gauge how far this toler- ance, documented in the written sources, was observed in everyday prac- tice; where there are reports of the killing of sorcerers,36 the deaths were ordered by princes, not by the threatened bishops (or priests). But it is highly improbable that a systematic persecution or extermination, such as sometimes occurred centuries later with the Old Believers (razkoVniki), took place. On the other hand, the church was apparently without any posi- tive ideas as to how to " Christianize" pagan customs. The opposite has not been proved by Soviet historiography (or anthropology), which has often offered as evidence of a merely superficial Christianization the replacement of pagan gods and religious sites by Christian saints and churches (for instance, the substitution of the animal god Volos/ Veles by the peasants' patron saint Vlassii, or of the Perun sanctuary in Kiev by the Elijah church).37 Unquestionably, dvoeverie was more a matter of everyday domestic practices than of religious offices. II. PRINCIPAL ASPECTS OF THE THEOLOGICAL LITERATURE These findings concerning Christianity in Kievan Rus' - however encourag- ing or discouraging they may be - lead to my second set of questions: What were the principal aspects of Kievan theology? Were the central themes of the Christian gospel recognized as such, and was their reception encouraged? Or did things get bogged down in more or less randomly chosen peripheral themes? The organizers of a scholarly colloquium in Germany marking the millennium recently asked me to speak on the "sys- tematics" of Kievan theology: but there is no such thing, as I have argued at the outset here. That is why answering this set of questions is difficult: they allow each observer to judge for himself to what extent the recogniz- able key concepts determined not only orthodox ideas but also everyday orthodox practice. It seems to me, however, that the following two points are indisputable: first, there is no need to further subdivide the Kievan epoch according to the categories of the history of theology (e.g., familiar- 36 Povësf vremennykh let, pp. 147f. (on 1024), pp. 174-81 (on 1071). 37 See Podskalsky, Christentum, p. 16, fn. 69; p. 17, fn. 74; also St. Georgoudi, "Sant' Elia in Grecia," Studi e materiali di storia delle religioni 39 (1968): 293-319.</page><page sequence="10">THEOLOGY IN KIEV AN RUS 279 ity with the world versus distance from the world);38 second, many features are typical of Kievan theology, but none are exclusive to it. A. Eschatology The first "red thread" that I discern is the basic attitude toward eschatology that permeates many of the texts. Here I am referring not so much to the countless, almost standardized warnings about the Last Judgment that were to help monks and the laity free themselves from sin and vice,39 or interpret pagan attacks as harbingers of that judgment. Rather, I am looking at the larger eschatological framework. The Tale of Bygone Years, consciously organized as a chronicle of the world, already tended to calculate the end of history because it took over from the Byzantine chronicles the figure of A.M. 7000 as the age of the world. A few years after the final editing of the Nestor Chronicle, Deacon Kirik of Novgorod (A.D. 1136) provided an explicit justification for this figure by combining the week of Creation (or the period of time in Paradise) with the length of a completed day (Ps. 89: 4; 2 Pet. 3: 8). In his Uchenie (imzhe vedati cheloveku chisla vsekh let), he did not neglect to mention that in setting the current year at A.M. 6644 (i.e., the date of the world's age then, with the birth of Christ being in 5500), exactly 356 years remained until the end of the world.40 This method of calculating the world's age found its way into homiletics through the work of Avraamii of Smolensk, who, influenced by the Zhitie of Basileios Neos (Vasilii Novyi; Basil the Younger), turned his attention primarily to the subject of the Last Judgment.41 In his writings the coming of eternity is not simply a fact or a warning, but it is depicted vividly in all its awesome terror (mytar'stva), with the aim of making Christians change their lives. Also significant is Nestor's statement in the Chtenie about Boris and Glëb, that as long as the "Rus' land" was in the thrall of pagan idolatry, the parable of the workers in the vineyard (Matt. 20: 1-16), where it is said that the last shall be summoned at the eleventh hour, was applicable to it.42 In patristic 38 Cf.

Within the limited selection of patristic texts that were available in Slavic translations during the Kievan period, the frequency of references to Ephraim the Syrian is also striking,44 for it was precisely eschatology that was one of Ephraim' s privileged themes. Apart from this chronological framework, which also belongs to the his- tory of theology, an idealistic world of the imagination was kept alive beyond the Kievan period by eschatological expectations.45 First was the reverence shown to Jerusalem, noticeable as early as in the Izbornik 1076 g. and in Igumen DanhTs Khozhdenie, but also in the Lives of Feodosii Pecherskii and Avraamii of Smolensk; this arose from the tension between the earthly copy and the - still missing - original heavenly image (see Apoc. 21, for example). For the peoples in the Byzantine "Com- monwealth" there was also both the "new Jerusalem" of Constantinople - Antonii, later Archbishop of Novgorod, outlined in his guide for pilgrims, a vision of the eschatological Peaceable Kingdom (which he linked to a miracle of light in the Hagia Sophia) where even Jews would come to be baptized46 - and the "new Jerusalem" of Kiev.47 In the beauty of their respective cathedrals dedicated to St. Sophia, both cities symbolized the glory to come, but they also threatened to obscure it. More- over, in the widely read apocryphal and pseudoepigraphical literature (otrechennyia knigi), especially in the Pseudo-Methodius of Patara,48 already incorporated into the Nestor Chronicle, the Last Judgment in Jerusalem was portrayed in detail. Closely allied with this was the idea of the thousand-year binding and subsequent rule of the Antichrist (Apoc. 20: 2-7), taken not so much from the Revelation of St. John, which had 43 See R.

His first monk's sermon was subtitled "On the Future Judgment and On Torment."50 The combined parables of the wicked workers in the vineyard (Matt. 21:33-41) and of the halt and the blind were followed by a description of the judgment that would befall the two central figures (intended to symbolize the fusion and the separation of body and soul): on the day of resurrection they would come before the face of God together with their interceding angel. In his prayers of the hours, Kirill again expressed the familiar idea about the "toll-gates" {mytar7 stva) that the soul must pass through after death, as well as the idea of intercession by angels and saints (Mary, John the Baptist, Nicholas) and of the joys of the heavenly Jerusalem (in the company of the Rus' saints Antonii, Feodosii, Varlaam Khutynskii, Efrosiniia of Pölatsk).51 The aim of this reforming monk was always to make all Christians change their ways. In the Kievan Paterik, too, there is no dearth of eschatological thinking. One instance is the story of Pimin the Sufferer (slovo 35), who, applying the example of three deceased monks, illustrates for his comrades how different the significance of the "Grand or Angelic Scheme" can be for each individual. God gives this monastic vestment to the first, posthumously, for his long suffering and his good works; it is taken from the second monk after his death because he did not wish to receive it until the hour of his death and therefore could not show evidence of any good works; finally, it serves as evidence against the third monk at the Last Judg- ment, due to his sloth and sinfulness. Even this cursory survey shows us that the theology of Kievan Rus', with regard above all to personal eschatology, yet also to its cosmological dimension and concern with the eschatology of empire, repeatedly reflected on and proclaimed the connection between this world and the next, between 49 For the Slavic translation, see G.

B. Imitatio Christi A second topic, one that takes us perhaps even closer to the center of the Christian gospel, surfaces as early as the eleventh century: the imitation of the suffering of Christ, who bears the Cross and who is the meaning of life for the layman or the monk called to sanctity. Of course, in Byzantium52 this chosen path to perfection was not always followed under the same rubric, yet it was probably at the focal point of spiritual concerns there, exactly the way it was in the West. Was there among the Rus' any religious evidence of a particular devo- tion to the Cross that prepared the way spiritually for the imitatio! It is remarkable that in the canonical questions and answers of Kirik the only day memorializing Christ that is referred to repeatedly is the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross (September 14/27).53 Depicted there are these ele- ments: the liturgical rite of the raising of the Cross toward each of the four points of the compass; the marvellous ascent of the relic of the Cross after its discovery; abstention from fish and meat; and kissing the cross as a sign of special devotion (and of daily devotion). Some of these prescriptions are traced back to Metropolitan Klim Smoliatich. One practice that did not meet with approval from the church, because of its formulaic nature and the risk of perjury, was the kissing of the cross,54 which was often done, according to the testimony of the Old Rus' chronicles, to confirm the con- clusion of an agreement. Furthermore, in the prologue (short-vita), St. Ol'ga is called a ' 'second Helen" because she is said to have brought back from Constantinople the cross that now stands in the right chancel of the Cathedral of St. Sophia in Kiev.55 The Nestor Chronicle, and even more the polemical literature, denounces the lack of respect, even the contempt, for the Cross shown by the Latin church. Probably supported (whether con- sciously or not) by a prescription in the Codex Justinianus (I, 8) or in the Cañones (can. 73) of the Council in Trullo (691) against chiseling a cross in 52 A bibliography of works on this ascetic ideal in Byzantium is found in Podskalsky, Christentum, '&gt;. 155, fn. 678. 53 Goetz, Kirchenrechtliche. . .Denkmäler, pp. 234f.

The Rus' knew a liturgical and a private devotion to the Cross that, owing to its unique and central place in church and everyday life, was perhaps even more strongly articulated than in Byzantium. Abuses born of thoughtlessness or devised by minds still given to magic and fetishism certainly may have occurred, but there is no documentary evidence for this apart from what has already been mentioned. What do the actual theological writings say about this form of piety? Once again, the most profound statements are to be found in Kirill of Turov, who was often mistaken as a mere word-juggler, whereas in reality he was a preeminent theologian. In his third monk's sermon, one particu- larly rich in symbolism,58 Kirill summarizes his introduction to the imitano with the following piece of advice: the monk should bear shame and suffer- ing while being mindful of the Passion of his Lord; he should accept his shorn head as a crown of thorns; he should fix his willfulness onto the Cross - not have faith in himself, but rather expect that Christ will be his savior from Hades. Kirill goes on to make a far-reaching connection between the garments of the priests of Aaron (Ex. 28f., especially 29: 1 -9), the priesthood of Christ, and the monk's habit. So the belt of the Mosaic priesthood signifies Christ's being sentenced to death by crucifixion, to which he was led bound in order that Adam might be "deified"; that is also why the bearer of the Grand or Angelic Design should wear the belt on feast days, as Aaron and Christ did. One piece of clothing after another is interpreted with reference to scenes from the Passion of Christ, or the "ßioc áyye^iKÓç."59 Even Kirill's hours for each day of the week contain the request, in the prayer for Friday, that he be permitted to partake in the spiri- tual fruits of Christ's Way of the Cross at each of its stations. The great 56 See P. Bernadakes (B.

As examples of the imitano Christi in the pain of martyrdom, the Kievan Chronicle depicts the death of the two princes, Igor' Ol'govich (d. 1147) and Andrei Bogoliubskii (d. 1174).61 Like Christ, Igor' tells his murderers that they are about to kill him as they would a thief (Matt. 26: 55), and that they know not what they do (Luke 23: 34). Along with the reference to the nakedness of birth and death (the tearing off of the monk's habit; cf. Job 1:21) there are even overtones of the classical theme of monastic mysticism in the imitano. Before he dies, Igor' can still repeat Christ's last words: "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit" (Luke 34:46). In the description of Prince Andrei's murder, the comparison of the ringleader with Judas, the betrayer of Christ, is noteworthy. Even before he dies, in his prayers the prince recalls the bloody atonement of his Lord for the redemption of sinners; like a "lamb without blemish" (Exod. 12:5), he commends his soul to God. The similarity to Christ's Passion is clearly intentional, at least on the part of the chroniclers. As early as in the report of the martyrdom of the two saints, prince-martyrs, and sufferers (strasto- terptsy), Boris and Glëb, we find the image of the "slaughter of the (defenseless) sacrificial lamb" central to the interpretive scheme; their par- ticipation in Christ's Passion is further characterized by an anticipation of forgiving their murderers, following the example of the Redeemer.62 The liturgical office (Sluzhba) of the Feast of the Translation that is dedicated to Boris and Glëb intensifies the comparison with Christ's Passion by adding that the two brothers not only realized a radical imitatio Christi (Matt. 10: 21), but that they also let themselves be killed by their own brother.63 Briefer allusions to the topos of the imitatio can also be found in the Old Rus' lives of the confessors. The life of Feodosii was determined by poverty, humility, and labor in the imitatio Christi even before he entered 60 On editions and bibliography, see Podskalsky, Christentum, pp. 241, 243, 245. 61 PSRL, 2 (St. Petersburg, 1908; 2nd ed.: Moscow, 1962): 345-54, 580-95; see Podskal- sky, Christentum, pp. 224, 228. 62 On editions and bibliography, see Podskalsky, Christentum, p. 110 (Skazanie), p. 114 (Chtenie); also see Freydank, "Die altrussische Hagiographie," p. 81. This particular motif is already mentioned in the account of the Primary Chronicle: Podskalsky, Christentum, p. 212 (with fn. 943). 63 Podskalsky, Christentum, p. 233 (on the edition, p. 235).</page><page sequence="16">THEOLOGY IN KIEV AN RUS 285 the cloister.64 Avraamii of Smolensk, when he began his life as a monk, oriented his thinking toward the holy sites in Palestine and living in har- mony with the life of Christ;65 a canon refers to his literal imitano of the Way of the Cross dressed in the guise of both shepherd and lamb.66 Aside from the already mentioned Zhitie by Feodosii there are only two other occurrences of this motif in the Kievan Paterik: one is in the motto for the spiritual striving of the monk-father Antonii (slovo 2), and the other is the quasi-parodistic description of the Way of the Cross that the imprisoned monk Evstratii (slovo 16) has to suffer at the hands of a Jew. Apart from these instances we find the monk Iakov recommending, in his ascetic monitory letter, Christ's Passion as the best model for patience in bearing suffering.67 An anonymous slovo from the end of the thirteenth cen- tury to a newly ordained priest calls him and his fellow priests purely and simply " imitators of the Lord," but the reference is to the theological heart of their calling.68 What is the meaning of all these illustrations, interpretations, admoni- tions, and references with regard to the imitano Christi? Can they be characterized as being "non multa (tantum), sed multum?" If we keep in mind that not a single text belonging to Kievan literature can be categorized by a single theme, or by a single genre - and that therefore we cannot expect to find a theological treatise that might either exclude all other motifs or systematize a single one - then the many and in part very impressive loci add up to a substantial center of interest. Since they are for the most part clothed in narrative garb, they will perhaps be fully revealed only after repeated spiritual readings. One could certainly point to still other major aspects, for example, the theology of images. By this I mean not only the glorification of certain icons - many theologians believed the sole permanent contribution of Kievan Rus' to be in fine arts69 - but also the conviction expressed in a passage from the Kievan Chronicle, where meditating on beautiful decora- tions (i.e., icon paintings) in the Rus' churches is declared to be the decisive 64 Podskalsky, Christentum, pp. 123f.

Even Hagia Sophia on the Bosporus held a great icon of SS. Boris and Glëb around 1200.71 The icons of Nicholas the Miracle- worker were widely dis- tributed and loved; in the Kievan Paterik (slovo 34), two deceitful monks are found guilty by means of icons that were "painted not by human hands (eÍKcov à%eipo7toír|TOç)." These few clues indicate how much material of this kind could be gathered. The examples given here show that the church of Kievan Rus', which itself had no serious doctrinal conflicts, on the one hand addressed its par- ticular problems (such as dvoeverie) bravely and thoughtfully, yet, on the other hand, could proceed as it did only because of a simultaneous turning to the central truths of Christianity. The fact that these truths are often hid- den away in writings that are narrative rather than didactic is what makes Kievan theology so attractive, but this circumstance also makes it fragile and subtle.
