Bruce Horsfall and Charles R. Knight. The Macmillan Co., New York. $7.50. 8~ x 5~; xiv + 768; 1937. It was just a little more than 60 years ago that the author of this volume together with the late Henry F. Osborn and Francis Speir, Jr. planned and carried out their first palaeontological expedition into the Bad Lands of southwestern Wyoming. They entered an almost virgin field but one abundantly rich in material. In both the western part of North America and in southernmost South America there had been preserved marvelous series of records of the successive assemblages of animals that once dwelt in these regions. The present book (first appearing in 1913 but now entirely rewritten, except for the chapter on the skeleton and teeth) brings together all of the important links in the ancient history of mammals as told by fossilized forms and so far deciphered by the painstaking efforts of various investi- gators, of whom Professor Scott is one of the foremost leaders. The book, which will long be a classic, should be in all biological libraries for it will be invaluable to teachers as well as students in this field. It will also be of great interest to the general reader. Fos- silized animals were never given common names, therefore Professor Scott has used throughout the technical nomenclature, but this can hardly be considered a hin- drance to the enjoyment of the book since the numerous remarkably fine illustrations (420 line drawings and photographic plates-those that are new being the con-</page><page sequence="2">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 343 tributions of R.

K. Lewis and Co., London. is. 88 X 52; 29; I937 (paper). An interesting discussion of two theses: (I) that evil is a relative term, and is caused by strong individualism, and (z) that suffering is a result of our ethical evolution not being able to keep pace with cosmic evolution. The conclusion is that evil and suffering in the world will become extinct only when we have a common universal race, a common religion, and a common system of education. The text is developed in a logical manner, and presents much evidence in support of the basic ideas. However, there have been very few books written which can boast, as this one can, that more than 75 per cent of its paragraphs contain only one sen- tence. ENTSTEHUNG DER MENSCHENRASSEN. By Hans Weinert. Ferdinand Enke Verlag, Stuttgart. RM. I7. (paper); RM. i8.8o (cloth). (Outside of Germany, 75 per cent less). io x 62; viii + 3I3; I938. This little book concerning the origin of human races contains little that is actually new on the subject, but it is an excellent summary of all that is known about pre- historic man from the standpoint of physical anthropology. Five chapters are devoted to Neanderthal and pre-Neander- thal races, one chapter each to Diluvian man, Mesolithic man, Neolithic man, and present day races, with special emphasis on present day European white races.

In this book, based on a series of Muir- head Lectures at the University of Bir- mingham, Professor Haldane gives a popular exposition of our present knowl- edge of human genetics and of the bearing on such measures as compulsory steriliza- tion and anti-Semitic legislation. When an abnormal condition is due to a domi- nant gene that manifests itself in IoO per cent of cases and early in life, sterilization would cut off all hereditary cases of the defect, leaving only those cases due to mutation. Where the condition is reces- sive sterilization would not produce a noticeable effect in less than thirty or forty generations, whereas the prohibition of cousin marriages would reduce the inci- dence of the abnormality appreciably. Although it is often stated that the children of two mental defectives are all defective, it was found that in Birmingham of thirteen children both of whose parents were defective "only one was pronounced defective in I933 and another one may possibly be registered by now." Of 345 children at least one of whose parents was defective only 7.5 per cent were defec- tive, I8.5 per cent were backward, 7I per cent were normal and 3 per cent were above the average. Professor Haldane concluded "'that the sterilization of all mental defectives would probably cut down the supply of mental defectives in the next generation by something of the order of io per cent." If such a reduction is thought sufficient to warrant measures to prevent mental defectives from having children, he favors segregation in institu- tions as more humane than sterilization. PHYSIOLOGICAL GENETICS. By Richard Goldschmidt. McGraow-Hill Book Co., New York. $4..9 x 61; ix + 375; I938. With the ever growing interest in the field of genetics, and with the increasing amount of experimental work and the development of new methods in the study of heredity has come the need for someone to synthesize the fundamental findings of the different workers into a comprehen- sive volume. Just such a synthesis Gold- schmidt has attempted in this volume. He not only has had long experience in experimental genetics, but he has the rare</page><page sequence="3">344 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY ability to combine his own work with the work of others into a very interesting and readable book. The author is entirely justified in stating in his preface that "Not only has this material been as- sembled and reviewed, but an attempt has been made to organize it into the skeleton of a future science of physiological genet- ics." The text is quite technical through- out, but it is assumed that the reader has enough background in genetics and embry- ology to understand the fundamental principles concerned even if he does not understand all the technicalities. The 44 page bibliography, the author index, and the subject index add to the usefulness of the volume. All geneticists will not agree with some of the theoretical posi- tions taken. FAKTORENKOPPELUNG UND FAKTORENAUS- TAUSCH BEI NORMALEM UND ABERRANTEM CHROMOSOMENBESTAND. Probleme der theo- retischen und angewandten Genetik und deren Grenzgebiete. By Wilhelm Ludwig. Georg Thieme Ver- lag, Leipzig. RM. i i. 84 X 53; Z45; I938 (paper). The problem of crossing-over and exchange of parts between two or more chromo- somes is one of the most important and complicated chapters in modern genetics. The author gives a very concise insight into these problems-the genetic theory as well as the cytological fundamentals. The presentation is hardly suitable for beginners in biology and genetics, but the well-grounded student will profit from this special review which covers almost all of the newer investigations. As mathematical symbols play an important role in genetic thinking these can not necessarily be avoided in some of the dis- cussions. There is an exhaustive list of the literature up to I937, and indices of authors and subjects. SPONTANE UND STRAHLENINDUZIERTE MUTABILITiT. By H. Stubbe. Georg Thieme Verlag, Leipzig. RM. 6.8o. (Outside of Ger- many, except Palestine, Z5 per cent less). 818 X 54; I90; I937 (paper). This little book is intended as a review and summary of the most recent work done in the field of mutations. After an intro- duction to the mutation theory, the author discusses at some length different types of spontaneous mutations, their effects, their manner of origin, dependence on tempera- ture, etc. By far the greater portion of the book however is devoted to X-ray mutations. There is a lengthy discussion of H. J. Muller's contributions on the methods, results, and generalizations that can be drawn from X-ray genetics, the production of chromosome and gene mutations from short wave rays in ani- mals and plants, and practical results particularly for the field of botany. There is a zo page bibliography and an index. FORTSCHRITTE DER ERBPATHOLOGIE, RAS- SENHYGIENE UND IHRER GRENZGEBIETE. I. Jahrg., Heft i and 2. Edited by Johannes Schottky and Frhr. von Verschuer. Georg Thieme Verlag, Leipzig. Subscription price RM. i6. plus postage. IO X 64; I34; I937 (paper). This new journal is concerned mainly with pathological genetics connected with race hygiene. A few of the articles in the first two numbers of Volume I have the follow- ing titles: Inheritance of intelligence and character, by K. Gottschaldt; Selection, by H. Wiilker; Inventory of inheritance, by H. Schade; Discoveries in the inherit- ance of schizophrenia and cyclothymia, by H. Luxenburger; Epilepsy, by H. Geyer; and Inheritance of dental malfor- mations, by F. Proell. The journal has so far managed to accept articles of real scientific value and free from any political propaganda. This is unusual for a publication from Germany dealing with race hygiene and it is to be hoped the editors will continue to select articles of such calibre. GENERAL BIOLOGY THE AXIOMATIC METHOD IN BIOLOGY. By J. H. Woodger. With Appendices by Alfred Tarski and W. F. Floyd. Uni- versity Press, Cambridge; The Macmillan</page><page sequence="4">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS Co., New York. $3.75. 82 X 5; x + I74; I937. In I930 and I93I, J. H. Woodger pub- lished in Q. R. B. (Vol. 5 and 6) a note- worthy essay in three parts entitled The "Concept of Organism" and the Relation between Embryology and Genetics in which modern symbolic logic was applied to biology. This excellent paper has now been followed by a book in which the first steps towards treating genetics, em- bryology, and taxonomy from an axio- matic point of view have been taken. The result is a work of signal importance in so far as it not only inaugurates a new sub- division of biology but also applies to biology a philosophical instrument which raises the philosophy of biology, and indirectly the philosophy of science, to a new position of eminence. Woodger has taken a long stride forward towards inculcating methods of exactness and rigor into biology, and representing the philos- ophy of science as the discipline of exact definitions, explicitly stated assumptions, and the rigorous deduction of logically related theorems. Thus as a biological work, The Axiomatic Method in Biology stands as the inceptor of a new biological science, while as a philosophical work it deserves a place of prominence as a guide and example to future endeavors in philosophical research among scientific topics. The first two chapters contain a brief summary of those logical concepts and methods which are essential to an under- standing of their subsequent application to biology. Though these are admirably presented, they are insufficient in them- selves to prepare a reader, unfamiliar with symbolic logic, for the chief topic of this book. It should be recommendled to such a reader that he first acquaint himself with Carnap's Abriss der Logistik, the influence of which is clearly displayed throughout Woodger's work. THE HUMAN VALUE OF BIOLOGY. By Johan Hjort. Harvard University Press, Cambridge. $z.50. 72 X 58; Xii + 4 I; I93 8. This absorbing little volume is a revision of a series of lectures given by the author before his students at the University of Oslo, and presents in a dramatic fashion a summary of his philosophy of life. Hjort's study of marine populations has led him to believe that much knowledge can be gained from a study of populations of lower forms which can, either directly or indirectly, be applied to human popula- tions in our effort to bring about a better social order. Historical evidence is presented to show that the different philosophies have con- tributed to the development of biology, but it makes the point that present day biology, to be of the highest human value, must be interpreted by biologists, and not by philosophers of pure reason, mathe- matics, or physics. Hjort summarizes his views in the idea that an ideal goal for any science, in fact, for any unit of society, is to aid in . . . "liberating those who suffer from want of intellectual activity in their work, the greatest of all social diseases." There is a bibliography. LABORATORY MANUAL FOR GENERAL BIOLOGY. By Leslie A.

Harper sand Brothers, New York. $I.75. 82 X 7; xvi + Z73; I937. The first of these manuals (dealing with both plant and animal forms) is so ar- ranged that by the removal of the cover it can be slipped into a loose-leaf note- book. A group of 2-7 plates showing line drawings, largely adapted from well- known texts, is provided for the student to label after his work with laboratory specimens is completed. The second man- ual emphasizes the morphology of animal forms. It fits in particularly well with Hegner's College Zoology (fourth edi- tion), and offers adequate material for a full year's work. The last manual is more detailed than the other two.

NEW INTRODUCTION TO BIOLOGY. (Re- vised). By Alfred C. Kinsey. J. B. Lippincott Co., Chicago. $I.76. 7 X 5; Xv + 845; I938. The present edition of this fine high school text follows very closely the content and organization of the earlier edition (Q. R. B., Vol. 9, No. I). The body of excellent illustrative material, which has had minor omissions, alterations, and addi- tions, is now in such form as to give the content of the text more unity and em- phasis with regard to the relationship of structure and function, and to the relation- ship of organisms to their environment and to each other. The volume contains, as did the earlier edition, a list of select references, a fine glossary, and a complete index. SOURCE BooK OF BIOLOGICAL TERMS. By Axel L. Melander. Department of Biology, The College of the City of New York, New York. $i.io. 8 X 58; vi + I57; I937- The layman will find this book informa- tive, though esoteric; the classical scholar will find that brother scientist has steeped his nomenclature in mythological lore; the biologist will polish up his technical vocabulary along with his Greek and Latin; and the science student will be able to acquire standardized pronuncia- tions and meanings with a technical vocabulary. Part I is a discourse on such problems as word sources, homologies, phylogeny, origins, emergence, deriva- tions both mistaken and uncertain, and mispronunciations. Part II is an alpha- betical list of the components of the biological vocabulary. A scholarly book. BIOLOGY. The Story of Living Things. By George W. Hunter, Herbert E. Walter and George W. Hunter, III. American Book Co., New York. $3.75. 841 x 5 x + 670; I937. The writers of this excellent elementary text have hit upon something new and appealing in their method of presentation. Every chapter has zest and vitality, and even the usually boring sections on classi- fication have been handled with such precision and finesse that they captivate one's attention and consideration. The text is beautifully illustrated throughout, either diagrammatically or photographi- cally, and each chapter is concluded with a brief bibliography on the subject pre- sented. LADY JULIA PERCY ISLAND, I93 5 EXPEDI- TION. Reports of the McCoy Society for Field Investigation and Research. No. i. Proceedings of the Royal Society of Victoria, Vol. 49: 329-437, I937. Lady Julia Percy Island, lying off the south coast of Australia and appearing to represent a small and self-contained sample of the Australian environment, was selected as the site of the first season's investigations of the McCoy Society. The island proved to be unique, however, rather than typical when it was found to be purely volcanic instead of a portion of the old continental mass cut off from the mainland. This first report of the So- ciety puts on record all findings made during the summer of I935-I936 on the state of the balance of nature on this island, and includes lists of the plant and animal forms found.

Cokesbury Press, Nashville, Tenn. $z.oo. 778 X 52; z9; I938. The author of this verbose bilge is of the opinion that "science seems to have gone as far as it can with experimentation," and suggests that biology should now look for its further progress in such directions as telepathy and clairvoyance, the philo- sophical implications of Lamarckism, and the "soul in medicine." HUMAN BIOLOGY GEORGES DREYER. A Memoir by His Wife. By Margrete Dreyer. With an Introduction by Sir Charles Sherrington. Basil Black- well, Oxford. iOs. 6d. net. 8 x 52 ix + 249 + 4 plates; I937. This book is a worthy memorial of a distinguished immunologist and physiolo- gist. Georges Dreyer was a Dane by parentage and was educated at the Uni- versity of Copenhagen, where he studied bacteriology and pathology under Salo- monsen, and collaborated with Madsen in studies on diphtheria toxin and with Finsen on the biological effects of light. In I908, at the age of thirty-four, he was elected to the Chair of Pathology at Oxford. During the war he developed an automatic apparatus for supplying the proper concentration of oxygen to flyers at high altitudes and supervised its manu- facture for the British and American air forces. This work on the physiology of respiration led him to the study of "Vital Capacity" -the maximum amount of air one is able to expel from his lungs-and its relation to physical fitness. Much of Dreyer's research was given to the development of more exact quantita- tive methods in biology and especially in immunology. Thus in his Copenhagen days he developed a standard technique of the Widal reaction with a sensitivity of 99.I per cent and a specificity of 98.8 per cent. At Oxford he collaborated in research on a diagnostic test for syphilis that was one of the forerunners of the Kahn test. In his Harvey Lecture at Harvard he again championed the cause of biological standards. Now, the first question that comes to the mind is: What advantage do we derive from the use of definite standard units? and the answer is readily given: that science-workers of every country and every race in this way are enabled to understand each other for the simple reason that they speak the same language. This has already been achieved in the field of electricity by the universal acceptance of the well- known standard units, the ampere, the volt, the watt, the ohm, etc., while the civilized world is still divided on such important questions as the system of weight, measure and coinage. If the goal of a really close co-operation between medical research workers could be reached, the bio- logical sciences would be put on an equal footing with those hitherto accepted as the "exact." The difficulty of fixing biological standards is only too often believed to be insurmountable because of the idea so widely taught and accepted that any great degree of accuracy in biological science is be- yond our reach. That this difficulty, however, is more imaginary than real should not be doubted when one remembers that some of the fine tests in the "exact" science depend on biological functions, namely, those of sight and hearing.... Of course individuality and independence is admit- tedly the proper spirit in science and any measure that might tend to interfere with that freedom of thought and action is justly condemned. And as acceptance and use of biological standards often impose the adoption of a definite technique one easily understands the hesitation. Yet, the use of valid standard units can never really interfere with individual freedom. Hardly anyone, even the greatest of champions for individuality, could maintain that the universal acceptance of units like the ampere, the volt and the ohm has in any possible way interfered with the individuality and originality of modern investigators. On the contrary, research carried out without the use of these standard units would be lost to the scientific world at large because of the lack of infor- mation concerning the values involved.... As will be seen, Dreyer accomplished important work in several fields of medical research. Yet the book deals not only with the scientist but with the man, his friendships, his zest for life.

DATA ON THE GROWTH OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CHILDREN (From the Materials of the Har- vard Growth Study). Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, Volume 111, Number i. Serial No. I4. By Walter F. Dearborn, John W. M. Roth- ney and Frank K. Shuttleworth. Society for Research in Child Development, Na- tional Research Council, Washington. $i.oo. 98 x 68; I36; I938 (paper). The first mnonograph is a review of those factual studies which, in the opinion of the author, "enable some generalization about adolescent sexuality." Under the headings of Implicit Sexuality, Autosexu- ality, Para- and homosexuality, and Hetero- sexuality the author presents data from numerous investigations regarding the onset of various types of sexual experi- ences, very seldom, however, giving any indication as to how the original studies were carried out and what reliability can be attached to the figures so copiously cited. There is a bibliography but no index. The second monograph is concerned primarily with the statistical techniques applicable in an analysis of longitudinal data. Endocrine factors (time of first menstruation) and their relation to growth patterns were also studied. Altogether 3650 girls from Massachusetts schools were followed, with annual measurements as long as they remained in school. The measurements, in addition to information on the onset of first menstruation, in- cluded eleven physical dimensions, dental examinations, intelligence tests, school progress, etc. It was found that "interre- lations of assumed endocrine stimulation, advent of menarche, and the timing of patterns of growth are very high." A large number of graphs and tables have been added to the text. The third monograph presents in detail the repeated growth records acquired over a period of iS years, on I553 individ- uals, these cases being selected for com- pleteness of data from the records of the Harvard Growth Study. The first third of the text is made up of explanatory notes on the tables that follow. BIo-POLITICS. An Essay in the Physiology, Pathology and Politics of the Social and Somatic Organism. By Morley Roberts. J. M. Dent and Sons, London. I5s. net. 9- x Q; xv + Z40; I938. This remarkable book deserves much more extensive and thorough discussion than limitations of space permit here. Under these circumstances we conceive it to be our first duty to recommend strongly and unreservedly to our readers that they get the book and both read and study it. It is a penetrating and realistic contribu- tion of first rate importance to sociological theory. Morley Roberts is known to most people only as a novelist. Actually he has been for the greater part of a long life a serious and profound student of biology, and an occasional writer in that field. In this book he develops to something like logical completeness the idea of human society as organism that Herbert Spencer dropped when he perceived that its implications were going to run painfully contrary to some of his most cherished prejudices. A strong case is made for the view that nations display the characteristics of loosely-knit low-grade organisms strug- gling to survive. It is further made clear that there is no evidence that intellect has played any significant part in the</page><page sequence="8">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 349 growth, disorder, or decay of society- in social evolution, in short. Govern- ment is more soundly to be apprehended as a set of physiological responses to the internal and external environment in accordance with physical law than as an historically elaborated and intellectually sophisticated instrument. The book is written with the clarity and charm expected from its author's high literary craftsmanship. It is adequately indexed and carries a soundly selected bibliography. Again we emphasize that it deserves the widest reading, and will repay the reader. VOLKER AM ABGRUND. Zweite vermehrte Auflage. By Friedrich Burgddrfer. J. F. Lehmanns Verlag, Munich and Berlin. 3 marks; (outside of Germany) z.z5 marks. 98X 68; 76; I937 (paper). Burgdorfer adds another book to his already numerous publications on the dangers of the declining birth-rate for Western civilization. It is not over- population, he points out, but underpopu- lation that now menaces the highly civilized countries of Europe and European stock. The earth could feed 8-io billions of human beings (instead of around z billions as the present population of the earth) and the United States is easily in a position to support 5oo to 6oo millions of men. But in almost all nations of West- ern civilization the birth-rate is rapidly decreasing. This is demonstrated by a series of tables and figures on population movement in recent years. The German government alone, since I933, has checked this danger. After an almost uninter- rupted decrease in births, the number of live births is increasing again, amounting in I933 to 97I,000, in I934 to I,I98,000, in I935 to I,z64,000 and in I936 to I,Z79,000. That means a birth-rate increasing from I4.7 per i,ooo in I933 to I9.0 in I936. However, that is no greater than the birth-rate was in i9z8. At the turn of the century it was almost double in Germany, the absolute number being over z millions of live births a year. Burgd6rfer explains the single methods of the government's economic and social policies in relief of marriages (Ehestandsdarlehen), but he fur- thermore wants to show that by far the more important was the will of reproduc- tion among all groups of the population. So he demonstrates that not only the num- ber of first-born (of the young marriages) have increased but also the second, third, and fourth-born (of the older couples). This publication, of course, has more the character of propaganda (edited as No. I in a series on political biology) than of scientific fundamentals. It is illustrated by tables and is indexed. POPULATION PRESSURE AND ECONOMIC LIFE IN JAPAN. By Ryoichi Ishii. University of Chicago Press, Chicago. $3.00. 8 X 55x ; xix + 259; I937. Although this detailed study of the Japa- nese demographic and economic situation was completed before the outbreak of the present Sino-Japanese hostilities, it will probably be read in the light of that conflict. After remaining nearly station- ary during the eighteenth and early nine- teenth centuries the population of Japan has nearly doubled since i872. As only about I5 per cent of the area of Japan is arable this rapid increase in population has resulted in a density of 27 persons per acre of tilled land as compared with zi in the Netherlands. Although the trend of the birth rate has been downward since about i92.0 this is counterbalanced by a corresponding de- cline in the death rate. Although the former hostile attitude of the Japanese government towards birth control is changing, it is doubtful how soon this factor is likely to have an appreciable effect on population growth. According to various estimates the Japanese will have to feed from ii,ooo,ooo to 2O,OO,OOO additional mouths within the next genera- tion. How can they do this? It is estimated that 5,ooo,ooo acres can be added to the agricultural land of Japan. This, together with the proposed increase of acreage in the Japanese colonies and the probable increase in production per acre, will make Japan self-sufficient with</page><page sequence="9">THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY regard to her food supply. However, the cost of food production is relatively high. The best hope of taking care of the in- crease of Japanese population without reducing the standar of living seems to be a further industrialization of the nation. But an industrial nation poor in natural resources requires access to sources of raw materials as well as a market for its manufactures. The motives for the pres- ent conflict in China are therefore evident, but whether the Japanese adventure will solve her difficulties or add to them is not so plain. AFRICA's GOD. VII. EAST AFRICA. An- thropological Series of the Boston College Graduate School, Volume 11, Number 4. By Joseph J. Williams, S.J. Boston College Press, Chestnut Hill, Mass. $i.oo. 94X 62; 54; I937 (paper). An interest in the Negro race, especially in the Jamaican Negroes and their beliefs, has led Dr. Williams to study the parent- stock in Africa. Sincd accurate observa- tions of the African tribes by one individ- ual is an impossible task, a questionnaire was broadcast "among those who were actually toiling along the required lines throughout the length and breadth of the Dark Continent." The answers, which are still being sent in by persons best fitted to understand each tribe (that is, by missionaries and government officials who have lived many years among the Negroes) are available at the Dinand Library, at Holy Cross College, Worcester, Mass. The present monograph includes the answers of reliable workers concerning the tribes of Kenya and Tanganyika Territory in East Africa. The conclusions reached are that the tribes of the regions studied are monotheistic in their religious beliefs. The Wafipa of Tanganyika show positive signs of religious decadence, but, "vestiges of monotheism are found among the ancient beliefs of this tribe"; the monotheistic tendency, in general, "looks to a strong Hebraic infiltration that made itself felt all along the territory covered by the present paper." There is also a brief historical discussion on the Hebrew exodus from Egypt and the Jewish influence on Africa thereafter, as a result of Jewish immigration and coloniza- tion. Dr. Williams's paper is followed by an argument in favor of "Revelation and Primitive Sacrifices" by William J. Mc- Garry, S.J., President of Boston College. CHINA AT WORK. An Illustrated Record of the Primitive Industries of China's Masses, Whose Life is Toil, and Thus an Account of Chinese Civilization. By Rudolf P. Hommel. Puhlished for the Bucks County Historical Society of Doyles- town, Pa. by the John Day Co., New York. $5.00. Io X 8x8; x + 366; I937. This book is the result of an expedition to Central China financed and irected by Henry Chapman Mercer, that versatile historian and antiquarian of Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Its object was to investigate, photograph and describe the implements and methods of labor used in the rural districts, in order to throw fur- ther light upon the daily life, character and civilization of the Chinese people in the area studied. No generalizations as to tools or customs are possible in speaking of China. The photographs and measurements of the implements, which fully illustrate the text, were difficult to take because of the prevalence of superstition and the extreme reluctance of the farmers to let their possessions be photographed. It is hard to realize that these heavy, crude, ancient looking tools are the present-day working equipment of millions of Chinese. There have been few changes in thousands of years. In every photograph and every detailed description of the laborious methods employed there is amazing evi- dence of the tremendous-almost super- human-work involved, and the prodigal expenditure of this physical energy. There could be no more graphic way of depicting the traits of infinite patience and long- suffering of the Chinese people than in a study of this kind. The contents of the book are divided into classifications of tools required for the various phases of life. There is a complete index of six pages.</page><page sequence="10">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS WE AMERICANS. A Study of Cleavage in an American City. By Elin L. Anderson.

Miss Anderson has chosen Burlington, Vermont, for her sociological study of the complex ethnic relationships behind the outward comformities of dress and appear- ance as seen on active, bustling streets. Burlington is a conservative city with a population of nearly z) ,ooo, in which number are such diverse racial groups as the English, English-Canadians, French- Canadians, Irish, Jews, Italians, Germans, Greeks, and Syrians. This city faces, as do other communities of America, the complex and as yet unsolved problem of ethnic cleavage. Ethnic distinctions are of prime im- portance in Burlington, and playing no small part in this segregation is the atti- tude of the fourth generation Americans, and those who claim even longer ancestral lineage in this country, to the first, second, and even third generation Americans. Each of Burlington's racial groups clings to its own tradition; each has the ethno- centric outlook of the primitive savage, and each is suspicious of the other racial groups. The incorporation of the many racial groups into a unified community of common aims still lies in the future. The story of Burlington indicates how far from realization is "the high dream of creating an American people of all the elements that have been borne into the country on successive waves of immigration." This study, which has received the third John Anisfield award, profits by its author's sympathetic insight and honest revelation of the racial, religious, social, and economic elements that keep Ameri- cans divided into separate ethnic groups. HARLOW BROOKS Man and Doctor. Second Edition. By John J. Moorheaid. Harper and Bros., New York and London. $3.50. 82 X 53; vii + 302. + 9 plates; I937. From I895 until his death, in the forty years in which Harlow Brooks practised his profession in New York City, he not only achieved an important position in the art and science of medicine, but because of genuinely human qualities acquired a host of friends and admirers. The fact that his biography has gone to two edi- tions is a tribute to Brooks's personality and medical reputation as well as to the author's literary skill. Brooks went directly to New York City after having received his doctor's degree at Michigan and almost immediately he became associated with the Bellevue Hos- pital Medical College. The author intro- duces this period of Brooks's life with interesting and often amusing accounts regarding Bellevue Hospital and the lead- ing physicians of the day. From the very beginning, Brooks's uncommon abilities were apparent and he early received due recognition as a pathologist and diagnosti- cian. The high points of his remarkable career including his war services which were almost balked at the start by bureau- cratic red-tape are described in a style which is discursive yet not lacking in elegance. The reader is impressed by Brooks's modesity and continuous devotion to the high principles of the art of healing but most of all by the strong affection which he inspired in the author as well as in many others. SHORT YEARS. The Life and Letters of John Bruce MacCallum, M.D. 1876-1906. By Archibald Malloch. Normandie House, Chicago. $3.50. 94 x 64; xiii + 343; I938. John Bruce MacCallum died two months before reaching his thirtieth birthday. But in that short life he achieved a reputa- tion as an invetigator that has sometimes been compared with Frank Balfour's in respect of brilliancy and promise. Out- wardly his short life was a simple and uneventful one-boyhood and undergradu- ate days in Canada, Johns Hopkins Medi- cal School, a bad summer in Germany, and finally the University of California with Jacques Loeb-but over and through it all the never-ceasing battle against tubercu- losis. Dr. Malloch has done a superb job in the labor of love that made this book. Mac-</page><page sequence="11">352. THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY Callum's own letters tell the story, but the editing, arranging, and running coin- ment have been managed with consummate artistry by Malloch. This is a book that every medical student -indeed every student of any branch of science-should read. It will reveal the inherent dignity and beauty of scientific research, and set a spiritual model for living that cannot fail of meaning and helpfulness in a disordered world. SEASON OF BIRTH. Its Relation to Human Abilities. By Ellsworth Huntington. John Wiley and Sons, New York. $3.50. 8y x 52; vii + 473; I938. Huntington has studied the seasonal fluc- tuations in the number of births in this and other countries and concludes that: (i) the kind of weather present at about the time of conception influences the mental and physical condition of the embryo and consequently affects the whole life of the individual; (z) the human race inherits a mechanism sensitive to weather changes; (3) the seasonal oscillations in births are due to the survival of individuals whose seasonal reproductive rhythm coincides with the optimum time for the offspring to be born and live; (4) children conceived and born during the optimum season are more vigorous, stronger, etc., than those born at other periods. It is difficult to judge whether any or all of these conclu- sions are actually supported by the facts. The author presents his data in graphic form only and consequently it is prac- tically impossible to determine whether the relations observed by him are real or simply apparent. Moreover, there are numerous factors which could be casually responsible for the seasonal fluctuations of births and that the author passes over lightly or fails entirely to take into account. Finally the comparability of the data used is open to question and Huntington's interpretation of differences between countries is often very dubious. Better analytic technique and method is needed before the conclusions advanced by the author can be given serious con- sideration. RACE. A Study in Modern Superstition. By Jacques BarZun. Ilarcourt, Brace and Co., New York. $z.5o. 8 x 58; X + 353; I937. In essence, this work is an exposition of the controversies which in France have taken place over the question of race and racial superiority. The author wishes to show that this question brought to the front in Germany today is not an original product of Nazism but that at different periods, in France as well as other coun- tries, it has been the subject of grave and animated discussion by philosophers, writers and scientists. In demonstrating that this belief in "pure" race, racial superiority, etc. is simply a superstition the author tells us nothing new, but in assuming that the disquisitions of the intellectuals are of great weight either in fostering or maintaining this belief he overlooks the most important elements in this phenomenon-the emotional reaction which it arouses in the population group. Moreover, in attempting to show that the question of race has really no scientific meaning the author proceeds to a whole- sale indictment and ridicule of the findings of physical anthropology and of the vital and health statistics with regard to "racial" differences. This is a smart journalistic device but leaves doubts as to the author's seriousness of purpose or profundity of knowledge. There is an extensive if not complete bibliography on the subject. TOTEMICA. A Supplement to Totemism and Exogamy. By Sir James G. Frazer. The Macmillan C,New York and London. $6.5o. 81x Co.) e okadLno.$.o 82x 52; Xii + 5I8; I938. As the sub-title indicates, Frazer here has compiled some of the principal observa- tions concerning totemism made since the publication in I9IO of his monumental treatise. Approximately half of the book is dedicated to a review of the data on Australia. The importance given the observations on the native Australian is due essentially to the fact that more information has been collected about these peoples than about any other and because</page><page sequence="12">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS from the varied forms in which totemism is manifest among them it is hoped to find a clue to its origin. Besides totemism in Australia, the author reports on the obser- vations made in Melanesia, New Guinea, India, Africa and North America. It is to be noted that in this book more emphasis is placed on the facts than on possible interpretations or generalizations. This is a happy reversal of the method adopted by some of the more enthusiastic of Frazer's disciples. Since the author fails to summarize the observations reported here or comment on their bearing to his earlier conclusions, we hope that in the near future this omission will be remedied by a mature summation and evaluation of the significance of this complex social phenomenon. NOT So LONG AGO. A Chronicle of Medi- cine and Doctors in Colonial Philadelphia. By Cecil K. Drinker. Oxford University Press,NewYork. $3.50. 82x558;xii+ I83 + IS plates; I937. Professor Drinker here presents extracts and notes from the diary which his great- great-grandmother, Elizabeth Drinker of Philadelphia, kept from I758 to I807. The items which he has selected deal in particular with the methods of hygiene and medical practice in vogue in that period. Elizabeth Drinker, it is apparent, was a shrewd and intelligent observer of the life around her. Moreover she took an active interest in medical questions especially when related to the health of her family and was able to avail herself of the best professional care which that period could give. From her diary the reader acquires a vivid picture of the bathing and toilet facilities in the homes of that time and the care and treatment for childbirth, tuberculosis, smallpox, and yellow fever. In addition, there are given interesting pen-portraits of such eminent physicians as Rush, Shippen, Bard, Kuhn and Physick. As noted in the title, the conditions described were present not so long ago, a matter of only I40 years. But this was an interval of progress in public health and sanitation so great that it takes a vivid account like this to give us a true realization of its import. DR. NASH'S COOKERY BOOK. By Elwin H. T. Nash. Simpkin, Marshall, London. 6d. net. 8x X 183; I937 (paper). This cook book, issued by an English doctor (whose hobby has long been cook- ing) furnishes to the family of small income an excellent series of recipes which, if followed with care, will produce palatable dishes with an adequate protein ration at a very low cost. An intelligent and enthusiastic group of workers put in a year's research in experimenting and testing. "Some of these dishes were altered as many as ten times until the right flavour or consistency was obtained. Throughout the researches the rice aid for beef averaged 6d. per pound, an for mutton, 3d. per poun ." Always it was kept in mind "that the smaller wage earner, speaking generally, likes his flav- ours more pronounced than other people." If any criticism is to be made, it is that so little space (3 pages only) is devoted to the cooking of vegetables-yet this is not altogether a just criticism for vegetables are used repeatedly in the meat dishes. Being a cookery book, it does not touch upon the many ways in which raw vege- tables and fruits can be used. If this reviewer lived in England he would certainly obtain a copy of this book and study it carefully. The chutney recipes are already being tested in our American kitchen. NOTES ON A DRUM. Travel Sketches in Guatemala. By Joseph H. Jackson. The Macmillan Co.,New York. $3.oo. 8x2;x+ 276; I937. Because the author's room in Guatemala contained no table but a tall Mayan drum, upon this he wrote his notes on the sur- rounding country and its people. Hence the title of the book. Mr. Jackson, having, like all good tourists, carefully</page><page sequence="13">354 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY read up on the country and its history, had fairly definite plans as to what he wanted to see. These he submitted to the Clark Tours people who skillfully and economically arranged his travels in Guatemala. This volume, however, is more than a helpful guide for future travelers to this interesting country, for it is written in an amusing, informal style and is worth reading for entertainment alone. Sixty full page photographs taken by the author enrich the book, giving the reader a more complete idea of the country and its inhabitants. Here and there some of the past history of the country is brought in, making it more interesting for the modern explorer. Unfortunately he has not included a bibliography and there is neither an index or a table of contents. AFRICAN GENESIS. By Leo Frobenius and Douglas C. Fox. Stackpole Sons, New York. $3.00. 9 x 6; 3 6 + 6 plates; I937. Because Frobenius' rock picture research led him to believe there might be a trans- fusion of cultures and faiths between African and Egyptian civilizations, he undertook to investigate the mythology back of these paintings. This body of folklore, the substance of this volume, makes delightful, entertaining and re- freshing reading. The legends, collected from a number of African tribes are writ- ten in clear straightforward language which is almost poetical in its simplicity of style and idea. The book is illustrated with drawings from rock paintings taken from the different parts of Africa explored by the Frobenius expedition. These have nothing to do with the actual body of the text. However, Fox, in his foreword in which he theorizes about the meaning and origin of these legends, attempts to ex- plain the paintings by the legends. In addition there are a number of extremely well done pencil portraits of the African natives and an occasional map showing the areas in which the rock pictures were collected. THE AMERICAN INDIAN. An Introduction to the Anthropology of the New World. Third Edition. By Clark Wissler. Oxford University Press, New York and London. $3.75. 82 x 58; xvii + 466 + 9 plates + i folding map; I938. Dr. Wissler's book can be considered the Bible of New World anthropologists. Starting off with the distribution of the aborigines and their social patterns as determined by the food areas of the conti- nent, he proceeds into the cultural traits of the various tribes. Instead of pene- trating any one field thoroughly, the author lightly covers all the phases of culture in a concise manner, but giving sufficient information to enable the reader to gain a conception of the extent to which the Amerinds had progressed. The origin of the American Indian is also discussed. There is appended a classification of the linguistic stocks of the United States and Canada and a bibliography of 32. pages. The tyro or the well-versed scholar will find information, both interesting and new, whether it concerns the Abipones or the Zuni, in this revised edition. A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF THE WORKS OF AM- BROISE PARE: Premier Chirurgien and Con- seiller du Roy. By Jarnet Doe. University of Chicago Press, Chicago. $s.oo. I04 x 74; xx + z66 + 22 plates; I937. For the past century Malgaigne's bibliog- raphy has served as the authority on the writings of the sixteenth century surgeon, Pare. However, it covers only the edi- tions extant in Paris in I840, together with those listed by a previous bibliogra- pher, Haller, and contains several mistaken entries copied from previous writers. Miss Doe has now compiled all the avail- able information concerning the editions of Pare's works, including six editions previously unknown to bibliographers, corrected the errors of Malgaigne's list, and furthermore added interesting little digressions into the surgeon's life and personality, his patrons, publishers,</page><page sequence="14">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 355 friends and enemies. Thus this book is more than a cut and dried notation of items. Extracts from the books are cited and numerous facsimile pages serve as illustrations. THE LAND OF THE GURKHAS or the Hima- layan Kingdom of Nepal. By W. Brook Northey. With a chapter by the Hon. C. G. Bruce. W. Heffer and Sons, Cambridge. ios. 6d. net. 81 x 61; x + Z48 + 66 plates + i folding map; I937. Since there is relatively little information available regarding the kingdom of Nepal and its people, this account written by an officer with to years experience in a Gurkha regiment is one that will interest the human biologist and whet his curiosity about this land practically closed to the ordinary traveller. In this volume will be found a comprehensive although neces- sarily condensed description of the geography of Nepal, of the customs and arts observed in its principal centers and of the history of the Gurkha. The author is apparently not interested either in the ethnology or anthropology of the country and consequently the reader who hopes to obtain a picture of the conditions of life and civilization of Nepal will be disappointed. However, even with these defects, the book will be found interesting and worth delving into for what it gives on the subject. THE FUTURE OF CIVILISATION AND SOCIAL SCIENCE. A Study Involving the Principles of Scientific Meliorism. By W. P. Dreaper. E. T. Heron and Co., London. Is. 74 X 54; 48; I937 (paper). Scientific Meliorism, a humanitarian form of socialism, was proposed by Jane Hume Clapperton in I885 as a means of attaining the ideals of goodness which she believed to be the goal of man's evolution. The theory, as advocated by her, was essen- tially a general application of the methods so dear to the heart of the Victorian, "to repress in the young certain instincts which are natural and therefore unblam- able." In restating and reviving Jane Clapperton's ideas, Mr. Dreaper is appar- ently unaware that nowadays those in- terested in the study of society are not receptive to vague theories which are as far from reality as the characters of an Elsie Dinsmore book. It might be added that the 'scientific' in Scientific Meliorism has about the same value as the 'science' in Christian Science. A HISTORY OF WOMEN IN MEDICINE From the Earliest Times to the Beginning of the Nineteenth Century. By Kate Campbell Iurd-Mead. The Had- dam Press, Haddam, Conn. $6.oo. 9 x 6; xvi + 569 + 6o plates; I938. This is the first of two volumes which together will adequately reveal for the first time the place of women in the history of medicine. This volume carries the story from the earliest times (begin- ning in Egypt, Assyria, and Palestine), comes down through Greece and Rome to mediaeval Europe, and then includes the various countries of the world up to the beginning of the nineteenth century. The second volume, to be published in the near future, will carry the story up to date. An admirable work is presented here both as to the subject, neglected until now, and as to the diligence in personal research throughout all the different sources in most of the great libraries in Europe. It is indeed a lifetime study that began forty years ago. Every page is interest- ingly and fascinatingly written and nu- merous quotations from the original sources are included. Naturally it will be of great interest to the historian of medicine. The index covers more than fifty pages. MEDICAL CLASSICS. Volume 1, Numbers 2 to Io. Compiled by Emerson Crosby Kelly.

These numbers complete Vol. i of this</page><page sequence="15">356 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY series of publications. Similar to the first number (cf. Q. R. B., Vol. IS , P. 2.40), each of these presents a brief biographical sketch of the author whose work is extracted or reprinted, bibliographic data, and a note regarding the influence and significance of the work given. Each of the numbers contains reprints of one or more articles or selections from the writings of one of the following authors: Charles Bell, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Percivall Pott, Theobald Smith, Dominic J. Corrigap, Thomas Hodgkin, Nathan Smith, Douglas Argyll Robertson and Guido Banti. As the reader will note, the names of the majority of these authors are associated with disease entities re- garding the clinical description of which precious little has been added in recent years. It seems almost superfluous to say that a careful reading of these papers will interest and benefit not only the physician flut also the biologist. FIFTH AVENUE TO FARM. A Biological Approach to the Problem of the Survival of Our Civilization. By Frank Fritts and Ralph W. Gwinn. Harper and Bros., New York and London. $3.oo. 8! x 5 viii + .82; I938. Belief that American civilization is be- coming genetically inferior, due to migra- tion of the superior individuals from farms to cities, is the theme of this book. These individuals then fail to reproduce them- selves, while the inferior persons left on the farms are the reproducers of the population. The proposal is made that country life could be very attractive to the biologically more desirable elements, and that a back to the farm movement should be stimulated. Granted that the country is, or could be, an attractive place for anyone to live, nevertheless the authors are treading on thin ice in assuming superiority or inferiority and its transmis- sion in such extensive groups as urban and rural populations. THE MARGINAL MAN. A Sttudy of Person- ality and Culture Conf ict. By Everett V. Stonequist. Charles Scrib- ner's Sons, New York. $I.6o. 74 X 5x ; xviii + 2.t)8; I937. By marginal man is here meant the in- dividual who either through heritage or migration is brought into close contact with two different and often antagonistic types of civilizations and cannot partici- pate completely in either. Thus the author examines the problems of the descendants of some of the race (color) marriage mixtures of India, South Africa, United States, Java, Hawaii and Brazil. He discusses also the problems and meth- ods of adjustments of the European immi- grants in the United States and of their offspring, and of the so-called racial minorities in Europe. As a source of bibliographic references this book will be found useful, but otherwise it is a some- what diffuse compilation that demon- strates very little originality except in chapter and section headings.

The necessity for a new edition after only three years is a good sign of the significance and popularity of the work. In the three numbers now at hand an introduction into the fundamentals of anthropology and the history of research on man since antiquity is given in con- nection with numerous neighboring points from biology, geography, history, and the arts. The racial standpoint of modern Germany and the Nordic idealogy of Gobineau and Chamberlain receive rela- tively brief treatment in comparison with the broad quotations from other literature. Each number is extensively documented.</page><page sequence="16">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 357 FAMILY LIVING IN KNOTT COUNTY, Ky. U. S. Department of Agriculture. Technical Bulletin No. 576. By Faith M.

This study is part of a comprehensive survey of economic and social conditions in the southern Appalachians, and at- tempts to show the effect of farming upon material conditions of family life. It was found that the level of living of the z28 families studied was, on the whole, lower than that of many groups of farm families in other areas. the authors conclude that the problems of the people of this section call for economic action on a greater scale than the individual family can undertake. There is a bibliography and an appendix containing a classifica- tion of the goods and services entering into the value of current family living.

For a brief bird's-eye view of the status of agriculture in the United States today, this bulletin has been excellently prepared. The increase or decrease in number and size of the different types of farms, together with the value of products are shown graphically by map diagrams. The data are taken largely from the census reports of I930 and I935. ZOOLOGY THE BIRDS OF AMERICA. By John James Audubon. With an Intro- duction and Descriptive Text by William Vogt. The Macmillan Co., New York. $iz.5o. iz71 X 9; xxvi + 5oo plates; I937. The reputation of this classical work renders any extensive detailed comment unnecessary. The current edition com- memorates the centennial anniversary of the original publication, and contains sixty-five additional illustrations of birds from the Pacific slope, which Audubon painted at a later date. The original edition of The Birds of America was pub- lished in London in the years i827-38. Each plate was reproduced from an orig- inal water-color painting by Audubon. The process used for reproduction was aquatint engraving on copper plates, with hand coloring of the impressions. The plates were printed on Whatman paper of double elephant folio size 392 x 26' inches before trimming. There were 435 of these plates. The set was priced at ? i84 /I4 in England, and $iooo in the United States. In I840-44 an octavo edition (lithographed and hand-colored) in seven volumes was published in New York and Philadelphia. The present work is the first edition of these famous plates ever to be issued in a single volume. And it is a superb piece of book-making. The plates are repro- duced by lithography and on the whole extraordinarily well. At the price the book is a real bargain. The brief texts accompanying each plate, while necessarily very condensed have been extremely well done by Wil- liam Vogt. Ranges, habitats, and con- spicuous diagnostic characters are indi- cated. Altogether we congratulate the pub- lishers on the fine service they have done biology in producing this book. THE CALL OF THE KOALA. By Ambrose Pratt.

When we take cognizance of the fact that in the early twenties of the present cen- tury as many as i,5oo,oop Koala pelts were exported from Australia to Britain alone per annum, and that today the entire</page><page sequence="18">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 359 race of Koalas numbers less than i,OOO, we realize and appreciate how nearly this "'native bear" came to the fate of our own American passenger pigeon-extinction. It is for the purpose of conservation, and appreciation of what this popular little animal has to offer to the world of science as well as to the entire nature-loving world, that these two little books have been written. The fourteen years of study which have led the author of the first volume into every phase of the Koala's life have made him well qualified to write on the subject. Pratt's work has included detailed studies of the anatomy, physiology, classification, origin, and food of Australia's "native bear." Particularly has he been interested in determining the cause and discovering a method of preventing the high death rate atnong bears both in captivity and in the free state. The work has presented almost unsurmountable difficulties in that (i) it is pioneer in nature, and (X) it deals with an organism that is almost entirely incapable of adapting itself to conditions outside the narrow realm in which it has lived practically unchanged for the past million years. This little volume is truly a scientific treatise, written in a popular style, and with a note of sym- pathy that appeals to every nature lover. The second volume deals with the early history of the Koala, its classification, habits and value, together with the effect of colonization of its native Austra- lia on its natural population. Both books include a number of excel- lent photographs of the Koala in some of its most characteristic poses. The former includes several photos of the different species of Eucalyptus, the leaves of which make up the entire diet of this strange little marsupial. SILVER Fox PELT PRICES AS AFFECTED BY TIME OF PELTING, SEX, AND AGE. U. S. Department of Agriculture, Circular No. 460. By Chas. E. Kellogg. Government Printing Office, Washington. io cents. 94 x 6; Z7 + X plates; I937 (paper). The industry of silver fox fur farming is of such recent origin that factual informa- tion concerning its many phases has not yet been collected to any great extent. Statistics concerning the effect of time of pelting, sex, age, degree of silver, etc., on the value of pelts have been needed for the obvious purpose of putting the industry on a more scientific and profitable basis. The Bureau of Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture has made a study of pelt values based on the industry of the Herbert A. Nieman Co., Thiensville, Wis., and has published the findings in this bulletin. The data concerning the value of the furs were collected by tabulat- ing the prices received for some IO,OOO pelts sold by the New York Auction Co. in November, December, January, and February of I935-36. In calculating the mean value for furs of different types sold each week during the period, it is assume that the quality of the pelt alone deter- mines the price received, and no men- tion is made of the possible effect of supply and demand on the variability of price.

Two selected areas of the North Sea were used as collecting grounds for the 34,I24 herring whose stomach contents were examined in this study. The principal organisms present in the food of the her- ring and their prevalence and sequence during stated intervals of time were noted, the percentage composition of the food calculated and the total volume of the food ascertained. Comparisons were made</page><page sequence="19">360 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY of annual variations in the quantity and type of food consumed and cotnparative estitnates made to show the relative quantity of food taken out of the water each season. Twelve reference works are listed in the bibliography. Old and new data have been brought together in Marine Fauna of the Isle of Man in the preparation of a classified list of the marine animals found on the shores of this island between tide marks, and in the surrounding sea to a distance of about five miles. An up-to-date record of the dis- tribution of these forms is included. Three charts show the location of the various collecting grounds, all of which are briefly described in the text with the exception of the Dub Reef of Port Erin Bay for which a detailed account of the fauna is given. The book includes an index and both reference and record bibliographies. GIANT FISHES, WHALES AND DOLPHINS. By J. R. Norman and F. C. Fraser. Illus- trated by Lieut. Col. W. P. C. Tenison. W. W. Norton and Co., New York. $4.00. 8x2 X 521; xxvii + 34I + 8 plates; I938. This book is the scientific reply to the many inquiring sportsmen, travelers, and seafaring men who, for sundry reasons, desire information concerning whales, dolphins, and larger kinds of fish. To merit a place in this work Neptunian members must possess a physical combina- tion of true backbone and six feet of length. The only ones to qualify were the six-foot sharks, rays, bony fishes, whales, dolphins, and porpoises. The lampreys and hagfishes were omitted, and such enormously long members of the Coelenterata, Mollusca, and Arthropoda as are popularly called "fishes" were also excluded for lack of a qualifying back- bone. The book is divided into two parts. Part I deals with the Selachii and Pisces; Part II, with the Cetaceans. Conversa- tionally written in generally nontechnical language and arranged for facile, ready reference, this work is both a scientific and a picturesque presentation of its subject. History, legend, and personal anecdotes pleasantly flavor scientific de- scriptions of the breeding habits, diet, habitat, structure and appearance of the selected creatures. Simple keys for identi- fication are also included. There are 8 colored plates, 97 drawings for identifica- tion purposes, and other numerous quaint historical and legendary sketches. ATLAS OF THE SCALE INSECTS OF NORTH AMERICA. By G. F. Ferris. Stanford University Press, Stanford University; Oxford Univer- sity Press, London. $8.75 I04 X 82; 8 + [z544j; I937. The ambitious purpose of this series (of which this is only the first part) is "to make possible the definite identification of every species of scale insect now known from North America." To make this project feasible the book is in atlas form and is essentially a collection of plates of the different species with a minimum of textual material. One can grasp the magnitude of the problem from the fact that this first series covers only the Tribe Diaspidini of the Family Diaspididae; the latter is only one of the ii families in the Coccoidea. The scale insects are a confusing group, and at the same time their importance to man is so great that this monograph is doubly welcome. Eco- nomic entomologists will find this series indispensable. GREEK WOLF-LORE. A Dissre;tation in Greek Presented to the Faculty of the Graduate School of the University of Pennsylvania in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy. By iRichard P. Eckels. (Small number of copies for free distribution by the author, I N. Harrisburg St., Steelton, Pa.) 94 x 6' inches; 88, I937 (paper). A doctoral dissertation setting forth and discussing what the ancients, particularly the Greeks, knew or did not know about the wolf; beliefs and superstitions about him and something of their later history; the werewolf and 'lycanthropy' (medical); the place of the wolf in certain Greek</page><page sequence="20">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 36I cults; and the wolf as nurse, with special reference to the she-wolf who suckled Romulus and Remnus. The significant point is that, where the ancients had numerous superstitions and fallacious ideas about wolves, we moderns have only a few (e.g., that wolves run in packs and that they attack men out of hunger or even out of malice) and those few quite as erroneous and as staunchly believed in as those held as articles of faith in bygone days. Indices of the source material and of the authors cited and referred to are provided. The treatise will interest not only clas- sicists and folklorists but also historians of science and of medicine. A MONOGRAPH OF THE ACANTHODRILINE EARTHWORMS OF SOUTH AFRICA. By Grace E. Pickford. W. Heffer and Sons, Cambridge. 55s. net. 94 x 6; 6iz + z folding charts; 1937. A good many years went into the making of this comprehensive survey of the Acanthodrilinae of South Africa. Where they had already been studied (viz., scattered localities in the region of Port Elizabeth, Cape Peninsula and the Knysna Forest, and a few places in Natal and the Transvaal) they exhibited a high degree of local endemicity. It was the purpose of the present investigation to study the unknown intervening regions with a view to elucidating this problem of local endemicity in the light of past and present geographical and climatic conditions. It is hoped that the preliminary results so obtained may form the basis for some more com- plete survey by future investigators. A valuable reference work. It is abun- dantly illustrated and has an appendix of taxonomic notes on non-South African genera and species re-examined in connec- tion with the present investigation, and an alphabetical index to the South African species of Acanthodrilinae. Unfortu- nately there is no general index. A NATURE LOVER IN BRITISH COLUMBIA. By H. J. Parham. H. F. and G. Witherby, London. 8s. 6d. net. 812 x 52; 292 + 21 plates; I937. Soon after the author settled in southern British Columbia, he began to observe the wild life about him and before long knew most of the birds, mammals, and fish of the region. In a pleasantly rambling fashion he relates experiences that show keen observational powers. He is greatly vexed by the lack of protection afforded the wild life by the government and he devotes an entire chapter to the methods by which the birds might be saved through governmental aid. The author unfortu- nately digresses in the last chapter entitled "The search for truth," wherein he ex- pounds his philosophy of life. Otherwise the book is very entert'aining and enjoy- able to read. There is an index and several appendices that list the mammals, birds, fish, and plants of the Okanagan Valley with their scientific names. THE BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF AN INSECT IN Fiji. An Account of the Coco ut Leaf-mining Beetle and its Parasite Complex. By T. H. C. Taylor. Imperial Institute of Entomology, London. izs. net. 94 x 638 Z39 + Z3 plates; I937. This smoothly-written account of the successful control of the leaf-mining beetle Promecotheca reichei Baly in Fiji by biolog- ical means begins with an account of the life history of the pest and of its principal parasites. Oddly enough, one of its parasites, the mite Pediculoides ventricosus Newp., complicated the problem by "periodic elimination of all developmental stages, except one, of P. reichei itself," thus depriving the other parasites of one of their principal sources of food for a large part of the year. The practical details of selecting and rearing parasites and estimating their effect on the pest are described and the principles of biological control are concisely stated. The book is well illustrated with photographs and drawings of the insects discussed. There is no index. ZOOLOGICA.

THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY Park,NewYork. $i.8o. I02 x7; III + 3 plates; I937 (paper). In this issue of Zoologica the first paper is on the histological structure of the normal and the hyperplastic thyroid in Rasbora lateristriata (Bleeker), a small tropical fish. Serial sections (3 plates) show that the excessive growth of the thyroid destroys and replaces the gill structures. The other papers are on lymphocystis in the hogfish Lachnolaimus maximus, on the "display" of the Twelve-wired Bird of Paradise and of the Magnificent Rifle Bird, on decapod crustacea from the Lower California region, on deep-sea fishes of the Bermuda oceanographic expedition [Serrivomeridae (genus Platuronides) and Nemichthyidae], and the caudal skeleton of Bermuda shallow water fishes (order Iniomi: Synodontidae).

RM. 9.2.o (paper); RM. io.8o (cloth). 84 x 3 54; viii + I43; I938. This little book is a summary of all that is known on the subject of hormones among invertebrates. The author in de- fining his concept of hormones points out that recent work has shown that there are many stuffs in organisms that have peculiarities in common with hormones but cannot be said to be glandular prod- ucts. These stuffs are discussed under the following chapter headings: Cell hor- mones; Aglandular tissue hormones; Glandular tissue hormones; Hormones producing color changes; Glands of inter- nal secretion among molluscs and tuni- cates. BATTLES WITH MONSTERS oF THE SEA. By F. A. Mitchell-Hedges. D. Appleton- Century Co., New York. $4.00. 83 X 6x; x + 349 + 24 plates; I937. This is a lively narrative of fishing thrills off the coast of British Honduras and among the islands off the coast of the Republic of Honduras and in the Gulf of Panama. Although the author was col- lecting all the time, this is mainly a story of adventure, excitement and hair-breadth escapes. The captures include a 960 pound jewfish, a I,960 pound tiger shark, a 4,600 pound saw-fish and an eagle-ray weighing 5 ,200 pounds. For those in- terested in adventure and the endless bounties of southern waters and tropical islands, this book with its pleasant style should bring great enjoyment. Many clear photographs accompany the text and there is a complete index. , LIFE OF THE OCEAN (FISHES, ETC.). Won- ders of the Sea. Art and Nature in Colour Series. Introduction by E. G. Boulenger and A. Portmann. Plates painted from nature by Paul A. Robert. B. T. Batsford, London. 7S. 6d. net. I34 x iO8; 8 + IS plates; I938 (paper). This volume is another number in a series dealing with "Art and Nature in Colour," which has already been noticed in these columns. The compilers have gone to the bottom of the sea for their material. The beautifully colored illustrations are replete with forms of animal and vegetable life which quickly lose their color when removed from their natural environment, and with which consequently, the major- ity of people have no first hand acquaint- ance. The book is more likely to appeal to the artist than to the scientist. WORLD NATURAL HISTORY. By E. G. Boulenger. With an Introduction by H. G. Wells. Chagrles Scribner's Sons, New York; B. T.

These are stories of Miss Kelway's charm- ingly intimate experiences with her animal friends including squirrels both red and grey, shrews, moorhens, and her pet toads, Geraldine, Boadicaea, and the lively Nat- terjack. Although the stories themselves are of little scientific interest, her numer- ous photographs of these wild creatures are excellent. Her way of interpreting their feelings, their psychology and their lan- guage is nothing short of amazing. THE OXYSTOMATOUS AND ALLIED CRABS O F AMERICA. United States National Museum Bulletin i66.

AFRICAN HUNTER. By Bror von Blixen-Finecke. Translated from the Swedish by F. H. Lyon. Alfred A. Knopf, New York. $.75. 7- x 52; [8] + 284 + viii + zz plates; I938. Game laws and licenses, characteristics of the natives, and wild animal traits all interest one in this book more than the courageous deeds of the author or his associations with the elite. Changes in the characteristics and supervision of Africa during the past twenty-five years are well depicted. The volume is indexed and contains many good photographs.

This book is not available for general distribution, but may be purchased in bound form from the Superintendent of Documents in Washington, D. C. It is an excellent source for identifications and uses of range plants. The 2.94 illustra- tions, which were nearly all made es- pecially for this handbook, are more than adequate, both aesthetically and prac- tically. For purposes of identification the drawings and photographs are in minute detail and fully labeled. The 339 text accounts include nearly goo range species and vacant spaces are provided for later insertions. The field edition is in loose- leaf form and a convenient symbol se- quence is used in place of numeral pagina- tion. Also, the index may be used as a checklist of preferred names for outstand- ing range plants. Though prepared for government officials whose duties lie in the management of range lands, this handbook should also be in the botanist's library. FLORIDA WILD FLOWERS.

From the many flowering plants of Florida the author has selected 8oo herbs, shrubs, and trees for this edition (enlarged and more profusely illustrated than the earlier one) and in simple terms has indicated their individual characteristics. There is an excellent key in which the plants, with notations on their size and shape, are classified under color headings. The key also acts as an index and refers the reader to the text where, under family headings, further details are given for the identification tentatively established in the key. There is a general alphabet- ical index in addition to the key. DE L INFLUENCE DE DIVERS CATIONS SUR LE CROIT MICROBIEN.

By Lucien Neipp. Masson and Cie, Paris. go francs. IO x 621; 430 + 5 folding charts; I937 (paper). For this important work the author has studied quantitatively the influence of certain cations on the growth of bacterial colonies. After extensive study of the literature and experimentation he con- cludes that with the exception of silver, which gave an antiseptic action, all the cations utilized (lanthanum, cerium, lead, and mercury) accelerated the growth when given in small dosages but inhibited it when the doses were large. There appears to be no relation between the value of the electric charge and normal bacterial multiplication, nor can the acceleration or inhibition be attributed to a variation in the electrification of the germs. A bibliography includes 5z8 titles. THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE FUNGI. Second Edition. By H. C. I. Gwynne-Vaughan and B. Barnes. The University Press, Cambridge; The Macmillan Co., New York. $5.50. 8- x 5; xvi + 449; I938. The second edition follows almost ex- actly the sequence of the contents in the first edition (Q. R. B., vol. 3, no. m) with the exception that the section Forms Re- sembling Fungi, is placed in a more appro- priate position in the later edition. As before, the new edition deals with the morphology and physiology of fungi and with mycological technique. New ad- vances in the investigation of the fungi are included. There are also additional illustrations, though most of the older illustrations from the first edition have been retained. The bibliography is more extensive than that of the former edition. GARDENING INDOORS. The Enjoyment of Living Flowers and Plants the Year Round, and New Opportunities for Home Decora- tion. By F. F. Rockwell and Esther C. Grayson. Line Drawings by Esther C.

All of the practical and artistic phases of indoor gardening are covered in this book in a thoroughly adequate manner. With the more general use of air conditioning in homes and apartments, and the use of growing plants as integral parts of mod- ern interior decoration, the newer methods suggested by these well-known authors are timely and valuable. The photo- graphs, charts and classifications of plants for seasonal and special purposes, and a well-organized index make this book an excellent example of a handy volume. GUIDE TO EASTERN FERNS.

Archaic Fishes. Article VI. By Bertram G. Smith. American Museum of Natural History, New York. $3.50. 11. I2: X 92; 33I-520 + 7 plates; I937 (paper). The phylogenetic position of Chlamy- doselachus caused much controversy in its day, and while its exact affinities are still in doubt, there is no question that it occupies a primitive position among the vertebrates. Since it was first described by Garman in I884, there has been little information published about it. One reason for this dearth of material lies in the fact that this shark has rarely been taken outside of Japanese waters. The authors have gathered all known data, using Dr. Dean's notes and available ma- terial, and synthesized them into this book. The second volume is a detailed ana- tomical description of the frilled shark in which the author has "endeavored to distinguish those features that represent a high degree of differentiation, from others that link Cblamydoselachus with the most primitive fishes." The author concludes that the frilled shark "presents a strange assemblage of characters ranging from the very primitive to highly differ- entiated. Chlamydoselachus is a deep-sea adaptation of some rather ancient type of shark, and is now waging a losing battle in the struggle for existence." Both volumes are excellently prepared and profusely illustrated. This rare and interesting shark has now received some of the attention it so well deserves. A MONOGRAPH ON VEINS. By Kenneth J. Franklin. Charles C Thomas, Springfield, Ill. $6.oo. 9 x 6; Xxii + 4IO; I937. In this book the writer has attempted, however imperfectly, to show what is permanent in our knowledge of veins, to indicate where additions of value are even now being made to it, and where opinions about certain aspects of it are changing in the light of fresh research. The review is primarily intended for those engaging in such research, though it should also be of use to others, who wish to know more about the veins and the important parts they play in the harmonious inter- actions within the living organism. It has been "possible to formulate from a very scattered literature a reasonably consecutive and integrated story. In- deed, nothing has surprised the writer more than the way in which the individual pieces have fitted together." A work of first rank. The bibliography runs to 27 printed pages and there is an adequate index. LEITFADEN DER ENTWICKLUNGSGESCHICHTE DES MENSCHEN. By Horst Boenig. Georg Thieme Verlag, Leipzig. RM. Io.2o (paper); RM.

This textbook of human embryology has been very well illustrated both with ac- tual photographs and many diagrams. It is clearly written and includes discussions of the most recent discoveries in the field. The author starts with an account of the development of the sperm and egg, then proceeds to an account of the fertilized ovum, placentation, and finally the de- velopment of the various organs. About three-fourths of the book is concerned with organ development. THE DISSECTION AND STUDY OF THE SHEEP'S BRAIN as an Introduction to the Study of the HIIuman Brain. By James Wilkie.

PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY OCCIDENTAL THERAPEUTICS IN THE NETHERLANDS EAST INDIES DURING THREE CENTURIES OF NETHERLANDS SETTLEMENT. (I60o-i900). By D. Schoute. Netherlands Indies Pub- lic Health Service, Batavia. io58 x 72; iv + I4; I937. In this book is given, in abbreviated form, the substance of two larger volumes (printed respectively in i929 and I93 5, in Dutch) on the history of medicine and surgery and the development of sanitary measures during three centuries in the East Indian Archipelago. It is a history of the struggles ofthe United Netherlands East India Company to keep illness and death rates reduced to a minimum during the long voyages around the Cape of Good Hope and of the growth of hospital and medical service in the Dutch East Indies. We read that in i6zI "De Gouden Leenw made an unheard-of short trip" (4 mos., 4 days) from the Netherlands to Batavia. Death rates aboard ship were frequently appallingly high. The Princ- esse Royale (sailing in I647, i2 days at sea, 300 crew) lost I32 of the crew by death and "arrived, nearly all hands sick in berths." Scurvy and foul drink- ing water or no water at all were the chief worries of the early voyagers. When the drinking water became wormy it sometimes was put through a process of purification "as best as could be done by dropping glowing iron or a big heated cannon-ball into it, mostly a thirty- pounder." Sometimes on a voyage greatly prolonged by adverse winds, when scurvy was particularly bad, the ship would stop at St. Helena or the Cape. With an abundance of fresh vegetables and fruits recovery of passengers and crew seemed little short of miraculous, but more often than not, after a short time again at sea, a new crop of troubles appeared in the form of fevers which were much more to be dreaded than scurvy. The volume is well documented and contains indexes of personal names and of subjects. Of particular interest to physi- cians and public health workers will be the sections dealing with the evolution of hospital service in the Dutch East Indies, and the steps which were taken to im- prove general health conditions. The author includes many interesting mor- tality tables which he has collected from various authentic sources. THE FIGHT FOR LIFE. By Paul de Kruif. Harcourt, Brace and Co., New York. $3.00. 82 X 54; [IO] + 341; I938. This book continues the appeal for wider and more intelligent application of exist- ing medical knowledge and techniques to humanity in the mass that was begun in the author's preceding volume Why Keep Them Alive? It is written in the fine and gallant spirit of a passionate crusader. Righteous indignation bursts forth on nearly every page at society's too calm and placid acceptance of some of the more glaring imperfections of a world that indubitably falls short of complete im- peccancy in a number of respects. The principal targets this time include ma- ternal mortality, gonorrhea, syphilis, tuberculosis, and poliomyelitis. Whether one prefers the warmly emo- tional or the coldly intellectual technique for diffusing ideas and information is a matter of taste, in respect of which indi- vidual human beings differ. But regard- less of tastes there surely can be but few persons, if any, who will not find this book fascinatingly interesting. Its deep sincerity is evident, and its scientific re- porting is meticulously accurate in detail.</page><page sequence="27">368 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY THE PATIENT AND THE WEATHER. Vol- ume IV, Part 3. Organic Disease. Surgical Problems. By William F. Petersen with the assistance of Margaret E. Milliken. Edwards Bros., Ann Arbor, Mich. $io.oo. IO4 X 8x; xxxvii + 65 i; I93 8. In this volume the author deals with some acute abdominal and surgical diseases in connection with meteorological influences after having discussed in former volumes this influence on general physiology, pathology and some groups of special diseases, as, for instance, psychosis (cf. Q. R. B., Vol. io, No. 3, I935). The surgical diseases of the abdomen like ulcer of the stomach, gall bladder diseases, acute pancreatitis, appendicitis, etc. are considered from the point of view that they represent acute vascular and smooth muscle dysfunction, so that a uniform mechanism underlies them. The author presents for every sort of disease a good many detailed medical histories with meteorographs to illustrate the different clinical events. This casuistic material is of the greatest interest in many direc- tions, but it should be completed by an adequate statistical technique to prove that there is really a coincidence or at least a correlation between the supposed abnormal fluctuations in vasoconstriction and dilatations and some components of the weather, like barometric pressure, humidity or sun spot emanations, etc. The weather, as the atmospheric environ- ment, plays evidently an important role in the course of many diseases, but up to the present its influence has not been made as clear as that of such other en- vironmental factors as parasites, diet and social conditions. Perhaps this exhaus- tive work will show the way for a more exact study. THE SPAN OF LIFE. By William M. Malisoff. J. B. Lippin- cott Co., Philadelphia. $z.50. 8 x 58 339; '937. This treatise professes a profound faith in science, and yet never loses an opportunity of misrepresenting the results of careful, thorough, and honest scientific work. The author starts by discussing length of life and its underlying phenomena, passes to theories of aging, and finally gets on to the prolongation of life. The style throughout is cheap and tawdry wise- cracking journalese. Optimism about the future in spite of the present sad state of affairs is professed, and a foundation is proposed to synthesize all that the many branches of science have to offer. Pos- sibilities are even suggested for its finan- cial maintenance. But where are the ones to start Malisoff's new Cooperative Re- search Foundation for the attainment of astounding age going to come from when all of "the grey little men of science, proud of their techniques and miniature certainties-have moved into a cosy apart- ment of science and there they will stay, away from the chaos of the pioneering front?" Perhaps the idea is that unsci- entific pioneers will do the job. Doubtless a poorer book than this could be written on longevity. WHY GROW OLD? A Guide-Book for the Man Who Seeks to Remain Physically and Mentally Young. By Frank S. Caprio and Owsley Grant. Alfaxwell Droke, Indianapolis. $z. 50. 84 x 51; [i8] + 1L04; I937. The past several years have seen a mul- tiplicity of books of the general type that conveys vast encouragement that "life begins at forty" in a real sense, and that if a man takes care of his heart, his stom- ach, his waistline, his gonads, and his prostate, he can enjoy life a long way past his allotted three score and ten years. The present volume falls exactly into the above mentioned general type, and reveals nothing original with regard to either material or presentation. As a matter of fact a man of the meanest intelligence will find little here that he does not al- ready know, either as a result of trial and error, of reading magazine advertisements, or of exercising a little common sense. Each chapter of the book is summarized in the form of either a question list, or a do and don't list with regard to such topics as diet, exercise, sleep, sex, and mental traits.

The second article, occupying about half the pages of this Lieferung treats methods of measuring electric cur- rent and voltage. In the third, Behrens describes a new method for separating cells and tissues which involves initial freezing of the organs. Winterstein treats the successful utilization of Tswett's chromatographic adsorption method for fractionating and purifying colorless or- ganic substances. This method, first per- fected by Tswett in I906 for coloring mat- ter of plants, was not universally known as the work was published in Russian, but received further impetus at its redis- covery by Kuhn in I93I. PAVLOV AND His SCHOOL. The Theory of Conditioned Rieflexes. By Y. P. Frolov. Oxford University Press, New York. $4.00. 81 x 51; xix + 2-9i + 26 plates; I937. The method and reasoning by which Pavlov and his school attacked the bio- logical problem of nervous activity through the aid of conditioned reflexes form the basis of this book. The context is made clear enough to be intelligible to the average biologist. Although there is little bibliographical material, the reader can obtain some insight of the char- acter of the great Russian physiologist from the way he conducted his laboratory and by the great reverence he inspired in his co-workers. The translation has been excellently rendered by C. P. Dutt. There are several illustrations and an index. MEDICAL RECORDS IN THE HOSPITAL. By Malcolm T. MacEachern.

Troisieme Edition entierement refondue et avgmentee. By R(. J?ivoire. Masson et Cie, Paris. 45 francs. 94 x 62; z64; I937 (paper). The appearance of a third edition of this work is testimony to its interest and success. The present edition has been entirely rewritten to include the newest findings, and two chapters, one on the thyroid and the other on the thymus and epiphysis have been added. For those not yet acquainted with this book it may be mentioned that it brings together the most important and definitive findings of physiological, biochemical, and clinical research on the endocrines. Unfortu- nately the work lacks a bibliography or documentation other than the mention of names. THE HAIR AND SCALP. A Clinical Study (With a Chapter on Hirsuties). Second Edition. By Agnes Savill. William Wood and Co., Baltimore. $4.75. 8- x 52; viii + 309; I937. Following a summary of the structure and physiology of the hair, the principal diseases of the hair and scalp are arranged on a symptomatic basis. Yhe probable etiology, clinical appearance, an alterna- tive courses of treatment are described. The book is intended primarily for prac- ticing physicians and medical students, but many cautions are directed at hair- dressers. Lay people who are willing to wrestle with medical terminology can obtain sound advice on the relation of general bodily health to hair growth. The illustrations are adequate and there is an excellent index. MACLEOD'S PHYSIOLOGY IN MODERN MEDI- CINE. Eighth Edition. Edited by Philip Bard, with the collabora- tion of Henry C.

Due to the many developments in the physiological sciences the distinguished group of physiologists who take part in the revision of this important text have practically rewritten the subject matter. Professor Bard states in the preface that "the present volume makes no pretense of being a text-book of 'applied' physiol- ogy." Clinical material, however, has been called upon when it illustrates particularly well fundamental physiolog- ical principles. The volume is a well- rounded, authoritative treatise-a worthy successor to the earlier editions. It is abundantly illustrated, extensively docu- mented and has a useful index. TEXTBOOK oF EXPERIMENTAL SURGERY. By J. MarkowitZ. William Wood and Co., Baltimore. $7.00. 9 x 6; xv + 527; I937. Experimental surgery, according to Dr. Markowitz, plays too small a part in the training of surgical students. It is by this means that one obtains practice in the fundamental but very essential techniques for later use in the human operating room. The importance of a mastery of physiology by the surgeon is especially stressed. Accompanied by numerous clear illustrations, the text material describes in detail the operative methods for use on various tissues and organ systems of experimental animals, particularly dogs. A fine book for the medical student or clinician. THE RABBIT TEST for the Detection of Chorionic Tissue in the Body and the Deter- mination of Its Proliferative Activity. By S. B. Anklesaria. With a Foreword by Emil Novak. Popular Book Depot, Bom- bay H. K. Lewis and Co., London. izs. 94 X 64; xvi + i6i + 8 plates + z graphs; I937. After giving a brief review of female sex hormology (human) and the technic of the original Aschheim Zondek test, the author discusses in considerable detail reproduc- tion and ovulation in the rabbit, advan- tages of the rabbit test over other biolog- ical tests, technic, possible fallacies, clinical significance of the biological pregnancy tests, etc. The volume contains a number of illustrations, a lengthy bibliography and author and subject indexes.

By J. R. Partington. The Macmillan Co., New York. $z.50. 7A x 51; xiii + 386; I937. A noted scholar in the history of chem- istry presents here a valuable account of the progress of his science from earliest times through theories of radioactivity and atomic structure to approximately I935. The material in this little book is well presented but stated so concisely that its appeal will be limited to students and teachers of elementary courses in the history of chemistry rather than to either laymen or specialists. Relative to its size, it is astonishingly replete with in- formation, although of necessity it treats but lightly of the chemical fields lying within the penumbra of the science, such as physical, biological, industrial chem- istry, and neglects details throughout except for the briefest of references. When a contribution is merely mentioned by a phrase in passing or in a listing at the end of a chapter, it would be highly desirable for the author to state a reference to which the reader can turn if his interest impels him in that direction. Only through such assistance can still another brief account of the history of chemistry justify its publication in a field in which</page><page sequence="32">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 373 there are already a fairly large number of short works. Although Partington's book includes more references than do most of its com- petitors, and can be favorably compared in several respects to such rivals as Hil- ditch's Concise History of Chemistry or Moore's History of Chemistry, it nevertheless will probably be considered simply an- other elementary text. What is needed today is not a repetition of what is already on the market, but rather a comprehensive treatise, similar to von Meyer's great standard work which is no longer procur- able, detailing the progress of chemistry in its various branches to the present day. KATALYSE UND DETERMINISMUS. Ein Beitrag zur Philosophie der Chemie. By Alwin Mittasch. Julius Springer, Berlin. RM. 9.60. 81 X 5 iX + 203; I938 (paper). The author deplores the fact that for some time chemistry has not been favored with the same attention as physics or biology among philosophers. Here he attempts to remedy this matter, and his specialty, catalysis, is especially suited to the purpose. "Above all," he writes, "one should no longer speak of Natural Causa- tion (or determinism) without taking consideration of the definite role which catalysis plays in it," and further, that this determinism is no one-sided mechanis- tic one but that "a broader frame is necessary, in which freedom as well as force can exist." Among the subjects treated are: catalytic causality as a form of stimulus causality, chemical reactions of catalysts, the relation of catalytic causality to other types of causality, the place of catalysts in the order of causali- ties, and what is included in the concept of determinism. Obviously it is impos- sible to adequately discuss these points in a short review. The book is well documented, contains a bibliography and is well worth reading by the philosophi- cally-minded scientist. PRECIS DE CHIMIE ORGANIQUE. By Victor Grignard. Published under the direction of Roger Grignard and Jean Colonge. Preface by G. Urbain. Masson et Cie, Paris. 150 francs (paper); I75 francs (bound). 93 x 61; xiv + 774; I937. This excellent textbook, essentially the work of the senior author, who is con- sidered one of the greatest present-day French chemists, has been posthumously published and carefully edited by his son and his collaborator. Although the whole subject of organic chemistry is here treated as a practical rather than an abstract science, the theories of physical chemistry are presented at some length. The meth- ods of degradation are systematized as far as possible and presented for the first time in a French text intended for ele- mentary classes. This work is indexed for subjects and authors. The Pre'cis may also serve as an introduction to the more comprehensive fifteen volume Traite' de Chimie Organique, five volumes of which have already been published.

The purpose (of this work is, in the words of its authors, "to supply authoritative data on the nutritional values of foods in a form for quick and easy reference.'" The foods are arranged alphabetically as are also the classes under which the foods are grouped. The system of using portions frequently served as a basis of calculation lends itself very p actically to a study of comparative foo values and an approxi- mate analysis of diets.

This text has for its object "to present sufficient discussion of the subject to give the student a background for his labora- tory work. The aim of the laboratory work is to illustrate some of the facts of biochemistry." The book is divided into three parts: (i) a discussion of the facts of biochemistry, (z) laboratory experiments which all the students may carry out during the usual course in biochemistry, and (3) special experiments for groups of two or more students.

SEX A STUDY OF THE GREEK LOVE-NAMES. Including a Discussion of Paederasty and a Prosopographia. The Johns Hopkins Uni- versity Studies in Archaeology, No. 23. By David M. Robinson and Edward J. Fluck. The Johns Hopkins Press, Balti- more. $3.00. 9? x 6; vi + 2o4; I937. The aspect of Greek mores that later ages have found hardest to understand is their attitude towards paederasty. It is true that with a greater understanding of the causal mechanism of homosexuality we are less inclined than our forefathers to condemn it as criminal, but most of us would still regard it as pathological, an unfortunate maladjustment in the develop- ing chain of sex reflexes. Few would echo Plato's eulogy of paederasty. Neverthe- less, as the author of this book points out, though it be a faint unintelligibility to see just how essentially related, as cause and effect, were Greek moral-ideals and Greek art, still no progress in inter- pretive appreciation can ever be made if the layman behaves like an ostrich in the face of something dis- tasteful and ignores its reality. To see only the dazzling shimmer of its reflection in Hellenic art without admitting the strange shadows that, to our sense, so enshroud the sensitive soul of the Greek, is as purblind an occupation as that of separating the known homosexuality of this people from the fine jewel of art it produced in the Athenian Akropolis. One reflection of the place of paederasty in the Greek mores is the frequent occur- rence of the formula: "The boy is beauti- ful" or "So-and-so is beautiful" on Greek vases. This book catalogues the various names that occur in this formula whether in literature or on vases and suggests identifications of the names with historical characters known from other sources. About the time of the Peloponnesian War paederasty sank into disrepute, as may be seen by the change in attitude from Plato to Aristophanes. One result of this and of the linked rise in repute of hetero- sexual love is the more frequent occur- rence of nude women in Greek sculpture, whereas before they had been draped and only the men nude. Another is the disappearance of love-names from Greek vases. SEX, CUSTOM AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGY. A Study of South African Pagan Natives. By B. J. F. Laubscher. Robert M. McBride and Co., New York. $5.oo. 94 x 61; xv + 347 + i6 plates; I938. This interesting and well written volume -a study of the South Eastern Cape Bantu -is an endeavor to show the influence of the native's beliefs and customs on psycho- pathology in a primitive culture. In detail Dr. Laubscher, who is on the staff of the Queenstown Mental Hospital, discusses the folklore and mythological characters which play an uncannily real part in the life of the native. His chapter on diviners and sorcerers and the remark- able feats of these men is also one of\great interest. However, he fails to explain their superhuman powers attributing them to "psychic sensitivity," "because the word 'intuition' does not cover all its phases." Further chapters describe native</page><page sequence="34">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 375 sacrifices, burial and marriage rites, the complicated rituals that involve circum- cision and the initiation of the adolescent into manhood. The author's psychiatric interpretation of the various and complex native rites and their bearing on psychoses verge on the Freudian, but his great abundance of factual material, accurately and painstakingly collected, should be of value to the anthropologist as well as entertaining to the layman. In conclusion the author writes of the native's own conception of mental disorder and its confusion with witchcraft, and devotes two chapters to his native mate- rial in the Mental Hospital. He finds that the behavior of the native mental patients is similar to that of European psychotics and suggests that too much emphasis has been laid on the environ- ment in schizophrenia and not enough upon constitutional factors. The final chapter discusses the prevalence of stock theft and homicide and the psychological make-up and culture conducive to these crimes. There is also a chapter on sexual offences. An appendix supplements the chapter on hospital material containing family his- tories of some of the native psychotics showing that often members of their families were either witch-doctors or were considered bewitched by their tribesmen. Excellent and interesting photographs accompany the text and there is an ade- quate index. DIE STORUNGEN DER SEXUALFUNKTION BEI MANN UND WEIB. By Ludwig Chiavacci. Introduction by Otto Pdtzl. Franz Deuticke, LeipZig and Wien. 4.60 marks (paper); 5.40 marks (bound). 9 x 68; vi + I45; I938. This brochure is a mixture of common sense and dubious procedures. The title, which implies a discussion of the disorders of sexual function, is misleading. The book deals mainly with impotence, fifteen pages only are devoted to sterility, and many definite disorders such as nympho- mania, satyrism, vaginism, etc. are not touched upon at all. The author sensibly states that frigidity and impotence are not diseases but symptom complexes and for this reason treatment should be varied according to the individual. However, his recommendation that infidelity should be suggested very subtly by the physician in those cases where the impotence of the husband might be due to the frigidity or sexual inadequacy of the wife seems dubious, let alone under-handed. His discussion of treatment for impotence otherwise is an enumeration of patented endocrine preparations, especially the pluriglandular kinds that have so far not found great favor among American endo- crinologists. The treatment of sterility is likewise dismissed with a list of various procedures and is of little practical use to the specialist. The book might however serve as a cram survey of the subject to the medical student. STEP BY STEP IN SEx EDUCATION. By Edith H. Swift. The Macmillan Co., New York. $z.oo. 8 x 52; xiii + 207; I98 In dialogue form this book aims to impart the ideal way of instructing the young in the facts of life. It is not a repetition of the old bee and flower sex education, for Dr. Swift is of the firm opinion that par- ents should inform their children about "the seamy side of life" before they have a chance to learn it from other and less poetic sources. Her theory may be a sound one, but the manner in which it is portrayed is enough to nauseate the least squeamish. Perhaps the blame may be laid on the bad English and complete artificiality of the author's model char- acters. At any rate, the whole book leaves one with the impression that these parents spend their entire lives lying in wait to corner their unsuspecting young- sters in order to stuff them to the gills ("casual-like") with sex information, and that before the children are even house-broken they are none too subtly being modelled into ideal mates and parents.

LOVE AND HAPPINESS. Intimate Problems of the Modern Woman. By I. M. Hotep. With a Prefactory note by Logan Clendening. Alfred A. Knopf, New York. $z.oo. 72 x 54; ix + `35 + Vii; I938. Here is a guidebook for the woman who would seek sexual solace in liaison. The author states that he is not writing for the uneducated girl, because she will never read his words. Yet the person with a moderate degree of intelligence could about as well solve her problem with Love and Happiness in a dusky corner of a book- shelf. The folly of preaching morality is here recognized, but not the equal folly of preaching against the repressive hand of the church, social taboos, and political legislation. The material is divided into problems of the girl from I5 to z5, the woman from z6 to 40, the married woman, and the widow. MENTALITY AND HOMOSEXUALITY. By Samuel Kahn. Meador Publishing Co., Boston. $3.00. 8 x 52; 249; I937. The homosexuals represented in this study were inmates in the New York Peniten- tiary for men, and the Women's Work- house and Correction Hospital for Women. The histories, including the sexual, were obtained by means of personal interviews and supplementary data were provided by the physical examinations and the mental testing. In his general conclusions Dr. Kahn indicates the factors that he con- siders the most important as concerns the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of homosexuality. There is no index. BIOMETRY RANDOM VARIABLES AND PROBABILITY Dis- TRIBUTIONS. By Harald Cramer. The University Press, Cambridge; The Macmillan Co., New York. $z.z5. 8 x 51; [8] + IzI; I937 (paper). There have been various approaches to the theory of probability. The first of these in point of time supposed that the ways in which an event can happen are divisible into a number of equally prob- able cases, such as heads and tails in a perfectly balanced coin, and defined the probability as the ratio of the number of favorable cases to the total number of cases. When we, however, broaden the application of the theory of probability to include more than games of chance it is not apparent what are the equally possible cases on which we are to base our prob- ability. The second approach, accord- ingly, defines the probability of an event as the limit of v/n as n approaches infinity, where n is the total number of observa- tions and v is the number of favorable observations. This is the approach fol- lowed by von Mises, and ih this country by Coolidge. This definition, however, suffers from the defect that the ratio v/n can be said to have a limit only in a highly Pickwickian sense. Actually as n increases the ratio in general shows a trend towards a limiting value but may exhibit fluctuations that any self-respect- ing mathematical function would consider beneath its dignity. Cramer therefore chooses a purely postu- lational approach. If R is a set of points the probability P (s) of the sub-set S is defined as a non-negative number such that P (R) = land P (Si + S2 + . . .) = P (Si) + P (S2) + . . . whose S1, S2 . . . have no common points. On this basis he develops the mathematical side of the theory, without any reference to the applications. STATISTICAL METHODS Applied to Experi- ments in Agriculture and Biology. By George W. Snedecor. Collegiate Press, Ames, Iowa. $3.75. 9 X 6; xiii + 34I; I937 .

The numerous examples not only give the student practice in applying the methods, but often illustrate significant points. Thus the examples on chi-square bring out the fact that the same percentage deviations are more significant the larger the populations on which they are based, while the same absolute deviations are less significant. Altogether this is an admirable text with special emphasis on the more recently developed statistical methods. HOW TO USE PICTORIAL STATISTICS. By Rudolf Modley. Harper and Bros., New York. $3.00. 94 x 68; xviii + I70; I937. The advantages of graphic presentation of statistical data have long been recognized. However, a bar diagram or other graph, while it shows relations more clearly than a numerical table, is still highly abstract. Somewhat more than a decade ago Dr. Otto Neurath of Vienna began the devel- opment of a new form of graph which makes a more vivid and concrete appeal to the layman. This is essentially the division of a bar diagram into units, each of which is represented by a symbol of the subject. Thus a bar representing i5,ooo,- 000 people is replaced by fifteen schema- tized, men, each representing a million people. The author, who has had a large share in introducing the method into this country, describes the technique of plan- ning and making such pictorial graphs as well as pictorial diagrams not involving numerical relations. He sees a wide future for the method in schools and museums, and wherever quantitative data are to be presented to the layman. For a trained audience, however, he prefers the older forms of graphs. ELEMENTS OF STATISTICAL METHOD. By Albert E. Waugh. MIcGraw-Hill Book Co.,NewYork. $3.50. 9x6;xv+38I; I938. This textbook differs little from the major- ity of statistical volumes that have re- cently appeared. It makes no attempt at specialization in a particular field, but gives a variety of examples, mostly from economics and biology. Development and derivation are largely omitted. Each chapter ending contains a number of exer- cises, designed primarily to evoke thought on the fundamental principles rather than on arithmetic methods. A series of appendices is included, giving short tables and a list of statistical books. PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR THE MIND OF THEJUROR as judge of the Facts or the Layman's View of the Law. By Albert S. Osborn. Introduction by John H. Wigmore. Boyd Printing Company, Albany. (Also obtainable from the author 233 Broadway, New York). Library Edi- tion $4.50; Students Edition $3.50. 98 X 68; xv + z39; I937. For nearly forty years Mr. Osborn has been an expert witness on documents before courts in nearly every state in the Union. It is natural that in this long service a shrewd observer should have accumulated a valuable fund of first hand knowledge on how our courts are actually run. In this book he presents his observa- tions together with suggestions for the more efficient administration of justice. These include greater care in the selection of an intelligent type of jurors, abolition of the requirement of a unanimous verdict, appointment of judges for long terms instead of their election for short terms, repeal of the statutes which in many states gag the judge and leave the jury at the mercy of the sophistries of the contending lawyers, and exclusion from the bar, so far as possible, of those attor- neys whose only interest in their profession is the amount of money they can acquire. When a man of Mr. Osborn's essentially conservative temper and with his wide experience of our courts presents such an unflattering picture of their actual opera- tion we may well pause and think. What</page><page sequence="37">378 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY stands in the way of such reforms as he proposes? The answer is easy and short and offensive; the legal profession in this country stands in the way. Next week steps toward this reform could begin, next month reform could be extended, and next year and the years following it could be completed if a majority of the legal profession earnestly desired reform. The opponents of this proposed means of making the administration of the law more efficient by in- creasing the powers of the judge are the present day successors of those who originally took this power away. They are the advocates who strenuously object to any interference with their law practice by a man sitting on a bench as a judge. They say this frankly. One of these opponents in a burst of confi- dence said, 'It is difficult enough to defeat my oppo- nent without also being obliged to defeat the judge.' Every person interested in the more efficient administration of justice, whether lawyer or layman, should read and ponder this book. A HERD OF RED DEER. A Study in Animaal Behaviour. By F. Fraser Darling. Oxford University Press, New York; Humphrey Milford, London. $5.50. 8' x x2; X + 2i5 + 8 plates + z folding maps; I937. Most of life history studies have been among insects, birds, and a few other representatives of our animal life but the mammals have been sadly neglected, main- ly because it requires a lot of time to observe their entire life history and because their size makes it infeasible to place them in cages for experimental purposes. By overcoming these difficulties, Darling has done a notable piece of work. This book tries to give the plain tale of an animal's life, of the things it does and is trying to do, of its relations with its fellows and with men, and of the things to which, as long observation leads me to believe, it responds. The study can be considered in no way complete, for now, after two years, I am left with more problems to solve than I knew of at the outset. The author is too modest when he says, "this book tries...." For two years he stalked the deer of northwestern Scotland in all kinds of weather, and the result is this entertaining, penetrating, and scien- tifically important story of their doings. He found that the deer spend their lives in limited areas, that the hinds and stags have their own territories according to the seasons, that the stag's antlers are used as an erotic zone. There is also a wealth of material on movement, insect parasites, territory and population, repro- duction, etc. The observations are very honest and the author studiously avoids placing any anthropomorphic interpretations on be- havior although he admits that the objec- tions to anthropomorphism can be carried too far. Mammalogists, students of ani- mal behavior, naturalists, deer raisers, and even deer hunters, will find this book absorbing and valuable. A notable con- tribution. THE MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES OF PHYS- ICAL EDUCATION FOR COLLEGE WOMEN. By Elizabeth Graybeal. University of Min- nesota Press, Minneapolis. $I.OO. 9-1 x 64; viii + 8o; I937 (paper). A controlled experiment was set up in which half of an entering class at the University of Minnesota participated in the regular required courses in physical education and the other half did not. The problem was to ascertain the differ- ences, after a period of examination, in the outcome of four objective tests; attitudes, knowledge, motor ability, and posture. This pamphlet gives a detailed description of these tests and their outcome and many tables present the various scores of the two groups. It was found that those who participated in the prescribed courses demonstrated an improvement in the functions tested. While this was not always great, it was demonstrated so consistently that the author concludes that a college requirement in physical education would seem justifiable. A bib- liography and appendix supplement the text. L'INTELLIGENCE DES ANIMAUX. Insectes sociaux, Chevaux mnathematiciens et causeurs. By Maurice Lecat. Librairie Castaigne,</page><page sequence="38">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 379 Brussels. 3 francs. 93 x 63; 22; I937 (paper). This paper represents a chapter from the larger work of M. Lecat entitled Le Maeter- linckiaznisme, and deals -with the philoso- pher's ideas on the intelligence of animals. The text is well documented with quota- tions from Maeterlinck's work, and is intended to give us some idea of the man and his work. The author very carefully refrains from making comments that would in any way influence the reader's opinions either of the man or of the value of his contributions. The strain upon the imagination in trying to visualize an ant that . . . "lives only for his God . . .", or a horse that can calculate the fourth root of 7,890,49I is so great that we are in- clined to agree with other critics in saying that Maeterlinck was a mystic, and that some of his work would hardly withstand the test of scientific criticism. THE INTERRELATIONSHIP OF DRIVES IN THE MALE ALBINO RAT. 11. Intercorrelations Be- tween 47 Measures of Drives and of Learning. Comparative Psychology Monographs, Volume I4, Number 6, Serial Number 72. By E. E. Anderson. Johns Hopkins Press, Bailtimore. $ i.SO. I0 X 6-1; "9; I938 (paper). Because in the earlier study the different drives were measured by a comparatively limited number of tests, this study in which 47 measures were obtained was undertaken to get more comprehensive data concerning the interrelationship of various measures to learning performance. The monograph gives a detailed descrip- tion of the various tests and many tables illustrate the scores. In general the author found that the correlations of the earlier and less extensive study were higher than those of the present one, but there were many cases of essential agree- ment between the two. He believes that the inadequate preliminary adaptation and the lower degree of motivation for the test in the earlier experiment account for the discrepancies between the two studies. A BIOLOGICAL APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM OF ABNORMAL BEHAVIOR. By Milton Harrington. Science Press Print- ing Co., Lancaster, Pa. $4.00. 9 X 6, 459; I938. Credit must be given to Harrington for following an earlier destructive criticism of the Freudian theory by this attempt at constructing a different angle of approach to the problem. The theory advocated here, that all abnormal behavior results from anatomical and physiological in- adequacy of the individual, is obviously not an entirely new one. Perhaps some- what insufficient acknowledgment is ex- tended to others with a similar point of view. The author presents his arguments in a logical manner, but does not hesitate to recognize weaknesses in his purely mechanistic theory. The work deals with "psycho-physiology" or the mechanism of behavior, and "psycho-pathology" or the abnormal behavior which arises from this mechanism. Treatment of abnormal- ity is left to a further volume. THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EARLY GROWTH Including Norms of Infant Behavior and a Method of Genetic Analysis. By Arnold Gesell and Helen Thompson, Assisted by Catherine S. Amatruda. The Macmillan Co., New York. $4.00. IO X 72; ix + 290 + I5 plates; I938. This volume presents to a certain degree a continuation and elaboration of a former publication The Mental Growth of the Pre- school Child that is now out of print. It deals especially with norms of infant behavior as to mental development in early childhood but includes also growth and anthropometric examinations. It is sub- divided into three parts: I. Methods and procedures; II. Norms of infant growth; III. Analytical appraisal of infant growth status. As in the former investigations of the authors, it gives a great many differ- ent results of high value with regard to the mental development in infancy. These results are important for the study of child hygiene and individual psychology.

DIFFERENTIAL PSYCHOLOGY. Individual and Group Differences in Behavior. By Anne Anastasi. The Macmillan Co., New York. $z.75. 778X 54; xvii + 6I5; I937- In this textbook, intended especially for the college student, the author has brought together and critically examined the facts and theories relating to variation in psychologic manifestations. In the first part Anastasi introduces the subject with an elementary exposition of the con- cept and mieasurement of variability and then proceeds to a discussion of the rela- tion of psychologic differences to heredity, environment and physical constitution. In the second part the subject matter concerns subnormal intellect, genius, and the association of sex, race, and urbanism with certain mental characteristics. The soundness of the author's views and the adequate bibliography serve to make this an excellent work for its purpose. EMBRYONIC MOTILITY AND SENSITIVITY. Monographs of the Society for Reseagrch in Child Development. Volume 11, No. 6 (Serial No. '3). By W. Preyer. Translated from the Origi- nal German of "Specielle Physiologie des Embryo" by G. E. Coghill and Wolfram K. Legner. Society for Research in Child Development, National Resea5rch Council, Washinigton, D. C. $i.oo. 9 x 6; v + II5; I937 (paper). An important translation. The original (of which this is only a part, beginning with Chapt. 6) appeared in I885 and "summarizes the earlier literature on the physiology of the embryo with Preyer's critical consideration and includes Preyer's own unsurpassed observations on em- bryos." With the present development of interest in genetic psychology and the growing awareness that behavior begins before birth, Preyer's monograph returns again to a well-deserved place on biologi- cal book-shelves. The translation is so arranged as to facilitate comparison with the original. The bibliography of over 500 titles is included and there is an index of authors. PERSONALITY in Formation and Action. By William Healy. W. W. Norton and Co., New York. $z.oo. 8 x 52; 204; I938- The author is the director of the Judge Baker Guidance Center, Boston, and this account is based upon 30 years experience with a great variety of personality prob- lems. Psychological theories do not rate a great deal of space, and make way for the common sense of experience and the insight that is presumed to follow upon the heels of the latter. While we agree that it is the common sense that gives to the book what value it has, we are not so sure that the insight is of the sort that goes very far beneath the surface. THE BACKWARD CHILD. By Cyril Burt. D. Appleton-Century Co., New York. $s.oo. 812 x 521; xx + 694; I937. A comprehensive discussion of the inter- relations of the factors determining back- wardness, physical and mental defects, poor environment, etc. The analysis of the sensory and motor defects is based upon a large body of experimental evi- dence, particularly so in the cases of speech defects and left-handedness. Considera- tions of general intelligence, tempera- ment, character, and environment figure prominently in the discussions on the diagnosis and treatment of backwardness. There is an appendix devoted to the curves of growth, and another to the statistical criteria. THE QUEST OF THE OVERSELF. By Paul Brunton. E. P. Dutton and Co., New York. $3.00. 82 x 58; 304; I938. According to the author this book is an explanation of a system of Yoga altered and adapted to suit modern Western needs.</page><page sequence="40">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 38I To the reviewer a system of breathing exercises as a means of attaining spiritual truth has always seemed slightly gro- tesque. In a quotation from Carrel there is an amusing error: "It is known that certain animals such as the small anthro- poid, tardigradum, stop their metabolism when they are dried." Surely for "an- thropoid" we should read "arthropod." THE MANAGEMENT OF EARLY INFANCY. PUBERTY AND ADOLESCENCE. THE PSYCHO- LOGICAL APPROACH. THE NEUROTIC CHAR- ACTER. Individual Psychology Medical Pam- phlets-No. i8. By E. Joyce Partridge, H. Crichton-Miller, T. A. Ross and F. G. Crookshank. C. W. Daniel Co., London. zs. 6d. net. 81 x 512; 64; I937 (paper). The four papers presented in this pam- phlet, by psychologists of standing, formed part of a symposium on Mental Health in Childhood and Adolescence. They were originally delivered before the Medical Society of Individual Psychology, London. DE OMNIBUS REBUS ET QUIBUSDEM ALIIS DE VERITATE. By Edward, Lord Herbert of Cherbury. Translated with an Introduction by Meyrick H. Carre. J. W. Arrowsmith, Bristol, England. is. 6d. net. 8 2 x 51; 334; I937. This is a translation from Herbert's rather crabbed Latin of the first purely meta- physical work written by an Englishman. Partly because of the difficulties of his style and partly because the main current of English metaphysics has been empiri- cist, Herbert has been little more than a name to most English students of philoso- phy. As Mr. Carre points out in his introduction, Herbert in his emphasis on Natural Instinct and its product, the Common Nations, is a precursor of Kant and his a priori forms of knowledge. In- deed except for Reid and his followers, Herbert's affinities are with the Conti- nental rather than the British metaphysi- cians. In placing at the centre of his scheme of knowledge self-evident judgments of reason, Herbert stands sharply contrasted from the empirical method power- fully advocated by his great contemporary. But he penetrates far more deeply into the metaphysics of knowledge than Bacon, examining assumptions which the latter takes for granted. For the first time in English thought-and it is not easy to find a parallel elsewhere in Europe-a systematic and comprehensive enquiry into the complex processes of knowing is undertaken. That the analysis is often confused and superficial does not detract from the merit of the insight which is achieved. Even in the psychological portions of the work there is, as we have noted, remarkable foreshadowing of later theories. But in its central conception of the organic relation between the impulse of Nature and human thought, in its theory of the reciprocity between objects and the understanding, and in its discussions of the a priori foundations of knowledge, it expresses philosophical ideas which look beyond the whole course of English empiricism, by which for nearly two centuries they were submerged. MAKING PICTURES WITH THE MINIATURE CAMERA. A Working Manual. By Jacob Deschin. Whittlesey House, McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York. $3.00. 9 x 6; xii + I56 + 47 plates; I937. For the amateur or even the professional miniature photographer who is seeking exact and detailed directions in every phase of his art this little volume is of extreme value. Mr. Deschin writes as one with experience not only in the art of photography, but also in the field of editing. His editorial work has been seen in several journals in the form of keen and understandable articles on every phase of his work. The book is divided into four parts, namely: (i) Taking the Picture, which includes a discussion of techniques in "shooting" every conceiv- able type of picture; (7) Making the Nega- tive, which contains all the salient points on equipment and technique in develop- ing; (3) Making the Picture, which gives all the details of printing, enlarging, and touching up the picture; and (4) A Minia- ture Camera Gallery of 47 plates character- istic of the type of photography displayed in the countless picture magazines found on all our corner news stands. The first three sections are well illustrated by dia- grams and line drawings. The volume is completed with a glossary of photo- graphic terms and an index.</page><page sequence="41">382. THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY MINIATURE PHOTOGRAPHY From One Ama- teur to Another. By Richard L. Simon. Introduction by Laurence Stallings. Simon and Schuster, New York. $I.75. 71 x 52; x + i68 + 30 plates; I937. This little guide to miniature photog- raphy has been written to supply the solutions to some of the many problems and questions that confront the candid cameraman as he pursues his hobby along ever-widening trails. Though we could hardly say that the work was the product of a literary genius, it is nevertheless clearly and interestingly written, and spiced up a bit by an occasional photo- graph illustrating good or bad technique in some phase of the making of the pic- ture. The content is made up of a dis- cussion of such topics as type of equip- ment, expenses, exposing, developing and printing of pictures. Included also are some notes on publications and gadgets, appendices A and B on how to work several types of cameras, and an index. SCIENCE IN OUR LIvEs. By Benjamin C. Gruenberg and Samuel P. Unzicker. World Book Co., Yonkers-on- Hudson, N. Y. $I.76. 7 X 5x8 ; xiv + 750; I938. A praiseworthy comprehensive study of general science. Simple vocabulary, un- complicated sentences, and concrete, familiar examples make this a practical, teachable textbook. Herein all science is presented as a related picture, and the social significance of scientific achieve- ment is stressed. The contents are divided into two parts each of which is subdivided into four units. Air, water, fire, and earth are the four "elements" developed in Part I. Work, electricity, life in respect to nutrition, environment, reproduction, heredity, sound and hear- ing, light and sight, and reflexes and in- stincts are dealt with in ParE II as part of man's control over nature. There are also 97 problems to stimnulate the natural curiosity of the student and over 300 described activities for practical demonstrations of scientific procedure. BOOKS AND DOCUMENTS. Dating, Perma- nence and Preservation. By Julius Grant. Chemical Publishing Co., New York. $4.50. 82' x 52 ; xii + zi8 + iS plates; I937. Part I deals with the origin and develop- ment of paper from the point of view of dating characteristics and describes tests which indicate the presence or absence of these characteristics. There is a special chapter on the use of fluorescence in ultra- violet light. Part II deals exhaustively with the durability, permanence and preservation of books and documents. The volume will interest librarians, anti- quarians and collectors, and all those having anything to do with manufac- turing books and documents. 'MtpeA7</page></plain_text>
