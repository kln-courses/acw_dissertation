Trager, of the School of Languages and Linguistics of the Foreign Service Insti- tute, for the following statement on metalinguistics which they have prepared specially for this issue of ET C. : METALINGUISTICS The dealing term with "metalinguistics" the relation of was linguistic devised behavior to cover ( aspects language of ) linguistic to other human science dealing with the relation of linguistic behavior ( language ) to other human behavior ? It presupposes the thorough formal analysis of a language - the micro- linguistic analysis of its structure. Metalinguistics is dependent upon the existence of this and similarly thorough analyses of such phases of human behavior as patterning in movements, material objects and their uses, philosophical orienta- tion, relations between persons, etc. Like language, all of these constitute systems of learned and patterned be- havior (including the products of behavior), and comprise what anthropologists call the totality of culture. For each society, the total culture and all its sub- divisions must be analyzed as closed systems, having no necessary resemblance to or connection with those of any other society. As yet, metalinguistics is a field whose study is only begun; this is because only now has microlinguistics reached a point where it can furnish complete enough descriptions of languages to establish definite limits between micro- and metalinguistics. Microlinguistics concerns itself only with differential meaning, that is, whether utterance fractions are the same or different. Metalinguistics, however, which may be described as the study of what people talk (or write) about and why, and how they react to it, is concerned with meaning on all levels. Where microlinguistics stops with the consideration of the structure of the sen- tence, metalinguistics deals also with the organization of sentences into discourse and the relation of the discourse to the rest of the culture. 1 The use of the word "metalinguistics" in this issue is to be distinguished from its use in such expressions as "metalinguistic statement" employed by Professor Charles E. Bures in the context of formal logic in his "Critique of 'Language in Thought and Action,' " ETC., IX, 35-43 (Autumn 1951). 2 See George L.

IX, NO. 3 Whorf anticipated an important phase of metalinguistics - the analysis of the interrelationships of linguistic structure and those other structurings of ex- perience expressed in language which may be called the world-view of the speakers of a language. It must be realized that the speakers of a language, as members of one culture, are unaware that their system of logic is not "natural" or universal, but is principally the result of this sort of interaction. At the Foreign Service Institute further studies of these interrelationships are being made. Henry Lee Smith, Jr. George L. Trager Students Alfred Korzybski's of general lectures semantics and who seminars had the will privilege recall that of he attending urged upon the late his Alfred Korzybski's lectures and seminars will recall that he urged upon his hearers the reading of material - especially articles by Benjamin Lee Whorf - which today constitutes some of the basic literature of what is here called meta- linguistics. Korzybski made available to his students reprints of Whorf' s articles, and it was due to his influence that Whorf's essay, "Science and Linguistics," was included as a supplementary reading in Hayakawa's Language in Action (1941) and that "Languages and Logic" was included in Lee's anthology, The Language of Wisdom and Folly (1949). The reasons for Korzybski's interest in the comparative study of the structures of different languages are indicated in such passages as the following from his Science and Sanity (1933) : That languages, as such, all have some structure or other is a new and, perhaps, unexpected notion. Moreover, every language having a structure, by the very nature of language, reflects in its own structure the world as assumed by those who evolved the language. In other words, we read unconsciously into the world the structure of the language we use (pp. 59-60). For no "facts" are ever free from "doctrines": so whoever fancies he can free himself from "doctrines," as expressed in the structure of the language he uses, simply cherishes a delusion, usually with strong affective components (p. 87). We do not realize what tremendous power the structure of an habitual language has. It is not an exaggeration to say that it enslaves us through the mechanism of semantic reaction and that the structure which a language exhibits, and impresses on us unconsciously, is automatically projected upon the world around us (p. 90). Neither Aristotle nor his immediate followers realized or could realize what has been said here. They took the structure of the primitive-made language for granted, and went ahead formulating a philosophical grammar of this primitive language, which grammar - to our great semantic detri- ment - they called "logic," defining it as the "laws of thought." Because of this formulation in a general theory, we are accustomed even today to inflict this "philosophical grammar" of primitive language upon our children, and so from childhood up imprison them unconsciously by the structure of 164</page><page sequence="3">SPRING 1952 FOREWORD the language and the so-called "logic," in an anthropomorphic, structurally primitive universe (p. 89). The explicit formulation of the idea that language can have structures differ- ent from that which was formally described in Aristotle's "laws of thought" was based principally, in Korzybski's case, on his observation of the fact that the new languages of twentieth century science are as powerful as they are because they escape the limitations of aristotelian (Indo-European) language structure.3 As he said, "The whole Einstein theory, or any other fundamental scientific theory, must be considered as the building of a new language of similar structure to the empirical facts known at a given date" (p. 30). Philipp Frank, in Einstein, His Life and Times (1947), similarly perceived the scientific revolu- tion of the twentieth century as a linguistic revolution: "Einstein's relativity of time is a reform in semantics, not in metaphysics." Studying as he did the (largely unconscious) linguistic determinants of human behavior, Korzybski was impressed by the degree to which traditional habits of thought, based on tradi- tional Western language structure, stood in the way of adequate problem-solving and adequate evaluation. IN Korzybski order to recommended, improve evaluations therefore, in social as readers thought of as ETC. well know, as in the everyday discipline life, Korzybski recommended, therefore, as readers of ETC. know, the discipline of making conscious our unconscious (aristotelian) assumptions and becoming acquainted with the possibilities of languages of radically different structure, as in mathematics and mathematical physics. Such a discipline would result, he said, in what he called "consciousness of abstracting," which may be described as the continuing awareness of the degree to which language, in the process of reporting events, imposes its own doctrinal and structural assumptions on the events re- ported.4 The individual who is to a high degree conscious of the linguistic and cultural conventions governing his own abstracting processes, Korzybski claimed, is nondogmatic; he is aware of the limitations of his own perceptions and * "The term aristotelian' as used by Korzybski can be translated 'Indo-European' for most purposes, the name of Aristotle being used largely because he was, and remains, foremost in making explicit the structural implications underlying our common Western linguistic heritage, and therefore foremost also in introducing order into Western thought. . . . The term non-Indo-European,' however, cannot be substituted for Korzybski's non- aristotelian,' since historic non-IE languages carry as many (although probably different) conscious or unconscious primitive metaphysical, prescientific, and animistic assumptions as IE languages - possibly more." Hayakawa, "What Is Meant by Aristotelian Structure of Language?" ETC., V, 230 (Summer 1948). 4 For example, the sentence "It rains" imposes a division of actor and action upon an event in which there is no such division; the sentence "The grass is green" attributes a (verbally detachable) "quality," greenness, to a "substance," grass. Out of such accidents of linguistic structure arise many of the "problems" of philosophy. See especially, in this issue, Chang Tung-sun's article, "A Chinese Philosopher's Theory of Knowledge." 165</page><page sequence="4">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. ex, NO. 3 observations and theories ; he is able to make allowances for the fact that others may approach events with different backgrounds, hence different abstractive sys- tems. Consequently such an individual is more capable than the semantically naive of entering into fruitful communicative interaction with others. As Professor William G. Leary points out in this issue, such an orientation of evaluative flexibility is exactly the kind of result hoped for by the School of Languages and Linguistics in the training of U.S. foreign service and diplo- matic personnel. Hence we can say that metalinguistics and general semantics have quite similar aims. Metalinguistics attempts to do for a relatively specialized group of people, through the study of comparative linguistics, what general semantics tries to do for a larger audience through the study of the methodo- logical and linguistic assumptions underlying modern science. Metalinguistics and general semantics are alike too in being simultaneously descriptive (in the usual scientific sense) and prescriptive (in that the facts described have implications for education, policy, and action that are virtually impossible to ignore) . True, the general semanticists are overtly, and sometimes urgently, prescriptive - perhaps to the peril of their scientific reputation; while the metalinguisticians tend not to talk about the prescriptive implications of their findings (see Smith and Träger' s statement above) . Nevertheless, basic to meta- linguistics is the perception that failure to take into account differences of lan- guage structure and other linguistic and cultural differences leads to distortions and failures of communication. The fact that metalinguistics is being used as it is in the training program of the Foreign Service Institute for the improvement of international communication is evidence that students of metalinguistics are not unaware of the practical and prescriptive implications of their discipline. Sober mantics students as being of not linguistic firmly enough science grounded have often in been modern critical linguistics. of general On the se- mantics as being not firmly enough grounded in modern linguistics. On the other hand, students of general semantics have often been critical of linguistic scholarship as being over-preoccupied with the sounds of language, vowel changes, morphology, and descriptive grammar (i.e. ' microlinguistics") to the exclusion of any apparent concern with the relations of language to human thought and action. That there should be these imperfect sympathies between linguistic science and general semantics is hardly a matter for surprise: the two disciplines have different origins and different histories. But in their interest in the area of inquiry here adumbrated under the term "metalinguistics/' students of linguistic science and of general semantics meet on common ground and arrive at remark- ably similar conclusions. It is the hope of the Editors that this issue of ETC. will mark the beginning of a closer relationship between the two disciplines, to the mutual correction and enrichment of both. - S.I.H. 1 66</page></plain_text>
