<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS OF BOOKS Inscribed Landscapes: Travel Writing from Imperial China. Translated by RICHARD E. STRASSBERG. Berkeley and Los Angeles: UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS, 1994. Pp. xxvii + 580 + illus. + maps. $60 (cloth); $20 (paper). Oscar Wilde, who wrote that it is better to be beautiful than to be good, would have appreciated this book. It is a handsome volume, collecting some eighty-three pieces of travel writing by fifty authors, followed by over one thousand notes, pre- ceded by a fifty-six page introduction, and accompanied by sixty-four illustrations and five maps. The writings span the Han through the Ch'ing dynasties. The illustrations range from hanging scrolls to woodblocks, from monumental landscapes to fine-line chieh-hua -Y. The introduction is the most informative essay of its kind yet to appear in English. It discusses many of the same issues- Chinese approaches to and appreciation of landscape and travel, the development of the literary tradition, and, in particu- lar, the coincidence between landscape painting and travel writ- ing during the Sung dynasty-and comes to many of the same conclusions Ch'en Su-chen [1$ does in her Master's thesis, published in Kuo-li T'ai-wan shih-fan ta-hsueh kuo-wen yen- chiu-so chi-k'an -_1 'i jlt:Fi:~F U (no. 31 [1987]: 623-740) under the title "Sung-tai shan-shui yu-chi yen-chiu" {f-LU1I7J g:EFt (this, and all other secondary sources cited in this review, can be found in Strassberg's bib- liography). Strassberg goes beyond Ch'en, however, in discuss- ing the early ritual aspects of travel and in drawing succinct comparisons between Chinese and Western travel literature. He also raises two issues not touched on by Ch'en, both of them ex- tremely interesting but, because of the general nature of intro- ductions, no as well developed as either reader or writer would like. The first is his general characterization of the places de- scribed in the essays as "marginal" (pp. 6, 12). A number of places written of in the volume can certainly be so qualified, but most readers would agree that as a general characterization it is an unfair one: Han dynasty T'ai-shan, for instance, was nei- ther culturally nor politically marginal, nor was Southern Sung Hangchou, nor the Temple of Confucius at Ch'ii-fu during any era in which state and society were grounded in Confucian mo- rality. A place like O-mei-shan might be called exurban, re- mote, difficult of access; but to call it "marginal" denies its identity as a spiritual center for Buddhism, and by extension denies the influence of Buddhism on mainstream Chinese cul- ture and Chinese history. The other issue Strassberg raises is that of the literate traveler's "inscribing the landscape"-that is, figuratively altering the land by producing a written ac- count that might influence another's perception of the place, and physically altering it by transferring the documentary ac- count to a piece of dressed stone that would be mounted in some, if not rustic, at least public, spot. This is an attractive idea as far as it goes, but in physical terms, it fails to take into account the other types of inscriptions that certainly outnumber travel accounts in the Chinese landscape: autographs, poems, place-names, Buddhist scriptures, votive inscriptions-as well as funerary inscriptions, which may or may not be visible but are nonetheless very much a part of the land. In figurative terms, it discounts the influence other types of writing have had on travelers' perceptions of the land, an influence well attested to in, for instance, the Sung travel diaries. Curiously, Strassberg ends his discussion abruptly with the Sung dynasty, although well over one-third of the essays in the volume (thirty-five out of eighty-three) date to the post-Sung era. The essays Strassberg has chosen for inclusion are certainly representative. Sixty-nine of the eighty-three pieces can be found in one or both of two anthologies cited in the introduc- tion (p. 427 n. 23) as recently published examples of the current Chinese interest in travel literature: Ni Ch'i-hsin {RLL, et al., eds., Chung-kuo ku-tai yu-chi hsiian P]t{ff gB^ (Peking: Chung-kuo lii-yu ch'u-pan-she, 1985; hereafter referred to as "Ni"), and Pei Yian-ch'en [14 and Yeh Yu-ming XJHA, eds., Li-tai yu-chi hsiian Mf{g4Bg (Changsha: Hu-nan jen- min ch'u-pan-she, 1980; hereafter referred to as "Pei and Yeh"). Most of the remaining selections can be found scattered among a number of other recently published travel anthologies or in the pages of Ku-wen kuan-chih `it7lIL. The only real surprise- and it is a most pleasant surprise-is the inclusion of six (out of seven) short pieces by Chang Tai m;b generally not antholo- gized in travel collections. Anyone acquainted with the anthologies mentioned above knows that they are aimed at the general Chinese reader and, as such, strike a comfortable balance between necessary detail and scholarly clutter. Strassberg maintains a similar, if not identical, balance in his notes. But the reader with access to the Chinese 121</page><page sequence="2">Journal of the American Oriental Society 116.1 (1996) anthologies and the occasional moder annotated edition of an individual text cannot help but wonder, occasionally, if Strass- berg has not relied, sometimes too heavily, on such secondary sources. At times, Strassberg seems reluctant to go beyond the model set by the Chinese anthologists in providing explanatory notes. At the close of "Chi-nan hsing-chi" Ai^[^{1, for instance, Yuan Hao-wen 7ffrI states that he wrote fifteen poems dur- ing his trip to Chi-nan and that he has appended them to the es- say, along with a few friends' poems, written in response to his own. Pei's and Yeh's Li-tai yu-chi hsiian, which includes the es- say, does not footnote the remark (p. 105). Neither, in essence, does Strassberg, whose note reads: "The poems were not pre- served together with the text" (p. 488 n. 50). This must leave even the most general reader feeling a bit unsatisfied-have the poems survived or haven't they? (For a tentative identification of the extant poems, see Yao Nai-wen k97T5:, "Yian Hao-wen tsai Shan-tung te ch'uang-tso huo-tung" n t 3rE]LUX Jtl jSj, in Yuan Hao-wen yen-chiu wen-chi, ed. Shan-tung-sheng ku-tien wen-hsiieh hsiieh-hui and Yuan Hao-wen yen-chiu-hui [Taiyuan: Shan-hsi jen-min ch'u-pan-she, 1987], 316-18; not cited in bibliography.) Elsewhere, after quoting a passage from Han Yii's ,T, "Yian tao" 1M calling for the secularization of Buddhist clergy and lands, Ku Yen-wu 6I0iE, in his "Wu-t'ai-shan chi" ?fiflJ1a, writes: Mr,fiff71J?M ~ti,,S S/}E _ ; l; . Strassberg's translation reads: "... . while Li Te-yii as prime minister ordered Chang Chung-wu to seal off Chii-yung Pass and refused to admit escaping monks from Five Terraces Mountain" (p. 359). The translation omits two words, tao 71 and fu Ft. Turning to the Chinese anthology for some clarification of the original passage, we read only of Li Te-yii's ~,f advocacy of border defenses and his promotion of Chang Chung-wu; we also learn of Chang's victories against the Ui- ghurs, including the capture of hundreds of infiltrators; Chi- yung-kuan is located on the moder map; andfeng-tao I77, "to scabbard a sword," is unconvincingly explained as referring to Chang's plans for the capture (as opposed to slaughter) of Ui- ghurs (Ni, 2:271 n. 60). Turning back to Strassberg's note 22 (pp. 514-15), we read the same, with one added piece of information: "Chang ... captured infiltrators of the enemy Uighur tribes at Chii-yung Pass." This might be, though neither Chang's T'ang shu biography nor the Tzu-chih t'ung-chien specifies Chii-yung- kuan as the site of Chang's confrontations with the tribesmen (Strassberg cites no sources in his note). What is certain, is that the note fails to relate Chang Chung-wu to the "escaping monks" mentioned by Ku Yen-wu and that it fails too to explain the significance of the tao andfu of the original passage. For this, we turn to the Tzu-chih t'ung-chien (Chung-hua shu-chii ed., 248.8018-19), where we read that during the Hui-ch'ang perse- cution of 845, monks who were forced to leave Wu-t'ai-shan were crossing the border into Yu-chou J'I'I, where Chang Chung-wu was serving as aide to the superior area command. On receiving an exhortation from Li Te-yii (who has been suspected through the centuries of instigating the suppression), Chang Chung-wu, the Tzu-chih t'ung-chien tells us, "wrapped up two swords and handed them over to [the guard at] Chii-yung-kuan, saying, 'behead any wandering monks who enter our borders'" {P -',it7 J) H ElM: i,A^HiJ*FF. Chang did not "seal off the pass," then, but wrapped a sword, or two swords, possibly with yellow silk, an act that in historical times gave an agent the authority to put a particular person or persons to death (Han-yii ta tz'u-tien, 2:1251). Similarly, in a note concerning Pao Chao's ,t, "Wu-ch'eng fu" llj AS, Strassberg states that Pao Chao wrote the rhapsody "after a revolt in 456 by Liu Yen [sic], prince of Ching-ling, was brutally suppressed. This followed upon an invasion of the city by Northern Wei forces in 450" (p. 531 n. 1). The advance that led the Northern Wei forces through the area of Kuang-ling J [ occurred, according to the Nan shih (Chung-hua shu-chii ed., 2.52), in the first month of the 28th year of the Yuan-chia era, or 451. What is commonly referred to as the "revolt" of Liu Tan WJi], according to the Sung shu, never really took place. The emperor began to suspect Liu Tan's loyalty in 454-55 (SS, Chung-hua shu-chii ed., 79.2026). In 457 rumors concerning re- volt were rife (79.2027); but in 459, Liu Ch'eng iJM could still submit a memorial accusing Liu Tan of "plotting rebellion" (mou fan ?i), so we know that the prince had not yet taken up arms or publicly challenged the throne (79.2027). Acting on the memorial and his own mounting suspicions, however, the em- peror ordered his generals to move on Kuang-ling and to deal with Liu Tan. Shen Ch'ing-chih ~tJ/ finally succeeded in Au- gust of that year (79.2036). (For a more precise summary of events, see David R. Knechtges' note in his Wen xuan, Or Se- lections of Refined Literature, vol. 2 [Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1987], 253, 255.) While Strassberg's information does not correspond to what we find in the primary sources, it does coin- cide with what we find in Pei and Yeh (p. 386, n. 4), who cite 456 as the date of Liu Tan's revolt, and Ni (2:376, n. 5), who cites 450 as the date Kuang-ling suffered an earlier military disaster. Strassberg's note includes no source citation. Elsewhere, errors in fact clearly indicate that, in certain in- stances at least, Strassberg has relied exclusively on the second- ary sources and has used them carelessly. In his Hsi-yu-lu i V, Yeh-lii Ch'u-ts'ai f-$V] locates the Han-hai Ai "more than a hundred miles northwest of the city" of Beshbalik (p. 230). Strassberg notes: "The 'Desert-Ocean' (Han-hai) is the Gobi Desert that stretched northwest of Beshbalik to the Golden Mountains" (p. 481 n. 8)-that is, that stretched northwest of modern Jimsar, just east of Urumchi, to the Altai. Strassberg's map 5, however, "Yeh-lii Ch'u-ts'ai's Journey through the West- ern Region" (pp. 226-27), includes neither the Han-hai (men- tioned in Yeh-lii's account) nor the Gobi (mentioned in Strass- berg's notes). No maps or atlases, moreover, Chinese or Western, 122</page><page sequence="3">Reviews of Books place the Gobi near Urumchi; nor do any of the standard Chinese encyclopedic or geographical dictionaries. Trning to Hsiang Ta's rri]l annotated edition of Hsi-yu-lu (Peking: Chung-hua shu-chii, 1981), cited by Strassberg, not as the source of the note quoted above, but as the recension of the text from which the translation was made, we read: "The Han-hai is the great gobi that extends north from the city to the Chin-shan" JA JTIJ- ItL J J ,llJ_t--4I _ (p. 6, n. 12; underscore in original). This gobi, or "lenticular mass of sedimentary depos- its," can only be the Dzungarian or Junggar Basin, which encom- passes the Gurbantiinggut Desert and is bounded on the north by the Altai. Similarly, Strassberg places Kuei-lin i1 in Kueichou, when it is in Kuangsi (p. 468 n. 2; cf. Ni, 1:155, n. 8); and Wu-hsing %^: in Kiangsu, when it is in Chekiang (p. 477 n. 1; cf. Ni, 1:223 n. 3). He reads the Analects (6/9) phrase Wen-shang i~i-:-"on the banks of the Wen" or "on the far side of the River Wen," in the opinion of the Lun-yu scholia-as the name of the later administrative district Wen-shang (p. 525 n. 25; cf. Teng Chin-shen IMAM, ed., Li-tai ming-jen jih-chi hsiian JfIX2 g E [Kuangchou: Hua-ch'eng ch'u-pan-she, 1984], 324, n. 60). He identifies the Hsiin-yang iZ4 as a tributary of the Yangtze, when all standard sources identify it as the name of a particular stretch of the Yangtze (p. 529 n. 1; cf. Ni, 2:369, n. 2). He ascribes the name of the mountain Fu-shan if ll to the fact that "it is surrounded by bodies of water, making the visitor feel that he is floating," when the source cited by the Chinese anthologist, Liu Ta-k'uei's l]Jk;i "Fu-shan chi" C[lgE, states that it is so named because, when viewed from a distance, the mountain itself appears to be floating (p. 526 n. 2; cf. Pei and Yeh, 343, n. 13, and Ni, 2:341, n. 18; for Liu Ta-k'uei's text, see also Hai-feng hsien-sheng wen 3lV $ :7I3i [n.p., 1874], 9.14a). And he makes Li Ch'ang ]' (1027-90) a ten-year-old licenti- ate by citing the date of his chin-shih degree as sometime during the Ching-yu era (1034-37), while the Sung-jen chuan-chi tzu- liao so-yin *)AEWft *4*. I cites the more reasonable date of 1049 (p. 530 n. 8; cf. Pei and Yeh, 375, n. 18). In the cases just cited, Strassberg has evidently misread the secondary sources and failed to catch his errors by crosscheck- ing in standard reference works or primary sources. Elsewhere, however, he creates data. In his notes to a selection by Hsii Hung-tsu ft il Strassberg identifies fu-po t{, as the "cour- tesy name" of Ma Yuan ,,% (p. 509, n. 38). The secondary source Strassberg seems to have consulted in preparing his notes to the Hsii Hsia-k'o selections, Hsi Hsia-k'o ming-shan yu-chi hsuan-chu 1,;tlWgBI/, ed. Hsii Chao-k'uei &amp;,1, (Peking: Chung-kuo lii-yu ch'u-pan-she, 1985), 204, n. 147, does not make this identification, nor does any primary source or ref- erence work, it goes without saying. Fu-po, "le dompteur des flots" in Kaltenmark's translation, is the title bestowed on Ma Yuan by Kuang-wu-ti ti- in recognition of his merit and service. While Ma Yuan was not the only general in history to receive the title, as the one credited with expanding the southern frontiers of the Han empire down into what is now northern Viet- nam, he was the best known. This inattention to detail carries over into the translations. In a passage from Yuan Hao-wen's "Chi-nan hsing-chi" con- cerning the Ch'ang-pai-shan t [ ll of Tsou-p'ing-hsien 5*- ,, Shantung, for instance, we read: il-..;i ~;E,i -;2-jt. Strassberg's translation reads: "It is where Fan Chung-yen's schoolhouse, also known as Collegiate Hall, is located" (p. 240). But grammatical logic demands that the chih ? be understood as referring to the mountains, not the school- house, a reading that is supported by standard reference sources, which cite "Hung-t'ang" W_ as an alternate designation of the Ch'ang-pai-shan, also known as the Hung-t'ang-ling M. Simi- larly, in a passage from Ku Yen-wu's "Wu-t'ai-shan chi," Strass- berg translates ;i lll]jS,i l.if - -+ as "its [i.e., Wu-t'ai-shan's] distance northwest from Fan-chih District is forty-three miles" (p. 357). The map, which places Wu-t'ai-shan southeast of Fan-chih, should have cleared up any ambiguity the translator might have read in the Chinese original. Paraphrase abounds, especially where it shouldn't-in Wang Po's EtJ "T'eng-wang-ko hsii" Wi-TR, for instance, whose ornate, stately language is what sets the piece apart for most readers. On pages 107 and 108, shih-hsiin hsiu-hsia +hj{*HJ is rendered "week's end"; sheng-yu PIK is rendered "com- pany"; ts'an-fei !S is rendered "horses and carriages"; ch'an- wei ]t~ is rendered "carriage"; ting-shih chih chia PA *2 is rendered "noble mansions"; p'ing W is rendered "grass"; fu- yao ~ is rendered "the winds"; sang-yii AJ1 is rendered "the west"; tsan-hu Fi is rendered "tokens of office"; feng ch'en- hun ~i is rendered "to look after my parents"; and p'eng-mei Rt is rendered "to pay my respects." This is approximation, not translation, of text; it is not what we, as readers, turn to scholarly translations for. In other places the reader comes to the unavoidable conclu- sion that Strassberg is not simply paraphrasing the original text, but translating the modern editors' glosses. Consider four ex- amples from Strassberg's translation of Pao Chao's "Teng Ta-lei- an yu mei shu" ;J-:lg . Strassberg renders the phrase ch'ui lao 19K as "playfully spit forth water" (p. 76), although ch'ui is generally glossed simply as "to release with force some- thing that has been collected in the mouth" and thus carries no overtones of either playfulness or solemnity. Strassberg's inter- pretation becomes more understandable, in one sense at least, when we consider, not the gloss provided by Ch'ien Chen-lun A 1sfif in Pao ts'an-chiin chi-chu ,t W-Vil (Shanghai: Ku-tien wen-hsiieh ch'u-pan-she, 1958; 2.40), which cites the decidedly unplayful context of Mu Hua's *7 "Hai fu" #1W, but the gloss provided by Ni Ch'i-hsin in Chung-kuo ku-tai yu-chi hsian (1:23 n. 88): "Ch'ui-lao: to spit out water in play" il:t7it* W. In like manner, Strassberg's "waterfowl" (p. 75) translates the gloss provided by Ni (1:19, n. 42), shui-niao 7*%; but Pao 123</page><page sequence="4">Journal of the American Oriental Society 116.1 (1996) Chao's text reads ch'i po chih niao MRfiM,, "birds that roost on the waves." Though the class of birds referred to remains the same in Strassberg's translation, the evocative image inherent in Pao Chao's phrase is lost. Strassberg's rendering of the succeed- ing phrase, shui hua chih ch'ung 7A{Ll]A, fares a little worse: "fishes" (p. 75) complies with Ni's gloss (1:19, n. 43), yii-lei f 1; but it disregards the wording of the original text, which reads "creatures born of the waters"-a class that, in a medieval Chi- nese context, includes far more than fish. In this case, Strassberg has both pared down the language and narrowed the scope of the original phrase. In the same piece, Strassberg renders the phrase hsi-chou SI as "the island where wild boars die" (p. 75). Here he seems not only to have favored the gloss over the original text, but to have mistranslated it. In reference to the phrase, Ni (1:21, n. 66) reads: "A river island that is a haunt of wild pigs" j:itHJ $i4JF1. No other references I consulted implied any- thing more. In some cases, Strassberg invests phenomena natural and man-made with abilities neither described nor implied in the original texts. He renders Liu K'ai's OPr phrase tso shih nung ch'uan ]5SS , for instance, as "Entranced by the way the rocks toyed with the springs,..." (p. 154). But the rocks were not toying with the spring-the narrator and his companion were; the rocks were being sat on. In another selection, Wang Wei's t, "Shan-chung yii hsiu-ts'ai P'ei Ti shu" lIrpr t *Wf, Strassberg renders the original it l MIiil as "In the village, nighttime rice pounding played a duet with the distant bells" (p. 113), thus lending the translated letter an inti- mation of anthropomorphism, not to mention an unseemly cute- ness, that is not present in the Chinese text. In other cases, Strassberg's interpretations can be explained only as gratuitous attempts to break from tradition. In his trans- lation of "Hou Ch'ih-pi fu" *ti 1M, for instance, the phrase hua-jan ch'ang-hsiao l]J tj- is rendered "let out a sharp cry" (p. 188). The phrase can be construed as "sharp cry," of course, but it is a reading that ignores the traditional understand- ing of the phrase in the essay and, more importantly, ignores the context in which the phrase appears-the eeriness of the landscape, the chill of the atmosphere, the weird response that follows the act-as well as the natural and supernatural signif- icance of "long whistling." (For a summary of the secondary lit- erature on whistling, see Paul W. Kroll, "Verses from on High: The Ascent of T'ai Shan," in The Vitality of the Lyric Voice, ed. Lin and Owen [Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1986], 201, n. 96.) It is also a reading that robs Su Shih's ,I essay of some of the mystery that makes it, when read with the "Ch'ien Ch'ih- pi fu" ip,,llFS, "superior to the entire Chuang-tzu." And in his translation of Ou-yang Hsiu's W f{fi "Tsui-weng- t'ing chi" R -gE, Strassberg muddies the structural clarity of the original composition by needlessly switching tense from the general present to the past specific, then back to the present and again to the past, quickly, before bringing it all to an end in the present. Stranger than this is Strassberg's insistence on inserting a first-person pronoun when none is called for-nor is this "I," as explained in the introduction's discussion of the essay (p. 52), intended simply as a sort of linguistic stopgap added to ease the transition from classical Chinese to modern English. Con- sider the opening passage from the original: Strassberg's translation (pp. 162-63 reads: Mountains ring the seat of Ch'u Prefecture. The many peaks on the southwest are especially beautiful, with their forests and valleys. I gazed into the distance at one that was luxuriant, deep, and graceful-Lang-ya Moun- tain. I walked more than two miles up the mountain and gradually heard the gurgling sound of water, "ch'an- ch'an" until I found, splashing out from between two peaks-Fermentation Spring. The peaks circled around me as the road twisted and turned until there was a pavilion with eaves like wings, facing the spring-the Pavilion of the Old Drunkard. Who built this pavilion? A monk on the mountain-Chih-hsien. Who named this pavilion? The Prefect did, after himself. At this point, the "I" disappears, never to re-emerge, and the time frame shifts (not for the last time) to the present. It is a read- ing most students and scholars will have difficulty accepting. This is only a sampling of what the reader will find in Inscribed Landscapes-translation that frequently demonstrates an insensitivity toward the language and authorial voice of some of the most eminent men of Chinese letters; a collection of early travel writings in which historical context and geographical orientation are often only indifferently considered; a purportedly scholarly work that generally slights scholarly method and scholarly protocol (in none of the extracts or notes quoted in this review does Strassberg cite the secondary sources he has so evi- dently depended on). The error that pervades Inscribed Land- scapes is systemic and fundamental; the illustrations that grace the text, lovely as they are, are hardly meet compensation for it. Wilde was wrong. It's better to be good. DEBORAH RUDOLPH UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY 124</page></plain_text>
