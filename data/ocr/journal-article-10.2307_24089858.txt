<plain_text><page sequence="1">GENERAL ARTICLES Typology of sacred groves and their discrimination from sacred sites Arti Gar g Inadequate awareness on the typology of sacred groves is perceived to be the major cause for mis interpretation of some unnoticed, naturally preserved, deep-seated and concealed sacred sites established within the thickets of the Himalayan mountains and forests as 'sacred groves'. This results in an invalid typification and incorrigible documentation of the priceless virgin ecosystems generating surplus sacred groves and creating a chaotic and debatable situation which may hamper their development for sustainable benefits. A more rationalized definition encapsulating the typological parameters of sacred groves is given here and the major criteria of differentiating them from sacred sites are provided. Keywords: Discrimination, sacred groves, sacred sites, typology. The blend of criteria provided recently by various work ers in designating sacred groves appears to be based on a comprehension that sacred groves 'comprise of remnants of pristine forest or cultural artifact embedded in a thickly forested site in vicinity of any place of worship, bearing some historic anecdote of the grove, with a shrine created for the deity in a dedicated place regarded as "genius loci" or spirit of the place, where rituals are per formed'1-4. Such considerations reflect inadequate aware ness on the standard typological characters of sacred groves, which results in the misinterpretation of sacred/ religious sites as sacred groves. A necessity is therefore realized to evolve a rationalized concept of sacred groves with unique, consistent and concrete parameters, to strengthen their typology5 and underpin the conceptual demarcation between the two closely allied terms - sacred groves and sacred sites (Table 1). Typological parameters of sacred groves The term 'sacred' implies some extraordinary attributes which stimulate feelings of power, mystery, awe, tran scendence, peace and healing6 '. Trees are a form of nature which represent life and the sacred continuity of spiritual, cosmic and physical worlds and are the first temple of gods8,9. Trees may be 'holy', 'blessed' or 'sacred', depending upon the religious attitude of people towards them. A 'holy' tree is a species of which all parts are worshipped, e.g. Ficus religiosa Lev. (peepal), Ficus benghalensis L. (bargad). A 'blessed' tree10 is an abode of angels or a deity who protects it, and is revered due to Arti Garg is in the Botanical Survey of India, Central Regional Centre, 10 Chattham lines, Allahabad 211 002, India, e-mail: kad_arti396@yahoo.com the religious dedication of people who worship it with an intention to please the deity within (e.g. the 'Kalpvraksh' - Adansinia digitata L.). 'Sacred' trees are those which are subjected to practical manifestation of worship, adoration and profound veneration to honour a deity or to please a devil, demon, or any other ghostly creature, provide sanc tuary for spirits, remind present generations of ancestors, or to protect a sanctified place from willful damage and exploitation. Once linked with stringent religious or historical events, the sacred trees acquire a symbolic status to manifest the associated events and act as a path between man and god. The term sacred is strongly upheld by fear and awesome reverence of the associated gods and spirits11-13. The habitats which harbour only sacred trees in special environments, owned exclusively by the local clan responsible for their establishment, protection and supervision with special values limited to their own culture and religion14'15 and with restricted human inter ference, emerge as 'sacred groves', derived from the desire of local people to live in harmony with numerous spirits that are believed to be associated with the natural envi ronment, especially forests7. The typology5 of sacred groves depends on a number of factors associated with the tree cover and variously defined by different workers15-24. However, these defini tions were 'ecological', derived from a botanical ideal (climax), not based on local understanding25. Later, Hughes and Chandran9 provided a more comprehensive definition as 'Segments of landscape containing trees and other forms of life and geographical features that are delimited and protected by human activities believing that preserving such a patch of vegetation in relatively undisturbed state is necessary for expressing one's rela tion to the divine or to nature', which is more widely accepted. 596 CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL, 104, NO. 5, 10 MARCH 2013</page><page sequence="2">GENERAL ARTICLES Table 1.

The seven major elements which define the typological characteristics of sacred groves are as follows. • An abode of a supernatural power. The deities or demons worshipped within are abstracted from nature and believed to permeate through entire groves as indistinct beings such as tree spirits - Vanadevatas or Vanadevis; abstract weird creatures and evil spirits - atmas, bhutas, prêtas, jinnas or animal deity - serpent (naga), panther and tiger26, often represented by vacant spots, crude stones and termite mounds and recognition of sacred trees inevitably precedes the associated idol or artifact. • Piece of natural vegetation (in most cases). Sacred groves are comprised of multispecies, multi-tier virgin forest or a set of trees, of climax primary vegetation with keystone27 species and rich floral diversity, a repository of specific genetic variants and remnants of species specific to the particular geographical region that might have succumbed to threats and perished from the denuded surroundings16'28"31. • Well delineated physically/geographically. Sustained in anthropogenically undisturbed conditions amidst altered environment, sacred groves stand out as distinct, physically diverse patches of original vegetation, not merging with the enveloping tampered ecosystem, and having a rich representation of sacred trees within, compared to the peripheral buffer area and possess a characteristic water body32. Related to historical, cultural or religious issues. The adopted cultural practices depict the intrinsic spiritual perception, memories and values which local people attach to the sacred trees and the entire grove for which they are enshrined in the natural environment. Associated taboos. Every tree of the grove is consid ered sacred for religious reasons33. Sometimes, pluck ing of a small portion of plant specimen and even picking up dead wood and fallen leaves is a taboo and the entire patch is kept under strict vigilance of the local custodian. Within their precincts, the sacred groves are impermeable to even the slightest human interference34'35, fearing that it may disturb the gods and spirits and attract retribution36. Communal sanctity and protection from interference. The entire area is protected and the deity is propitiated periodically to ensure benevolence or to avert malevo lence of the supernatural powers. The sanctity is based on the religion of the endogamous group and cere monial procedures are specific to the clan, sometimes unique or even weird and unusual, often involving CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 104, NO. 5, 10 MARCH 2013 597</page><page sequence="3">GENERAL ARTICLES animal sacrifices and blood offerings. The persons, generally elderly priests/priestesses, who perform these rituals and pray to the gods and spirits on behalf of the entire community are also defined. • Ubiquitous values not restricted to specific religion or geographic territory. The deities, demons or other holy figures or evil spirits are independent of any religion and impervious to religious obligations. All values are self-designed based only on the beliefs of local clans. The authoritative community carries the responsibility to safeguard these beliefs, while ensuring the execu tion of traditional practice over generations. Based on these criteria the rationalized definition cover ing all attributes of sacred groves is specified by the present author as 'a physically diverse patch of natural, primary forested enclosure of sacred trees and connected life-forms, revered by the endogamous clan for their supernatural association with religious or ominous attrib ute, or some alarming mythological anecdote, ascribed to a deity, devil or a demon who is strongly bond with the woods, which are conserved informally over generations to uphold these beliefs'. Sacred sites 'Sacred sites' are 'specific, discrete, narrowly delineated location on Federal land identified by a tribe, or individual determined to be an appropriately authoritative represen tative of the religion, as sacred by virtue of its established religious significance to, or ceremonial use by, the relig ion; provided that the tribe or appropriately authoritative representative of the religion has informed the concerned Government agency of its existence'.27 They constitute active centres of regular worship and religious rituals with symbolic and tangible elements that interlink man and divinity and witness centripetal influx of pilgrims for worship and offering prayers. The Himalayas in India are endowed with many such religious sites which devotees visit regularly for perform ing religious rituals and ceremonies. Among the most well-known sites are Vaishno Devi, Amarnath, Chandika Devi, Badrinath and Kedarnath in the Himalayas, Rameshwaram, Mahabalipuram, Bodh Gaya and Sarnath in other parts of India7 and the Buddha Lumbini in Nepal, all bearing a historical significance connected to the Hindu mythology. The venerated deity of sacred sites is inevitably a god or goddess, an angel or a prophet, whose idol or other form or symbolic artifact, is established in the temple monument with religious sentiments. Devils, demons or other forms of unnatural, weird creatures are never worshipped here. The venerated gods of the shrines may not be associated with the trees and woods at all. Many sacred temple forests in India are carefully man aged and contribute immensely in preserving the land scape with natural floral and faunal wealth, by virtue of their location in small pockets of hilly and mountainous areas often embedded and obscured by unapproachable, remote forest thickets. Such concealed sites are often left abandoned, unexplored and unnoticed in their inaccessi ble locations, falling outside human settlements and the forests in the vicinity of such sacred sites also enjoy un scathed natural conservation, sometimes to the same extent as the sacred groves. Many sacred sites are also endowed with primary vegetation and carve out a refuge for some rare tree species, such as the 'sweet osmanthus' (Osmanthus fragrans) tree in Chandak temple of Pithora garh in Kumaon Himalayas37. The degree of vegetational conservation and vicinity of religious shrine paves way to misinterpretation of such sacred sites as 'sacred groves'38. A meticulous appraisal of the typological criteria, coupled with the detailed scrutiny of the differentiating characters of the sacred groves and sacred sites, is therefore recom mended as a prerequisite for designating such enshrined forested patches, as sacred groves, to avoid conflicts aris ing out of such classifications. Conclusion Sacred groves and sacred sites are closely allied terms demarcated by very fine, but intelligible features. Divine powers are worshipped in both these sites, which are beli eved to be intimately and inextricably linked with forests and woods. Many such sacred/religious sites are embed ded in deep and dense forests where human encroach ments and interferences are negligible. The surrounding forests provide a sanctuary to important, sometimes vir gin flora having curious plant species which may have been left unexplored, unnoticed or neglected in these inaccessible locations. The merits of sacred sites are so closely allied to sacred groves that unless these sites are scrupulously investigated and scrutinized in-depth for detailed behavioural strategies adopted by the local clans and their religious tie-ups which help in the protection of the trees in and around the religious sites, these are liable to be misapprehended as sacred groves, thus opening way to debatable situations and chaotic inventory of sacred groves. It is therefore suggested that while designating sacred groves, the typological criteria must be strictly followed in adherence to the basic guidelines of differen tiating them from sacred sites. Once a sacred grove is typified or a sacred site is instituted, the same must be re ported and registered formally with the concerned Gov ernment agency for future development and sustainable utilization. 1.
