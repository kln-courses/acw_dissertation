<plain_text><page sequence="1">German Studies 655 MEDIEVAL LITERATURE By David A. Wells , Professor ofGerman at The Queen's University of Belfast 1. General Lexikon des Mittelalters, Munich, Artemis, commences the third of its seven vols with fascs 1-3 covering headings from Codex Wibaldi to Delia Faggiola. The most substantial articles published this year are very full accounts oiDdnemark and Dante Alighieri, while of specifically vernacular Ger. interest are the entries on Crescentialegende (K. Baasch), David von Augsburg (V. Mertens), and Contemptus mundi, where the useful surveys of literature relating to the concept in Latin and the individual vernacular languages include U. Schulze's article which, in spite of the absence of a single medieval Ger. terminological equivalent, draws together a variety of different threads. Under Corona T. Struve outlines the metaphorical application of the crown in the Ger. Empire, while of general background interest are Colores rhetorici, Comitatus, Concordantia caritatis, Corpus iuris canonici/civilis, Dach, DdmonenlDamonologie, and Datierung von Urkunden. Max Wehrli, Literatur im deutschen Mittelalter. Line poetologische Einfuhrung (UB, 8038), 358 pp., modestly claims not to be a systematic introduction, but in fact provides, in a beautifully concise format, an account of a wide range of the literary, rhetorical, historical, and philosophical problems fundamental to an understanding of medieval literature in general, not only in Germany. Prominent among the topics discussed against a background of immense erudition are the place of tradition, innovation, and discontinuity, the relationship of vernacular and Latin, oral and written poetry and performance, author and audi ence, beauty and ugliness, comedy and satire, verse and prose, numerology, allegory and typology. Metzler Liter atur Lexikon. Stichwdr ter zur Weltliteratur; ed. Giinther and Irmgard Schweikle, Stuttgart, Metzler, viii + 497 pp., is an admirably concise new literary encyclopedia in which one can browse with profit. The lemmata ? over 2,800 ? are classified in summary form in an appendix, and the book is particularly valuable for much basic information on metrical and rhetorical terminology. The editors have ensured that medieval and Renaissance terminology is represented much more fully than is usual in works of this kind. Epische Stoffe des Mittelalters, ed. Volker Mertens and Ulrich Mliller (KTA, 483), xii 4- 529 pp., is a highly successful small reference work on the major thematic constellations of the epic. In spite of its title the book is heavily slanted towards Ger. literature. An introductory chronological review (W. Haug) is</page><page sequence="2">656 German Studies followed by accounts of the biblical epic (D. Kartschoke), legendary matter (U. Wyss), other world visions and journeys (P. Dinzel bacher), Charlemagne, Roland, and William (M. Ott-Meimberg), Nibelungen and Kudrun (U. Schulze), Dietrich von Bern (J. Heinzle), OE heroic poetry (H. M. Heinrichs), the Icelandic saga (A. Heinrichs), chronicles and historical epic (N. H. Ott), allegorical literature (I. Glier), the beast epic (F. P. Knapp), Classical themes (A. Ebenbauer), Arthur (V. Mertens), the grail romances (D. Welz), Tristan (P. K. Stein), other romances of love and adventure (W. Rocke), the survival of medieval themes (U. Miiller), their iconogra phy (N. H. Ott), and a history of their interpretation (U. Peters). Horst Dieter Schlosser, dtv-Atlas zur deutschen Literatur. Tafeln und Texte (dtv, 3219), DTV, 1983, 305 pp. with 16 illus, is the apotheosis of the visual maps, charts, diagrams, and family trees beloved of some Ger. scholars. In vivid colours, accompanied by informative explanatory commentaries highlighting the major names, movements, and deve lopments, the Middle Ages receive at least their fair proportion of space. Conventional maps remain perhaps the most successful among these visual media, but vie with illustrations reminiscent of dart boards, underground railway plans, digestive tracts, planetary systems, and atomic, chemical, and economic diagrams. Deutsche Gedichte. Eine Anthologie, ed. Dietrich Bode, Stuttgart, Reclam, 368 pp., is a personal, chronologically arranged compact anthology of 290 poems by over 100 authors. The Middle Ages is represented by the Wessobrunn Prayer, Du hist min, and examples of the lyric of Kiirenberg, Morungen, Wolfram, Walther, and the Carmina Burana. So predigent eteliche. Beitrdge zur deutschen und niederlandischen Predigt im Mittelalter, ed. Kurt Otto Seidel (GAG, 378), 1982, 149 pp., includes G. C. Zieleman, 'Das Studium der deutschen und niederlandischen Predigten des Mittelalters', pp. 5-48; O. Langer on Meister Eckhart and the female mysticism of his time, pp. 49-96; and K. O. Seidel on a MLG MS of the St Georgen sermons in Bielefeld, pp. 97-150. K. Kirchert, ZD A, 113:61^-78, surveys the principles underlying medieval Ger. Bible translation, and the useful 'Bibliographic zur Wirkungsgeschichte der Bibel im deutschsprachigen Raum', comp. H. von Schade, VB, 6:321-61, includes sections on pre-Lutheran versions of the Bible in German. Walter Salmen, Der Spielmann im Mittelalter (Innsbrucker Beitrage zur Musikwissenschaft, 8), Innsbruck, Helbling, 1983, 238 pp. with illus. M. Curschmann, BGDSLT, 106:218-57, discusses problems relat ing to the transmission of MHG classical literature to the audience by oral means or by private reading, indicating that the book of M. G. Scholz (cf. YWMLS, 42:714) will have a profound influence on scholarship in this area. C. Schmid-Cadalbert, ABAG, 21:85-114,</page><page sequence="3">Medieval Literature 657 gives a wide-ranging review of the evidence for the relationship of oral tradition to written literature, concentrating on Latin and MHG historiography and the MHG Brautwerbungsdichtungen and emphasiz ing the coexistence of different forms. D. H. Green, FMLS, 20:289-308, equally stimulated by Scholz's book, favours an inter mediate mode of transmission in which the reciter delivers a work from a manuscript, to which literate members of the audience have independent access. Aus Glossenhandschriften des 8. bis 14. Jahrhunderts. Quellen zur Geschichte einer Uberlieferungsart, ed. Irmgard Frank (QDSL, 3), 170 pp., presents a selective range of glosses covering both OHG and MHG periods, designed both to serve as an introduction to the study of this field and to illustrate the sheer range of formal and thematic content. The material is classified in 15 sections including Old and New Testament, Bible commentary, sermons, theological, legal, historical, and medical texts, thematically arranged glosses, mixed glosses, and Latin grammar. The material is clearly set out; interlinear glosses appear in the same position as in the MS, only marginal glosses have been placed uniformly in the right-hand margin. Lemmata and glosses are distinguished with italic fount. There is sufficient critical editing, with text and apparatus on the same page, to make the collection easy to use, and F. fully justifies the decision to favour legibility in cases of doubt concerning the spacing of compound words: hence a tendency to give priority to the unity of a word. C. Lecouteux, EG, 39:227-50, starts to document the vocabul ary and characteristics of Gmc ghosts and phantoms. G. Roller, Germanistik in Erlangen, pp. 611-20, describes a computer-based method of normalizing medieval Ger. texts for lexicographical purposes. Das Weiterleben des Mittelalters in der deutschen Literatur, ed. James F. Poag and Gerhild Scholz-Williams, Konigstein, Athenaum, 1983, 217 pp., is a further volume of essays on the reception of the Middle Ages, including B. Becker-Cantarino on 'Frau Welt' and the 'femme fatale', J. Janota on the i6th-i8th cs, A. Schwarz on Gottfried, F. G. Gentry on the Nibelungenlied in the Weimar Republic, U. Miiller on Walther von der Vogelweide, J. F. Poag on Meister Eckhart and Sebastian Franck, and G. Scholz-Williams on the Middle Ages as viewed by the 15th c. V. Schupp, Freiburger Universi tdtsbldtter, 83:13-25, also writes on the survival of MHG poetry. U. Liebertz-Grun, Euphorion, 78:219-36, demands a history of medieval Ger. literature written by women, noting the poor showing of female writers compared with the Romance countries exemplified by Marie de France and Christine de Pisan. Wilson, Women Writers, includes J. Marchand, 'The Frankish mother: Dhuoda', pp. 1-29; K. M. Wilson on Hrotsvitha, pp. 30?63; K. Kraft on Hildegard of Bingen, pp. 109-30; and J. Howard on Mechthild of Magdeburg, pp. 153-85.</page><page sequence="4">658 German Studies M. Fries, FCS, 7, 1983:55-77, includes some general comment on medieval conceptions of the female. John A. Alford and Dennis P. Seniff, Literature and Law in the Middle Ages. A Bibliography of Scholarship, N.York-London, Garland, xvi 4 292 pp., is a well conceived and competently executed selective bibliography of 915 numbered entries, each accompanied by brief but informative notes on content. The classification is by languages, with general and Latin sections being followed by English, Ger., Icelandic, French and Provengal, Italian, and Hispanic. A short introduction surveys the highly significant points of contact between medieval literature and law since J. Grimm's 'Von der Poesie im Recht' of 1816, and emphasizes that the bibliography focuses on studies which 'use law as a vehicle for illuminating some aspect of the literary text'. Access to the material is facilitated by author and subject indexes. Ekkehard Kaufmann, Deutsches Recht. Die Grundlagen (Grundlagen der Germanistik, 27), Berlin, Schmidt, 193 pp., generally succeeds well in its aim of presenting the historical and cultural basis of Ger. law to those schooled in other disciplines, especially Germanists. The Middle Ages receive generous treatment in an account which concentrates on legal institutions, the historical surveys citing not only the obvious sources such as Eike von Repgow's Sachsenspiegel and the 'Weistiimer', but also examples from Reinhart Fuchs, Helmbrecht, Gottfried's Tristan, Wolfdietrich, Lohengrin, and other literary texts. Following Hans Fehr's distinction of 'Die Dichtung im Recht' from 'Das Recht in der Dichtung' there is an interesting chapter on proverbial, alliterative and other formulae. L. Denecke, ZDP, 103:118-25, publishes letters from K. Goedeke to J. Grimm, and J. Weissberg, ib., 438-48, writes on the Yiddish scholar Boris Borochow. Kurt Ruh, Kleine Schriften. 1. Dichtung des Hoch- undSpdtmittelalters. n. Scholastik und Mystik im Spdtmittelalter, ed. Volker Mertens, 2 vols, Berlin, de Gruyter, viii + 345, vi + 363 pp., is an admirably conceived Festschrift for the author's 70th birthday. With 42 essays dating from 1944 to 1983 the two volumes are a perfect reflection of R.'s activity. The first has a tripartite classification of work on the classical courtly period, the later Middle Ages, and six items on related topics on the Romance side. The second, containing almost half the titles, is exclusively devoted to late medieval mystic and scholastic prose literature. While each article has been completely reprinted so that the two volumes are typographically harmonious, places of first printing with the original pagination and page-divisions have been added, so that, if no updating has been undertaken, for practical purposes no recourse to the original sources is necessary for the reader who wishes to cite the material. Hugo Moser, Studien zur deutschen</page><page sequence="5">Medieval Literature 659 Dichtung des Mittelalters und der Romantik. Kleine Schriften, 11, Berlin, Schmidt, 294 pp., follows a first volume of linguistic essays with a collection of 17 literary articles dating from 1948 to 1979 and classified according to the problem of reality in classical MHG literature, problems of genre in MHG, the MHG lyric, the reception of the Middle Ages by the Romantics (Uhland, Simrock), and other work on the Romantic era. The first section includes a hitherto unpublished essay, 'Zauberring und Tarnmantel. Zum Problem der Eindimensionalitat und des Wunderbaren in mittelhochdeutschen Epen', pp. 43-53, in which M. considers the function of the magical elements in Iwein and the Nibelungenlied against the background of the 'Volksmarchen'. There is also a preface in which the author reviews his work and draws the threads together. Werner Schwarz, Beitrdge zur mittelalterlichen Literatur, ed. Peter Ganz and Timothy McFarland (APSL, 54), 104 pp., reprints six essays from the years 1947-73. The texts are photographic reproductions of the original printings, including the original pagination. All remain valuable contributions to scholarship in a range of fields, and the article 'Free will in Hartmann's Gregorius' (1968) exemplifies the cyclical nature of scholarship which in this area can be seen to have moved back to an acceptance of S.'s position. There are other collected essays this year, by Wolfgang Spiewok, Mittelalter-Studien (GAG, 400), 416 pp., and Bruno Stablein, Musik und Geschichte im Mittelalter. Gesammelte Aufsdtze, ed. Horst Brunner and Karlheinz Schlager (GAG, 344), xvi + 458 pp. Codicological publications of importance include Karin Schneider, Catalogus codicum manu scriptorum Bibliothecae Monacensis.

Ziegler, 'Lokalisierungsprobleme bei Text und Ausstattung spatmittelalterlicher deutscher Handschriften', pp. 179?94; and</page><page sequence="6">66o German Studies reports on projects for the computer assessment of medieval pictorial sources (E. Vavra, pp. 195-211) and for the cataloguing of manuscripts in Austria (G. Hayer, pp. 213-27). Of particular interest is the account by N. H. Ott of the Munich catalogue of medieval Ger. illustrated manuscripts (pp. 151-78). E. Stutz, 'Der Codex Palatinus germanicus 341 als literarisches Dokument', Bibliothek und Wissen schaft, 17, 1983:8-26. T. Brandis, 'Eine spate Minneredenhand schrift', Codices Manuscripti, 9, 1983:19-25. N. H. Ott, Literatur und Laienbildung..., pp. 356-86, discusses the illustrations of i5th-c. MSS in relation to their texts and subject-matter. Die Stockholmer Handschrift Cod. Holm. Vu 73 (Valentin vnde Namelos, De vorlorne sone, Flos vnde Blankeflos, Theophelus, cDie Buhlschaft aufdem Baume\ De deifvan brugghe, De segheler). Edition und Untersuchung einer mittelniederdeutschen Sam melhandschrift, ed. Loek Geeraedts (NdS, 32), 312 pp. + 14 pis, is a Miinster dissertation which edits a collective MS of c. 1480 forming one of the most significant sources of MLG literary monuments. Besides a brief account of its discovery by Sir George Webbe Dasent in the 1840s and detailed codicological description, G. introduces each of the seven disparate works contained in the collection and reviews the present state of research on each; their importance is seen to be independent of their place in the MS. Detailed linguistic analysis leads to the conclusion that it dates from the early 15th c. and perhaps derives from a HG original. G. rightly chooses a diplomatic edition in view of the existence of critical editions of individual works; comparison is aided by concordances of line-numbering. The prin ting is very clear and the work will be of service to both the codicologist and the literary scholar. OTHER WORKS Rudolf Wittkower, Allegorie und der Wandel der Symbole in Antike und Renaissance (DuMont-Taschenbucher, 142), Cologne, DuMont, 1983, 418 pp. with 250 illus, is a translation of W.'s Allegory and the Migration of Symbols (1977) but none the less welcome as a collection of 14 essays dating from 1937-38 to 1972 focusing on ideas and concepts which lent themselves to expression in the visual arts. Of particular interest to medievalists are the lengthy and richly illustrated chapters on marvels of the East and monstrous beings, while the book as a whole is replete with discussions of subjects such as time, Fortuna, the use of gesture, and many aspects of symbolism. Donat de Chapeaurouge, Einfuhrung in die Geschichte der christlichen Symbole, WBG, viii 4 160 pp. 4- 48 pis, is in a series of introductory works on art history, and in the introduction makes clear C.'s view that the existence of a symbol is dependent on the understanding of an audience, so that Christian</page><page sequence="7">Medieval Literature symbolism in art lasted from the 3rd to the early 19th c. and for the 20th c. needs explanation; and that meaning may vary according to the time, so that the existence of'eternal symbols' is denied. Besides supplying a series of useful, though inevitably selective, brief commentaries on about 75 symbols, the chronological thesis is demonstrated in practice through their classification into instances from the early Christian period, the high Middle Ages, and the late medieval and modern period. Mensura. Mafl, Zahl, Zahlensymbolik im Mittelalter, 11, ed. Albert Zimmermann and Gudrun Vuillemin-Diem (Miscellanea Mediaevalia, 16/11), Berlin, de Gruyter, viii 4 pp. 261-494 + 16 pis, concludes this impressive collection of essays on the theory of medieval number symbolism and its practical application, the latter being more in evidence in this volume than in the first (cf. YWMLS, 45:626). Of particular interest is W. Roll (356 76), who, taking full account of early attempts, looks afresh at the symmetrical proportions indicated by the 30-line sections in both Parzival and Willehalm. Elsewhere E. Gossmann discusses the use of measurement and number by Hildegard of Bingen (294-309), U. Ernst writes on the structural implications of Classical and early medieval number poems, culminating, naturally, in Hrabanus Maurus (310-32), J. Rathofer argues that the Golden Gospel Book of Heinrich III (1045-46) is constructed according to the numerological proportions which make it a mirror of the ordo salutis (333-55), W. Potters uses a similar approach to identify the Laura of Petrarch's love poetry as the letter symbolizing absolute philosophical truth (377?406), while H. de Vries contributes on Spanish poetry (407-34), G. F. Vescovini on the De motu octavae sphaerae of Petrus Aponensis (277-93), and both J. Gaus (435-54) and G. G. Wolf (476-83) on the symbolism of the circle, H. Kummerling detects an anthropomorphic basis to the symbolism of the church building following Apoc. 21. 16-17 (455-58), K.-J. Sachs explains the role of symbolic measurement in the proportions of certain musical instruments (459-75), and H. M. Nobis introduces the important and stimulating collection with an essay on 'ZeitmaB und Kosmos im Mittelalter' (261-76). Franz Carl Endres and Annemarie Schimmel, Das Myster ium der Zahl. Zahlensymbolik im Kulturvergleich, Cologne, Diederichs, 344 pp. with 8 pis and 101 illus, is a complete reworking of E.'s Die Zahl in Mystik und Glauben der Kulturvblker. Islamic tradition has now been given greater prominence beside Judaism, Christianity, and Classical civilization, but other Oriental, and Maya, conceptions have not been neglected. Particular importance has been given, as the bibliography shows, to the major work in the field of medieval numerology since V. F. Hopper's seminal study of 1938. B. Lorenz, LJb, 25:271-79, writes on the symbolism of the number 12. Dietmar</page><page sequence="8">662 German Studies Peil, Untersuchungen zur Staats- und Herrschaftsmetaphorik in literarischen Zeugnissen von der Antike bis zur Gegenwart (MMS, 50), 1983, xvi 4 942 pp. + 18 pis, is conceived as a contribution to the interdisciplin ary history of metaphor and owes much to the work of F. Ohly, by the nature of the subject going far beyond the usual bounds of medieval studies so that much of the imagery reviewed extends from Classical and biblical antiquity to the present. In contrast to more general work on the 'language of politics' or specialized analysis of specifically medieval 'state symbolism' P. tills a fruitful but neglected middle ground, identifying and deliberately restricting the material to a selective study of six particularly important fields of imagery: the shepherd and his flock, which with its associated metaphors of wolf, sheepdog, etc., remained potent from Ancient Near Eastern civiliza tion until the growth of 19th-c. democracy; the comparison of the state to the bee-hive, productive until the i8th-c. challenge to absolutism; commonest of all, the state anatomized an organic body comprising members and prone to sickness and remedy; the state as a machine, dating only from the 17th a; the state as a building, of undoubted antiquity though hitherto scarcely treated; and the much more familiar ship of state. The title of the work is somewhat compromised by the fact that P. is obliged ? necessarily ? to devote as much space to documentation from the major Western works of political theory as to creative literature as such, and the approach can never satisfy totally since readers from every discipline will be frustrated by omissions of familiar examples (e.g. Walther von der Vogelweide appears only in a single footnote, and MHG material is largely restricted to the postclassical didactic authors). Nevertheless, the sheer range of the volume makes it a treasure-chest of information. D. Gerhardt, VB, 6:155-90, documents the onomatopoeic and other qualities ascribed to the raven and other corvids, while H. Reinitzer, ib., 191-260, complements C. Gerhardt's work on the pelican with a wealth of examples. Joachim Knape, 'Historic3 im Mittelalter und fruher Neuzeit. Begriffs- und gattungsgeschichtliche Untersuchungen im interdis ziplinaren Kontext (Saecvla Spiritalia, 10), Baden-Baden, Koerner, 589 pp. with 49 pis, breaks new ground with a work which can be read as a semantic history of a Ger. term of great longevity, but which also ranges over a wide area of generic and historiographical problems and highlights the fundamental concept discussed against a broad cultural background. An extensive methodological and philosophical introduction leads into an essay on the sources, etymology and application of historia in medieval Latin culture, a necessary while self-contained prolegomenon to an account of the use of the Ger. word down to c. 1400; here the individual studies of, e.g., the MHG use of the term to denote a source (which does not neglect comparison with</page><page sequence="9">Medieval Literature 663 Fr. estoire) will be of lasting value, while there are substantial contributions to subjects as diverse as liturgical history and the Prose Lancelot problem. Of equal scope is the account of historie as a technical term in the I5th-i7thcs, where the printed word and woodcut, political, and religious change and developments in the natural sciences add further dimensions of complexity. J. Paul, 'Le manteau couvert d'etoiles de Pempereur Henri IF, Soleil..., pp. 261-91, points to an important area of theocratic symbolism. Memoria. Der geschichtliche Zeugniswert des liturgischen Gedenkens im Mittelalter, ed. Karl Schmid and Joachim Wollasch (MMS, 48), 786 pp. 4- 30 pis, contains the reworked and expanded texts of 19 contributions to a 1980 Miinster colloquium on liturgical comme moration as a historical source, many of them substantial mono graphs. F. Ohly, 'Bemerkungen eines Philologen zur Memoria' (9 68), introduces the collection by studying the theme of remembrance against the background of medieval tradition, in prayers, poets such as Otfrid, Hartmann, and Dante, the liber vitae and corporate commemoration, the personification of Memoria, remembrance after death in poetry and memorial, saints' lives, the Rolandslied, the introduction to Gottfried's Tristan prologue, Gahmuret's tomb in Parzival, the rhetorical tradition of ars memoriae, MHG sich verdenken, and numerous literary examples which form a context for the rest of the book. Other themes include the tradition of a church above a tomb (B. Kotting, 69-78); a very full review of the theology and liturgy of the commemoration of the dead (A. Augenendt, 79-199), and its historical perspective (G. Tellenbach, 200?14); the role of memoria in confraternities Q. Wollasch, 215-32), and their legal consequences (H. E. J. Cowdrey, 233-54); an account of the history and methods of research of medieval personal names (S. Sonderegger, 255-84); sepulchral art and its relationship to funeral and comme moration practice and liturgy (R. Kroos, 285-353); the memorials in Naumburg Cathedral (W. Sauerlander and J. Wollasch, 354-83), and memorial figures more generally as a link between the living and the dead (O. G. Oexle, 384-440); an encyclopedic survey, with copious bibliography, of the basic forms of calendars and annals (E. Freise, 441-577); commemorative foundations in St Gall records (M. Borgolte, 578-602), and the confraternity books of the Lake Const ance houses (J. Autenrieth, 603-12); the dating and location of office books for prime (J. Vezin, 613-24); the office of the chapter in the commemoration of the dead (J.-L. Lemaitre, 625-48); commemor ative practice among the rulers of the ioth-iithcs (G. Althoff, 649-65) and uth-i2thcs (K. Schmid, 666-726); the Cluniac necrological tradition (D. Poeck, 727-49); and, taking the subject beyond the medieval boundary, the design and building of Maximi</page><page sequence="10">664 German Studies lian I's empty tomb in Innsbruck (K. Schmid, 750-86). The only niggling defect in this magnificent volume is the lack of an index. Hiltgart L. Keller, Reclams Lexikon der Heiligen und der biblischen Gestalten. Legende und Darstellung in der bildenden Kunst, 5th revd ed., Stuttgart, Reclam, 655 pp., maintains its value with a range of additions and emendations. Much basic information is contained in a small space and, though the examples cited are chiefly iconographi cal, literary monuments are mentioned where appropriate. The glossaries of technical terms, names in different languages, etc., now augmented by explanatory diagrams of liturgical garments, are a welcome feature. Grqfie Mystiker. Leben und Wirken, ed. Gerhard Ruhbach and Josef Sudbrack, Munich, Beck, 400 pp., contains 20 short lives of famous Christian mystics by different authors, intro duced by S. who outlines the chief characteristics of mystical experience. While the contributions on Augustine (W. Wieland), Luther (R. Schwarz), various Eastern patristic and medieval authors, and the English I4th-c. mystics (W. Riehle), are of general back ground interest for the period, of central importance are the accounts of Bernard of Clairvaux (B. Schellenberger), Hildegard of Bingen (A. Fuhrkotter and J. Sudbrack), and Meister Eckhart (A. M. Haas). A series of later examples bring this admirably arranged collection into the 20th c; though introductory, it has full scholarly documentation. G. Pichon, MA, 90:331-56, surveys the Latin theological literature on leprosy. Rosalind and Christopher Brooke, Popular Religion in the Middle Ages. Western Europe 1000-1300, London, Thames &amp; Hudson, 176 pp. with 44 illus, is an admirably vivid introduction which convincingly brings together a mass of usually disparate material, though tending to neglect the significance of vernacular religious literature. Approaches to Nature in the Middle Ages. Papers of the Tenth Annual Conference of the Center for Medieval &amp; Early Renaissance Studies, ed. Lawrence D. Roberts (Medieval &amp; Renaissance Texts &amp; Studies, 16), Binghampton, N.York, [State Univ. of N.York at Binghampton], 1982, xiv 4- 220 pp., contains essays of general interest, each accompanied by a few pages of'comment' from a fellow-scholar: B. F. Huppe on nature in Beowuljand Roland (3-41), W. Wetherbee on the feminine aspects of Natura (47-62), D. Glass on visual illustration of the Creation, with 16 pis (67-104), R. A. Koch on the fleur-de-lis and lilium candidum, with 12 pis (109-30)^. A. Weisheipl on the concept of nature in Aristotle, Avicenna and Aquinas (137-60), and J. E. Murdoch on late medieval natural philosophy (171-213). Aristotle's Theory of Language and its Tradition. Texts from 500 to 1730, ed., transl., and comm. Hans Arens (Studies in the History of Linguistics, 29), Amsterdam-Philadelphia, Benjamins, vi 4 532 pp., is a well-planned</page><page sequence="11">Medieval Literature 665 collection of texts: the first four chapters of Aristotle's Peri hermeneias, crucial for the whole medieval conception of logic and the relationship between words and things, and the commentaries of eight later writers, including Boethius, Abelard, Albertus Magnus, and Aquinas, in English translation or paraphrase, each followed by A.'s own explanatory commentary. There is a great body of interesting material here, and, if the book is evidence of the limited knowledge of the Classical languages among linguists today, A. is careful in both texts and commentaries to indicate the use of technical terms in the original form. Wilhelm von Ockham, Kurze Zusammenfassung zu Aristoteles3 Buchern uber Naturphilosophic (Summulae in libros physicorum), [ed. and transl. Hans-Ulrich Wohler] (UBL, 1013), 1983, 328 pp., is a lucid modern Ger. translation of a seminal text. The 'Nachwort' sketches in the historical and philosophical background, the life of O., and the content and history of the text, which here follows the early printed edition of 1494. A brief section of notes and glossary conclude the volume. C. Meier, LiteraturundLaienbildung..., pp. 467-500, seeks to identify the chief structures of the genre of medieval encyclopedias. A. Karnein, Vortrdge... (Giessen), pp. 148-60, argues that the theoretical literature on love, in Latin, French, and Ger., lacks ? unlike the lyric traditon ? a conception of passionate love. Edith Ennen, Frauen im Mittelalter, Munich, Beck, 300 pp. 4- 24 pis, is a much better book than some recent works on medieval women ostensibly triggered off by the present-day feminist movement. E. emphasizes the complexity of the subject and its distortion when subjected to fashionable modern cliches, and in three substantial chapters spanning the early, high and late Midle Ages characterizes vividly the different roles of women in all ranks of society, the ecclesiastical and legal position of marriage, feminine piety, and political commitment. The section on women in the age of chivalry surveys the careers of the prominent French and Ger. women rulers and the patronage which encouraged the rise of courtly literature. E. is particularly successful in showing that many of the cliches about the depressed status of medieval women in fact reflect social changes dating only from the 15th c. Deutsche Volkssagen, ed. and comm. Leander Petzoldt, 2nd ed., Munich, Beck, 1978, xvi 4- 510 pp., is an extensive collection of 690 legends based on F. Ranke's sources (1910, 1924), based on I9th-c. and 20th-c. oral tradition but largely with a medieval basis. Although the text is intended for popular reading and is accompanied by a selection of early woodcuts, the very detailed commentary, occupying 133 pages, gives full documentation of the background and scholarly sources. Indexes of motifs and places facilitate access to what must be regarded as a major modern source of Ger. folklore.</page><page sequence="12">666 German Studies William R. Cook and Ronald B. Herzman, The Medieval World View. An Introduction, OUP, 1983, xxviii + 366 pp., is a remarkably successful introduction to the period which can be read with pleasure by every medievalist and recommended with confidence to the undergraduates for whom it is designed as perhaps the best available work of its kind. The first section, on the foundations of the Middle Ages, considers in turn the contents of the Bible and its medieval reception and interpretation, the Classical background, early Christ ianity, and Jerome and Augustine, all in terms of their importance for later attitudes. The second part, on the early Middle Ages, surveys the transition from Classical to medieval thought with well-chosen excerpts from the major writers, the monastic achievement, and the Carolingian Empire and its aftermath. Finally, the high Middle Ages are treated in equally good chapters on Church, state and society, the Twelfth Century Renaissance, and Francis of Assisi and the mendi cants. The illustrations are of poor quality, but this is not necessarily a disadvantage: they are carefully subordinated to the text and serve to illuminate rather than dominate it. A very fine achievement. Kaiser und Reich. Klassische Texte zur Verfassungsgeschichte des Heiligen Rbmischen Reiches Deutscher Nation vom Beginn des 12. Jahrhunderts bis zum Jahre 1S06, ed., introd., and transl. Arno Buschmann (dtv, 4384), DTV, 655 pp., is an extremely useful compendium of the 18 major sources which, in contrast to other such collections, supplies the relevant texts in full. This decisive advantage is purchased at the expense of Latin texts appearing only in Ger. translation, but sources are fully documented and substantial bibliographical introductions accompany each text. An introduction (pp. 9-56) reviews both the historical background and earlier collections of sources. Kaisergestalten des Mittelalters, ed. Helmut Beumann, Munich, Beck, 386 pp. with 15 illus, has biog raphies of 15 prominent Ger. Emperors by leading historians. B. intends the book not to mark a return to a conception of history as dominated solely by great men, but nevertheless to focus on one of the most important and fascinating perspectives on the period. B. himself writes on Otto I and Otto III; J. Fleckenstein on Charlemagne; J. Semmler on Louis the Pious; R. Schieffer on Henry III; H. Zimmermann on Henry IV; C. Servatius on Henry V; W. Petke on Lothar III; H. Appelt on Frederick I; W. Lammers on Frederick II; H. Boockmann on Henry VII; R. Schneider on Charles IV; H. Koller on Sigismund; R. Schmidt on Frederick III; and H. Wiesflecker on Maximilian I. Relevant literary monuments are not neglected, there is a basic bibliography of sources and monographs for each ruler, and index of persons. Bernhard Schimmelpfennig, Das Papsttum. Grund zuge seiner Geschichte von der Antike bis zur Renaissance (Grundziige, 56), WBG, x + 370 pp., is a straightforward and lucid short history, unusually objective for the subject-matter, and conceived as a</page><page sequence="13">Medieval Literature 667 chronological survey in 11 chapters from the earliest times to 1534. S. emphasizes the need to examine the relationship between the claims of the papacy and their real acceptance or otherwise, while social, political, liturgical, dogmatic, and constitutional aspects of the history all deserve treatment equally; relations with other rulers are regarded as less important than earlier works have suggested. In accordance with the pattern of this series, notes are replaced by a classified bibliography occupying 35 pages; there is a full list of popes and antipopes, and index. Das Heilige Land in Augenzeugenberichten. Aus Reiseberichten deutscher Pilger, Kaufleute und Abenteurer vom 10. bis zum 19. Jahrhundert, ed. Peter Gradenwitz (dtv, 2713), DTV, 265 pp., is a popularizing but nevertheless useful survey of the picture which emerges from the records of pilgrims and travellers. The chief medieval sources are documented in the opening chapter, and subsequent sections treat the population of the Holy Land, its religions and sects, flora and fauna, the perils of the journey, descriptions of Jerusalem, life in the country and, very briefly, references to pilgrimage songs. G. Theuerkauf, AKG, 65, 1983:89-116, considers topographical descriptions as sources for social history. Maurice Keen, Chivalry, New Haven ? London, Yale U.P., xii + 303 pp. 4- 55 illus, is an ambitious attempt to draw together the evidence for what is known of chivalry between c. 1100 and c. 1500 as a 'social influence of any significance'. After an introduction on the idea of chivalry, K. supplies successive chapters on the secular origins, the relationship to the Church and the Crusades, investiture ceremonies, the tournament, historical mytho logy, heraldry, the idea of nobility, arms, nobility and honour, the secular orders, pageantry, and chivalry and war. The book is notable for its combination of a highly readable style with constant references to historical and literary sources, although the Chanson de Roland and Chretien's works receive considerably greater attention than Wolf ram, while Gottfried is mentioned only en passant and the Rolandslied and Hartmann not at all; this reflects the scant treatment of conditions peculiar to Germany, apart from a derivative discussion of the ministeriales, etc. Nevertheless, this is a fascinating work which combines a wealth of material from the high and later Middle Ages into a cohesive framework, while K.'s thesis, that earlier literature has tended to exaggerate both the Christian orientation of early chivalry and its later secular decline, convinces not least because it is so unobtrusively argued. The illustrations are excellent. Ernst Cordt, Die Gilden: Ursprung und Wesen (GAG, 407), 222 pp. 2.

S. writes lucidly and discusses in turn the general nature of palaeolithic culture, the various ceramic cultures, the Bronze Age, Hallstatt culture, the Celts, and a concluding chapter 'Northern Genesis' which links the foregoing directly to the early Gmc tribes, Tacitus, and the coexistence and conflict with Rome, including the linguistic evidence. The book gives an excellent general impression of the subject but would have been improved by better indexing of the admirable collection of illustrated matter. R. Nedoma, Collinder Vol., pp. 339-40, discusses the inscrip tion on the Meldorf fibula. Ulf Diederichs, Germanische Gbtterlehre. Herausgegeben und mit mythologischem Wbrterbuch versehen, Cologne, Diederichs, 288 pp., contains a brief introduction on the Eddie sources of knowledge about the pagan Norse religion, the 16 relevant songs from the Poetic Edda in Felix Genzmer's recently reprinted, archaizing translation, and the narrative passages from Snorri's Prose Edda in Gustav Neckel's translation. This is followed, pp. 201-86, by a 'mythological dictionary' of names and themes, full of cross references and serving above all to locate the chief figures and myths and to compare Snorri's material with the poetic corpus. Work on runology includes Ulrich Hunger, Die Runenkunde im Dritten Reich. Ein Beitrag zur Wissenschafts- und Ideologiegeschichte des Nationalsozialismus (EH, m, 227), 508 pp.; H.

The corrigenda and addenda to earlier volumes, by both authors, are considerable, but do not detract from an achievement combining impressively detailed scholarship with legibility. Thomas Burns, A History of the Ostrogoths, Indiana U.P., xx + 299 pp., is a more general treatment than his earlier monograph (cf. YWMLS, 42: 706 f.) but no less excellent.

Making use of recent archaeological work besides the traditional literary sources, B. argues that the conventional view of Theodoric as the only significant Ostrogothic figure and the upholder of Roman civilization is an over-simplification.

Mit 44 Abbildungen (SA, 4), 116 pp., continues this important new series which, under the auspices of the Gottingen Academy of Sciences, marks a veritable revival of OHG studies. The reverse dictionary in question is part of R. Schutzeichel's OHG dictionary project in Miinster, but the second half of this book consists of a semi-independent monograph by M. Schlaefer on the history and methods of lexicographical recording of morphological forms, vividly illustrated by visual examples of earlier efforts to grapple with the problems posed by suffixes and derivatives. All this is abundant justification for the principle of reverse indexes, already familiar in the MHG field from the work of R. A. Wisbey and others. In the first half of the book the morphological content of Schutz eichel's dictionary is surveyed against the background of its general structure, the scope of the proposed reverse dictionary is outlined, and the particular problems arising from the* recording of OHG morphological data by this means are discussed, with specimens of proposed solutions. Eckhard Meineke, Bernstein im Althochdeutschen. Mit Untersuchungen zum Glossar Rb (SA, 6), 246 pp., is a study of considerable semantic importance from the same school. M. takes issue with the received opinion, handed on in the tradition of the OHG dictionaries, that the words agatstein, brennstain/burnsteyn, fernis, Jliod, gler, glas, and gismelzi signify 'amber', thus reinforcing views on the cultural significance of the amber trade. The first section of the monograph is a methodical and exhaustive study of the evidence of the glosses, with reference to Tacitus and other Classical documenta tion where necessary. The results are dramatic: only fernis and brennstain may on occasion denote amber, and the latter term dates from long after the OHG period. Hence the emphasis shifts to the development of the trade in Baltic amber under the Teutonic Order in the late Middle Ages. A particular problem is posed by the Reichenau Rb with the gloss electri clases, where the unsolved question of the relative independence of the biblical glossary leads to a detailed study of the MS in the second part of the work. Here it is shown conclusively that there must have existed both an original contextual gloss on the biblical material in question, and an intermediate stage, thus</page><page sequence="16">670 German Studies revealing Rb as the second largest glossary to date back to the 8th c.

(ATB, 4), xxxii + 294 pp., places the standard edition in the hands of a new editor with the first reissue since 1965. While little substantial alteration has been made to text, apparatus and vocabulary, the appearance of the text has been greatly improved in a new layout, the new Straubing fragment S has been incorporated, and the whole introductory section has been rewritten, the ballast of bibliographical references being dumped in favour of a return to a fundamental account of the principles of the edition and its chief problems. The new edition forms the basis oiDer Heliand. Studienausgabe in Auswahl, ed. Burkhard Taeger (ATB, 95), xiv + 86 pp., a selection of excerpts which fills a glaring lacuna.

Only obvious spelling errors have been corrected, dubious forms are included, and homographs eliminated from the final text. The value of this type of reference list in the hands of an imaginative user has already established itself through the medium of concord ances to individual MHG works, to which reverse indexes have proved welcome additions. The present work was produced at the Hamburg University Computer Centre. D. M.

A cautious balance is struck between the necessary parading of established facts for the student market and the attempt to impose an individual vision upon a particularly complex period. The approach is sociological to the</page><page sequence="18">672 German Studies extent that the vernacular was seen to reach out to specific groups and institutions; H. however rejects the abstract theorizing ? and the jargon ? of some recent work. The first half of the book is organized in two sections entitled 'Modelle literarischer Interessenbildung', in which are discussed two sequences of literary examples of a variety of genres, the first illustrating the literary response to changing political circumstances in different areas of the Empire, and the second, the response to new forms of piety, an account of the religious literature mainly of the Franciscans being followed by a chapter on Mechthild von Magdeburg as representative of the mystics. Works not featuring in the first half are treated in the second, 'Die literarischen Formen', a more orthodox sequence of examples conforming to the major genres, culminating in the rise of the prose romance. The deficiencies of the approach ? the virtual absence of value judgements and the sometimes tenuous links between literature and historical exposition ? are abundantly compensated by H.'s lucid, concise style and the successful arrangement of the material into a coherently structured pattern. Eckart Conrad Lutz, Rhetorica divina. Mittelhochdeutsche Pro loggebete unddie rhetorische Kulturdes Mittelalters (QFSK, n.F., 82 (206)), xii + 420 pp., is an ambitious Freiburg dissertation which reflects the florescence of interest in rhetoric in the past two decades. By postulating the existence of a 'rhetorical culture' in the high Middle Ages, the history and composition of which are argued in the whole of the first half of the work, L. proceeds to re-examine major examples of the selected rhetorical model, the emperor's prayer in Rudolf von Ems's Der guote Gerhart, the prologues to his Barlaam und Josaphat and Weltchronik, and the prologue to Wolfram's Willehalm, in terms of the tradition established. The accounts of the reception of Classical rhetoric, ars dictandi, arspoetriae, and ars praedicandi range over a host of examples and culminate in a survey of Latin and vernacular religious prologues before Wolfram. An analysis of the typology and rhetorical structure of literary prayers shows that William of Auvergne was not the first to understand the existence of such a structure in his Rhetorica Divina of c. 1240. If previous approaches to the alleged unique status of Wolfram's text and the 'epigonal' dependence of Rudolf are too readily dismissed as outmoded, L. undoubtedly succeeds in placing many of the rhetorical themes and structures of W. and R. in a new light, and especially in the case of Willehalm brings new material to the debate. B. Haupt, WW, 34:159-68, discusses the communicative function of MHG prologues, and J. A. Schultz, Speculum, 59:1-15, argues that the French and Ger. vernacular poets rapidly developed prologue traditions independent of those of established Classical rhetoric.

The author succeeds remarkably well in combining introductory material for the general reader, constant reference to the established tradition of scholarship, and an original line of interpretation. A review of the contemporary cultural background leads into an account of the chief characters, to the traditional primacy of Kriemhilt being added her 'tendency to absolutize' yielding fruitful interpretative insights in the subsequent chapters which concentrate on the power structure and the style of the work. The mythological features are convincingly integrated into a coherent overall view which focuses on the primitive, non-courtly, 'otherworld' realm from which Briinhilt originates and to which the Burgundians pass upon crossing the Danube. There are also brief accounts of the historical reception of the epic in Germany, the Norse tradition, and prosody. O.

THE COURTLY ROMANCE Edmund Reiss, Louise Horner Reiss, and Beverly Taylor, Arthurian Legend and Literature. An Annotated Bibliography. 1. The Middle Ages, N.York-London, Garland, xviii 4- 467 pp., is an imaginatively organized and partly annotated bibliography which can fairly claim to be the first substantial catalogue of Arthurian material in general since Loomis's Arthurian Literature in the Middle Ages (1959). More than 10,000 items from the early 19th c. to 1982 have been examined and 3,074 chosen and arranged according to subject in 12 large sections. To avoid imbalance the authors have deliberately concentrated on scholarship appearing since the last-published author bibliographies in the case of Chretien, Wolfram, Gottfried, Malory, and Sir Gawain, and have largely ignored biographical, metrical, or narrowly philo logical studies. While the classification and selection will plainly fail to satisfy every user ? for example, the section 'Non-Arthurian works using Arthurian elements' has defined this useful topic quite nar rowly: what about almost all of MHG heroic literature? ? the book will prove an invaluable guide through the forest of more recent work, and will also please the browser, particularly in the lesser-known pastures. The indexes include a classification of works by language, Arthurian writers and works, subjects, and scholars and critics. A second volume is awaited with interest. The Romance of Arthur, ed. James J. Wilhelm and Laila Zamuelis Gross, N.York-London, viii + 314 pp., is an anthology of major texts in translation clearly aimed at a popular English-speaking audience, and covering the whole time span from 450 to 1485. The editors state that they 'polled a number of scholars' and the replies led to the inclusion in their entirety of Chretien's Lancelot and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and passages from Malory. There are also excerpts from the Alliterative Morte Arthure and from Geoffrey of Monmouth, Culhwch and Olwen, and introduc tory essays, with quotations, on Arthur in the Latin chronicles (J. J. Wilhelm) and in early Welsh tradition (J. K. Bollard) respectively. New translations of much of this material are welcome and, while the volume succeeds on its own terms, one can only regret that space did not permit any representative of the Tristan and Perceval cycles.

Die hochmittelalterliche Glaubenskrise im Spiegel der Literatur (Monographien zur Geschichte des Mittelalters, 28), 2 vols, Stuttgart, Hiersemann, 1983, xxvi 4- 1-387, 388-613 pp., parades in full his thesis that the chief poets of the classical MHG period were using an 'allegorical' code to expound the doctrines of the Cathars and Waldensians. D. Welz, 'Gedanken zur Genese des Gralromans', AGJSG, 15, 1982:7-15^. Schnell, Noomen Vol., pp. 225-38, mentions</page><page sequence="22">676 German Studies several MHG romances in a demonstration that the theme of marriage for love with the bride's consent is intended as a corrective to social reality, and X. von Ertzdorff, Vortrage... (Giessen), pp. 99-110, considers the theme of love and adultery in the Prosa Lancelot, making comparisons with the Tristan tradition, while H.

H.v.A., Derarme Heinrich, ed. Hermann Paul. 15th revd ed., ed. Gesa Bonath (ATB, 3), xxii 4- 58 pp., places a new editor at the helm in succession to L. Wolff. A totally rewritten introduction takes account of the most recent textual discoveries and also illustrates vividly the wholly different approach of Leitzmann and Wolff in contrast to the conservatism of Paul, a return to which, as B. explains, is more in keeping with modern taste. In practice, however, the changes from the last edition of 1972 are carefully selected and mark closer</page><page sequence="23">Medieval Literature 677 adherence to A as the Leithandschrift only in specific areas. J. A. Asher, Fest. Grosse, pp. 313-23, identifies and analyses ten examples of thematic repetition in A.H., and B.

Tiroler Mittelalter... complements a volume on the Runkelstein murals (see YWMLS, 45:633) with the remaining papers delivered at a 1979 colloquium, the background to which is fully documented. V.

Studien zu Wolframs 'ParzivaV, Heidelberg, Winter, 1983, 329 pp., interprets P. against the back ground of recent theory emphasizing the need for a perspective on the social and cultural purpose of literary works in their historical context. Though B. has adopted some of the tortuous jargon characteristic of those who see literature as a 'communication medium' of partisan political views, the Diisseldorf dissertation, from the school of Gert Kaiser, is redeemed by its lack of abstract theorizing. From the lengthy opening section on the Prologue by way of an account of W.'s attitude to the tradition of poets such as Chretien and Gottfried, and thence through the major episodes of the work, B. argues that the relatively conservative W. deviates from the established identification with the Arthurian ideal to propagate his conception of a true hereditary nobility in which family and genealogy outweigh the importance of the court. The restoration of the true feudal values of the aristocratic family community is seen to inform all major episodes of the work and even the appeal to Kyot. Reference to a range of other works gives this interesting thesis a context. Marianne Wynn, Wolfram's Parzival. On the Genesis of its Poetry (Mikrokosmos, 9), Berne, Lang, viii 4- 375 pp., is a lucid critical study of aspects of P, particularly the 'poet's audience, his hero, and his reality' which produce a work of a totally different order from W.'s chief source. Integrated into the book are the author's well-known accounts of scenery and chivalrous journeys, geography, and P. and Gawan as hero and counterpart. An initial chapter places P. in its</page><page sequence="24">678 German Studies historical and social context and ranges over the evidence for knowledge about the poet and his audience, a task justified by the author's wide reading in much recent literature and her due caution in matters which remain speculative. The most substantial new material, however, is a cogently structured analysis of Book ix, identified as the heart of the work where W. departs most radically from Chretien. A final chapter concerns W.'s motivation of his regeneration of the work through his account of P.'s parents. H. Zutt, Fest. Grosse, pp. 451-66, selects four passages from P. to illustrate W.'s peculiar stylistic difficulties, and L. Boigs, ZD A, 113:8-16, considers P. 261 against the hypothesis that W. revised the text, while H. Brunner, Germanistik in Erlangen, pp. 61-73, attempts to identify in general terms various spheres of chivalric activity and their mutual relationships, and S. Christoph, ABAG, 21:115-29, studies the instances in P. and Willehalm in which a knight is mistaken for a merchant and their social implications. J. T. Greenfield, RFLUP, 2, no. 1:195-208, discusses the particular problem oiminne for the grail family, and A. Ebenbauer, ZD A, 113:16-42, considers the attitudes displayed towards the blackness of Belakane and the moors in P. and many other MHG works, while M.B. Bindschedler, SchM, 64:729-43, looks at Gawan's role as a healer, and A.-S. Matthias, GRM, 65:29-43, shows that the account of the trial and conviction of Urjans for rape in Book x follows authentic legal procedure. H.-W. Schafer, ZDP, 103:370-77, summarizes his views (cf. YWMLS, 45:639-40) of the value of Spanish archaeological evidence for identifying W.'s grail as the San Juan de la Pena chalice now in Valencia Cathedral; but S.'s argument is demolished by P. Kunitzsch, ZD A, 113: 79-111, in the course of a documentation of the Oriental topography of P. The characteristics of W.'s grail are also analysed by J. Delcourt-Angelique, Colloque... (Bruges), pp. 89-105, who associates it with the lapidis jaspidis of Apoc. 4.3, and J. Maczewski, Seminar, 20:1-26, points to the close linguistic and symbolic connections between the account of the grail procession and the episodes immediately preceding it in Book v. E. Schmid, Germa nistik in Ertangen, pp. 75-93, writes interestingly on the Prester John legend and its relevance for P. and other works, and M. Wynn, AKG, 65, 1983:431-49, supplies a Ger. version of an article on P. and Wagner (cf. YWMLS, 45:777). Josef Domes, Untersuchungen zur Sprache der Kolner iWillehalm&gt; Handschrift K (Hist. Arch. d. Stadt, W357) (GAG, 416), xii 4 341 pp. W.v.E., Willehalm, transl. Marion E. Gibbs and Sidney M.Johnson, Harmondsworth, Penguin, 311pp., is a welcome addition to the Penguin Classics translations of MHG works, though appearing not long after the rendering of C.E. Passage (cf. YWMLS, 39:620). The</page><page sequence="25">Medieval Literature 679 language of this new version is rather more mundane than that of P., and the introductory material concentrates on 'characters' and the problems familiar from recent scholarship which are well summa rized. Charles E. Passage, Wolfram of Eschenbach. Titurel. Translation and Studies, N.York, Ungar, x 4- 220 pp., has much in common with P.'s treatment of Willehalm, and achieves the same successful combination of originality of insight and presentation of the work to a wider audience. P. introduces, analyses, and translates the text, and follows with chapters on the Jungerer Titurel, the sources of the Schionatulander story, the title talfin, the Angevin and Iberian associations, and a dictionary of 57 proper names. W. Schroder, Stutz Vol., pp. 398-407, discusses Whm, 10,18-20, also 162,14-15, and shows from the use of mort and riterschaft elsewhere that there can be no question of W. attacking chivalry in general as murderous; rather he refers to a single especially bloody battle. K. Stackmann, ib., pp. 462-68, interprets Whm 68,18, translating unschuldeclich vergiht as 'Schuldlosigkeit bewirkende Beichte'. GOTTFRIED VON STRASSBURG Hans Unterreitmeier, Tristan als Retter (Centro Internazionale di Studi di Filosofia della Religione. Saggi, 13), Perugia, Benucci, 274 pp., returns to a reductive, mythological approach, to which the first quarter of the text is an extensive introduction. The T. legend is seen not as 'a myth', but as 'mythical': the reader becomes bogged down in Celtic analogues and a survey of countless definitions of myth and archetype. Against this background U. seeks to identify the chief features of T. as the 'Heilbringer' in both Eilhart and G., though with greater differentiation in the latter's work, a more detailed analysis of which in the light of this theme occupies pp. 87-233. The conclusion dwells on the sacramental aspects of the hero's function as saviour, its inherent ambivalences and limitations, and the extension of the theme to the audience. The essentials of this study could probably have been conveyed in less space, while the theme could be shown to be of equal importance in the portrayal of other romance heroes. X. von Ertzdorff, Vortrage... (Giessen), pp. 88-98, sees, with Denis de Rougemont, the theme of love and adultery in T. as inevitably culminating in the death of the lovers, and R. Miiller, Amour..., pp. 195-201, takes a balanced view of G.'s attitude to love and marriage as a critical, but not revolutionary, comment on a defective courtly ideology, while S. E. Knopp, ColGer, 16, 1983:131-47, emphasizes G.'s deliberate use of ambiguity and contradiction, and H. Heinze, Euphorion, 78:82-91, detects a Christian, if pessimistic, ethos at the heart of T.

Arabel und Willehalm auf west-bstlichem Divan (Akad. der Wiss. und der Lit., Mainz. Abh. der geistes- und sozialwiss.

Here S. supplies a synoptic text of U.'s original and the redaction of the vitally important section of the work from Tybalt's departure to assist Terramer to Arabel's flight with Willehalm. The brief introduction points to the crucial themes of the courtly conception of the hero and</page><page sequence="27">Medieval Literature the lack of concern for the adultery in U. which caused modifications in the recension. S. studies the textual disparities, illustrations, another (mixed) redaction, and what he terms the 'Divan-Gesprache' of Arabel and Willehalm. All this obliquely illuminates Wolfram. WS VIII is largely devoted to the Jungerer Titurel, with an introduction (8 10) and account of textual problems (34-48) by W. Schroder, and studies by H. Fromm (an admirable introduction to the work and the problem of its author 'Albrecht', n-33); W. Roll (sources of the vocabulary, 49-66, and the parallels in Berthold von Regensburg, 67-93); K. Zatloukal (the personal and topographical names, 94 106); D. Hirschberg (the discussion of the nature of true love, 107 19); K. Nyholm (A.'s relationship to his audience/readers, 120-37); P. Kern (A.'s patron and his Wolfram role, 138-52); and D. Huschenbett (the historical position of the postclassical work, 153 68, and a bibliography, 169-76). Fundamental problems of the J.T. are also the subject of U. Wyss, Germanistik in Erlangen, pp. 95-113. The role of Arthur and the grail in Lohengrin are discussed by D. Goulet, MA, 90:39-63, and H.-H. Steinhoff, ZD A, 113:242-45 4 1 pi., describes a new fragment of Manuel und Amande, while H.

Ebenbauer, Stutz Vol., pp. 151-66, points to the change in attitudes to history c. 1300 in several later romances. T.

Von denAnfangen der Uberlieferung bis zum i$.Jahrhundert. Nach dem Plan Hugo Stopps, ed. Sabine Freund (QDSL, 2), 1983, 300 pp., fulfils H. Stopp's plan for a full diplomatic edition of the whole tradition of the alba in MHG to the end of the Middle Ages, intended to serve as a firm basis for the study of the genre. The first hundred pages of the text are occupied by 34 anonymous songs from all periods, arranged alphabetically according to their first lines; the</page><page sequence="28">682 German Studies attributed songs follow, in alphabetical order of authors. For each text the complete MS transmission is reproduced, using facsimiles or photocopies of the original MSS. This is a most useful collection which in range and accuracy makes its predecessors redundant. Owe do tagte ez: Tagelieder und motivverwandte Texte des Mittelalters und der fruhen Neuzeit, ed. Renate Hausner. i (GAG, 204), 1983, 1 + 276 pp. H. Brunner, Tiroler Mittelalter..., pp. 45-51, edits a lyric fragment once legible on a wall at Runkelstein, and G. Steer, ib., pp. 183-207, seeks to associate the famous illustration at the beginning of the Carmina Burana MS elm 4660 with the positive and stable concept of fortuna caesarea found in Friedrich IPs writings, while W. Lipphardt, ib., pp. 209-23, counters S.'s thesis, favouring B. Bischoff's view that the MS originated in Seckau rather than South Tyrol. B. Wachinger, Bauml, Symbol, pp. 1-34, writes on the Ger. strophes in the Carmina Burana, and other, general topics include F. C. Tubach, ib., pp. 190-207, on the social ritual implied in the lyric, and H. Lomnitzer, Vortrdge... (Giessen), pp. 111-24, on the married or other status of the beloved. Roswitha Wisniewski, Kreuzzugsdichtung. Ideali tdt in der Wirklichkeit (IF, 44), vi + 172 pp., follows a potted history of the Crusades with allusions to Christian-Moslem polemic and to the Koran, on the basis of which it is claimed that not only the 'crusading lyric' as traditionally understood but also a range of other lyric works were explicitly conceived as anti-Moslem propaganda, asserting Christian truths against the infidel. The thesis is, for this reader, unconvincing. The attempt to apply it to the Ezzolied and Summa Theologiae rests solely on the argument that these works contained statements of Christian theology denied by Islam, ignoring the fact that the theology of, e.g., the ?.7". has been shown by H. Freytag to follow traditions antedating Islam by centuries. The concentration on the Virgin Mary in the Vorauer Marienlob and Melker Marienlied is supposed to reflect the undervaluing of the feminine in Islam, W. even speculating that the adoration of the lady in the Minnesang was a reaction against the male superiority expressed in the Koran. Little account is taken of previous scholarship and, apart from general references to Peter of Cluny, the external evidence of anti-Moslem polemic all postdates the MHG classical period, W. cutting herself off from a substantial body of evidence by excluding work on the background to epics such as the Exodus, Rolandslied, and Willehalm. W. E.Jackson, SMC, 15, 1981147-94, surveys the Frauenlied in detail. H. B. Willson, 831469-81, interprets Kurenberg, 10,9, 9,21, and 10,17, as implying courtship with a view to marriage. Friedrich von Hausen, Lieder. Mittelhochdeutsch/Neuhochdeutsch. Text, Ubersetzung, Kommentar, ed. Giinther Schweikle (UB, 8023), J84pp., shows considerable changes compared to S.'s edition of 1977 (YWMLS,</page><page sequence="29">Medieval Literature 683 39:619). The text now follows, wherever possible, MS B rather than C, the introduction has been greatly expanded and, as in other Reclam texts, covers an impressive body of material in concise format. Commentary and translations have been fully revised. Other work on poets in MF includes E. von Reusner, ZDP, 103:366-70 (Morungen XXII); A. H. Touber, ZDA, 113:1-8 (doubting the place of Engelhart von Adelnburg among the early poets); F. Goldin, SMC, 16:57-92 (the language of the Reinmar-Walther feud); E. von Reusner, GRM, 65:8-28 (classification and chronology of Hart mann's lyrics); H. Heinen, SMC, 15, 1981:95-110 (the woman's role in H.'s songs); and H. Kokott, AGJSG, 16, 1983:25-41 (a Freudian interpretation of the watchman in Wolfram). Walther von der Vogelweide, In dieser Welt gehVs wundersam. Die Gedichte. Texte, Versubertragung und Gedichtfolge nach der Ausgabe von Hubert Witt, introd. Ursula Schulze, Munich, Winkler, xlvi 4- 358 pp. 4- 17 pis, turns out to be a reissue for the West German market of H. Witt's unusual juxtaposition of diplomatic print of the songs from MS C with his modern verse renderings (cf. YWMLS, 41: 713). S. supplies a greatly improved introduction which reviews the Romantic and I9th-c. reception of W., historical background and contemporary references, his status and profession and the various forms and themes of his work. Also on W.: A. Hruby, Bauml, Symbol, pp. 118-49 (his conception of love related to the text-critical tradition); O. Briickl, AGJSG, 16, 1983:43-58 (39,11); S. L. Clark, Bauml, Symbol, pp. 69-91 (the 'bilde' of 66,21); A. Groos, ib., pp. 92-117 (the two versions of 72,31); H. Rupp, Fest. Grosse, pp. 427-32 (the order of strophes in 112,35); and M. Nix, GRM, 65:278-94 (the Ottenton strophes and the Crusade). Jutta Goheen, Mittelalterliche Liebeslyrik von Neidhart von Reuental bis zu Oswald von Wolkenstein. Fine Stilkritik (PSQ, no), 220 pp., is the most detailed study of the later lyric for some time ? though G. rejects such chronological terms with their connotations of decadence and Epigonentum. The conception of'style' is extremely broad, and G. supplies an intelligent and detailed analysis of the treatment of three major themes, nature, and its imagery, the heart, and the lady. Not only does G. choose a good range of poets from the period, but does not hesitate to cast a wide net where the subject-matter seems to demand it: thus, while representation of nature is illuminated by reference to the Carmina Burana, the discussion of the qualities associated with the heart draws on both religious poetic and prose texts for comparison, and exploits Jungian concepts such as the anima to illuminate what is regarded as medieval psychological exploration. If G. succeeds admirably in highlighting the complexity and variety of the lyric of the 13th-! 5th cs, the question of its aesthetic value in</page><page sequence="30">684 German Studies relation to the masters of DMF nevertheless remains. I. Glier, Bauml, Symbol, pp. 150-68, characterizes the changing roles, situations, and concepts of the postclassical lyric. Die Lieder Neidharts, ed.

Besides correcting textual errors J. has expanded the bibliography, previously restricted to Der Weinschwelg, to a five-page selection of titles related to all five texts in this volume. Also on Strieker: M. Resler, Euphorion, 78:17-30 (dating of Daniel)] E. Miiller-Ukena, ZDP, 103: 27-51 (interpretation of Artus in Daniel); X. von Ertzdorff, Fest.

Piitz, Tiroler Mittelalter..., pp. 29-44, attacks the view that Der Pleier's Gdrel was intended as polemic against Strieker's Daniel, and the heroic epic as a source for Gdrel is the subject of G. Zimmermann, ZD A, 113:42-60. Der Reinhart Fuchs des Elsdssers Heinrich, ed. Klaus Diiwel, Katharina von Goetz, Frank Henrichvark and Sigrid Krause (ATB, 96), xliv + 145 pp., marks a new departure in editions of Heinrich der Glichezaere's work with a move from the Heidelberg MS P used since J. Grimm to MS K, fully argued in the introduction. Like other recent additions to the ATB series, D. also supplies literary material with information on sources, with a synopsis of the relationship to the Roman de Renart and discussions of some of the names and places in the text and its legal associations. The text, edited according to modern principles, forms an authoritative addition to the series, but recom mends itself only to specialist use. Recent publications on the beast epic are reviewed by K. Grubmuller, BGDSLT, 106: 258-68, while in Actes... (Evreux), there are articles on the current state of Reinhart Fuchs scholarship (K. Diiwel, 197-213), the genre of the beast epic (P. Wackers, 687-99), tne LG version of Aesop by Gerhard von Minden (J.-M.

In Stutz Vol., pp. 131-50, K. Diiwel studies the hunt in Reinhart Fuchs, various aspects of which are treated by J. Erben, Fest. Grosse, pp. 355-69. There is a section on the R.F. in a discussion of rape in the beast epic by K. Varty and D. Buschinger, Amour..., pp. 411-24, while S. S. Robertson, RCEN, 4, 1983, no. 1:63-68, characterizes the greedy, gullible and vicious humans in the genre, and F. Wagner, ib., 77?90, relates Goethe's Reineke Fuchs to the medieval sources. K. Berg and N. Kruse, Hbtzer Vol., pp. 9-11, edit and translate the i3th-c. 'Weingartener Ausfahrtssegen', W. Frey, Stutz Vol., pp. 176-95, links the didacticism of the Winsbecke with the social background, and Helmbrecht is discussed by J. Le Goff, Melanges Zink, pp. 123-41 (dreams), and S. Hartmann, ib., pp. 143-59 (bird symbolism). Konrad von Haslau, Der Jungling. Nach der Heidelberger Hs. Cpg. 341 mit den Lesarten der Leipziger Hs. 946 und der Kalocsaer Hs. (Cod. Bodmer 72), ed. Walter Tauber (ATB, 97), xxii + 78 pp., is the first new edition of this 1,264-line didactic work since that of Moritz Haupt (1851). T. similarly uses the Heidelberg MS as his textual basis, but, unlike his predecessor, had direct access to the original, and takes account of both the Leipzig and neglected Kalocsa MSS. Besides the textual background the introduction also briefly considers the reference to the work in Seifried Helbling and related examples of the genre. W. Hofmeister, Sprachkunst, 15:1?13, re-evalu ates the didactic elements in Der Jungling. R. Schmidt-Wiegand, LiLi, 51-52, 1983:206-26, views Eike von Repgow's Sachsenspiegel as a technical textbook, and M. Zips, Ndjb, 106, 1983:43-73, on the basis of the attitude to the Jews in this work and the Sdchsische Weltchronik sees no reason to attribute the latter to Eike. Ursula Liebertz-Griin, Das andere Mittelalter. Erzdhlte Geschichte und Geschichtserkenntnis um ijqo. Studien zu Ottokar von Steiermark, Jans Enikel, Seifried Helbling (FGADL, 5), 234 pp., follows the author's earlier interpretation of the Seifried Helbling satires (cf. YWMLS, 43:766), of which the first 69 pp. of the present book are a superficially revised reprint. Two chapters on Enikel's Furstenbuch and Weltchronik follow articles published in Euphorion, 74-75, 1980-81, and the scope of L.-G.'s thesis is revealed in the concluding extended essay on Ottokar's Reimchronik where, taking the same sociological approach to a largely unread text, she reviews the traditional literary historical data, then analyses the historical content, establishing O.'s point of view in relation to other accounts of events. This leads into an evaluation of the mentality and ideology of author and audience and to conclusions about various aspects of the society portrayed. The book is thus successful in revealing a largely neglected tradition of historical works of the period; less convincing, in view of the</page><page sequence="33">Medieval Literature 687 approach, is L.-G.'s claim that on its own terms O.'s Reimchronik bears comparison with Wolfram and Gottfried. O. Gschwander, Collinder Vol., pp. 135-81, studies the references to heroic legend in the Quedlinburg Annals and the Wiirzburg Chronicle, while G. Korn rumpf, WS VIII, pp. 178-98, examines the role of Arthur and the grail family in Heinrich von Miinchen's chronicle, and K. Gartner, ib., pp. 199-218, the use made of Philipp von Seitz's Marienleben in the latter. Peter von Dusburg, Chronik des Preussenlandes, transl. and comm. Klaus Scholz and Dieter Wojtecki (Ausgewahlte Quellen zur deutschen Geschichte des Mittelalters, 25), WBG, vii 4- 588 pp., continues this important series with a text which makes more accessible a major 141T1-C. chronicle source of knowledge about the Teutonic Order. An introductory essay reviews the content and structure and the limited knowledge of the author, his provenance and relation to the Order, his particular interests as revealed by the work, its sources, and the MS transmission. The editors justify the retention of the Latin text of Max Toeppen (1861) unaltered on the left-hand pages; their translation on facing pages is lucid and clearly set out. A bibliography and full index of proper names complete the volume. H. Boockmann, Literatur und Laienbildung..., pp. 80-93, also contributes on the historiography of the Teutonic Order. Julio A. Hernandez, Studien zum religids-ethischen Wortschatz der deutschen Mystiker. Die Bezeichnung und der Begriffdes Eigentums bei Meister Eckhart und Johannes Tauter (PSQ, 105), 148 pp., adopts a contrastive linguistic approach to vocabulary of the type besitzunge, eigen(schaft), erbe, guot, and habe, emphasizing its communicative function in specific contexts, and referring to the language of OHG documents, the court epic, and legal Latin as contrasting languages. There is a useful introductory survey of the attitude of the Church to the questions of property and poverty at the time of the mystics. The semantic material is carefully described and analysed and, although the results are scarcely surprising, H. succeeds in his aim of relating the mystics' usage to their understanding of man the possessor in relation to God and creation around him. This receives particular emphasis in the final section which concentrates on the significance of the subject-matter for the theme of the poor in spirit.

Jahrhunderts uber Moral und Recht nach der 'Summa theologiae'II-II des Thomas von Aquin und anderen Werken der Scholastik und Kanonistik. 1. Einleitung. Mittelhochdeutscher Text. 11. Lateinische Quel len, ed. Klaus Berg and Monika Kasper (TTG, 7, 8), 2 vols, cxx 4 467, iv 4 305 pp., is a fine critical edition and related body of studies, from the Wiirzburg school, of an anonymous Dominican compen dium of guidance on theological, moral, and legal problems. In common with other editions in the series, the first volume, besides meticulous codicological assessment of the nine known MSS of the vernacular text, supplies material of literary and wider interest with an account of the punctuation and its relevance for the edition, the relation to the Latin sources (the most important being an abbrevi ated version of part of the Summa Theologiae), the authorship problem, and the function of the work. Chapter headings and text are set out with exceptional clarity. The second volume collects the Latin sources in as complete a fashion as possible, whether based on modern edited sources (Aquinas, Hugo Ripelin of Strasbourg, Albertus Magnus) or MSS and incunabula (Guillelmus Peraldus, Ulrich of Strasbourg). Spdtmittelalterliche geistliche Lieder in der Nationalsprache. 1 (Analecta Cartusiana, 106), Salzburg Univ., Inst. fur Anglistik und Amerikanistik, 1983, 236 pp., includes A. M.

Previous volumes appeared in 1966 (Book iv of the text)</page><page sequence="35">Medieval Literature 689 and 1974 (Books i-iii: see YWMLS, 37:551-52). The introductory material here includes a summary of the account of author and work supplied with Book iv, and a description of the Munich MS e containing Books v and vi only. The text conforms closely in layout to the earlier volumes. Book v deals with the Breviary, Book vi, occupying a third of the whole work, the liturgical year; the volumes divide, somewhat uncomfortably, between Good Friday and Holy Saturday. Each volume concludes with an appendix of excerpts from the Latin text where this is indispensable to an understanding of the German, and a list of words with Latin equivalents not found in Lexer's dictionary. A. G. Weiler, Geert Grote undseine Stiftungen (N, 30), 52 pp., commemorates the 600th anniversary of G.'s death, and is of interest for the spread of the Devotio Moderna to Germany. Marquard von Lindau, O.F.M., Das buck der zehngebote (Venedig 1483). Textausgabe mit Einleitung und Glossar, ed. Jacobus Willem van Maren (QFESM, 7), vi 4- 10* 4- 176 pp., is further evidence of increasing interest in the neglected Franciscan author, although the present volume has no substantial information on his life and works, the short introduction being concerned entirely with the background to the early printed Ger. version of his De decent praeceptis, apart from a brief glance at the apparent sources. The editor, who has presented an Amsterdam dissertation on the Strasbourg editions of 1516 and 1520, now supplies the text of the most complete version printed by Erhart Ratdolt. The edition aims to be as conservative as is consistent with legibility and is clearly set out with bold type for headings, a glossary, and index of proper names. It is useful to have access to what is regarded as an intermediate stage towards a full critical edition. Pieter Boon, Spiegel der armen sundigen Seele (Ulm: Cunrad Dinckmut 1484). Textausgabe mit einem Glossar, einer Einfuhrung und Beobachtungen zum Sprachgebrauch (QFESM, 8), xii 4- 101 4- 142 pp., contains a clearly reproduced facsimile of the 1484 print of this text. In the lengthy accompanying studies B. is able to identify a probable source edition of the Speculum animae peccatricis, and comparison with this and with the Ger. 1487 edition leads to the establishment of substantial textual emendations. There is a full linguistic commentary, glossary, and bibliography, and the highly technical material is presented legibly in a relatively cheap format. Id., ABAG, 22:167-75, studies typographical and other features of the two prints. C. Gerhardt, VB, 6:100-22, comments impressively on the background to the strophes on the fig and the vine in Heinrich von Miigeln's Turn, 153 and 154, and, ib., 123-54, makes Wartburgkrieg str. 157 the starting-point for an investigation into beasts, precious stones and plants invented by poets.

(Buchlein von der Liebhabung Gottes.' Edition und Untersuchungen (MTU, 81), x + 427 pp., is a Munich dissertation which supplies the first critical edition of a I5th-c. vernacular prose work, hitherto accessible only in printings of isolated MSS. S. outlines the limited knowledge of the life of the cleric of the 'Vienna school' dated by him to c. 1390-1439 and reviews his works with codicological data. The edition of the text, in 22 chapters, occupies only 67 pages of the book, which also includes an edition of the Latin sources. In the prolegomena the most significant chapter concerns the history of the text, where S. successfully expounds the evidence of a relatively rare phenomenon: two differing versions, each by the author, and separated by a stage of authorial revision, all of much greater importance than subsequent changes made in the later transmission. The MS descriptions and the account of the latter, which with the help of the sources leads to the establishment of a complete stemma, is a major accomplishment. As with other volumes in this series, S. does not neglect the literary and theological significance of the text, ranging succinctly over the social and historical background.

Ottersbock, The Neidhart Frescoes ca. 1400, the contents are partly abridgements of recent monographs published in the Osterreichische Zeitschrift fur Kunst und Denkmalpflege. Christa Wolf Cross, Magister ludens: Der Erzahler in Heinrich Wittenweilers 'Ring' (UNCSGLL, 102), 112 pp., interprets the role of the narrator in terms of his magisterial function which, however, just as the red and green initial capitals indicate both serious and humorous content, expresses itself in terms of playing with the reader through irony, parody, and deception as well as straightforward didacticism. C. illuminates her thesis by taking us through each episode of the work and interpreting the narrator's attitude to his material accordingly. K. Ruh, Literatur und Laienbildung..., pp. 344-55, characterizes the Ring as a 'Laiendoktri nal'. Gerhard Hahn, Der Ackermann aus Bbhmen des Johannes von Tepl (EF, 215), viii 4 137 pp., continues this admirable series of research surveys with a painstaking account of most of the significant work of the present century on this highly controversial text. Designed both for the specialist and for a wider public, the material is clearly set out in chapters covering the author, text, and transmission, various interpretative approaches with a formal or thematic basis, sources, and influences. With its clearly delineated sub-sections, name index, and full bibliography of all titles, the book is easy to use and forms an excellent introduction to the Ackermann. Johannes von Saaz, Der Ackermann aus Bbhmen. 11. Kommentar. Aus dem Nachlafi von Gunther Jungbluth, ed. Rainer Zack, pref. Hugo Moser (Germ. Bibl., 4. Reihe), Heidelberg, Winter, 1983, 279 pp., follows J.'s edition which appeared in 1969 (YWMLS, 31:498-99) and is compiled by Z. from the substantial material left by J. at his death in 1976. The commentary follows the text of the first volume at every stage, is clearly laid out, and compresses an enormous quantity of information on all aspects of the work, apart from the narrowly philological, into a small space. It has the supreme advantage of dispensing with a vast array of footnotes; access to points of detail is facilitated, and, where</page><page sequence="39">Medieval Literature 693 an argument requires a more discursive style in exposition, this does not jar against the opposite extreme, mere lists of references. The list of abbreviations and bibliography of work incorporated in the commentary occupies 15 pages. There is a five-page addendum to the bibliography of the first volume, brief list of corrigenda to the edition and, of particular value, indexes both to the chief problems and to all medieval and Classical sources mentioned. Besides this fundamental aid, other work on the Ackermann includes E. S. Firchow, Fest. Reed, pp. 72-92 (identity of the poet), A. Schnyder, SchM, 64:1039-51 (Freudian interpretation), and M. Morton, FCS, 9:125-46 (struc ture). Frieder Schanze, Meisterliche Liedkunst zwischen Heinrich von Mugeln und Hans Sachs. 11. Verzeichnisse (MTU, 83), viii + 357 pp., completes this important work on the later lyric with a copious volume of documentation which goes far beyond even the scope of the wide-ranging body of studies accompanying it (cf. YWMLS, 45:653-54). The aim is to supply the codicological and bibliographi cal basis for the whole tradition of the Meistergesang from the second half of the 14th to the first quarter of the i6thc. The material is arranged in five catalogues containing respectively the work of the major poets, the contents of the various song collections, a descriptive list of the MSS in alphabetical order of place, a similar list of prints, and an alphabetical catalogue of authors and melodies, intended to serve both in its own right and as an index for the four preceding catalogues. The careful organization of the information and the lucid system of cross-referencing indicate that the author can justifiably claim to have created an indispensable tool for future research in the field. R. Schroder, Literatur und Laienbildung..., pp. 289-313, prints texts attributed to Regenbogen and relates them to the problem of the artisan poet. Work on Oswald von Wolkenstein includes D.
