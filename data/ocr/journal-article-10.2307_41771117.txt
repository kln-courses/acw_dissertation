There is also evidence for such art, both at this time and in earlier periods, in Africa, the Middle East, and Australia, but the so-called great explosion in image-making occurred in Ice Age Europe. Hunters of woolly mammoth and rhinoceros, reindeer, wild horse and cattle, ibex (wild goat), and other species, these early people camped in rock-shel- ters and on hills overlooking a vast network of rivers flowing west toward the Atlantic, south to the Mediter- ranean, and, on the Russian plain, south to the Black Sea. These rivers were the highways along which small groups moved with the seasons, and it was at sites overlooking these rivers that they gathered for seasonal rituals and the exchange of flint, tools, skins, personal decorations, and probably mates. Over the millennia a network of rivers had cut through the soft limestone hills of southern France and northwestern Spain, creat- ing narrow valleys with rock-shelters and hills honey- combed with caves. It was here, on rock faces and in the caves, that these people carved, engraved, and painted images of the animals of their day. In 1864 a ten-inch-long section of mammoth ivory was excavated at the riverside rock-shelter of La Madeleine on the Vézère River in southwestern France. On it was incised a woolly mammoth - the first image of an extinct species ever discovered. Five years earlier Charles Darwin had published his On the Origin of Species , which postulated a vast stretch of time during which all species, including humans, had evolved. The La Madeleine mammoth engraving was evidence that humans capable of creating art had indeed lived in a distant past when now extinct animals roamed the continent. Since that first discovery, thou- sands of Ice Age images have been found at riverside sites and shelters across Europe. Why did such art thrive during this period? One hundred years after the La Madeleine engrav- ing was found, I studied it under a microscope and found that it was far more than mere art or depiction. What I discovered would help me understand many of the images in caves and from excavations throughout Europe that I would later study. The La Madeleine mammoth had three or four extra backs, a second tail standing upright, and a number of extra tusks. It had also been ritually killed by a number of darts engraved in and around the body. The mammoth had appar- ently served as a symbol to be used in different ways and perhaps at different times. It was ritually killed, by marking it with abstract representations of wounds or weapons, such as darts, and renewed and presumably reused by adding an extra tail and backs. For 30 years, while at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University, I have conducted research in Palaeolithic archaeology. I have investigated image-making traditions from every period and region of Ice Age Europe, and I pioneered the study of rock art using microscopy, fluorescence, and infrared and ultraviolet light. I have found that many cave depictions resemble the La Madeleine mammoth in their manner of execution and, presum- ably, in their function as symbolic images. In the foothills of the Pyrénées in southern France, at the Magdalenian cave of Les Trois Frères, named after three brothers who discovered it, there are hun- dreds of animal images about as old as the La Madeleine mammoth. One beautifully incised bison has been ritually killed with many darts or spears. It has also been renewed and reused by adding a second, upright tail, much like that on the La Madeleine mam- moth. Many animals today, including elephants and rhinos, raise their tails when in danger or under attack. There are many such images in Ice Age caves. At Las- caux a speared and disemboweled bison with upright tail is shown charging a human figure. The Les Trois Frères bison also has three zigzags engraved on its upper body. I have argued that such markings on certain species indicate the summer moult, when irregular patches of hair fall from the animal's upper body. Painted and engraved images of moulting bison are common in the Magdalenian period and can be seen at Altamira and Lascaux. The Les Trois Frères bison has an upper body without hair, indicating the moult, and scrape-marks on the lower body suggesting remaining hair. I believe the added tail, the three zigzags, and the many spear markings were made with different tools or points at different times, perhaps by different artists, to represent the ritual killing and renewal of bison in spring and early summer. Were bison present in the region in spring or summer? Were they awaited, or had they been killed recently? Many of the species depicted at Les Trois Frères, including bison, horse, reindeer, and ibex, migrated between winter and summer pastures. Images of Atlantic salmon, which would have spawned in the streams of the Pyrenean foothills, are also engraved on bones and stones found in rock-shelters across the region. Clearly the seasonal appearance and disappearance of species, which helped delineate a subsistence calendar, were closely observed and recorded. La Madeleine and other Magdalenian sites date between ca. 15,000 and ca. 10,000 B.C., toward the end of the Ice Age, when warmer temperatures allowed animals to move higher into the river valleys of the Pyrenean foothills, which had been uninhabit- able in earlier colder periods. As hunters followed their prey into these valleys, they began to decorate the rock-shelters and caves of the higher slopes. Chauvet Cave, 20 miles west of the lower Rhône Valley, was used ca. 19,000-18,000 B.c., during a colder period of the Ice Age. Because of the cold, the middle reaches of the Pyrénées were uninhabitable except for short sea- sonal forays.

Glaciers covered much of the Pyrénées, the Alps, as well as some of the lower mountain ranges. The massive northern ice sheet extended south into what are now England and Germany. The lower Rhône Valley was a refuge: while open to cold north- ern winds, it was interlaced with tributary rivers and protected valleys and rock-shelters. Its rolling floodplain and adjoining hills offered rich pasturage and an opportunity for seasonal movements of animals and humans. It was here, apparently, that the Solutrean culture evolved to cope with the colder climate. When the Chauvet images were first published, accompanied by a profusion of nonanalytical first impressions and interpretations, it was at once clear that they documented many of the image-making tradi- tions I had found elsewhere in Europe. Consider the bear with red dots (see cover), first thought to be a spot- ted hyena, in part because the nearby image of a leop- ard had spots common to that species. Solutrean caves are rich with examples of animals ritually marked with painted spots: a lion at Chauvet; wild aurochs in the nearby cave of Tête du Lion; two horses and a mam- moth at Pech-Merle in the Dordogne; and various ani- mals at Cougnac, northwest of Pech-Merle, and La Pileta on the southern coast of Spain. Even hand-prints are frequently surrounded with painted spots. Engraved images of bear-killings have been found in Ice Age caves and rock-shelters. The ritual springtime killing of a bear after it awakened from hibernation was practiced with great ceremony by the Basques, descendants of the Ice Age population, well into the nineteenth century. At Chauvet the extinct woolly rhinoceros presents a far more powerful image than the bear. A heavy short- legged creature that grazes on grass and bush not far from water, it probably inhabited the floodplain of the Rhône and other rivers. It was probably not a regu- larly hunted or eaten species, since it does not congre- gate in herds and is relatively difficult to kill. Early press reports stressed the power and beauty of the rhi- noceros images, and one article even suggested that an image of two rhinos facing each other depicted two males in a mating confrontation. Only one of the rhi- nos, however, appears to be male; horn-to-horn con- frontations between males and females are common during rhino courtship. Many of the Chauvet rhinos are depicted with a black, mid-body, armor-like skin fold common among today's nearly extinct Asian rhinoceros. In Ice Age winters, the woolly rhinoceros would have grown a full coat of hair covering that skin fold. A rhino in full win- ter coat, for example, is engraved on a stone from the Magdalenian winter camp of Gönnersdorf overlooking the Rhine River in central Germany. The Chauvet rhi- nos apparently indicate the species in spring or early summer. A spring or summer rhino was found etched on a pebble at the rock-shelter of La Colombière over- looking the Ain River, a tributary of the Rhône north of the Ardèche. This rhino was ritually killed with three feathered darts in its soft belly and renewed with two or three extra horns.

Points resembling arrow- heads found at Solutrean sites suggest that the bow and arrow were invented sometime during this period. The La Colombière image may well represent the rit- ual killing and renewal of a young moulting rhino in the spring or early summer. There is much evidence at Chauvet of what may be sea- sonal rituals of renewal. Several of the rhinos were renewed and reused by scraping and engrav- ing outlines around their bodies. One was renewed by adding six or seven extra horns, three or four extra backs, and one extra rear leg. These images recall the La Madeleine mammoth and the Les Trois Frères bison. Also at Chauvet, four horse heads were painted one above the other. The heads appear to have been made at different times, with dif- ferent degrees of skill, and prob- ably with different mixes of paint. They represent not a herd, but rather the renewal of the horse- head image. What struck me in particular was that these are heads of horses in summer, with- out the thick hair that would have covered them in winter. During an Ice Age winter, the wild horse would have grown a heavy coat over its entire body, including legs and muzzle, mask- ing many features apparent in the summer. The summer coat is depicted on the famous running horse at Lascaux, which bears a serpentine line indicat- ing the tonal differences between upper and lower body. The same serpentine line often appears on engraved horses, such as those at Les Trois Frères. A crude schematic engraving of a horse at Chauvet has this serpentine summer marking across its body. Early reports on the Chauvet Cave images expressed surprise at the many depictions of carnivores, primarily lions. Actually, images of the lion occur throughout the Ice Age. The earliest known Ice Age animal images were excavated at the 30,000-year-old Aurignacian cave of Vogelherd, in the hills of south-central Ger- many. These mammoth-ivory carvings include lions, mammoth, horses, bison, reindeer, and bear. With the exception of woolly rhinoceros, these are the same ani- mals depicted at Chauvet 12,000 years later. Micro- scopic study of the Vogelherd images indicated that they, too, were at times ritually killed with incised darts and wound marks. One carved lion has a series of spots, perhaps indicating wounds, gouged across its body. An anthropomorphic figure with a lion head, carved from mammoth ivory, was found at the nearby rock-shelter of Hohlenstein-Stadel. Whether it repre- sents a human wearing a lion mask - perhaps a shaman - or a mythical lion spirit in human form, the image seems to represent some aspect of lion power. The Vogelherd lion had been ritually marked, perhaps ritually killed. Could lions have been hunted for their skins or heads?

There are other lion images in the cave, including one, on a central stone in a small chamber, which has been renewed and reused. At Las- caux there are images of killed lions, one with blood pouring from its nose and mouth. Lion images are also found in the Gravettian culture, ca. 24,000 B.c., at the riverside site of Dolní Věstonice in the Czech Republic. One small lion head was modeled in soft clay, stabbed in both the eye and head, and then fired, perhaps as part of a ritual. The lions at Chauvet, dating to the Solutrean, were painted after the early Ice Age hunters of Germany, Central Europe, and the Russian plain had moved south, taking their traditions and myths with them. The great cave of Altamira in northern Spain was discovered in 1879. Its painted bison were so realistic and powerful that French archaeologists, who knew of no painted caves in France, declared the images to be fakes . It was not until an engraved and painted cave was discovered at La Mouthe, near La Madeleine and the Vézère River, that the French admitted that Altamira was genuine. The study of Ice Age cave art had begun. After more than a century, however, La Mouthe's most enigmatic image continues to puzzle scholars. Called a "hut" by the Abbé Breuil, one of the leading scholars of Ice Age art in the first half of the twentieth century, the S mall clay lion head from Dolní Věstonice was stabbed in the eye and behind one ear before it was fired in an oven. ut SŽ £ 2 Oí tf Q &lt; &lt; Very early Aurignacian mammoth-ivory figure, ca. 28,000 B.c., from Hohlenstein- Stadel may represent a human wearing a lion mask or a mythical lion spirit in human form. ut u X I s tí. tf 0 1 š &lt; 38 Archaeology</page><page sequence="11">fragment of a Magdalenian reindeer-antler atlatl (spear-thrower) from Le Mas d'Azil cave depicts three horse heads , possibly a colt , a stallion , and a flayed horse head. 5 S &gt; I engraving seems to resemble a hut-like structure. But while mammoth-bone huts were built on the Russian plain, and tents are known from Gönnersdorf on the Rhine and open-air sites on the Dordogne, there is no evidence that Ice Age hunters in this region of rock-shelters and caves ever built such structures. Variants of this motif, often appearing as a zigzag or a stream, have been found at Lascaux and at other caves in the Dordogne; at Gargas and Les Trois Frères in the Pyrenean region; and at La Pileta in Spain. I have also found variants of this motif at Ice Age settlement sites along rivers in Germany, the Czech Republic, Italy, and on the Russian steppe. While working at La Mouthe, I hap- pened upon a waterfall of a small tribu- tary of the Vézère. The falls, with streams flowing from its sides, was remarkably similar to the La Mouthe image. Could it represent a waterfall and not a hut? During the Ice Age, rivers, streams, and even waterfalls would have frozen in winter and thawed in spring. The return of salmon to the rivers and migratory animals to the val- leys would have accompanied the spring thaw and flooding of the Vézère. The thaw would have brought a dramatic renewal of life to these valleys: the dropping of calves, colts, and kids, the return of migratory water- fowl, and the awakening of bears. Indeed, the behavior of the rivers was perhaps as dominant a factor in Ice Age thinking as the movement of animals. A thorough study of Chauvet will take time. Researchers must date the images by studying remnant charcoal from lamps and fires, organic material in frag- ments of bone, and paints. The study will require a re- creation of the seasonal ecology of the Ardèche River, the high plateau around it, and the Rhône floodplain downriver. They must determine whether it was possi- ble to walk up the gorges of the Ardèche River in the winter, or only after the spring floods had subsided. It will require a study of animal remains at the settlement sites, though this can tell us only about some of the animals that were hunted and killed. They must com- pare the images at Chauvet to others from the Solutrean, as well as from earlier and later periods. The Mediterranean coasts would have provided a warmer climate and a different ecology from the val- leys of the middle Rhône and its tributaries. The coastal Mediterranean cave of Cosquer, for example, has ^ paintings of approximately the same date as Chau- vet, but there are no depictions of woolly rhino, mam- moth, or reindeer. Instead there are paintings of the great auk, a flightless seabird, and engravings of seals. Can one make inferences from a study of Chauvet about the art and traditions in other caves of this period? Were Solutrean animal images often seasonal markers? The questions and problems are large. Hunt- ing cultures have always created myths and conducted rituals in which the animal species of their time play a part. Different species have been used as clan or tribal symbols, as spirit helpers, as characters in myths of ori- gin, as explanations of human behavior, as guardians of the seasons and nature, and often as creatures to be sac- rificed at certain ritual times. It is possible that the ani- mals depicted in the Ice Age were used in similar ways. What were Ice Age hunter-gatherers thinking as the period came to a close? In the Magdalenian cave site and shelter of Le Mas d'Azil in the foothills of the Pyrénées, the top of a reindeer-antler atlatl, or spear-, thrower, was found, bearing three carved horse heads. One is small, perhaps a colt; the second is large, wide- eyed, and open-mouthed, perhaps a stallion; the third represents the flayed head of a dead horse. Life, death, and rebirth - of humans, animals, and the seasons - were by now entrenched Ice Age concepts, part of a ritual mythic lore that had begun 20,000 years earlier with the Vogelherd horse and lion images. At the end of the Ice Age, as the climate changed, the ice melted, and the animals began to disappear, these concepts would have had to accommodate the slow disappear- ance of species in terms, again, of death and hoped-for rebirth. Later, in entirely different contexts, these con- cepts of death, rebirth, and sacrifice, would become part of the farming cultures that developed following the end of the Ice Age. ■ Alexander Marshack, a researcher since 1966 with the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard Uni- versity, is the author of The Roots of Civilization, published in 1972 (second edition 1991).
