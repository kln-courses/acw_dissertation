<plain_text><page sequence="1">Epistemology of Social Science Research : exploration in inculture researchers Magoroh Maruyama 1 . Introduction It is trivial and axiomatic to state that there are cultural differences in cognitive and inferential structure with which persons perceive and explain events, feel and judge situations, reason and decide their actions, and build their philosophy and theory about universe, man and society. The whole cultural anthropology, and certain components of sociology and criminology, are based on and live on the study of cultural diffe- rences. This implies that these fields of science assume the existence of epistemological differences between cultures. Yet when it comes to the actual procedure of research, the differences in epistemologie s are usually reduced to differences perceivable in terms of one epistemology which is the epistemology of the researcher. For example a researcher whose epistemology is based on a rank-order structure may reduce and deform by his use of rank-order value system analysis, Q-sort technique or "leadership" structure analysis an alien culture whose epistemology is essentially nonhierarchical (refs. 1, 2). Or a researcher whose episte- mology is classificational may distort, by his use of psycholingiiistic category analysis, a culture whose epistemology is essentially relational (refs 2, 3, 4). Another example is a researcher who tries to apply the assumption, that behavior is motivated by desire for acceptance by peers, to a culture iri which behavior is governed by the necessity to defend oneself physically against his peers. Interpretation of one epistemological universe by a researcher from outside may produce a theory which is self-consistent and is therefore satisfactory to the researcher, but nevertheless is incorrect or irrelevant Dialéctica Vol. 23, No 3/4 (1969)</page><page sequence="2">230 M. Maruyama from the point of view of the universe being interpreted (refs. 1, 5). One way to overcome this epistemological barrier is to have cultures concep- tualized and analyzed by inculture persons. Though inculture persons have been often used as data collectors and information sources, the use of inculture persons as conceptualizers, selectors of focus of relevance, theoretical model makers, hypotheses makers, research designers and data analysts is relatively new, and has been put into practice in only a small number of projects. Prof John Adair, for example, had Navajos* take a film of their own life and edit it themselves in order to study whether there are structural diffe- rences between the film the Navajos made and a film a white anthro- pologist would make (ref 6). Prof Robert McKnight is currently con- ducting a literature ¡survey of the use of inculture researches. In this article I limit my discussions to the three projects with inculture resear- chers which I have conducted : one in prisons (refs. 7, 8) ; one in Black ghettos, and one on the Navajo Reservation. The inculture researchers in these projects turned out to be indispen- sable in three other aspects in addition to the epistemological considera- tion : (1) philosophy regarding communication; (2) relevance resonance ; and (3) unsuspected dangers in information giving . These will be dis cussed in this article. I will further discuss some of the results obtained by inculture researchers as well as operational successes and failures in the development of inculture research teams. Before proceeding any further, let me discuss some of the objections often raised against the use of inculture researchers. As shown later, some of the objections conceived by some social scientists with their epistemology turned out to be irrelevant or unimportant in actual opera- tion, while other obstacles emerged which had not been conceived in the epistemology of social scientists. Four commonly raised objections are: (a) Inculture researchers lack comparative perspective of outsiders; (b) They are vulnerable to censure and pressure by other inculture members; (c) They have some axe to grind on behalf of their culture; (d) They have no professional training. The epistemological research explores the structure of subjective mental universe rather than materially manifested "evidence". Social and cultural reality is a universe of beliefs and interpretations. For example the "family ghost" in old Manus had a social and cultural * In 1969 the Navajo Tribe adopted the spelling "Navajo" as official, as opposed to "Navaho" which was used by some writers.</page><page sequence="3">Epistemologa of Social Science Research 231 reality in the sense that it was believed to be real, and the belief affected the behavior of the people and interacted with other components of the culture. Whether the existence of the ghost was measurable with the instruments of material sciences was irrelevant to the understanding of the culture. The ultimate goal of epistemology is to improve intercultural understanding and communication by recognizing and appreciating the differences between the culturally rich subjective universes instead of insisting on an agreement on the impoverished shadow of material ma- nifestations. The objection (a) is first irrelevant if our goal is to obtain the sub- jectively "embedded" reality of the inculture persons free from conta- mination by outside epistemology. When the social science was at the stage where various cultures were studied by researchers from outside, mainly from one culture or from a small number of similar cultures, the emphasis on "objectivity" was imperative in order to counteract the ethnocentricism of the researchers. But at the next stage of social science where inculture researchers become available, the emphasis can be shifted to inculture subjectivity and its cross-cultural and cross-sub- jective comparison. Cross-subjectivity , rather than objectivity, may become the principle of future social sciences. Secondly, and more importantly, I suspect that behind this Objection (a) there is an implicit assumption, and perhaps unconscious need for affirmation, that the ouside "scientists" is somewhat superior to inculture researchers by virtue of being an outsider. This may be a rationalization stemming from the fear of rejection. The unconscious mechanism may be similar to that of the white "liberal" who wants to be a do-gooder primarily to pròve to himself that he is acceptable to the ghetto people. I am raising this point riot so much in order to be cynical about outside researchers but in order to point out the possibility that a seemingly logical argument may stem from conscious or unconscious emotional needs. As Karl Mannheim (ref. 9), Lawrence Kubie (ref. 10) and Lewis Feuer (ref. 11) have pointed out, behind the choice of a logical theory there usually are translogical emotional needs. As for Objection (b), here again the censure and the pressure by other inculture members, if any, are a part of the subjective reality of the culture and are valuable if reflected in the data. The intentional distortion of data, its causes and functions, as well as the means of its detection and elimination, will be discussed under « relevance reso- nance" and "unsuspected dangers in information giving". Similarly for Objection (c), the "axè" is a valuable part of the data.</page><page sequence="4">232 M- Maruyama All we need to do is to make the "axe" overt rather than covert. This can be accomplished by "relevance resonance". Objection (4) is ethnocentric, or rather professsiono-centric. In any culture there are persons highly versed and articulate in the culture. They may be medicine men, ceremonial singers, religious carvers or plain housewives. Even in the ghetto, there are pimps and hustlers who are highly intelligent and can easily outsmart social scientists. Prison inmates have highly sophisticated and subtle techniques to play games with and fool social scientists, psychologists and psychiatrists as will be discussed later. They may have no "professional" training as recog- nized by social scientists. But they have very thorough training in how to live in their own complex culture which the outside scientists do not have. Furthermore, the lack of "professional" training can be considered as an advantage in a sense. The inculture researchers do not have to wnlearn the conceptualizations and research methods developed by out- side researchers, even though they have to develop their own concep- tualization and research method. Freedom from academic "contami- nation" is a highly valuable quality which can be often found among inculture persons, but difficult to find among outside researchers. In short, all these "objectionable" qualities can be. turned into ad- vantages. This does not mean that all inculture persons are fit to be inculture researchers. There are other criteria which will become clear later in this article. II. Epistemology Traditionally, the term "epistemology" is used to designate philo- sophical discourses on the process of our cognition and cogitation, for example Plato's "Theaitetos" or Kant's "Kritik der reinen Vernunft". In these classical works it was assumed that all men had the same pat- tern of thinking. Therefore one epistemology was considered to be applicable to all human beings. Epistemological controversies were fought in terms of universal invalidity or validity of competing thories. Awareness of culture-boundness of epistemology arose only recently and was pioneered by Karl Mannheim (ref. 9), Karl Jaspers (ref. 38), T. S. Chang (ref. 3), Clyde Kluckhohn (ref. 39), Maruyama (réf. 1), and others. In this article we define the term "epistemology" as the pattern of thinking inherent in a given culture consisting of the aspects of thinking listed below. These aspects are by no means mutually exclusive. They</page><page sequence="5">Epistemology of Social Science Research 233 overlap and interrelate with one another. As there are cultural (and individual) differences in thought patterns, we speak of epistemologia, logics etc., rather than the epistemology or the logic. (1) Logical structure of verbal discourse : Examples : Aristotelian deductive logic Chinese logic of complementarity (ref. 3) Universalism vs. nominalism (ref. 12) (2) Cosmology : time, space, matter and order in universe. Examples : Balinese time as cyclic Western time as unidirectional development categorizational universe of Linné (3) Structure of religion : Examples : Christian and Mohammedan monotheism with one God as creator, prime mover, omniscient, omnipotent, "perfect". Early Greek anthropomorphic polytheism. Navajos' mutualism between man, nature, spirits, ani- mals and ghosts. (4) Structure of social organization : Examples : American "democracy" with administrative hierarchy and rule by majority over minority. Vertical and horizontal segregations of earlier Japan. Nonhierarchical societies of Navajos and Eskimos. (5) Scientific methods and models : Examples : Unidirectional causal models in the 19th century na- tural and social sciences. Recent development of mutual causal models in engi- neering, biology and social sciences (refs. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18). (6) Philosopho-historical factor : Examples : Karl Pribam (ref. 19) (7) Phenomenology of man and culture : Examples: Bergson (ref. 20), Husserl (ref. 21), Becker (ref. 22), Lifton (ref. 23), Garfinkel (ref. 24), Dyk (ref. 25), Lewis (ref. 26). (8) Existential factor : man and his situation Examples : Kierkegaard (ref. 27), Heidegger (ref. 28), Sartre (ref. 29), Bergson (ref. 33), Malcolm X (ref. 30), Bettelheim (ref. 31), Franki (ref. 32).</page><page sequence="6">234 M. Maruyama (9) Socio-existential factor : Example : Mannheim (réf. 9). As we have briefly touched upon, the choice of a logical theory is often based on individual unconscious emotional needs (ref. 10) or communally shared feelings, goals, purposes and interests (rfs. 9, 40) which in turn are generated by sociohistoric (refs. 9, 30) or individual (refs. 28, 29, 40) situations. Therefore even the logical aspect of the pattern of thinking in a culture cannot be understood without the sha- ring of experiences, feelings, goals, purposes and interests of the people in the culture. u Understanding " is an intellectual process. There are limits even within the communication of intellectual realities (ref. 34). Experiences, feelings, goals, purposes and interests cannot be adequately "understood" by intellect alone. They have to be grasped by experiential resonance (réf. 1), existential resonance (ref. 36), relevance resonance (réf. 1) and commitment resonance which are trans-intellectual (beyond intellect) processes. Relevance resonance is particularly important in culture research, whether conducted by insiders or outsiders, and will be dis- cussed in some length in this article. Epistemology formulated by inculture researchers : A question which I often receive from academic people is: "When you go into a new culture, shouldn't you go with a hypothesis of some sort?" Such a question assumes that there is no hypothesis unless an out- sider makes one. This is quite ethnocentric. Inculture persons are full of hypotheses of their own. These are inculture-relevant hypotheses, and are often of the sort that cannot be dreamed up by outsiders. For example on the Navajo Reservation one Navajo adult student told me that he wanted to do a research on Navajo'« opinion on man's trip to the moon. This was in June 1969, about a month before man's first landing on the moon. At first I could not see any connection between the Navajo life and the astronauts' moon landing, except the possibility that Nava- jos might consider the space program as a waste of money which should be spent for solving social problems. But the connection, quite unex- pected in nature, was supplied by the Navajo. He said that according to the Navajo mythology, a long time ago a Navajo went to the Moon and it took him only one day. He wanted to know what Navajos thought of the white men's trip to the moon which would take several days. Now, here was a topic quite inculture-relevant, which I could not have thought up.</page><page sequence="7">Epistemology of Social Science Research 235 In the prison project I suggested the inmate researchers to concep- tualize the factors - whatever they considered relevant - contributing to physical violence in prisons and in their home environment. The list of factors and the accompanying examples turned out to be quite dif- ferent (ref. 8, chapter 6) from those found in sociological and crimino- logical literature. Even though the inmate researchers had no theoretical training, they had a large reservoir of knowledge on specific facts and how these facts a were connected. It was a matter of letting them arrange these facts in their own relational structure (not disjoint categories) using the technique of Socratic dialogue. At no point I needed to sup- ply them with any sociological or psychological theories. The structure they produced was highly sophisticated. In the subsequent projects I used the same Socratic technique. The inculture epistemology emerges both from (1) the conceptual work of the inculture researchers prior to their research designing, and (2) from the data they obtain. The outsider who helps inculture persons organize a research is to function only as a Socratic catalyst, not as a hypothesis maker or a research designer. The data analysis by inculture researchers : Not only the type of data obtained by means of inculture research design are different, but also the method of data analysis and data interpretation by inculture re- searchers is different from those by researchers from outside. I have discussed this in detail in ref. 8. Validity check by inculture researchers: Furthermore, the inculture researchers can detect and verify inaccuracies, discrepancies, distortions and self-deceptions in the data suppliers much more efficiently and easily than the researchers from outside. For example, some inmates, isolated from the outside world and deprived of reality testing, substitute reality with fantasy. The inculture researchers are familiar with this phenomenon in many varieties, and can detect them more easily than researchers from outside. Validity checks by inculture researchers is discussed in detail in ref. 8. II A. Epistemologica I translation When the inculture epistemology is finally obtained, there remains the problem of epistemological translation for the outculture persons. Let us say that there are two cultures X and Y with two different epistemologies. Description or explanation of X in terms of its own epistemology is natural, coherent and satisfactory in the eyes of its own members. But if an outsider, unaquainted with the epistemology of X,</page><page sequence="8">236 M. Maruyama tries to analyze such a description or explanation, he is likely to find it unnatural, illogical and unsatisfactory. Let us call this " outculture - perceived illogicality in inculture autodescription79 . As I discussed else- where (ref. 14), this is the primary reason why many foreigners perceive Danes as intellectually childish, while many Danes consider the same foreigners innature and unsophisticated. Let us stress that the cause here is epistemological differences, not a simple matter of differences in values. There is also the problem of inculture-perceived illogicality in out- culture exodescription . This happens in the following situation. Mem- bers of X describe the other culture Y. As far as the members of X is concerned, the description is natural, coherent and satisfactory. On the other hand, the members of Y finds the description illogical and unsatisfactory. An example is the Black ghetto's description of the white society. Many of the Blacks consider all whites to be racists conspiring to exploit the Blacks and to practice genocide of all non- white races. As explained shortly, from the point of view of many of the Blacks this description is perfectly logical. But the white society considers this description illogical, insane and fanatic. The perceived illogicality of this sort forsters social conflict, oppression and violence. One of the practical tasks of cultural epistemology is to make the two sides see each other's logicality. This is achieved by epistemological translation . A language translator produces a translation which makes sense to the reader without having to teach the reader the grammar of the foreign language. In fact, the value of translation is lost if the reader has to study the grammar of the foreign language. Likewise, the epis- temological translator produces a translation which makes sense to the reader in the reader's epistemology without having the reader learn the epistemology of the foreign culture. (Let me emphasize that the analogy stops here. I am not equaling epistemology with language structure. On the contrary, my point of view is that epistemology is independent from the language structure. For example, as I discussed in refs. 14 + 44, the Swedish culture and the Danish culture have almost opposite epistemol- ogies, yet their language structures are almost identical. Lewis Feuer (ref. 37) also supports the independence of epistemology from language structure.) In my article "La Logique du Ghetto" (ref. 35), I have made a translation of a Black ghetto epistemology (not necessarily the Black epistemology) into the epistemology of the American white middle class. Let me illustrate: (1) how the translation eliminates the "illogicality"</page><page sequence="9">Epistemology of Social Science Research 237 in the white perception of the Black ghetto; (2) how the translation, which was a re-writing of Black ghetto epistemology into white middle class epistemology, appears necessarily unsatisfactory from the point of view of the Black ghetto. In the article I chose one aspect of the Black ghetto epistemology and translated it into another aspect of the white middle class episte- mology using a pivot concept . Pivot Concept : Legal machinery. Aspect of the Black ghetto epistemology chosen : oppression, exploitation and abuse. Aspect of the white middle class epistemology chosen : justice and fair- ness. Black ghetto epistemology: The whites we come in contact with are mainly policemen, probation and parole officers, social workers, shop owners and the like, who use their legal power to exploit the Blacks. Policemen often suspect an innocent Black, confiscates his legally owned money or property, and put it in their own pockets. They live on bribes and do not provide protective service to Black ghetto residents. Social workers may practice favoritism in exchange for sex. Shop owners charge higher prices and higher interest rates in the Black ghetto than elsewhere. The Power Structure , run by whites, do nothing to stop the abuse and exploitation. In fact, the Power Structure endorses the prac- tice of the policemen, social workers and businessmen. Therefore the whole white society must be conspiring against us. Most of us are un- employed or under-employed. Money is scarce in the ghetto. We must hustle (pimp, sell narcotics, gamble, steal, take by force) to survive. In order to hustle, we used to exploit our own kind, our fellow residents of the Black ghetto. Of course this was the white society's plot to keep our Brothers fighting among ourselves. Another of the white man's plot is the genocide in the War in Viet Nam. There is a higher percentage of Blacks drafted than whites to kill another non- white race. Before we started our Black Unity movement, our Black ghetto was a dog-eat- dog society. One had to physically protect himself from his neighbors. Of course this was a result of the economic conditions imposed by the white society. Growing up in such an environment, all we knew was exploitation: exploitation by whites and exploitation among ourselves. (This was one of the sixteen epistemologies obtained in the inculture research projects. This " Weltanschauung V psychologically projected,</page><page sequence="10">238 M- Maruyama added to the Black ghetto's interpretation of the whole white society as exploiters.) Epistemology of the white middle class: We live in democracy. Anyone who works hard can advance. Poverty is a result of laziness. Policemen protects citizens and arrest criminals. Social workers help the sick and the disabled. Our business world is based on free competition. Therefore any unfair store cannot survive long. Free competition produces fairness. The legal system assists citizens. There are legal means to settle pro- blems. Negros should not riot. They should quit being lazy and work their way up in our society. They should become as "good* as us. They should at least be nonviolent. Logicality in both espistemologies: Both epistemologies are logical in themselves. Both are founded on the reality-testing in the perspective environments. The ghetto residents experience exploitation, harassment and abuse which are unthinkable in the white middle class society. The details of such exploitation, harassment and abuse will be discussed later in this article. The autodescription of the Black ghetto is natural, consistent and is an adequate description of its reality. The ghetto de- scription of the white middle class society - exodescription - is also consistent with the ghetto autodescription. But the white middle class would not accept either the ghetto autodescription or the ghetto exode- scription of the white society. In the white middle class epistemology of fairness and justice, the ghetto autodescription seems unreal, dis- torted, exaggerated and illogical, and the ghetto exodescription of the white society seems outrageous and unjust. In order to make an epistemological translation it is useful, but not always necessary, to choose a pivot concept. A pivot concept is an object of perception which appears in the descriptions of both sides, but per- ceived differently. In our case any one or all of the following can serve as a pivot concept: policemen, probation and parole officers, social workers, shop owners (we can also add employment agencies, school teachers, courts and churches). These are the contact points bet- ween the Black ghetto and white middle class. From the ghetto point of view, the contact is forced from outside, is harmful, and is to be avoided as much as possible. From the middle class point of view, the contact is supposed to benefit the ghetto people and is expected to be welcomed with open arms by ghetto residents. The contact persons are believed to be law-abiding and conscientious. It is exactly this two- faced nature of this contact that creates frictions and misunderstandings</page><page sequence="11">Epistemology of Social Science Research 939 between the Black ghetto and the white middle class. This is why I chose these contact persons as the pivot concept. For brevity, let me call them "immediate oppressors". I do not intend to mean that all ghetto policemen, probation and parole officers, social workers and show own- ers are oppressors. Many of them are non-oppressive. But what counts is the fact that oppressive ones stand out conspicuously and outweigh the effects of non-oppressive ones. The result is overwhelmingly an impression of the abuse of the legally powerless by the legally powerful . The law and the legal machinery appear to be tools of injustice, not tools of justice. The concentration of the legal power in the immediate oppressors creates a virtual legal feudalism from which there is no escape to justice. Now, taking the immediate oppressors as the pivot concept, we can proceed wit the epistemological translation. We must use the basic con- cepts in the white middle class epistemology as the main tool for the translation. These concepts, in our case» are justice and fairness. The method I used was to appeal to the white man's sense of justice and fairness. Thus I pointed out three considerations: (1) Unjust and unfair practices of the immediate oppressors. This was done to arouse the indignation in the white reader; (2) the treacherous nature of the im- mediate oppressors who operate against the white middle class ethic on the back of the white middle class; (3) the fact that the whole white society is resented by the Black ghetto simply because the Black ghetto identifies the immediate oppressors with the whole white society. These three considerations established the immediate oppressors' unfairness and injustice to both the Black ghetto and the white society. It naturally follows that the white middle class and the Black ghetto should unite to eliminate their common enemy the "immediate oppressors". As you may have noticed, in focusing on the pivot concept I omitted many other aspects of the Black ghetto and white middle class episte- mologies. Let me discuss these omissions. The most important omission is the fact that the whole ghetto life has been, until the Black Unity movement, based on mutual exploita- tion among the ghetto residents. Of course this is one of the central frames of the ghetto epistemology. But as mentioned, an epistemological translation has to be done in the epistemology of the reader's culture. An average white middle class person cannot easily understand the mechanics of the ghetto life (refs. 42, 43). This is the primary reason for the omission. The second reason is that the mutual exploitation, if mentioned, would be misconstrued to reinforce the white misinterpre-</page><page sequence="12">240 M- Maruyama tation of the Black ghetto. The mutual exploitation among ghetto resi- dents is a result of the oppressive life conditions imposed by the domi- nant society, and is an imitation of the behavior of the white authority figures who demonstrate that success and power come from exploitation and abuse. Therefore the mutual exploitation among ghetto residents is a mirror image of the immediate oppressors' ethics and behavior. An average white reader would fail to see this, and would misconstrue the mutual exploitation as an inherent evil nature of the Black man. The second omission is the average white man's assumption of his superiority over Black men. In fact, this is what Blacks call "white racism". The reason for this omission is that this racism cannot be eli- minated by an intellectual argument and therefore we must find another avenue. An average white man has an emotional need to feel superior to someone, and Black men serve conveniently as "inferiors". The white man rationalizes his "superior" feelings by the "fact" that Black men hold inferior jobs. An appeal to equal opportunity does not produce an experiential resonance in a man who has not been discriminated against, and falls flat as an armchair theory. But an appeal to justice and fairness, especially the mention of the treachery of the immediate oppressors for whose hidden misconduct he has to pick up the repair bill and the displaced blame, can make him jump. In a way, this epistemological translation was an intellectual Judo with the white middle class. The principle of the Judo is to make the opponent fall by his own thrust: If he pushes you pull; if he pulls you push. I appealed to the white epistemology whose thrust is justice and fairness. This was not a cheating, however. The Black ghetto does not reject justice. It wants justice. It wants legal protection. But it never received one. Therefore it had to create its own, like Black Panther Party. The Black ghetto wants policeman who are protective, not abusive. My epistemological translation was a re-writing of a Black ghetto epistemology into the white middle epistemology. It was written in the white epistemology. Therefore it necessarily appears unsatisfactory to the Black epistemology. The main objection against my epistemological translation raised by Black ghetto residents is that it whitewashed the general white racism by scapegoating the immediate oppressors. A part of the answer to the objection was given above. That answer pertained to a specific content of the white middle class epistemology. But there remains another part of the answer which pertains to the inherent nature of epistemological translation. Here is the remainder of the answer.</page><page sequence="13">Epistemology of Social Science Research 24 1 In order to satisfy both sides, an epistemological translation must be carried out in both directions. "La Logique du Ghetto" was a one- way translation. Therefore it was unsatisfactory from the point of view of the Black ghetto epistemology. A translation in the reverse direction would include the following description of the white middle class: "If you look into the white middle class beyond the immediate oppressors, you will find that many, though not all, of the whites abhor injustice and abuse. The only reason they do not stand up with you is because they have not seen the abusive practices of the immediate oppressors. If they hear about them they cannot believe it simply because they are living in a fairer society. They are ignoranty not malicious. Their basi- cally fair mind must be mobilized, not offended. * IIB. T rans-spection Can an outculture person acquire the inculture perspective? He may or may not be able to acquire it completely or even partially. But he can in any case try to approximate it as much as he can. One method he can use is transspection. Transspection is an effort to put oneself in the head of the inculture person. In transspection, one tries to see what the inculture person sees in the inculture perspective and with the in- culture epistemology. One tries to feel what the inculture person feels, and to believe what the inculture person believes. One takes on, as his own, the assumptions of the inculture person. Transspection differs from an analytical, intellectual, "understand- ing" of the inculture thought process. Transspection tries to practice the inculture perspective. Transspection differs from empathy, if em- pathy is to be understood on the basis of the sameness of feelings which can be projected, and on the assumption of the sameness of epistemology between two persons. Transspection tries to learn a foreign perspective, feelings in this foreign perspective and the consequences of such feelings in this foreign context. In the process of the transspection, many questions arise in one's mind regarding the aspects of the culture which he does not yet under- stand. But in transspection, one asks the questions after incorporating as his own as much of the inculture assumptions as he can. For example, one asks questions about ghosts or religious ceremonies, not with an outsider's curiosity, but as an insider who believes in the ghosts. Such transspective "believing" is different from actual believing. One can turn on and off his transspective believing at his will, as com-</page><page sequence="14">242 M. Maruyama pared to his actual believing which is permanent. A successful trans- spector appears as if he is earnestly being initiated in the foreign culture to become a genuine member of the culture. However, transspection is not a dishonesty in the sense of mere behavioral appearance to deceive inculture persons, because the transspector earnestly tries to put himself in the heady not only in the "shoes" or the body of the inculture persons. III. Philosophy regarding communication In addition to the epistemological differences between cultures, there are other factors which, if not taken into consideration, distort the research. One of them is the cultural differences in the philosophy regarding communication. I have first become aware of this factor while I was studying the interpersonal communication behavior in Scandi- navia (refs. 14+44). In Sweden, the main purpose of usual interpersonal communication is transmission of facts. In Denmark, on the other hand, the main purpose of usual interpersonal communication is perpetuation of a familiar atmosphere and a comfortable equilibrium of affect. The Swedes strive for factual interest and objective accuracy, while the Danes cultivate the art of not hurting anybody's and one's own feelings. In Denmark, question-asking and expression of knowledge or feelings are considered aggressive and are avoided as much as possible except for specific professional meetings. Factual questions, even on imper- sonal matters, are impolite because they may reveal someone's ignorance who cannot answer the questions. Explanations are also impolite because they assume that someone is ignorant enough to need an explanation. Factual discussions are avoided because a disagreement implies that someone is wrong. Intellectual conversations usually evolve around arts, literature, music and other subjective topics on which disagreements cause no embarrassment. There are small circles of persons who engage in objective discussions. But they are a minority. Because the direct expressions of strong feelings are avoided, the Danes cultivate psychological projection, introspection, subjective inter- pretation and the art of guessing one another's feelings. Repression of expression may progress to the point where one is unable to formulate his own problems to himself. "Why should I try to understand anybody or anything, because I don't understand myself in a philosophy of communication common in Denmark. In Denmark, the most enjoyable type of communication happens when a small number of persons gather frequently at the same place,</page><page sequence="15">Epistemology of Social Science Research 243 eating the same pastry, telling the same gossips. Repetition of the famil- iar is the key to the Danish "coziness" (hygge). Such communication is not focused on transmission of new facts. It is oriented toward per- petuation of comfortable equilibrium. A foreign intellectual often makes the inevitable mistake in Den- mark. With all good intentions he tries to win Danes' friendship by showing factual interests in Denmark, being inquisitive about Danish culture, and eager to explain his own culture and his point of view. An ordinary Dane may tolerate him for a while, but will eventually with- draw. I have discussed further details of interpersonal communication in Denmark in ref. 14. Because of cultural differences in philosophy regarding communi- cation, a research design imported from outside into a culture may encounter resistance to communication. For example, among American Indians, receiving a visitor is an occasion for a leisurely expression of hospitality. A door-to-door interviewer violates the Indian philosophy of communication and will not obtain true information. In the ghetto and in prisons, information is a tool for manipulation as will be ex- plained under "unsuspected dangers of information giving". A research design based on the assumption that communication conveys facts for knowledge will not produce facts for knowledge. IV. Relevance resonance Relevance resonance, more than any other types of resonance men- tioned before, is most crucial in transcultural reseach. Definition of relevance resonance is discussed in detail in refs. 1 and 8. Here let us define relevance resonance simply as convergence of purposes. The difficulty in attaining relevance resonance is partly due to the fact that it is all too easy to attain relevance resonance in researches conducted in white middle class communities, and therefore the re- searchers are unaware that there is such thing as relevance resonance which is difficult to attain in other environments. In the white middle class environment, research is generally accepted as a tool for direct or indirect improvement of the life of people under research. The pur- pose of the research as perceived by the people under research coincides with the purpose of the research which the people under research wants the research to accomplish for them. This is not case with some other environments.</page><page sequence="16">244 M* Maruyama IV A. Relevance resonance with American Indians In most of the American Indians' perception , the purpose of too many anthropological researches is usually to benefit the academic com- munity or the museum, or to satisfy the researchers' curiosity or voca- tional drive, or to contribute to the researchers' reputation and pro- motion, or simply to produce salaries for researchers. Indians see the researchers as leading an extravagant life made possible by the research salary. In this sense the researchers are exploiters. Even the medical and educational researches are often suspected, because the white man's philosophy of medicine and education is built on assumptions, values, goals and epistemologies incongruent with many aspects of the Indian cultures. In addition to the academic researches, the historical context of government administration contributed toward Indians' resentment to- ward the researcher. Numerous surveys and researches conducted by the government have produced no visible benefits relevant to the Indian Way while creating highly paid positions for the administrators of new programs which grew out of the research findings. Some of the pro- grams resulting from researches, politically manipulated, have pro- duced detrimental effects on Indians, for example the livestock reduction program on the Navajo Reservation. When the real or perceived purpose of the researcher is incongruent with the purpose desired by the inculture persons, the people under research tend to give restrained or disguised information. This may occur even when the researcher intends to be "helpful" to the inculture persons. For example, in a health survey for the purpose of hospitalizing sick persons on an Indian Reservation, the interviewees may hide their illness if the hospital life contains elements which conflict with their ethical and religious views or with other cultural practices. The out- culture researcher may run into such unsuspected incongruence of pur- poses and may remain unaware of it throughout his research. IV B. Relevance resonance in prison Of the three projects, the prison project was the one in which rele- vance resonance was most crucial. Prison inmates are often interviewed by newspaper reporters, magazines writers, student interns, sociologists, criminologists and psychologists. Each of these interviewers comes with a certain purpose which, in the perception of the inmates, is often irre-</page><page sequence="17">Epistemalogy of Social Science Research 245 levant to or contrary to what the purpose of such interviews should be from the inmates' point of view. The most frequent purposes of the interviewers as perceived by the inmates are : Journalists and writers : to write articles which will sell, i.e. to make money; to reinforce what the public wants to believe; to manipulate the climate of opinion for a political, economic or legislative faction; to advocate the writer's own point of view; to help the "power structure" in imposing its distorted or defective perspective of social reality upon the public. Student interns : to earn certificates, academic credits, do-gooder status or "professional" status of having worked with "criminals". Academic researchers: to test academic hypotheses and to perpetuate academic theories which are blind to what is actually relevant in real situations; to produce publications as a tool for recognition, reputation and promotion; or simply to earn a living from the research salary. Inmates , on the other hand, want to accomplish the following purposes in the interviews: (1) to make the public aware of the living and working conditions, physical and mental treatments, and some inadequate or arbitrary procedures in the prison which often fall far below what the public is made to believe. (2) to make the society see, from an inside perspective, the conditions of the environments which produce crimes and from which most of the inmates came. (3) If the inmate is suffering under specific injustice or abusive prac- tice, to open a channel for rectifying the injustice. (4) to improve through public pressure the often substandard voca- tional and education programs in prison. (5) to express their feelings and opinions which they think are entitled to be heard by the public. (6) to have an opportunity to be considered as human being, to be listened to and to be respected by the interviewer, and to talk on a person-to-person, human-to-human basis with the interviewer. (7) to solve the inmate's psychological problems if the interviewer io a professional. (8) Through the interviewer, to obtain contacts for or means for self- improvement such as books, legal service, counseling, discussion groups etc. (The means available within the prison are often very limited. Some prisons even discourage or deny such means.) (9) to prevent young people in the society from becoming criminals.</page><page sequence="18">246 M- Maruyama As will be discussed under "unsuspected dangers of information giving", an information leakage in a prison may become a matter of life and death. Prison inmates therefore have a very sophisticated, complex technique of giving phony information, tailored to each spe- cific type of interviewer, which satisfies the interviewer and at the same time protects the inmates. Inmates are quite often versed in sociology, psychology and psychiatry, and know how to fool professional re- searchers. One of the standard games the inmates play with the prison psychiatrist is to manufacture symptoms of severe mental disturbance, play them out before the psychiatrist, and reduce them gradually in order to get a report of "improvement". Lack of relevance resonance produces phony information from the interviewee. The inmates detects the lack of relevance resonance in several ways: (a) noticing an instrumentalizing attitude in the inter- viewer; (b) giving reaction tests to the interviewer; and (c) observation of the interviewer's action before and after the interview, (a) Instrumentalizing attitude of the interviewer manifests itself in one or several of the following ways: (1) Using pre-set tests or pre-set questions which do not accomodate what the inmate really wants to communicate. (2) Considering the inmate as a response machine without allowing interchange or independent contribution. (3) considering the inmate as a statistical or clinical object. (4) Relying heavily on "official records" of the inmate, attributing more validity to official records than to the inmate himself. (5) Building his knowledge on books and theories, even though he is unacquainted with real situations. (6) Posing himself as an "expert" while discrediting the inmate's experience and insight as "unscientific". (7) Distrustful of the inmate. (8) Insensitive to, unresponsive to or unaware of the inmate's feelings. (9) Lack of interest in or desire to know the inmate's point of view and concern. (10) Evasive in expressing his own points of view, attitudes, feelings and goals. (11) Aloofness. (12) Patronizing or condescending attitude. (13) Naivity regarding the way the prison operates. (14) Apathy or lack of cause, involvement and commitment.</page><page sequence="19">Epistemology of Social Science Research 247 (b) The reaction test consists in (1) value test and (2) click-in test. In the value test, the inmate drops hints and observes the reaction of the interviewer in order to detect the interviewer's value orientation. In the click-in test, the inmate mentions some topic casually to see whether the interviewer catches its relevance and picks up the topic or remains unaffected by the topic. Examples of such topics are: police harassment, court-appointed attorney, school teachers, store owners, genocide. (c) The action observation method consists in seeing whether the inter- viewer puts in action what he promises or advocates; how promptly and energetically he does so; and how skillful he is in manoeuvering through the obstacles. As may be noticed, some of the components of these three tests of relevance resonance require sharing of experience, life goals and action. In this sense relevance resonance is related to experiential resonance , existential resonance and commitment resonance. Definitions of these terms are given in refs. 1, 8 and 36. For our present purpose the follow- ing brief description will suffice: Experiential resonance: Feeling of solidarity between persons induced by similarity of past experiences. Experiential resonance may be divided into affect resonance and cognitive resonance . Existential resonance: Feeling of solidarity between persons induced by shared meaning of life, philosophical meaning of self (not self- image), goal of life and care toward others. Commitment resonance: Feeling of solidarity between persons induced by the same degree of voluntary commitment to the same cause. Let us illustrate some of these resonances by an example. When a ghetto resident speaks of police harassment, he feels anger in him. This anger is a recurring and persistent ingredient of his daily life. It is a chronic obsession. He is sick and tired of being harassed, and he is sick and tired of thinking about it. He is used to it yet he has a low tolerance for it. When a middle class researcher hears about police harassment, he does not feel the same anger in him. First, nothing in his experience approaches the type of anger the ghetto resident feels. This is a lack of affect resonance . Second, the policeman in the middle class neigh- borhood does not harass people. Consequently "police harassment" does not strike the researcher as reality on the cognitive level. This is a lack of cognitive resonance . In the absence of both affect resonance and cognitive resonance, the researcher may not grasp the full significance</page><page sequence="20">248 M. Màruyama of police harassment, and may skip over it or underrate it, and steer the interview accordingly. The interviewee judges the researcher by this performance. The interviewee may perceive the researcher as delib- erately ignoring police harassment. He may even perceive the researcher as endorsing police harassment. Or if he is perceptive, he may realize that the researcher does not live in the same social reality as his. This is the awareness of lack of existential resonance . If the researcher pro- mises to use the research findings to improve the conditions in the ghetto, the interviewee knows that such an "improvement" will treat only the effect of, but not the cause of one of the basic problems in the ghetto. The interviewee sees the promise as useless. This is one type of lack of commitment resonance . Another type of lack of commitment resonance occurs, for example, as follows. Suppose that the interviewee succeeded in making the researcher realize the significance of police harassment in the ghetto. Now the researcher "understands" it intellectually. But he does not "feel" the harassment himself. Therefore he does not devote himself to the reduction of police harassment through as much emphasis in his research report as the interviewee would if the interviewee were to write the report himself. This is a lack of commitment resonance . V. Unsuspected danger in information giving The life in certain environments involves several types of dangers which are unknown to the middle class and are therefore unsuspected by and disbelieved by the middle class. The dangers may come either (1) from persons connected with the authority system imposed from outside; or (2) inculture members of the community. In both cases, the existence of the primary danger sources can be used as a leverage by those who manipulate the fear of the primary danger sources. These manipulators are the secondary danger sources . The term "secondary" does not mean "less dangerous". In fact, the secondary danger sources may be as deadly as or deadlier than the primary danger sources. Then there are those who manipulate the fear of the secondary danger sources. These are the tertiary danger sources . To be more specific: Primary danger sources: prison guards, policemen, thieves, money col- lectors, murderers, livestock reduction agents, etc. Secondary danger sources: snitches (finks, informers) who give real or purposefully fictitious information to the primary danger sources for the purpose of having the primary danger sources strike the informers, rivals or for the purpose of being rewarded by the primary danger</page><page sequence="21">Epistemology of Social Science Research 249 Tertiary danger sources : counterspies, snitch killers, false-jacketers (Those who label an innocent man as a snitch in order to have him killed by snitch killers). Fourth level dangers sources : the false- jacketed (who must retaliate and kill the man whom he believes to be his false-jacketer), detecters of false-jacketers, etc. Let us discuss the situations separately for prisons, the ghetto, and the Navajo Reservation. V A. Prison 1. Danger from other inmates: The prison life is characterized by extreme scarcity of things and occasions which fulfil basic human needs. These needs range from ma- terial needs such as cigarets and toothpaste, physical needs of sex, to emotional needs such as opportunity for expression of manhood, proof of one's own worth to himself, recognition by others, autonomy and privacy. Therefore a conflict over one pack of cigarets, one small insult or inadvertent physical contact may lead to physical fights and murder. In the prison project the inmate researchers listed sixty-four categories of the tt interpersonal factor" plus numerous other categories of other institutional and situational factors contributing to physical fights. Here are excerpts from some of the categories of the interpersonal factor: Collector : Example: Z loans Y one carton of cigarets for two weeks at 100 percent interest rate (repay the double). After two weeks Y is unable to pay. Z raises the interest rate to 200 percent and hires X to collect for 50 percent fee. Y is still unable to pay, or refuses to pay. X stabs Y. Deliver message: Example: X tells Y to tell Z to meet him behind the gym. Y tells Z. Z beats Y for not minding his own business. Explore reactions: (One person agitates another just to see what he will do). Example: X reads and tears up one of Y's letters for no apparent îeason. Y asks X why. X beats Y. False jacket: Example: Y tells Z that X is a homosexual. When X finds out, he stabs Y. Fear of being informed on: Example: Z sees X stab Y. X is afraid that Z will snitch on him. So X stabs Z. Homosexuals: Example: H (homosexual) is approached by Y and asked for a date. H refuses stating that he is married to X. At this moment X arrives on the scene, and when he finds out what is going on, he beats Y almost to death.</page><page sequence="22">250 M. Maruyama Isolation: X is afraid of being stabbed by Z. X stabs Y, whom he does not know, in order to get locked up in the isolation unit where he is safe from Z. Protection : Example: W is paying Y four cartons a month for protection (from others' physical attack). X tells W, "I can protect you for two cartons a month*. W stops paying Y and begins paying X. X and Y fight. Jealousy : Y tells X he receives letters with money in them every day. Further he says that he has not missed a draw (periodical cashing of personal funds) since he has been in prison. X calls Y a mama's boy and hits Y. Teach lesson . Example: X loans Y some shaving cream. The next morn- ing Y takes some shaving cream without asking X. X hits Y to teach him to always ask. Other categories of the interpersonal factor in physical fights are: accumulated hostility from different sources; boredom; bully; challenge: cliques; demonstrate not a fool; disagreement; displaced aggression: dope; drinking; face saving; fear of being beat up; gambling; get down first; grudge; help friends; hopeless outlook on life; insult; loans; mis- taken identity; misinterpretation; misunderstanding; no motive; no respect; opportune time; outside influences; paid violence; peace maker; personality clash; place saving; political disagreement; principles; pro- perty destruction; protection; protect friend; prove self to others; psy- cho; race; reputation; request not fulfilled; resent being told by others; resent custodial staff; resent informers; restore self-image; retain self- image; revenge; rumors; seek to impress others; seeking acceptance by others; self-defense; show-off; signify; television; theft; want to stay in prison; wheeling and dealing; communicative abilities; inexperienced persons; racial, ethnic or family loyalties; neighborhood or hometown loyalties; personal loyalties; economic status. 2. Danger from prison guards: There are two forms of danger from prison guards: harassment and abuse. Harassment is hostile behavior within legal limits or with a legal pretext on the part of the guards. Abuse is illegal hostile behavior on the part of the guards, such as physical assault or denial of medical care. Let us emphasize that there are individual differences among prison guards. Some are calm. Others have tempers. Some are fair. Others are</page><page sequence="23">Epistemology of Saciai Science Research 951 sadistic. Some are respected by inmates. Others are despised. Not all guards practice harassment or abuse. But what is relevant in the inmate life is that there are harassments and abuses which become the source of a realistic fear. Harassment and abuse have three functions: message , harm and pro- vocation. The message is: "I hate you. I am doing this to you because I hate you. You hate me but you cannot do anything to me". The harm may be physical or otherwise: Beating, shooting, suspension of a pri- vilege, denial of a legal right, destruction of personal belongings, incon- veniences, etc. Provocation has the purpose of inciting a hostile attitude in inmates to rationalize the guard's abuse which follows the provo- cation. The direct harm may be negligible as compared to the message it intends to communicate and to the provocation it intends to create. The message and the provocation, much more than harm, create resentment and tension. Outsiders tend to see only the direct harm without realizing the message, the provocation and the resulting tension. This is why the outsiders are unaware of or inappreciative of the fear and the indi- gnation in the prison inmates. Common harassments Shaking down: The guard stops the inmate and searches his pockets, etc. Probable message: "You are on the black list. Better be careful, or you will get busted." Strip down: The guard orders the inmate to get completely undressed. This is usually done in full view of the prison population. Then the guard orders: "Pull up your balls (testicles)", "Spread your ass (rec- tum)" etc. pretending to search hidden objects under the testicles or in the rectum. The guard as well as the inmate and the onlookers know that there is nothing hidden under the testicles or in the rectum. Mes- sage: "I hate you especially. This is why I am humiliating you in front of everybody." Cell search: The cell of an inmate may be searched for legitimate rea- sons such as a check on narcotics or knives. But a cell search may be done for harassment. The search "squad" may cut up the bed matress, tear the seams of clothes, slit the toothpaste tube, and scatter the family photos and religious symbols on the floor. The family photos or the religious symbols are often the inmate's only means to maintain his tie with his family or to remind him that he is an individual, not a number.</page><page sequence="24">252 M. Maruyama If the squad drops these objects on the floor, the inmate feels as if his whole family or his whole individuality is slaughtered. Cigarets and toothpastes are purchased by the inmate at the canteen. If they are destroyed, it becomes a net loss. The inmate may owe some cigarets to another inmate. If he is unable to repay, he may get stabbed. Clothes are "issue items", but the inmate is made responsible for their maintenance. The trousers and the jackets are stamped with the in- mate's ID number. Though the uniform is the same, many inmates express their individuality by having their shoes shined and the trousers pressed and creased by inmates who work in the laundry, etc., paying them in cigarets. If these clothes are destroyed, the inmate loses his pride in individuality as well as cigarets which function as money. A vicious variation of cell search is a "planted" violation. While the inmate is away from his cell, a guard places some illegal item in the inmate's cell. The guard then calls the squad to raid the cell. This is one of the ways the guard can get a clean inmate busted. Delayed or denied pass : The guard may delay or withhold the deliverv of a clinic pass or a visiting room pass. As a result, the inmate may miss his wife's visit or may not see her until near the end of the visiting hour. The wife may have travelled over a long distance, and may have to wait many hours in vain. Unfair job assignments: Inmates' jobs range from manual labor to automechanic or file clerk. Some jobs serve as a vocational training. There are official criteria of eligibility for each assignment. For exam- ple, narcotic offenders may not be assigned to hospital duty. But unof- ficial discriminations may be practiced inspite of the official eligibility. Some jobs, for example cell assignment clerk, gives the inmate a lever- age over other inmates. Inmates, especially homosexuals, may bribe the cell assignment clerk to obtain a desired cell or cell partner. Such jobs are lucrative. These jobs may be obtained by bribing a guard or by doing a personal favor to a guard. Inmates holding these jobs may also become a tool of guards to exercise favoritism on inmates. Picking on trifles, called chickenshit beef. There are small violations which are usually tolerated, for example taking a slice of bread from the mess hall left over on the tray, or possessing one extra pair of socks. A guard may single out an inmate and write him up for these usually tolerated violations. The inmates' phraseology for beying given a chick- enshit beef is "to be violated" by the guard. These "beefs" may cause the inmate to be transferred to a cell block with less privileges, or delav his release.</page><page sequence="25">Epistcmology of Social Science Research 253 Abuses : The usual form of abuses are physical attacks and refusal to issue a hospital pass, or intentional neglect to take a very ill or seriously injured inmate to the hospital. These are self-explanatory. Tension : The tension created by harassment and abuse is underesti- mated by outsiders. Contrary to the general belief, when the prison authority tightens up its control over inmates, there tends to be an increase of fighting and killing among inmates. When the guards begin stopping inmates to search for concealed knives or when the number of guards in the "yard" increases suddenly, tension strikes the prison yard like a lightning. Inmates anticipate and prepare for an outbreak of violence. The percentage of inmates carrying a knife in- creases. Inmates, fearful and suspicious, are ready to attack anyone with the slightest real or imaginary sign of hostility. Under such con- ditions some guards tend to become trigger-happy. There was another consideration in the prison system where our project was conducted: the inmates are punished more severely for a possession of a hidden knife than for stabbing an inmate. When guards start shaking down inmates, some inmates stab anybody who happens to be nearby in order to get a lighter punishment. Completely innocent inmates may stabbed under such circumstances. This adds to the fear and the tension. Increase of harassment also contributes toward increase of resent- ment and frustration which, in displacement, finds an outlet in increased fights among inmates. The prison staff may create tension among prison inmates for poli- tical purposes. For example, the prison administration may instigate one racial group of inmates against another racial group of inmates in order to weaken the solidarity among the inmates. Or the prison guards may stage a "riot" among inmates in order to "prove" the need for increased budget or personnel. 3. Information to be hidden from other inmates: a. Amount of cigar ets one possesses: cigarets function as money in the prisons. If it is known that an inmate has many cigarets, he may be pressured to repay his debts, to make laons to someone or to engage in wheeling and dealing as a partner. Or if it becomes known that his supply is depleted, his bluffing and bargaining power decreases. b. Amount of other items in possession : To prevent theft, this informa- tion should be kept secret. c. Amount of debts : If this is known, one may become victim to loan</page><page sequence="26">254 M. Maruyama sharks, or someone may offer financial help or physical protection from debt collectors in exchange for homosexual act. d. Amount of gambling gain: If this becomes known, one may be pres- sured into repayment of debts. e. Payment to protector : It is known that an inmate is paying some- one for physical protection from enemy, others may challenge the protector to take his business away. f. Plot against other inmates: Plots for physical attack or for financial or sexual exploitation. 4. Spies for other inmates : A spy for other inmates, when discovered, is likely to be challenged into a physical fight. 5. Information to be hidden from the guards: There are reasonable as well as unreasonable regulations. The inmate may violate regulations for good or bad purposes. Inmates protect one another from punishment, harassment, and abuse. The inmate ethics require that an inmate would rather suffer a false accusation by guards than to disclose another inmate's hidden facts. 6. Snitches: Spies for the prison authority are called snitches. Snitching is the most despised and resented act among the inmates. If a snitch is discovered, he may be killed, or may be pressured into paying a large portion of his monthly allowance for several years to the person on whom he snitched. Sometimes a guard may spread a false rumor that an inmate is a snitch in order to get the inmate attacked by other in- mates. Or the guards may set several inmates against one another by telling each of them that the others have snitched on him. 7. Informers against guards and prison authority : Inmates who expose to outsiders the harassments, abuses and other "irregularities" practiced in the prison are retaliated against by the guards and the prison author- ity. They may be punished or subjected to greater harassments and abuses. Their release may be postponed for several years. The prison authority tightly controls the information channels to the outside. Letters from inmates are censored. Visitors as well as the inmates who talk with the visitors are registered. Thus the prison authority has several means to identify the inmates who have informed against the prison authority. Therefore the visitors who receive the information from the inmates cannot publicly use the information against the prison authority</page><page sequence="27">Epistemulogy of Social Science Research 255 for fear of retaliation by the prison authority against the inmates. This renders the use of such information ineffective. 8. Research participants suspected as snitches . Inmates have good rea- sons to suspect that the findings of any research can fall into the wrong hands. The researchers, and the organizers and the sponsors of the research may make their best efforts to keep the research data confi- dential. But they may be unaware of all the dangers of information- giving and all the complex channels of information leakage, and may unwittingly pass information to someone who may snitch or slip. An inmate has no reason to give any information to anybody unless there is a very worthwhile cause for which he is willing to risk the danger which may result from the information-giving, and unless theres an evidence (promise is not enough) of absolute confidentiality. At the beginning of our project the inmate researchers had to test me, and the inmate interviewees had to test the inmate researchers. " Isotope tesť is a frequently used technique used by inmates to test a person. First the inmate gives a person a very safe information or a fictitious infor- mation, and observes where it will leak, just as an isotope is used to trace the path of materials in the body of an organism. If no leakage is found after several days, the inmate will give the person an addi- tional dose of slightly more dangerous information and observes the results. The process is repeated. If at any stage there is an indication that the information has leaked to the guards or to the prison adminis- tration, the inmate will from then on give phony information to the person. If information leakage is found at any stage during the research project, the inmate researchers as well as the inmate interviewees become suspected as snitches by the inmate population. If this happens, further interviews will produce phony information, and the inmate researchers and the earlier interviewees will risk physical danger, even death. 9. If the prison authority suspects that the research is producing infor- mation which the prison authority wants to hide, the project may be administratively harassed or terminated, and the inmate researchers and the interviewees may be transferred to units or jobs which make them impossible to participate in further research activities. If individual guards fear the research project, they may harass and abuse the inmate researchers and the interviewees.</page><page sequence="28">256 M. Maruyama Aside from the leakage of hidden facts, there are some other con- siderations which cause the prison staff to resist against research. A prison, like many other institutions, has a well-established tradition and a subtly maintained equilibrium among its mutually opposing compo- nents. For example, the prison school teachers may disagree with the guards on the treatement of inmates, but both sides sustain between them a workable relationship buffered by elaborate routines. A new project of any type may upset the tradition and the equilibrium. Especially a research project using inmates as researchers may cause anxiety among the prison staff for the following reasons: (a) Research activités may upset daily routines, for example (i) per- mitting the inmates to go to a privilege area where the interview is held. This creates an unwanted traffic; (ii) taking participants away from their daily assignments. This creates a shortage of man- power; (iii) issuing passes to interviewees. This creates an extra paperwork. (b) The administrative policy to permit the presence of a new type of project may alter the balance of power between conflicting factions within the prison. (c) Use of inmates as researchers may upset the traditional "place" (status) of inmates. (d) Those who regard certain parts of the prison as their personal ter- ritory may feel their psychological security threatened by the "tress- passing" research project. (e) Those staff members whose self-image is built on "knowing the inmates" better than anybody else may feel their self-image chal- lenged by the research project. (f) Those who are supposed to "know" the inmates but do not know may fear that their ignorance or incompetence may be revealed by the project. If the anxiety level becomes sufficiently high, the prison staff can harass the project or create inconveniences and difficulties to disable the project. If the anxiety level is kept to the minimum, the project may obtain a full cooperation of the prison staff. Our team decided that the less conspicuous the project, the less anxiety it would create among the staff. We behaved as if ours was not a new type of project. We also took special care not to violate any rules or offend the prison staff. In the dining room I avoided to sit with white-collar staff members who tended to ask questions about the project.</page><page sequence="29">Epistemodogy of Social Science Research 257 V B. Ghetto Just as in the prisons, there are two sources of danger in the ghetto: other ghetto residents; and legal authorities such as policemen, pro- bation and parole officers, social workers and shop keepers. 1. Danger from other residents: First, knife or gun fights may result from unpaid debts, insult, chal- lenge to manhood, gambling, theft or simply from accumulated frus- trations. A materially insignificant matter may have serious implica- tions. For example, if someone owes you one dollar and refuses to repay, he may be testing you to see how far he can take advantage of you or can ignore your existence. If he gets away with one dollar this time, he will try you for ten dollars next time. You must get the one dollar back, even with a gun. The ghetto residents do not get much protective ser- vice from the police. A crime committed by one person against another in the ghetto is usually settled by a direct retaliation. 2. Danger from, legal authorities: As in prisons, the ghetto residents experience much harassment and abuse from some of the policemen, probation and parole officers. Fur- thermore, some policemen may receive bribes from gambling places, narcotic dealers and pimps. They may "confiscate" into their own pock- ets, on the ground of suspicion, possessions or cash which ghetto residents have earned legally. The following examples are taken from our data: Example: A youth, who worked at a gas station, was standing on the street on an off-duty day. He had just been paid $ 130 the day before, and had the cash in his pocket. A police car came by and slowed down. The policeman shouted: "hey, Nigger, why aren't you working". The Policeman stepped out of the car, ordered the youth to stand against a wall, and searched his pockets. The policeman found $ 130 and told the youth: "Punk, I know vou couldn't have gotten this much unless you stole it. Well, I will let you get away easy this time. I will give you $ 20 back. Make sure you keep your black mouth shut." Example: One of our inculture researchers asked a friend of his to bring a taperecord by car to an interview place. The taperecorder belonged to our project. A policeman stopped the friend's car, found the tape- recorder and confiscated it on the ground that the man had no "proof of purchase" with him. I had to write an official letter to the police department to get the taperecorder released.</page><page sequence="30">258 M. Maruyama Example: A Black teen-ager borrowed his father's car to take his girl friend to the annual highschool party. A policeman stopped their car, and asked the youth where he had stolen the car. No amount of explana- tion satisfied the policeman. Finally the policeman phoned to the youth's father to confirm the youth's explanation. Then they were released. But they were half-an-hour late for the party. Example: A parolee was sitting in his apartment with two sisters who came to visit him from New York. A parole officer knocked on the door and came in, and made a remark that these girls were prostitutes the parolee was pimping. Example: A Black man had just completed his military service and was on his way home hitch-hiking. A car brought him to a place a mile or two away from his house. He started to walk toward his house, going through a white residential area. A policeman stopped him and told him: "Hey, Black boy, this isn't where you belong. I'd better not see your Black face around here again." These examples did not come from Southern States. They came from cities in Northern California. As in the prison, these harassments and abuses contain a message and provocation which create resentment and tensions in the ghetto. There is an additional consideration in the ghetto which does not exist in the prison. It is loss of present and future employment due to arrests or confiscation without proof of guilt. Ghetto residents can seldom afford a bail. Detention on the ground of suspicion or impounding of a car causes loss of job. Moreover, the "arrest" record will handicap a person in obtaining future employments even if he has been proved not guilty. There is also what corresponds to "chickenshit beef" in the prison. For some arbitrary reason a parole officer may send a parolee back to the prison for a very minor violation or for a far-fetched violation. Certain types of violations are impossible to avoid because of some un- realistic regulations. For example, regulations may require that a parolee cannot associate with another parolee, a prostitute or a member of "radical" organizations. A parolee, who has no choice but to live in a ghetto, cannot avoid running into other parolees, prostitutes or members of "radical" organizations. Usually violations of these regulations are tolerated. But they can be used for a "chickenshit beef". Social workers and shopkeepers can obtain information on a ghetto person which he may want to hide from other ghetto residents or from the legal authorities.</page><page sequence="31">Epis'temology of Social Science Research 259 3. Information lo be hidden from neighbors Money on hand , wins and losses in gambling. This information may be used to pressure repayments of debts, making new loans, refusing new loans etc. Working hours , hours of absence from home: This information may be used by thieves. The ghetto resident often leaves the radio or a lamp on while absent, in order to give the impression that someone is home. Place of work : An example would best illustrate. A woman worked as a secretary at the City Hall during daytime and as a prostitute in the evening. A neighbor told the City Hall that the woman was a pros- titute. The woman lost the job, and the neighbor got the job. In this case it was dangerous to let the City Hall know of her place of work in the evening. It was also dangerous to let her neighbors know of her place of daytime work. Possession of small , handy appliances such as a toaster, coffee maker, iron, or a small stereo set. These items attract thieves. The ghetto resi- dent prefers to have a bulky stereo set which can be nailed to the wall in order to avoid theft. 4. Information to be hidden from the police Selling of narcotics , gambling: These may be necessary for income, but are punishable. Possession of guns: Necessary for self-defense, but punishable. Location of employment: The police often comes to arrest a person at the place of his work. The employer, seeing the visible arrest, may fire him, or a prolonged detention may cause him to lose his job even if he is later found not guilty. Home address , names of friends and relatives, and location of hang-out places: Used by the police for arrest. 5. Information to be hidden from the social worker Employment: Until the 1969 revision of the welfare system, unem- ployment was usually a requirement for welfare eligibility. Under- employed persons needed welfare, yet had to keep the employment secret to the social worker. Presence of husband or boyfriend : Often absence of husband was a requirement for welfare eligibility. Presence of a male visitor may be misinterpreted by the social worker and make the recipient ineligible. Personal possessions of some monetary value : Such as a stereo set, a television or a car. Often these counted against the eligibility.</page><page sequence="32">260 M. Maruyama V G. Navajo Reservation The life on the Navajo Reservation is quite serene. Even though there are important economic, medical, cultural and political issues, they do not manifest in violent forms. Navajos believe in and practice harmony among people. Physical fights are almost non-existent except in a small percentage of youths and only when they are intoxicated. The Navajo tribal police, event though considered as "Uncle Toma- hawks" by some of the Navajos, is usually peaceful. The white traders no longer monopolize the market on the Navajo Reservation. There are Navajo-owned stores which compete with white-owned stores. Communal economy, such as communal feeding at religious ceremo- nies is still widely practiced, even though the tradition of mutual volun- teer labor among the tribesmen is gradually replaced by the idea of paid labor. The "exploiters" as perceived by Navajos consist mainly of anthro- pologists, tourists and Bureau of Indian Affairs officials. But even in this aspect, many (but not all) Navajos respect some anthropologists like Clyde Kluckhohn, and many Navajos regard some of the BIA operations as helpful. On of the strongest resentments against outsiders occurred regarding the Livestock Reduction Program which destroyed between 1934 and 1943 more than one half of animals owned by Navajos. The purpose of the program, supposedly, was to prevent overgrazing of the land. But many cases are known in which the animals, taken away from Navajos, were given to white traders who kept grazing the same ani- mals on the land of Navajos. The political pressure from the white livestocksmen in Southwestern States who feared the competition from Navajos was partly responsible for the creation of the program. A great percentage of the Navajos were impoverished and could not recover economically for many years. Even now the Navajos are reluctant to reveal the number of animals they possess to visitors from outside. An- other source of strong resentment was the compulsory internship of chil- dren into the government boarding schools. But as a whole, resistance to information-giving on the Navajo reservation stems mainly from the researcher's lack of relevance reso- nance rather than from the danger of information-giving per se. VI. Some of the data and epistemologie s The epistemological gain in the three projects was evident in two aspects: (1) in the conceptualization, methodology and research design;</page><page sequence="33">Epistemology of Social Science Research 261 (2) in the data obtained. Both are extensively treated in ref. 8. Even a summary of it would be too long for our present article. Therefore we discuss only a small segment of both aspects here. 1. Epistemologies reflected in the conceptualization , methodology and research design . For this discussion, let us choose the prison project as an example. Furthermore, let us limit our discussion to some excerpts from the end of Chapter 6 of ref. 8. These are excerpts from my comments on the differences between the factor lists of physical fights, which the inmate research teams had conceptually produced prior to their research design, and academically common conceptualizations regarding physical fights in so-called "high delinquency environments". It should be emphasized that the comparison between the inmates' conceptualization and the academic conceptualizations was made by me and was therefore written in the academic epistemology. The inmate researchers formulated their conceptualizations directly from their own experience, independent from and oblivious to the academic conceptualizations. The inmate research- ers' primary motivation was to put down on paper the factors as they see them, rather than to write a critique of the academic conceptual- izations. Therefore they were not making a deliberate effort to be dif- ferent from academic conceptualizers. They were trying to be as natural to themselves as possible. The comparative terms I use below are mine. The inmate researchers did not even think in such comparative terms. My comparison at the end of the Chapter 6, ref. 8, is 2,000 words in length. Here are some excerpts: (1) There are less group structures and "leaders" than assumed by outsiders. The majority of the violent incidents are individual affairs, not gang affairs. (2) Most of the inmates are individual offenders, and while in the prison most of them are trying to stay out of trouble. The percent- age of "professional criminals" is small. (3) There are certain patterns, or "logic", of violence, which are not too complicated. Most of the violence is neither random nor very elaborate. Violence is expectable in many situations, if not com- pletely predictable. Many inmates learn how to avoid getting into most of the violence-producing situations. (4) Situations, which seem safe in the outside society, may be dan- gerous in the prison. Some of them are difficult to get out of if one has fallen into them.</page><page sequence="34">262 M- Maruyama (5) Threshold of aggression is very low, and damage can be dispro- portional to the stimulus. Example: X's hobby is carving. Y has no hobby. X is busy carving. Y wants to talk with X and hangs around. X tells Y to come back later. Y does not leave. X cuts Y with the carving knife. (6) In the prison one cannot escape easily from his ennemy. The- refore self-defense may include an aggression to ward off an anticipated aggression. Example: Y tells X he is going to attack X on the following day at noon. X hits Y with a pipe at 8 am that morning. (7) Sometimes the potential for violence is barely hidden under the surface even when the individual is striving for peace. Example: W and Y are arguing. X asks them to break it up. W wants X to mind his own business. X stabs W. (8) Violence can be purchased as a cheap labor. There are inmates who can be hired for murder for a few packs of cigaret. Scarcity of material supplies inflates the value of material possessions. (9) There are violences over the right to prevent violence. For exam- ple, see Protector as discussed under "Unsuspected danger in information giving." (10) Almost paranoid sensitivity. Example: X is punching speed bag at the gym. Y asks if he can use the bag for a few minutes. When X let Y use the bag. Y hits it much better than X. X interprets this as Y telling X that Y is a better fighter. Later X stabs Y to show who is the better fighter. (11) Homosexuals are usually accepted. Female role players may be- come wives, freelancers or prostitutes, creating as varied situations as exist among men and women in the outside society. (12) The institutional factors have a much larger effect on the violence among inmates than imagined by outsiders. Example: Harass- ment, recreational facilities, size of institution, freedom of move- ment inside the prison, distance from family, draw day, bad food. Illustration: draw-day: This is pay day when inmates are issued their money in the form of tickets, and they buy their personal articles at the canteen. There are long lines at the canteen win- dows, there are collectors moving about threatening, there are hustlers who are selling, there are muggers or package snatchers, there are protectors, there are the officers attempting to maintain order, searching for weapons, alert for violence, and sometimes over-zealous to the extent of adding to the tension and confusion.</page><page sequence="35">Epistemology of Social Science Research 263 (13) Certain terms correspond to realities foreign to the academic mind. They are conceptually and e pis temolo gicallly different, not simply semantically different, from the concepts in the academic mind: i.e. they are not a matter of differences in word coverages on concepts or recombinations of subconcepts existing in the aca- demic mind, but they involve conceptual and relational dimensions which do not exist in the academic mind. For example, the team in Prison B divided the factors contributing to physical fights into three groupings: Institutional factors, demographic factors and personality factors. One of the seven personality factors was "out- look on life", which is further divided into "philosophies", "con- cepts of life", "attitudes" and "feelings". Each of these subdivisions has some examples: Outlook on life: Philosophies: everything is pre-determined; life is a struggle for sur- vival; efforts do not pay; might makes right. Concepts of life: Don't need anybody; owes me a living; there is no such thing as good and bad; Everybody is a crook. Attitudes : Don't care; never give up; live day by day; everything I do is right. Feelings: Kindness is weakness; never give a sucker an even break; better to hit than talk; step on those in your way. When the team came up with this list and the examples, I could not see clear distinctions between philosophies, concepts, attitudes and feel- ings as illustrated by the examples. For example, in my mind "kindness is weakness" could be put under "philosophy" along with "might makes right". Yet the inmate researchers said that these are four clearly dis- tinct subcategories, and that the examples are not interchangeable bet- ween the categories. The inmates saw four distinct dimensions where I saw only one, or atmost two dimensions. It was clear that they were using words to describ certain dimensions in their reality which do not exist in my reality, even though the words existed in my vocabulary and corresponded to something which existed in my reality. Even today, I am unable to see these four dimensions and their relational structure. An academic may try to define these four subcategories inductively from the examples given, but the result would be an inadequate distinction between the shadows reduced into the academic dimension. Such dimen- sion reduction may produce self-consistent explanation which satisfies the explainer but is incorrect. Dimension reduction is fully discussed in refs. 1 and 5. Let us take two examples:</page><page sequence="36">264 M. Maruyama Example 1 Y A ball is thrown, making a parabolic orbit as shown. Let us assume that this / v was done in a vacuum and therefore / ' there is no air resistance. This is a two- / ^ dimensional movement. Now, suppose / that the sun is at the zenith. If you / observe the shadow of the ball on the / ground, it moves on a straight line at / a constant speed. This is a one-dimen- / sional reduction of the two-dimension- / al movement. In the one dimensional - ' X space, it can be explained that the object moves at a constant speed. This is perfectly in accordance with the law of conservation of kinetic energy, and is therefore logical and self-consistent. You may also reduce the movement into the Y-axis. Suppose that the X-axis runs from East to West, and it is the sunset time of an equinox. The shadow of the ball projected on a wall will produce an up-and-down movement along a straight vertical line, as if the ball were thrown straight up. The creatures living in this vertical one-dimensional space would be perfectly satisfied with the explanation that the movement is one-dimensional, following the law of gravity. The explanation is logical and self-consistent. But in both cases, the explanations in a reduced dimension do not correspond to the actual movement. Example 2 Y Let us visualize a billiard table, on which two balls collide and bounce off as shown. This is a two-dimensional event. If this event is projected onto the X-axis, then it appears that two objects, after collision, (T' t got stuck together, perhaps with glue. This event violates the law of conservation of kinetic energy, but can be explained by inventing "potential energy", for exam- ple, (Much like the energy holding mole- cules together) and by saying that the y kinetic energy was converted into poten- tial energy. If, on the other hand, the</page><page sequence="37">Epistemology of Social Science Research 265 event is projected onto the Y-axis, then it appears that a stationary object exploded into two pieces. This can be "explained" by inventing, for example "chemical energy". In both cases the explanations are logical and self-consistent, but incorrect. Similar to these examples, an academic's attempt to discover the distinction between "philosophies", "concepts", "attitudes" and "feel- ings" as formulated by inmates may produce a result satisfactory to himsef, but nevertheless incorrect. (14) Some other terms correspond to concepts which exist in the academic mind but are called by other terms. Examples : "Misinter- pretation", taking an accidental act as intentional; "Misunderstanding", A person believes that another person has something against him when he really does not. (15) Some of the. relations between categories made by inmate re- searchers make little sense as static classifications, but make much sense if put into situational context and in dynamic connections. Example 1: "associations" is listed as a subcategory of "harm avoidance". An aca- demic would rather put "associations" under "acceptance". As will become clear later, the primary motivation in joining a group in the prison or in the ghetto is often to avoid being attacked by the same group. This is one of the significant epistemological differences between the middle class and the ghetto or the prison. "Harm avoidance", in turn, is listed as one of the major components of prestige. This is logical in a culture in which physical danger prevails. Example 2: "Defensive" is one of the subcategories of "Anxiety". Other subcategories of "anx- iety" are: "depression", "emotional instability" and "suicidal tenden- cies". "Defensive" seems to be out of place. But the examples given under * defensive" show the connection: Many individuals are unable to relate to others without defensiveness, and this inability frequently is a source of loneliness and its resulting anxiety. The causal relation is exotic to the academic mind, but is quite logical in the prison culture. Much of the epistemologies of the prison culture already discernible at the stage of conceptualization was later substantiated in the data. For example, take: (1) There are less group structures and "leaders" than assumed by outsiders. The majority of the violent incidents are individual affairs, not gang affairs. Later in the interview data we found 241 incidents of violence, which are broken down into:</page><page sequence="38">266 M. Maruyama Fighting alone 174 Note alone: Giving first blow 8 Second blow (his first blow was group's second blow) 11 Simultaneous (he and others giving first blows simultaneously) 21 helped by others 2 helping others 5 agitated by others 5 52 52 Miscellaneous 15 241 Thus, in this sample, 72 percent of the fights were fought as an indi- vidual. Notice that also fights agitated by others were tabulated as "not alone*, and are therefore not included in the 72 percent. The interview sample consisted of (i) all those who had entry of violence in the official record during the past two years; and (ii) those known among inmates as being violent or having been violent. There- fore the sample was not biased in favor of individual fighters. As for the relative irrelevance of "leardership", many interviewees repeatedly emphasized that the relationship between partners or crime partners is reciprocal, not hierarchical. ttI have à partner. If someone jumps on him, I will help him. If someone jumps on me, he will fight for me." "I'll back up whatever my partner does, right or wrong. And he will back me up whether I am right or wrong." In the reciprocal relationship an individual is sometimes a helper, and sometimes an initial aggressor or an initial victim. This is substantiated by the details of the incidents in the data. An example is Subj. 40, who has discussed his 56 fights during seven days of interview. He had the greatest num- ber of fights discussed per interviewee. His fights can be tabulated as follows:</page><page sequence="39">Epistemology of Social Science Research 267 fought alone, no friends present 23 fought alone, while friends look on 13 fought with friends: gave first blow 2 second blow following friend 4 agitated a friend for first blow, then gave second blow himself 4 simultaneous with friend 5 agitate only 3 got involded in friend's fight, became victim ... 2 56 Subj. 18 is another example: Of his 6 fights, 2 are "alone" and 4 are "with friends". The two "alone" fights were fought on behalf of his friends. In one of them, he fought (or pretended to fight) a friend in order to give him a reputation, i.e. he staged his friend as an enemy to help him. Of the four "with friends" fights, one was "division of labor", one was "simultaneous", one was "helping a friend" and the last was "being helped by friends". 2. Epistemologías in the data I had expected that there would emerge one general epistemology, at least as far as violence was concerned, among the interviewees who were all selected for interview on the criteria of their very violent behavior. But it turned out that there were numerous distinct episte- mologies which emerged from the data. I have tentatively sorted them out into sixteen groups. Let me first list them briefly: Epistemology a: These subjects learned violence or exploitation in order to survive in their environment. Society in seen as individual against individual. Epistemology b: Conspiracy among individuals. One social group is oppressing another. Epistemology c : Life centers around personal loyalty and individual efforts. Epistemology d : Traumatic experiences with or poor relations with parents are the most influential factor in the subjects' world view. Epistemology e: Their life is dominated by a strong feeling of guilt, (all whites)</page><page sequence="40">268 M. Maruyama Epistemology f: No guilt feeling about their violence. Two subjects enjoy violence while one considers violence as the only ability he has, without enjoying it. Epistemology g: They fight for or in a clique or a group of individual friends. Epistemology h: Life goal is to get married and raise a family. No bitterness toward society. Epistemology i: The whole life is haphazard. Epistemology j: No incentive. Happier in prison than outside. Hooked on drug and hustles for income to buy drug. Epistemology k: Their main foctor in violence stems from homosexual relations, (all white). (There are others with homosexual relations, but not as a main factor). Epistemology I: Phony throughout the interview. Epistemology m: Their main factor in violence is vocal hallucination (hearing voices). Epistemology n, o and p : Three individuals with three unique epis- temologies. Let us choose Epistemology (a) as an example and discuss it in some detail. This epistemology is of particular interest because it proposes an alternative to a widely held assumption that the ghetto child learns violence as a means to be accepted by his peers. The subjects in this epistemology group learned violence as self-defense against their peers. I had not known of this alternative and therefore did not consciously search for it in the data. I was surprised when this epistemology emerged from the data. Here are some excerpts from the data: Sub j. 20: "Some guys (like me) come from an environment where fight- ing is practically an everyday thing, you know. In the neighborhood I lived in, if you didn't fight, period (you are finished). Not because you are angry, but because if a guy hasn't tried you, he will eventually try you. When I walked out of the door, on my way to the store, and I saw these three guys standing down there. You known what, the way I had to learn how to fight, the guys chase me all the way home from store, knock me to my own screen door, and my mother says get up from there boy and get that out there. So you know, shut up. I went back there. Now I could fight him aweful hard. Because my mother told me, that it is OK so you just fight all you can." In this fight both the subject and his mother were trying to protect their groceries from and against their neighbors. Neither of them was trying to be accepted by their neighbors.</page><page sequence="41">Epistemology of Social Science Research 269 Subj. 12, Subj. 25 and Subj. 32 told of experiences practically identical with those of Subj. 20. Further data indicate that none of he subjects in this epistemology group considered fighting as a pleasure. Subj. 17 presents an interesting variation within this epistemology group. He was born in the ghetto but was brought up in a middle-class foster home for several years. He learned the middle-class behavior. He returned to the ghetto as a teen-ager. He was polite and kind to others. His peers took advantage of this. As he narrates: "If you have a piece of chicken, by the time you get a knife and fork the chicken is taken by somebody. You have to hold on to your chicken and eat it with your fingers." His middle-class behavior was not "rejected" by his ghetto friends. In fact, they accepted his behavior and took advantage of it. He had to learn to fight for self-defense, not for acceptance. Another interviewee told that he once went to a party in the ghetto given by someone. He hated the man who gave the party. The subject went to the party because the man was known to be dangerous and the subject did not want to be considered as the man's enemy. Here again the acceptance model is inappropriate, and self-defense model is more appropriate. Subj. 12 learned how to exploit others in the neighborhood. "He (a child) likes shiny thinghs, you know. If he got a dollar, his mother sends him to a store and I give him nice shiny dimes and take his dollar, because he doesn't know." His own desire for exploitation is projected into his perception of the social system: "It is a proven fact also that a - anything that I write that is a law is for my protection, you know. And this man put it in for his protection. He steal, after he has stolen anything, then he put it (the law) in because he don't want nobody else to steal nothing (from him). You know if I am a thief and I am out there, and I got White House, I got two or three people working in White House that know me and let me see. And if I see anybody steal- ing out here I will try to chase them off, get them crossed in some kind of way because I don't want this stealing nothing, you know. And after I take everything, then I cut these people loose that have helped me steal, and tell them don't let nobody else steal nothing. So nobody get nothing but me."He sees the middle class Negros as exploiting the lower class Blacks, and at the same time as being exploited by whites: "You know, you have a select few, you know, that are formulate enough to be doctors, and then even, even this select few appears pressed because they can't participate in a, these medical, ah, what do you call it, ah, the honorables' party or whatever they have... They are really used</page><page sequence="42">270 M. Maruyama (by whites)... Before they get on the top they want to do something about it (the ghetto). But once they get on the top, they never do, because they forget about you. They consider themselves white." This is a clear example of how a person, who experiences nothing but exploitation in his life, perceives the whole society in terms of exploitation. As have been discussed under "Epistemological transla- tion», this epistemological process contributes toward the Black ghetto's perception of the whole white society as exploiters. This epistemological process also explains why Negros who moved up to the middle class often became exploiters of the ghetto. Furthermore, as will be discussed shortly, this process also facilitated mutual exploitations among our ghetto inculture research team members. VII. Operational success and failures of the inculture research teams VII A. Prison project The operational success and failures of the inculture research teams in both Prison A and Prison B are discussed in detail in ref. 8. Let us discuss here briefly the operation of the team in Prison B. Though there were several crises among the team members and with the prison ad- ministration, as a whole the operation of this team was a significant success and paved the way to subsequent projects. At its formation in November 1965, the team was not a cohesive unit. The members hardly knew one another and were distrustful of one another. They had divergent goals, mostly self-centered. They did not know me well, and hey had to test me out. During the initial month the meetings looked like an encounter group or a group therapy session. Then gradually the team members started realizing that it was their own project, to be run in their way with a freedom which they had been unable to exercise in the prison. They decided that if they did anything at all, it had to be meaningful to the society, and especially meaningful to themselves. As they had been accustomed to the prison life which was in most part meaningless, the project created a new challenge and inspiration to them. In the second month there grew a feeling of dedication, commitment and group solidarity. One member dropped out. The first crisis came when a psychologist visited the team. He be- longed to the prison project in a nominal capacity, though he was active on another project outside the prison. His name had been put on the project proposal mainly to facilitate the acceptance of the project by</page><page sequence="43">Epistemology of Social Science Research 271 the funding agency because he had some reputation in his field. He was mainly an absentee member of the project. He lived 3,000 miles away from the prisons where our project was conducted. He visited the prison teams occasionally during the Christmas vacation, Easter vaca- tion and the summer vacation. His first visit was during the Christmas vacation, when the team had just established a group solidarity. He lectured down to the team members as to what they should do and how they should do it. When the team members politely and indirectly tried to suggest their ideas and their point of view, he rejected them as being unscientific. After his departure some team members said that they wanted to quit. But after some more encounter-group type meetings they decided to stick together and give a try. The team decided not to follow closely the ideas dictated by the psychologist. Next one month was spent on working out conceptualizations, focus of research and a list of factors to be researched. As mentioned earlier, I needed only to function as a catalyst using the Socratic dialogue tech- nique. At no point I needed to supply the team with sociological or psychological theories. The team produced highly sophisticated concep- tualizations of their own. After the completion of the factor list, the team devised an inter- view format, and conducted test interviews with other inmates to im- prove the interview format and their interview skills. The final inter- view format was in a form of discussion sessions rather than a question- and-answer interview, allowing as much time as the interviewee cared to spend. The interviewee was to be treated as the guest to the discus- sion sessions. When the data were tabulated at the end of the project, it turned out that the median lenght of the interviews was 2 days, the longest interview being 7 full days. In April the team started actual interviews. First the team had to prove itself, by its performance, to the inmate population that it was not a snitch organization and that the interview was meaningful to the interviewees themselves. At the beginning there were much suspicion and reluctance on the part of the interviewees. But as the interviewees went back to their friends and told them of their experiences with the team, words spread in the inmate population that the project was not only safe but was genuinely interesting and meaningful. Many inmates wanted to be interviewed. The team first completed the interviews of those who appeared on the official records of violence during the pre- vious two years. Then the team interviewed those who were known in the inmate population for their violent tendencies, as well as those</page><page sequence="44">272 M- Maruyama volunteers who met the criteria of violence. The waiting list of volun- teers grew long. Eventually it became a prestige symbol for inmates in the yard to come up to the team members and talk on a budy-budy level when we were crossing the yard. Some interviewees came with confidential notes they had especially prepared for the interview, and burned them up at the end of the interview session. In some instances the interviewees volunteered highly dangerous information which the team thought it wise to erase from the tape after the interview, even though the interviewees had enough confidence in the team to let the team keep it on the tape. These indications, together with the quality and the quantity of the output of the team, were a proof of the success of the project. There was another major crisis when a team member secretly false- jacketed another member as having been regarded to be a snitch by some inmates in the past. This almost tore the team apart. But the mem- bers' dedication to the project was strong, and the team healed the painful wounds quickly. Then, during the peak of the team's production, some members became resentful of slow workers in the team, but this was resolved peacefully. Each of the occasional visits of the psychologist created some tension and resentment. But the team evolved a technique to deal with him, giving him what he wanted but carrying out their own project undisturbed. The team members took utmost care not to break any regulations and not to offend any guards. As a result, the guards were in most part cooperative. Two team members' cells were shaken down by guards, but it became evident that it was not done for harassment against the project. The team completed its tasks at the end of August. Compared to the two other projects which were less successful, the successes of the first project can be attributed to the following: (1) allowing enough time (one month) for encounter-group type meetings to develop group solidarity and sense of dedication at the beginning. (2) The project was of the inculture researchers' own design, and was therefore meaningful to them. (3) allowing enough time (three months) for conceptualization, selection of focus, research design and test runs. (4) allowing enough time (up to seven full days) for each interviewee to express freely his experiences and his point of view in an atmosphere of a seminar in which the interviewee was a guest, and to study the topic in depth.</page><page sequence="45">Epistemology of Social Science Research 273 (5) taking every precaution to prevent leakage of confidential informa- tion. (6) allowing enough time (a few months) for the inmate population to gain confidence in the project. VIIB. The ghetto project Even though the ghetto project produced 300 interviews, as a whole it can be regarded as a failure. It violated the first four of the six con- ditions of success just listed. At the middle of June 1967 I was asked by an East Coast univer- sity whether I could organize a team of ghetto residents in San Fran- cisco area to conduct a research as a pilot study for a nation-wide project it was contemplating. I discussed the matter further with the project director, and it turned out that the purpose of the project was to follow the fluctuation of tension in the ghetto to predict riots. The team would have to be organized and put into operation quickly. It would have to produce a large number of short interviews daily with people on the streets. It struck me as a quick, shallow project. It also had a flavor of a snitch project. But the time was summer 1967. Tampa, Cincinnati and Atlanta had already erupted. Newark and Detroit were to explode soon. There was an urgency. Therefore I decided to accept the project and try the best I could. I contacted two ghetto residents, who had recently been released from Prison B, and asked them to organize a team of six ghetto residents quickly. One of the two came out of the prison when the prison team was just forming, and therefore knew very little about how the prison team operated. The other came out in August 1966, and had seen the prison team in operation for several months. In fact he wanted to join the team but we could not add a new member in the midway of the project. In the summer of 1966 there was a hope for a ghetto research project patterned after the prison project. The then inmate was hoping to join that project after his release. Though there was no promise for the funding of the project, he took a chance and came out to live in Northern California, where the ghetto project had been proposed, in- stead of returning to his home town. In June 1967, when I asked the two to organize the ghetto team, there were some frictions between them unknown to me, and they started playing intrigues immediately. They separately started talking to me</page><page sequence="46">274 M. Maruyama on each other's back. I could not spend much time to figure them out. I was busy with three things: (1) to write up a detailed project proposal and a budget; (2) to set up through San Francisco State College, where I was teaching, the channeling of funds and the bookkeeping proce- dures; (3) to prepare my family to move: my wife was five months pregnant with our first baby, and we were moving from an apartment to a house within one week. The transactions on the house had not yet been completed. My mother, whom I hadn't sees for seventeen years, was coming from Japan within a few days to help my wife through pregnancy. This was the first time, and possibly the last time, for my mother to travel outside Japan. The second of the three tasks took a disproportional amount to time. Five persons, whose signature I needed, were on summer vacation. My college and the university on the East Coast could not agree on the overhead percentage etc. Meanwhile the team was somehow put toge- ther, and after one week of confusion and orientation the members were on the streets interviewing. They had to turn in a certain number of interviews daily, and the quality of the interviews were very poor. I must make here a special mention of the danger in delegating to someone the task of selecting and supervising the team members. If I had had time, I would have gone into poolhalls and bars in the ghetto to select the team members directly from the very grass-roots myself, even though it would have been a time-consuming process. I think anyone contemplating to start an inculture research team should: (a) initially familiarize himself directly with different segments of the very bottom without going through intermédiaires, get to know several indi- viduals of each segment personally, and select team members from vari- ous segments. This will take several weeks, (b) build the team from the bottom up, not from the top down. I.e. there should first be members who then elect the coordinator if needed, not first the coordinator who then selects the members. Both (a) and (b) are important in: (i) reducing the unfair factional representation and favoritism in the selection of team members; (ii) insuring equality, democracy and mutuality among the team members; and (iii) reducing the manipulation and the leverage the intermediary may exercise against the team members or against you, or both. These considerations apply to both hierarchical and nonhierarchical cultures. In the ghetto culture, in which exploitation is a part of the epistemology, the manipulative tendency on the part of the interme- diaries is expected to arise. On the other hand in non-hierarchical cul-</page><page sequence="47">Epistemology oí Social Science Research 275 tures such as Navajo or Eskimo, the whole concept of «coordinator» or «organizer» is foreign, and those who aspire to be or appear to act as coordinators or organizers tend to be deviants in terms of their own culture or at least non-representative of their own people, and tend to become disruptive soon or later. Even if a non-deviant is given the role of organizer, he may malfunction due to his unfamiliarity with hierar- chical roles. In all cases, direct selection of the team members without intermediaries is desirable. In our ghetto project, however, the selection of team members was done by two intermediaries, and thereafter the two exercised much leverage between the team members and myself, and I was unable to eliminate the intermediaries' manipulation throughout the project. At the end of July the two schools finally agreed on administrative procedures, and funds started coming in at the beginning of August. Until then, the team members as well as myself contributed out of our own pockets to supplement the small emergency "petty cash" advanced by the university on the East Coast. I was looking forward to spending more time with the team members when the financial procedures were settled. But at the beginning of August it was decided that our Cali- fornia project should seek a separate funding from the federal govern- ment and that I should write the lenghty NIMH proposal. I spent three weeks of August writing the proposal, sacrificing my mother's only chance of seeing California. The university promised me that the NIMH would give a three-year funding to our project. I cancelled my teaching schedule at the college for the fall. At the beginning of September NIMH notified me that the funds were not forthcoming and that I should re-write the proposal for a smaller operation. The direct fund- ing from the university depleted, and while the team was kept going with a bare minimum budget, I went job-hunting in the middle of Sep- tember when most schools have already started. This took me away from the team for two weeks while I went to job interviews. My wife was expecting a baby any day. Finally I found part-time jobs at two col- leges, 40 miles apart from one another, both 35 miles from home. The combined income was less than one full-time job. The daily 110-mile triangular commuting did not leave me much time with the ghetto team. In addition, I was re-writing the proposal. I needed much time for preparation for one of the courses I taught which was new to me. Our baby was born on October 4, and my wife had post-pregnancy com- plications. All I could tell about the ghetto team was that the members were competing in goofing, except one who remained conscientious.</page><page sequence="48">276 M. Maruyama The operation of the team was finally closed in February 1968 as no funds were forthcoming. The team produced 300 interviews, each last- ing from 15 minutes to two hours. There was no new insights gained except for confirming community tension and resentment. The project has done almost everything wrong. It must be added, however, that the university on the East Coast later provided me with funds to write a major part of ref. 8. VII C. The Navajo project Early in 1969 the Navajo Community College, the first Indian- controlled college, began its operation. In June 1969 its Navajo Culture Curriculum Development Project was organized. The purpose of the project is to collect teaching materials on the Navajo culture for Navajo students. The project, still in process, consists of a team of Navajo students and teachers, occasionally assisted by white students from other colleges. The project will run for a few years. I was with the team for its first phase of operation, from June 8 to July 11, 1969. As the project is only at its beginning, its successes and failures cannot yet be eva- luated. But there were some experiences gained during its first phase. During its first phase the team divided into four to six subgroups of two or three persons each. Each group was assigned a specific topic, such as historical places, medical and other plants, the effect of the Livestock Reduction Program, etc. Mythology can be told only in winter, and was excluded during the summer phase. In each team there was one photographer and one who could operate a taperecorder. Each team went out into the field with a vehicle, usually a pick-up truck or a jeep, to seek out old men who were experts in history, medicine, etc. The interviews were recorded in the Navajo language, to be later trans- cribed in the written Navajo language. The most conspicuous success of the project was the fact that the old experts, after being told of the purpose of the project, usually became quite cooperative. Indians are generally reluctant to give infor- mation to white researchers because they rarely feel a relevance reso- nance. But when the Navajo researchers on the team explained to old interviewees that the information collected will be used to teach young Navajos, and will not go to white man's museums or book shelves, the interviewee's usual response was: "It is nice* that young people want to learn about old tradition. We old people will die soon and there will be no one left to tell the old stories". (* As contrasted to white Ame- ricans, Navajos seldom use the word "good". The Navajo epistemology</page><page sequence="49">Epistemology of Social Science Research 277 has almost no or little good-bad polarization.) Here is the relevance resonance that the Navajo project attained with old Navajos. It must be mentioned that not all old men responded favorably. Some said that they were too busy to have any interview. Some others, who were actually busy, set up an appointment for a later day, and kept the appointment. Many Navajos attain a very old age. People over 80 are not un- common. Consequently there is a very wide range of generation gap among Navajos. Some of the team members were over 40. Yet their manner belonged to a "younger generation" from the old people's point of view. For example, "yá ' át ' ééh" - our equivalent of "how are you?" - widely used by middle and young generation, is strange to old people, and they may respond: "What do you mean? Do I look sick?" In the eyes of the old people, the younger generation is lost from the tradition. The college students must look ultra-younç to men of 80, and the idea that young Navajos want to learn about the Navajo tra- dition seemed to strike the old men as a surprise. When telling an old story, the interviewees frequently added such comments as "Young people may not believe this and say that all this is nonsense. But this is the way I have heard it many years ago." On the other hand, such a comment may be also a part of the characteristic of the Navaios to allow for differences in individual opinions. Most of the interviewees ended each story by: "This is the way I tell it. Other people may tell it differently. But this is my version". Another gain of the project was that the researchers ffaii cd much new knowledge about old tradition. This contrasted with the prison project and the ghetto project, in which the researchers knew their cul- ture thoroughly, and the interviews added only the details to what they already knew. The Navajo researchers, on the other hand, seemed to discover new perspectives during the interview. Perhaps in this sense the Navaļo researchers, who were mostly under 45, were not strictly "inculture" in terms of the old tradition. On the side of the failures, there was the problem of hierarchical organizational structure which was alien to the Navaio culture. When an alien system is introduced, deviants tend to take advantage of it. Two students, who had been the heads of the student body, were ap- pointed to run the proiect. It turned out that they were verv authority- hungry and dictatorial yet administratively incompetent. This may simply be due to their lack of experience. But judging from the way</page><page sequence="50">278 M. Maruyama they interacted with other Navajos, and from the opinion of other Navajos, I suspect that they were cultural deviants. Yet, their excen- tricity may have been attenuated if there had been an encounter-group type experience at the beginning of the project to work out and establish mutually shared feelings and group solidarity. Another consideration is that precise planning is extremely difficult in a project in which the subgroups go out into the field over a long distance (as far as 200 miles) over rough terrain where people are semi- nomadic or frequently away for ceremonies at different places. Per- sonnally I enjoyed tracing medicinemen who were away at some remote patient's homes. In the process I learned much about the country and the people. Perhaps a research in such a community should not be single-tracked. It can allow for unexpected by-products and turn the seeming waste of time into productivity. For example, if a medicineman is not found at a distant hogan, the family instead of the medicine man may be interviewed for whatever the topic they find relevant to them and are willing to discuss. The Navajo project is still at its beginning but has already pro- duced some data and methodological insights. We can expect more to come from it in future. VIII. Criteria for the selection of inculture researchers Now that we have discussed the operational successes and failures of our past projects and pointed out for future projects several con- ditions for success, let me end this article with a list of criteria for the selection of future inculture researchers. (1) Formal education is not required. The average formal education level of our prison team members was 6th grade. Yet the prison teams were the most successful among all the projects. (2) Because relevance resonance between the inculture people and the project is most crucial, the most important criterion for the selection of inculture researchers is the sameness of his own goals with the goals of the people in the culture. He must have a strong identifica- tion with the people, especially the grass-roots people, of the culture. Preferably he himself is a grass-roots member. He must not be an armchair philosopher or a hermit. He must not be an Uncle Tom. He must not be a do-gooder. He must not be one of those who alien- ate themselves from their own culture and identify themselves with an outside culture. But he may be bicultural, provided his indenti-</page><page sequence="51">Epistemology of- Social Science Research 279 fication is with his own culture. Monocultural, less "contaminated" persons are preferrable if available. Relevance resonance also re- quires some degree of experiential resonance, existential resonance and commitment resonance. The inculture researcher therefore must have lived in the grass-roots, and must have shared experiences, feelings, interests, goals and purposes with the grass-roots people, and must prove in action his commitment toward the goals of his people. (3) He must be industrious and must have the ability for dedication to what be undertakes. (4) He must be perceptive, and must have the ability to relate to persons of all categories in his culture. (5) Certain skills, such as typing and driving, increase the efficiency of the work, and the team should include some persons who can type, drive, operate taperecorders, etc. References 1.
