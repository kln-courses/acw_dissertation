That gagging, stomach-churning odor comes  from gases like sulfur dioxide and methane. English speakers call the source of the  odor “muck,” meaning urine and feces in particular and all kinds of dirt and rubbish in  general. Muck is not unique to China, of course, and can be whiffed in the streets and subways  of Western cities or on farm fields throughout the world. China, however, is exceptional  for its longstanding dedication to putting human body wastes to good agricultural use.  “Of all the peoples of the world,” writes British journalist Rose George, “the Chinese are  probably the most at home with their own excrement.”1 An old saying refers to those  wastes as “a treasure to the land.” Westerners, in contrast, find the presence of such  wastes nauseating and try to avoid all contact with them. Excreta are not part of their no- tion of “treasure” or of “civilization.” But rather than turning our noses away from excre- ment or associating its scent with barbarism or poverty, we should ask what significant  role it has played in the rise of human civilization and whether the Chinese, more than  other peoples, have set us an admirable example of seizing on a valuable resource and  using it wisely, without shame or scruple.  In taking up the subject of muck use and muck attitudes, we should begin by noting  that simple national stereotypes can be highly misleading. China and the United States  may seem radically different, but in fact they have much in common and on many  fronts. Chemically, muck makes all of us humans alike, whatever our cultural differences. Ex- cretion is common to our species and to life in general. Attitudes toward that excretion,  to be sure, may vary from group to group, but then those differences do not remain stat- 1 Rose George, The Big Necessity: The Unmentionable World of Human Waste and Why It Matters (New  York: Metropolitan Books / Henry Holt, 2008), 109. This is a breezy world tour of toilets, sewers, and  public sanitation. </page> <page sequence="4"> 4 RCC Perspectives: Transformations ic—they vary with time and levels of economic development. Today’s Americans may  boast about their flush toilets and bathroom ventilation, but our ancestors were more in  touch with their body wastes than we are. Before large-scale urbanization and affluence,  they lived close to their own excrement. For example, until the age of 10, this so-called  “privileged white male” daily inhaled the familial stench of a backyard privy in western  Kansas and knew the sight and smell of feces as intimately as any rural inhabitant of  Szechuan or Mongolia. The Chinese, on the other hand, are not the same people cultur- ally that they were 50 or a hundred years ago; today they are becoming as fastidious as  bourgeois Americans and demanding a life free of muck. In Beijing or Shenzhen mil- lions of middle-class citizens want the latest in good plumbing—shiny porcelain fixtures  made in Japan by the famous Toto Company—and the removal of human wastes as far  as possible from their lives.2  Changes in attitudes can create enormous environmental changes, and not always to- ward betterment. As we face global ecological limits, including limits on how much  human waste the earth can bear, those of us in the West are forced to ask what we can  learn from the past experience of others and from practices that we may have aban- doned long ago, and where we might recover those discarded practices and make them  useful again. How do other countries look on muck and how do they treat it? What was  the value of muck in earlier times, and what have we lost in terms of conserving prac- tices on our way to progress? Recovering an appreciation for muck, according to some  observers, may offer hope of healing an overstressed planet and a chance to renew the  most basic kind of recycling, closing the loop that connects farm fields to toilets. In the  twenty-first century, muck has begun to matter once again. To aid in our thinking about environmental problems, historians should uncover the past  of muck production and consumption. They have not been giving this story its due, just  as they have paid too little heed to the depth and quality of our soils, the life and death  of organisms high or low on the food chain, the long-term changes that have occurred  in the world’s climate regimes, and indeed all the material connections between society  and the ecosphere that surrounds and supports us. We can no more separate our hu- 2  Especially popular among China’s most affluent classes is Toto’s top of the line model, the Neorest 550H  Dual Flush Toilet, which retails at about 35,000 yuan and, according to ads, offers “ecology-minded  luxury, with our technologically advanced Washlet, Tornado siphon jet flushing system, remote control,  heated seat and CeFiONtect glaze, an extraordinarily smooth, ion-barrier surface to help keep the bowl  cleaner longer.” http://www.totousa.com/neorest-550h-dual-flush-toilet-10-and-08-gpf-1. </page> <page sequence="5"> The Good Muck 5 man history from earth history or from the laws of matter and energy than we can ignore  where our body wastes go when they are flushed into our sewers and disappear from  sight and smell.  A muck-conscious history should begin with the human belly and its significance as an  environmental force. Through our stomachs we have been directly connected to the  natural world and have made an impact on it. Even in the most advanced industrial na- tions of today, filling our stomachs remains vital to survival and, surprisingly, it is still  the main way we generate environmental change and crisis. Through gathering food  we intervene in natural flows of matter and energy and try to make them serve our self- interest. We change nature, often radically, by interfering with flows and processes that  have evolved over many epochs and are vital to the maintenance of millions of other  species and their habitats. But let us not stop with giving the human belly its due. The belly is directly connected  to other parts of our anatomy, including nearly 30 feet of large and small intestines and  the human bladder. We should therefore speak of an interconnected “belly-to-bladder”  history. Our sense of the past should include the entire cycle of eating and eliminating as  it has changed over time—changing us as it has changed nature. We need a new history  that joins in one narrative both ends of our digestive tract—a history that is unabashedly  material, metabolic, and excremental. The stuff that goes into our bellies is the most vital of natural resources, for like water  or air it keeps us alive. What comes out the other end are “waste products,” primarily  our feces and urine, which in earlier days were not considered a resource at all. In a  hunting-gathering state of development, the world our ancient ancestors knew for so  many millennia, bodily effluvia were considered not enriching but defiling. Excreta had  no place in the human economy. People looked on feces as simply a toxic substance they  wanted to void, and then to avoid as much as possible. Food was the most basic of resources, while human excrement was not a resource at all.  On the contrary, it was the first environmental pollutant that humans created. A pollutant  is anything foul or toxic that corrupts and poisons its surroundings when it surpasses  some critical threshold in the air, water, or soil. All cultures and civilizations have recog- nized that excrement is a pollutant, one of the worst of all. Poop and pee are dangerous.  </page> <page sequence="6"> 6 RCC Perspectives: Transformations Made up of teeming populations of bacteria, viruses, pathogens, and parasites, includ- ing such helminths as hookworm, the Chinese liver fluke, pinworms, and the parasitic  flatworms called schistosomes, excrement can be deadly. Those parasites can cause,  for example, bilharzia, a debilitating disease from which today three hundred million  people suffer worldwide, a disease that can damage the liver, kidneys, and bladder or  cause cancer. People contract bilharzia simply by standing in irrigated rice paddies that  have been polluted by human wastes. Additionally, exposure to excrement can cause  diarrhea or dysentery, spread typhus or cholera, or start an E. coli epidemic.3 Our foraging ancestors feared with good reason their body wastes, which is why they  trudged off into woods and bushes to do their business at a safe distance from cave  dwellings and encampments. They understood that they were capable of despoiling  their habitat. And when the woods and bushes became full of their wastes, they moved  on. They resettled to find new food resources, but they also moved to escape those nasty  waste products. The invention of sedentary agriculture, beginning some  10 millennia ago, made avoiding that deadly pollution a  much more complicated and difficult problem. Sedenta- rized communities were forced not only to put up with  the intensified stench, but also to live in close proximity  to their excreta and to drink from streams into which  they had voided their wastes.

Dung heaps began to appear in the villages and towns that agriculture created— and they festered, steamed, and stank. Dung heaps were the habitat of the doom-ridden  Job and of all those who were forced to dwell near mounds of excrement, relegated to  the bottom ranks of society. At what point did agricultural communities begin to overcome their disgust and try to re- cycle body wastes as fertilizer for their fields? When did they begin to find in excrement  an economic value? Who was the first entrepreneur who realized that there was food or  money to be made by turning this pollutant into a resource, making a virtue out of neces- sity? We are familiar with the modern equivalents of this trick, for today we are trying to  get the lead or carbon out of the air or paper out of landfills and turn those wastes into  profit instead of into brain damage or climate change or reeking dumps. The challenge  to transmute pollutants into wealth is not new but as old as human settlements. The first discovery of how to transform wastes into nutrients and resources remains  shrouded in historical mists. We can only surmise that at some point someone began  to realize that she or he could collect and reuse their own wastes safely—that is, if  they could manage to store them until, through the heat of fermentation, they became  harmless enough to use as a soil supplement. Likely it took centuries to work out how  one could do that, and even then the treatment was never perfect. As late as the twenty- first century, people have died from eating vegetables that have been fertilized with  inadequately processed human or other kinds of excrement. But a breakthrough came  when farmers began to understand that, after careful processing, excrement could be  applied in the raising of food. The discovery was miraculous. It meant they could create  an almost timeless loop of productivity: food in, waste out, more food derived from that  waste, more waste out. And so was born the dream of creating an endless abundance.  Other animal wastes, vegetable matter, and household rubbish were added, encourag- ing some to embrace composting as the way to infinite richness.4 Unfortunately for the dreamers, nature sets limits on human resourcefulness. Most basi- cally, the laws of thermodynamics make endless abundance a fantasy, like the related  4 According to the ancient agricultural book by Sixie Jia, 齐民要术 Qiminyaoshu (reprint, Beijing: Science  Publisher, 1958), a wide diversity of animal wastes, including silkworm droppings, were used by farmers,  though it is hard to say how large the quantities were. They made manure by first collecting straw and other  residues after harvesting, spreading the material on a flat surface, and making oxen walk over it (p.17).  Other methods included boiling horse, ox, sheep, pig, and deer bones with snow melt and the juice of  monkshoot (p. 48). This classic text was first published during the Northern Wei dynasty, circa 386–534 CE. </page> <page sequence="8"> 8 RCC Perspectives: Transformations idea of a perpetual motion machine that never runs down. Each point in the food cycle,  whether in agricultural or industrial economies, cannot avoid losing energy into space,  where it becomes unavailable as food or the ability to do work. Economies never be- come isolated systems; they leak energy constantly. That is why no one has ever figured  out how to invent a system of food production that could go on forever—banishing all  shortages, sustaining itself indefinitely, and requiring little or no work from any of us.5  Always and inescapably, we face the limits of what is naturally possible.  I want to address several questions in this paper. First, when did modern citizens, espe- cially Westerners, begin to get interested in ancient practices of using human excrement  as fertilizer, and why were they so interested? What did they ignore or misunderstand  about those practices? Second, what can historians tell us about the actual use of hu- man excrement in China’s past, and do they acknowledge any flaws or problems in that  remarkable achievement? Should we celebrate the Chinese use of human excrement in  agriculture as a “green” innovation made by farmers who lived in harmony with nature,  or should we see it more darkly as a forced and degrading response to overpopulation  and declining soil fertility? Third, how in general should we look on ancient folk tradi- tions and practices like excrement recycling when they are offered today as solutions  to modern ecological problems? Should we be seeking a return to traditional ways, or  should we embrace modernity more enthusiastically as offering the best hope for the  planet? 5 For the bizarre story of nineteenth-century European economists who wanted to replace labor and capital  with the abundant fertility of excrement, see Dana Simmons, “Waste Not, Want Not: Excrement and  Economy in Nineteenth-Century France,” Representations 96 (Fall 2006): 73–98. </page> <page sequence="9"> The Good Muck 9 I Before coming to China nearly two decades ago, the first  book I read about its environment was the American  soil scientist Franklin L. King’s Farmers of Forty Cen- turies.6 Still in print a century after its first publication,  and recently translated into Chinese, the book’s nearly  four hundred pages describe a journey King made along  China’s eastern coast to learn about traditional, or what  he called “permanent,” agriculture. Sailing from Seattle,  he reached Yokohama, Japan, on 9 February 1909 and Figure 2: Franklin H. King.  Shanghai, China, on 2 March. From there he voyaged Published on the frontispiece of  south to Hong Kong and Canton, then retraced his steps Farmers of Forty Cen-turies. Via Wikimedia  to Shanghai, where he spent many frustratingly idle days Commons. in the Astor House Hotel trying to figure out what to do next and where to go. Not far  from that seaport city lay the fertile and prosperous Yangtze River delta, also known as  Jiangnan, the most successful agricultural region in the country. After much delay he man- aged to travel through that region extensively, threading through its dense intertwined  landscape of canals, rice paddies, and mulberry groves on a houseboat. Here at last he  was able to study more closely China’s methods of handling soil and improving fertility. The Jiangnan region had long been one of the world’s greatest rice producers, rais- ing two or three crops every year through a substantial investment in an irrigation  system and through heavy dressings of fertilizers, including human excrement, ani- mal wastes, and everything else they could throw in to enrich the soil. But Jiangnan  was not all of China. It was the most advanced region of the country in agricultural  productivity and in living standards, one that most closely approximated European  and American standards of prosperity, while most of China remained, by international  norms, extremely poor and backward even into the late twentieth century.7 6 Franklin H.

After  briefly exploring that settlement and its hinterland, he crossed Shandong province to  Tianjin, another treaty port and major harbor, but he never got so far inland as Bei- jing. From Tianjin he passed out of China into Korea before ending his investigations  in Japan.  In all, King’s research trip lasted nearly six months. In that time his eyes took in a  thousand striking scenes and his notebooks gathered a rich fund of statistical data.  Again and again his nostrils caught the tang of manure. While previous foreign travel- ers had noted the use of human wastes in agriculture, King was the first to examine  that practice in detail and to come away convinced that it offered a viable solution  to the soil nutrition problems he saw in modern farming as practiced in the United  States. In 1911, before completing the final chapter of his book, King died in his Wisconsin  home. That was the year of the Xinhai revolution, which overthrew two thousand years  of imperial rule in China and brought the Western-educated and republican-minded  Sun Yat-Sen into power. King was apparently unaware of that dramatic political trans- formation. He had come and gone unaware of the extent of the social discontent that  had been gathering in China’s cities and countryside, of internal stresses going back at  least to the Opium Wars, and that would abruptly break out after his return home and  lead to a radically new China for the twentieth century. King came to focus solely on  older farming practices, and nothing he saw during his travels seems to have stirred  any awareness of the region’s political or economic vulnerability or the shakiness of  its fragile, long-troubled relationship with the land.  King believed that he had found a country that was completely stable and peaceful,  well fed and efficient. He extolled its people for producing “the highest industrial art  of the world.” In letters sent home to his wife Carrie, he described in greater detail  the careful techniques and ingenious tools that those people had invented so long ago  and were still using with skill and precision. Like Joseph Needham, the British scien- tist who came decades later—“the man who loved China” and who created one of the  most impressive publishing projects the West has ever seen, the multi-volume series  Science and Civilisation in China—King was delighted with everything scientific, tech- </page> <page sequence="11"> The Good Muck 11 nological, and agricultural. “China is a strange land in almost every imaginable way,”  he wrote. The more I see of the Chinese the more my admiration for them grows, and the  more one realizes that they have really solved their problems along the line of least  resistance and of highest economy. Every man and woman seems to be busy and  each has put down the bucket where he is and is sustaining life and apparently liv- ing in contentment. 8 Although the peasants he saw had to labor hard for a bare pittance—farm workers in  Zhejiang province were making a mere $50 annually—to him they seemed happy with  their lot. Each person knew their job and did it well. That impression was one that he  formed early on and reinforced each time he ventured from his lodgings. King did not, however, speak or read Chinese—although he was able to hire capable  interpreters through whom he spoke to many Chinese people along the way, relatively  few were farmers or laborers. Most of his conversations seem to have been with fellow  travelers from the West rather than with peasants living on the land or even with Chi- nese officials. Did his admiration for the rural Chinese obscure his judgment of their  condition? Was he blind to hardship and suffering? And did his limited penetration  of the country’s geographical vastness leave him with impressions that were atypical  of China as a whole? Why did he miss the long-festering tensions pitting the coun- try’s peasants against their landlords, the common people against their Qing emperors  (who were of foreign Manchu origin), or the nation as a whole against the disrup- tive imperialistic powers like Britain and Germany that had carved out commercial  enclaves along the coast, imposed their power on the country, and even invaded the  interior with armies, technology, and capital?  Perhaps King was no blinder than most foreign travelers of the time. Even today, look- ing back on the causes of revolution in the world, we often are not inclined to ask how  declining ecological or economic conditions can suddenly erupt in violence or revolu- 8 King to Carrie King, 10 March 1909, Franklin King Papers, Wisconsin State Historical Society, box 2, fol- der 2, page 142. The correspondence from this trip amounts to about 500 pages of scrawled handwriting,  covering back and front and all the margins of his pages. Mostly the letters focus on the ad hoc travel  arrangements he had to make, the costs of his travel (he was apparently paying his own way), and reports  on his health (he suffered from rheumatism).  </page> <page sequence="12"> 12 RCC Perspectives: Transformations tion and turn institutions upside down. Few of King’s time pondered critically enough  the agricultural dead end that China had reached, making further progress seem un- certain and even hopeless. The countryside was running out of options. It would be  twenty years later when the American novelist Pearl Buck, a child of missionaries and  a fluent speaker of Mandarin, author of such poignant books as The Good Earth, pub- lished in 1931, introduced the outside world to the harsher realities faced by China’s  peasant farmers.9 At the time of his travels King had just retired as chief of the soil management division  in the US Department of Agriculture. He was inspired to go by American colleagues  who had preceded him, starting in the 1890s. Those fellow experts generally tended  to stay in Western-style hotels and communicate with each other by means of trans- oceanic telegraph services. They received considerable help from a string of consular  officers, and they enjoyed the modern comforts of steamships and railroads. Typically,  they arrived in a mood of certainty that they had all the answers when it came to rais- ing food. Charles Denby, for example, who served as US ambassador to China from  1885 to 1898, declared that despite “the great antiquity of agriculture among them,  the Chinese have failed to make any great progress in it. . . . They have made no im- provements in this line for a thousand years, just as they have stood still in every other  art of civilization.” Where King saw a tale of mastery, Denby found one of backward- ness. His dismissive appraisal was echoed by David Fairchild, Seaman Knapp, Frank  Meyer, and Pearl Buck’s husband, the agricultural economist John Lossing Buck, for  all of whom China was a stagnating country.  Fairchild, the son of the president of Kansas Agricultural College, arrived in 1898 and,  though intrigued by the strange, exotic things he found growing in Chinese gardens,  could not regard them as real food but more as contemptible weeds. He was repelled  by the stench of city streets, which came from the muck carried by “coolies” in earth- enware pots suspended on bamboo poles. He could not understand why the Chinese  had not turned to Western-style chemistry to find better fertilizers than human ma- 9 Pearl Buck, whose famous title inspired the more sardonic one of this essay, is worthy of more attention  by American and Chinese historians. Born Pearl Sydenstricker in 1892, she was the daughter of Southern  Presbyterian missionaries who took her to Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, including the grand old city of  Nanjing, where she spent more than three decades. Eventually she married the agricultural economist  John Lossing Buck, but in 1934, in the midst of religious and political turmoil, left her husband and China  for the United States. In 1938 she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. </page> <page sequence="13"> The Good Muck 13 nure, whose collection, transportation, and application to crops condemned “many  people to lives of disgusting drudgery.”10 Unlike them, Frank King was less confident that the West provided a better model. Be- fore setting out, he had become a critic of US farming and was looking for alternatives  in the East. American farming practices were to his mind wasteful, destructive, and  careless. It is hard to say what made him so critical. Having grown up on a farm near  Whitewater, Wisconsin, he had graduated from the local teacher’s college and earned  a PhD in agriculture at Cornell University, studying with the famed horticulturalist  Liberty Hyde Bailey. Perhaps it was Bailey’s influence that turned him against modern  agriculture and made him an admirer of the old ways. After graduation, he was hired  as professor of agricultural physics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he  wrote one of the first textbooks on soil science. Then he left his home state for a career  in Washington as a federal scientist. Along the way he seems to have taken up the  cause of Progressive-era conservationists, who taught him to worry about America’s  declining supplies of natural resources. Like other conservationists, but unlike most of  his fellow agriculturalists, he feared that the United States was heading toward a Mal- thusian crisis of too many people crowding onto a vulnerable, deteriorating soil base. “If the United States is to endure,” he wrote, “if we are to project our history even  through four or five thousand years as the Mongolian nations have done, and if that  history is to be written in continuous peace, free from periods of widespread famine  or pestilence, this nation must re-orient itself.” The United States, he was adamant,  must stop wasting its once-abundant natural resources. Compared to China (Zhong- guo in Pinyin, meaning the central or middle-of-the-earth country), the United States  (Meiguo, the beautiful land, a country of fortunate abundance) seemed to the Chinese  as well as Americans to offer the best hope for humanity. King, however, did not ap- prove of that comparison and came to find out what China, Korea, and Japan could  offer American farming. During his travels he concluded that those countries were and  always had been a model of sustainability from which much could be learned.11 10 Randall E. Stross, The Stubborn Earth: American Agriculturalists on Chinese Soil, 1898–1937 (Berkeley:  University of California Press, 1986), 8, 22. 11 King, Farmers of Forty Centuries, 239, 240. Unfortunately, King did not have the benefit of Mark Elvin’s  paradoxical essay, “Three Thousand Years of Unsustainable Growth: China’s Environment from Archaic  Times to the Present,” East Asian History 6 (December 1993): 7–46. </page> <page sequence="14"> 14 RCC Perspectives: Transformations In 1910 the US population stood at one hundred million, while China’s was five times  larger. For a very long time something like one-quarter of all humanity had lived under  Chinese rule, more than 90 percent of them living directly on the land, raising a sub- sistence food supply with just enough surplus to export as tribute or commodity to the  cities. Both the US and China occupied about the same amount of physical space on  the world map, but China had reached the point of sustaining itself on far less land per  person than America. King calculated that his country possessed more than 20 acres to  support each man, woman, or child, while the Chinese had only two acres, more than  half of which was mountain terrain, difficult or even impossible to farm.12 But if in 1909 the Americans had an enormous advantage in arable land, their future  had begun to look a little uncertain. King assumed that his country’s population might  one day rise to as much as 1.2 billion, making the US about as crowded as China.  That prediction would not come to pass; even after another century the US population  would stand at a mere 320 million, while China’s would rise to 1.4 billion. But King’s  prediction suggests what some conservationists and agriculturalists at the time tended  to assume: a huge growth in American population numbers was coming, an increase  that no one could or should try to prevent, one that many even welcomed in a spirit of  nationalistic pride. But how would that future behemoth feed itself, King wondered,  and what could China teach the farmers of Wisconsin or Iowa so they could be ready  for a more crowded future?  Everywhere he journeyed King recorded an astonishing diversity of crops growing  on the miniscule Chinese farms, far more diversity than in the United States. He saw  grass carp swimming in rice paddies, pigs fattening in muddy yards, silkworms feed- ing on mulberry leaves along the paddy dikes, tea growing on nearby hillsides, cereal  crops like rice, millet, and wheat sprouting in rich green carpets. He found exotic  plants like corn and potatoes, introduced from the New World, and then there were  all those indigenous but unfamiliar food plants flourishing in their midst. The typical  farm in China included far fewer domesticated animals than in America. One typical  Shandong farmer, for example, kept only a single donkey and a single cow for labor  12 Since King’s day, the ratio of arable land to people in both countries has declined precipitously, while at  the same time agricultural land has been lost to housing and industrial development. According to the  World Bank (www.worldbank.org), China’s arable land has fallen from 0.16 hectares per person in 1961  to 0.08 in 2013, while the US has experienced a similar decline from 0.98 hectares per capita to 0.48. See  also Vaclav Smil, “Who Will Feed China?” China Quarterly 143 (September 1995): 801–13. </page> <page sequence="15"> The Good Muck 15 and two pigs for meat and manure to support 12 humans in the household—altogether  16 creatures crowding onto a tiny plot of 2.5 acres, or about one hectare. Such farms,  in contrast to those of Wisconsin, were more like densely cultivated gardens than  American-style “farms,” but their per-acre yields were often higher than back home.13 That astonishing productivity would not have been possible if the peasants had not  grown used to brutal work schedules maintained all through the year—work for both  humans and their farm animals. King did not altogether fail to notice that intensifica- tion of labor, but rather than seeing it as cruel, he lauded its moral effects. China’s  work burdens, he declared, were the foundation of its national strength and virtue.  “This marvelous heritage of economy, industry and thrift, bred of the stress of centu- ries,” he solemnized, “must not be permitted to lose virility through contact with west- ern wasteful practices, now exalted to seeming virtues through the dazzling brilliancy  of mechanical achievements. More and more must labour be dignified in all homes  alike, and economy, industry and thrift become inherited impulses, compelling and  satisfying.”14 The West encouraged too much laziness and its companion, mechaniza- tion, while in the East farmers still followed a rigorous work ethic and practiced stingy  and patient thrift. King, though a scientist, was a moral traditionalist who was repelled  by sloth and conspicuous consumption.  King’s enthusiasm for the whip hand of hard work and agricultural efficiency seems to  have left him insensitive to the full costs of China’s productivity—tired muscles, long  work hours for humans and beasts, and not least the distasteful but inescapable chore  of handling human and animal excreta, with all the health risks it entailed. To collect  that vile stuff required the efforts of everyone in the household, so that even small  children had to pick up their daily quota. After collection, the wastes had to be stored  on-site until it was time to spread them on fields or paddies.  13 According to King (Farmers of Forty Centuries, 214), maize, or corn, yields in Shangdong province  averaged 420–480 catties per mu. Converting the catty to the kilogram and the mu to the hectare, those  farmers were getting 6,750 kilograms per hectare. American farmers, in contrast, from 1860 to 1940,  harvested on average 1,630 kilograms per hectare. See A. E. Tiefenthaler, I. L. Goldman, and W. F.

Franklin  King, Farmers of  Forty Centuries. Undoubtedly there was beauty and grace in that old peasant farming, along with health  and happiness, but there was also a high degree of hardship and degradation. David  Fairchild may have been too condescending toward Chinese agriculture, but he was  surely right that peasant life included a great deal of “disgusting drudgery,” which had  been forced on people by growing demands to extract more and more return from the  same piece of land. King, in contrast, celebrated in the peasant way of life an “almost  religious fidelity . . . which may well cause western nations to pause and reflect.”15  Data gathered by King from Japan and Europe indicated that a single ton of human ex- crement contained more than 12 pounds (5.4 kilograms) of nitrogen (chemical symbol  N), almost 2 pounds (0.9 kilograms) of phosphorous (P), and 4 pounds (1.8 kilograms)  of potassium (K), the elements identified by the nineteenth-century German chemist  15 King, Farmers of Forty Centuries, 241. </page> <page sequence="17"> The Good Muck 17 Justus Liebig as the three essentials of soil fertility.16 So the amount of nutrients lurk- ing in the combined excreta of China’s five hundred million people, each producing 40  ounces per day, was considerable. There were riches of NPK literally lying at their feet. But note that it took a lot of human waste to get a little fertilizer. To produce 12 pounds  (5.4 kilograms) of nitrogen a day, it would take 800 people voiding their bowels and  bladders. Using King’s figures, we can calculate that the body wastes of all of China in  1910 roughly totaled around 7,500 tons (6,800 metric tonnes) daily. Scanty though it  was for such an immense country, nothing like it could be found in the United States.  America’s much smaller population would have produced only about 1,500 tons (1,360  metric tonnes) of nitrogen per day. Worse, almost all of that nitrogen was washing into  rivers and seas. A large part of it, of course, was replenishing soils wherever it fell,  but it was not being used for restoring fertility on crop fields. The usually placid King  became furious at the thought of so much muck not being put to productive use: “Man  is the most extravagant accelerator of waste the world has ever endured.”17  Meanwhile, ignored by King was another kind of natural wealth washing down from  China’s Loess Plateau and mountains, as it had done for centuries, clogging rivers and  canals with precious soil and eventually drifting out to sea. Conservationists pointed  out that it came from clearing away native vegetation and plowing up highly erodible  ground. The centrally located plateaus and mountains were losing their substance to the  Yellow River (a.k.a. Huang He, often described as the “cradle of Chinese civilization”)  and had been doing so for many centuries. Over and over its clogged currents and ris- ing riverbed had caused severe flooding downstream. In 1855, because of heavy erosion  and silt deposits, the river unexpectedly cut a whole new course across Shandong prov- ince and began pouring its silt-laden waters into the Bohai instead of the Yellow Sea.18  16  Justus von Liebig (1803–1873) was a German chemist who made significant contributions to organic  chemistry. In 1840 he published Chemistry in Its Applications to Agriculture and Physiology, which argued  that atmospheric ammonia and soil nitrates were more important sources of plant nitrogen than manures,  a controversial claim that led him to develop and promote the use of “chemical manures” to enhance crop  production.

He was familiar, as were  other American conservationists in the days of President Theodore Roosevelt (who left  office in the very year of King’s journey), with the long history of Chinese soil erosion  and heavy flooding. But that part of the conservationist lament King resisted. To his wife  he wrote that the explanation for the heavy silt load carried by rivers “cannot be that  man has ruthlessly cut away the forests and thus brought ruin upon the land as foresters  are all the time talking.”19 The silt must be due to natural causes, he insisted—namely,  to the scantiness of inland vegetation caused by a warm semi-tropical climate. China’s  ingenious farmers were not at fault—not guilty of destroying the soil-holding vegetation.  In fact they were to be praised for discovering the compensatory powers of muck. Make no mistake: Franklin King was, despite his limited understanding, onto some- thing important. Good soil stewardship is required of all societies and requires a farm- ing community that understands fully the threats to soil health and appreciates soil’s  foundational role in human welfare. While Justus Liebig had managed impressively to  isolate the three major elements of soil fertility, his success tended to encourage over- confidence in reductive thinking. Scientists were ignoring what traditional farmers of  Asia knew from bitter experience, that good soil is more than a three-chemical prob- lem. Farming must approach soil management as holistically as it would approach the  life and health of any living organism. On the other hand, King should have realized,  as a trained scientist, that agriculture needed more than traditional methods and rem- edies, distorted as they often were by superstition, engrained bad habits, and unreli- able data. Maintaining good soil conditions required the analytical rigor of modern  science—provided that science could become more organismic in concept and more  respectful toward nature’s ways. Furthermore, saving the soil required a conservation- minded society that questioned not only wasteful behavior but also the growth in hu- man numbers and its environmental consequences.   For a science more organismic in approach we can turn to one of the most remarkable  men of the twentieth century, Sir Albert Howard. Born in 1873, a quarter century after  King, he grew up on a farm in Shropshire, England, near the birthplace of Charles  Darwin, the great theorist of natural evolution. Both men absorbed rural English cul- 19 King to Carrie, 4 March 1909, Franklin King Papers, box 2, folder 2, page 125. </page> <page sequence="19"> The Good Muck 19 ture while becoming scientific pioneers. What Darwin poetically called “the web of  life,” the intricately evolved fabric of nature, Howard preferred to call “the wheel of  life,” emphasizing the cycles through which nature flows. Plants, he understood, are  interdependent parts of that ever-turning wheel and so is the soil. We can label both  men early ecologists, spanning an old and new consciousness in science. Ecology  would not fully emerge until the mid-twentieth century, but decades earlier Howard,  like Darwin, was already thinking about how age-old relationships that evolved among  soil, plants, and animals might determine a farmer’s success or failure. Darwin’s inter- est in the role of earthworms in soil formation, for example, would produce a modern  classic in agricultural ecology. Both he and Howard approached farming as a problem  in applied evolution and ecology. Agriculture, they believed, should be regarded not  merely as the single-minded task of growing straight rows of beans or mulberry trees  in a field of dirt, but as the nurturing of a dynamic community of many kinds of beings  all interacting for mutual survival.20 In 1905 Howard was hired by India’s Imperial Department of Agriculture and assigned  to work in the town of Pusa in order to discover how to raise more food for a famine- plagued country. Pusa was an out-of-the-way place; fortunately for his personal life,  Howard’s wife (née Gabrielle Matthaei, also a trained scientist) joined him in this work.  And it was Gabrielle who had pushed him, even while they were still back in England, to  realize that a mechanistic and over-reductive science could never fully grasp the com- plex problem of crafting a sustainable food system.21 Together, the Howards launched a  powerful project for rural development to improve Indian economic wellbeing. In 1924 the husband-wife team moved to the city of Indore, located in the heavily popu- lated Narmada River Valley of Madhya Pradesh. There they took over a small government- owned farm of 75 acres and made it their outdoor laboratory for crafting a new agricul- ture. Then Gabrielle died in 1931, whereupon Albert married her younger sister Louise.  In 1940, undoubtedly with Louise’s behind-the-scenes help, he published his most im- portant book, An Agricultural Testament, which set forth in clear, compelling prose an  20 Charles Darwin’s last published work (1881) was The Formation of Vegetable Mould, Through the Action  of Worms, which took him back to an earlier interest in agricultural landscapes, as he had known them  around his estate in Down, Great Britain.  21 “The plant knows no division of science,” wrote Gabrielle in a 1905 letter to Albert; “in growing and  carrying out its functions it uses all.” Quoted by Louise E. Howard (Gabrielle’s sister and Albert’s second  wife), in Albert Howard in India (London: Faber and Faber, 1953), 15. </page> <page sequence="20"> 20 RCC Perspectives: Transformations ecology-based model for agriculture. It emphasized the importance of humus, the living,  organic component of soil, and its enhancement by careful application of muck. Along  with Franklin King’s book of three decades earlier, An Agricultural Testament became a  holy scripture for what we now call “organic farming.”22 These are the opening words of An Agricultural Testament: “The maintenance of the  fertility of the soil is the first condition of any permanent system of agriculture.” Echo- ing King, Howard called for a better kind of farming, attentive to conserving soil quality,  even before farmers chose their seeds and stuck them in the ground. Nature enhances  life by building soils, Howard declared, and nature is “the supreme farmer.” The human  tiller of soil must begin by taking special care of the soil. Other nature-inspired prin- ciples and practices must follow. Mother earth never attempts to farm without livestock; she always raises mixed  crops; great pains are taken to preserve the soil and to prevent erosion; the mixed  vegetable and animal wastes are converted into humus; there is no waste; the pro- cesses of growth and the processes of decay balance one another; ample provision  is made to maintain large reserves of fertility; the greatest care is taken to store the  rainfall; both plants and animals are left to protect themselves against disease.23  Could farmers replicate the success of Mother Earth? They must do so, Howard be- lieved, if countries like India were to achieve an abundant and enduring supply of food  and fiber.  But where and how to observe “Nature’s farm” in operation? For Howard the answer  was to find an old-growth forest where a diversity of trees and other plants grew, along  with the animals and microorganisms that lived as one community, and observe care- fully how together they achieved a self-renewing harmony through time. Walking ob- servantly through a healthy forest was the best education. There one learned foremost  that sustainability depends on the careful recycling of all nutrients. “The forest,” Howard  22 Albert Howard’s An Agricultural Testament, like Farmers of Forty Centuries, is still in print, but it is  most easily accessible online at this site: http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/howardAT/ATtoc.html.

All is sanitary, clean, and pleasant to the  nose. “There is no nuisance of any kind—no smell, no flies, no dustbins, no incinera- tors, no artificial sewage system, no water-borne diseases, no town councils, and no  rates. On the contrary, the forest affords a place for the ideal summer holiday: sufficient  shade and an abundance of pure fresh air.” Why cannot the same be said for agriculture  as practiced by humans? Because farmers have not paid enough attention to how the  natural world works. Howard’s laudatory view of Nature (a word he always capitalized) owed something to tra- ditional farming cultures, and to their common belief that a divine power had made the  world and pronounced it good. Call that power “God” or “Mother Nature,” it amounted  to the same thing. But the past century or two had been hard on that older view of the  world. It was no longer possible to portray nature simply as the nurturing goddess of life,  nor to maintain that she has organized the earth for the good of all.  Was it reasonable to call a wild forest that had evolved over millions of years, through  competition among so many species and individuals, a “farm”? Was there no distinction  to be made between trees struggling to grow and take possession of the land, prior to  human intervention, and a selectively bred crop of rice or maize? These were not ques- tions that the researcher pursued. Albert Howard made heavy use of ancient metaphors and images, but they had begun to  lose their power. The notion of nature as a “supreme farmer,” the true Darwinian must  admit, could lead to outmoded anthropomorphism and nature deification. In trying to  straddle two worlds, Howard overlooked or de-emphasized the aimless trial and error of  nature, the lack of design in its workings, the competitive struggle going on in the soil  that had been revealed by modern biology. A real forest, Darwin had explained, might be  incredibly complex, but its complexity contained the bad as well as the good by human  standards. Nature included a profusion of flies, odors, and diseases, along with danger- ous creatures like tigers and wild elephants who could take a peasant’s life. Agricultur- ists had always fought to gain control over that evolutionary wildness. How then could  one adopt “Nature” as one’s teacher and at the same time overlook the darker side of  lower-case nature as described by evolutionary science? </page> <page sequence="22"> 22 RCC Perspectives: Transformations It was a conundrum that Albert Howard did not try to resolve. But we might give him  credit for seeking a traditionalism that could merge seamlessly into modernity. At the  same time we may emphasize more than he that the natural processes of evolution, as  revealed through science, could provide better models for the farmer than older, pre- Darwinian worldviews. An understanding of nature as the sum of material things, nature  as the world that humans did not create, nature as an evolving set of patterns based on  trial-and-error adaptation was Darwin’s main idea, and it could offer some guidelines  toward sustainability. To mimic those natural processes, without turning them into holy  writ, might help humans farm more successfully. Farmers might well be advised to ac- quire a more humble mentality, but they did not necessarily need to approach nature in  a spirit of uncritical, worshipful obedience.  With the advent of factories and the market economy, Howard argued, had come an  increasing hubris and overconfidence that ignored the unspoken wisdom of evolution as  well as the wisdom of tradition. “Since the Industrial Revolution,” he declared, “the pro- cesses of growth have been speeded up to produce the food and raw materials needed  by the population and the factory. Nothing effective has been done to replace the loss of  fertility involved in this vast increase in crop and animal production. The consequences  have been disastrous. Agriculture has become unbalanced: the land is in revolt: diseases  of all kinds are on the increase: in many parts of the world Nature is removing the worn- out soil by means of erosion.”24 Cotton was one of the first big modern agricultural commodities to be raised and traded  internationally. Manufacturing nations like Great Britain could not grow it at home, so  they began to import cotton in great quantities and spun and wove it into cloth in their  textile mills. Along with other mass-produced crops like sugar, jute, oil seeds, dyes,  opium, tobacco, tea, and coffee, cotton was widely viewed as a “money crop,” raised to  sell on world markets to make a profit. To grow such a crop, capitalists had come to India  and other countries, turning them into colonies, and taking over vast acreages that had  traditionally been devoted to raising food for local consumption. Cotton growing came  to be based on an economic philosophy that aimed at quick extraction of resources and  infinite economic growth. While the older subsistence farming had shown no little ruth- lessness in raising food, the capitalist farmer was more contemptuous than ever toward  nature and, worse yet, tended to leave the next generation to look out for itself. 24 Howard, Agricultural Testament. </page> <page sequence="23"> The Good Muck 23 Albert Howard and his wives were sharp critics of industrial-capitalist farming—its over- reliance on chemical fertilizers, its sterile mono-cropping, and its shortsighted devotion to  mechanization driven by profit. By the 1930s and 40s it was apparent to them that much  of Asia had already been conquered by the new-fangled agriculture. India’s food system  was, consequently, no longer a sustainable enterprise. Only China, in their minds, offered  a significant alternative to Western modernity. At this point Howard fell back on King’s  Farmers of Forty Centuries as he wrote: “The peasants of China, who pay great attention  to the return of all wastes to the land, come nearest to the ideal set by Nature. They have  maintained a large population on the land without any falling off in fertility.”25 China, it was  hoped, could help countries like India throw off the influence of industrial capitalism and  its ruthlessly oversimplifying, mass-producing approach to raising food.  But could Chinese agriculture of the time really support such hopes and dreams? What  hidden problems lay in its methods of using land and recycling wastes? Had the strategy  of human manure proved as good for people as for the land? The answers were more  complicated, and less reassuring, than either King or Howard supposed. II Excremental history should not gloss over deficiencies or failures in traditional ways. On  the other hand, it should not ignore the high social and ecological costs that modernity  so far has brought. It must try to discover the full and honest truth lying in our wastes  and in their handling. Above all, we should never deny that muck is really vile, polluting  stuff, no matter how “natural” it may be. That nastiness is not a mere construct of fastidi- ous, over-civilized minds but a biological awareness wired into our senses and brains.  Acknowledging the nastiness should lead us to ask how it could ever have become a  common soil additive in the first place, what its use in agriculture required of people,  and how and why it abruptly declined in use. Unquestionably China was among the earliest places in the world to use human body  wastes to renew soil and improve food production. Here, in contrast to the feces- avoiding hunters and gatherers, the peasants began collecting that resource deliber- ately, treating it with care and intelligence, and even developing markets for it. What  had been considered “unclean” came to have a utilitarian function and a money value.  Excrement became the peasant’s savings account.  25 Howard, Agricultural Testament, 15. </page> <page sequence="24"> 24 RCC Perspectives: Transformations Before there was a need for fertilizer there had to be agriculture, defined as the cultiva- tion of domesticated plants and animals for human nutrition. China boasts one of the  oldest continuously functioning agricultural societies on earth. Only the Levant (Turkey,  Syria, and Palestine) can claim a longer pedigree, basing its path-breaking agriculture  on emmer and einkorn wheat, barley, peas, lentils, bitter vetch, chickpeas, and flax. Le- vantine farming, however, proved weak in terms of sustainability. The Han people—de- scendants of tribes on the Loess Plateau and originally called the Huaxia, who became  the dominant ethnic group in China—were more successful, far surpassing the Fertile  Crescent in longevity and productivity. Their plant domesticates would one day become  some of the world’s most important cereal crops, especially rice, which was first devel- oped in the lower and middle Yangtze River Valley seven to eight thousand years ago.  Then there was millet, which even earlier, about ten thousand years before the present,  became the basis of farming where China’s Loess Plateau meets the North China Plain.26  Following that agricultural breakthrough there emerged, in the words of Francesca  Bray, “the agrarian state par excellence,” one of the most important political systems in  human history. Over time it became a powerful institution—a centralized government  presiding over a vast, sprawling landscape densely inhabited by small farmers.27 Large  imperial retinues and a substantial number of rich landowners, along with a supporting  cast of village craftspeople and a scattering of urban trade centers, grew up on Chinese  soil. Considered trophically (that is, as a system of food and energy distribution, a word  derived from the Greek trophikos, meaning nourishment), the agrarian state resembled  a steeply pointed pyramid.  The top-level consumers in the Chinese system were the warlords and emperors. A  succession of dynastic governments ruled the pyramid. Their role was to protect the  producers at the bottom of the pyramid, primarily farmers, against their enemies; dur- ing times of drought northern nomads regularly showed up to pillage and plunder the  defenseless farmers. In exchange for protection, governments extracted taxes from the  vulnerable and claimed a “mandate from heaven.” From the Qin to the Qing dynasties,  26 Zhang Chi and Hsiao-chun Hung, “The Emergence of Agriculture in Southern China,” Antiquity 84,  no. 323 (March 2010): 11–25; Houyuan Lu, et al., “Earliest Domestication of Common Millet (Panicum  miliaceum) in East Asia Extended to 10,000 years ago,” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  106, no. 18 (5 May 2009), 7367–72.

Historian Ping-ti Ho has argued that the Loess Plateau, constituting much of the Yellow  River’s watershed, was the foundation of Chinese civilization and its state apparatus.  Later scholars have challenged that theory as too narrow, but for an environmentally  aware scholar it seems obvious that those ancient wind-blown deposits must have been  of considerable significance historically. They covered much of the north, forming a  blanket of nutrients that had been blown in by strong post-Pleistocene winds from Mon- golia and Xinjiang. Over a span of ten thousand years, the fine yellow-brown particles  washed down the hillsides to fill the lower valleys and plains. Everywhere they were a  godsend of fertility.  In the dry years that followed the retreat of ice sheets, various species of hardy grasses and  shrubs arrived and covered the Loess Plateau, anchoring the soil and keeping it in place.  Likewise, humans arrived, but not to live on the grass as nomads. On the contrary, they  destroyed it. Bunch grass was so much easier to remove than the forests that once covered  much of China, and that difference explains why it was here that the early cultivation of  crops occurred. Destroying native grass, however, accelerated soil erosion, as the soil was  left open once more to wind and rain, and to the cultivator’s tools. On the plus side the  loess’s innate fertility allowed farmers to intensify food production, far exceeding their  predecessors who had been limited to burning off patches of forest and, in the resulting  ashes, raising crops. Those patches, incredibly fertile though they were, could be worked  for only a few years before nutrient depletion set in and forced farmers to move on and  start over. Compared to forest soils, the loess allowed agriculturalists to reap rich harvests  year after year without moving so incessantly; they could conserve much of the energy  that was usually required to clear new virgin lands. Now and then, to be sure, they had  to restore lost nitrogen to their fields, but this they could do by fallowing or by planting a  nitrogen-fixing crop like soybeans. For a while they needed little fertilizer.  Whether those loess soils were the single basis of Chinese civilization or not, their natu- ral fertility did help sustain China’s agrarian state over many centuries. Farmers spread  relentlessly across the Loess Plateau, then down over the northern plains, and then  down the river valleys, adding wheat, barley, and draft animals to their tools of conquest. </page> <page sequence="26"> 26 RCC Perspectives: Transformations Eventually, however, China’s farmers reached the limits of loess cultivation. Nomadic  invaders or their own reproductive success forced many to leave the loess behind and to  migrate southward. Going south, they encountered rival, indigenous peoples who had  built up a radically different kind of agriculture based on the rice plant. The northern  farmers overran that obstacle, pushing into the Yangtze River valley and then pushing  farther south into what today are Jiangxi, Guangdong, Sichuan, and Yunnan provinc- es. In that southward expansion, they were forced to leave their traditional crops and  techniques behind and to learn from the people they invaded. They learned to make  rice paddies, watered with elaborate ditches, separated by mud walls, and arranged on  cascading terraces. The yield of rice per acre was astonishingly high, justifying all that  heavy labor, but rice paddies, in contrast to the loess country to the north, needed a lot  of fertilizer all the time. So began a hunt for anything that would restore fertility quickly. To grow rice abundantly year after year, peasants were forced to work harder and fertil- ize more. In the beginning, simple paddy irrigation made possible a new and prosperous  foundation for the agrarian state. The south was awash in natural waterways, coursing  everywhere through the hills and deltas, flooding repeatedly. When harnessed for ir- rigation, the streams brought to the farmer’s crops loads and loads of sediment, or river  mud. Sediment was rich enough in nutrients to allow more than one crop per year,  but multiple cropping could not be sustained forever merely on river sediment. They  must find a wealth of supplements. Where could these be found? Animal manure was in  short supply in rice country because farmers there kept comparatively few farm animals.  Thus, by necessity, they were forced more and more to utilize their own urine and feces.  The soil scientist King had set himself the goal of learning “how it is possible, after twenty  and perhaps thirty or even forty centuries, for [China’s] soils to be made to produce suf- ficiently for the maintenance of such dense populations.” Later in his book he omitted the  indecisive phrase “twenty and perhaps thirty” centuries and rounded his chronology up  to a full and certain forty centuries, or four thousand years. It must have sounded more  impressive that way. The alliterative roll of “farmers of forty centuries” would stick in  Western thought and be repeated endlessly by agricultural reformers around the world.  Perhaps to a soil scientist like King the difference between two, three, or four thou- sand years was insignificant, but for a historian the sonorous sweep of millennia must  be scrutinized more closely. Historians want to know a little more precisely when and  </page> <page sequence="27"> The Good Muck 27 where muck was first used extensively on Chinese farms. Did this practice really go back  four thousand years? Instead of merely four thousand years, why not go back to eight  thousand years ago, when rice was first domesticated? Or why not stop at two thousand  years ago, or one thousand years, or even less?  Some historians have argued that human excrement may have been in use as a natural  resource as long ago as the Shang (or Yin) dynasty, about 3,000–3,600 years before the  present. That falls somewhat short of King’s estimate. The evidence for even that point  of origin, however, is shaky and imprecise. It comes mainly from a few inscriptions on  “oracle bones,” which were China’s first written records. The Shang dynasty was a time  when diviners or soothsayers began inscribing, with knife or brush, tiny pictographs on  the shoulder blades of oxen or on the belly shells of tortoises, covering the bones with  questions posed to the supernatural powers about the future. One of those pictographs  seems to have been the precursor for the modern Chinese character 分粪 (fen). As noted  earlier, fen refers these days to excrement, human and other, but in Shang times what  did it mean? Perhaps it meant not excreta but rather household sweepings, or dirt or  trash in general. Or it may have referred to the ashes that accumulated from burning  forests or grasslands for agricultural use and be associated with land reclamation. Still  another reading argues that fen referred to organic soil dressings, but not necessarily  to human wastes.  After careful examination of these conflicting interpretations of ancient writing, Wang  Lihua of Nankai University has concluded that “Chinese farmers began using human ex- crement, along with the stool of livestock and poultry, a variety of weeds, burned animal  bones, and ashes for fertilization more than 2,000 years ago.”28 What remains unclear  is which farmers we mean, how many of them there were, and what quantities of excre- ment and other supplements they used. The problem is that the appearance of a single pictograph or character cannot tell us  what was typical practice among rank-and-file peasants. That could only be deter- mined by finding a lot more material evidence, which is probably impossible.

The  models are for a type of building that may have housed pigs but also produced fer- tilizer from human waste.

They included all kinds of biodegradable trash, ashes from  stoves and fireplaces, a wide array of animal droppings, urine-soaked straw bedding from  stables and barns, and so-called “green manure,” crops that were grown not for food but  29 For an amusing, informative overview of pigs in Chinese history, see C.

Much later, around 1400 CE, farmers in China began press- ing vitamin-rich oil out of soybeans and using the dry residues to make “fertilizer cake.”30  Agricultural experts extolled all of these and urged that they be used to improve output.  Was anyone listening? The experts’ lists of fertilizers are so long that we must assume a  growing need. But it was not until five hundred to a thousand years ago that demand for  more food reached such a peak of urgency that a revolution in excrement use began.  Professor Li Bozhong has argued that the widespread and systematic use of human  fertilizer was coterminous with the invention of what he calls “ecological agriculture,”  an integrated system of farming that included a more carefully organized diversity of  crops and heavier doses of human manure to maintain soil fertility. That system first  emerged in the Song dynasty, which lasted from the tenth to the thirteenth centuries  CE. Then during the succeeding Ming and Qing periods, the use of human muck  became a much more common and systematic practice. That is, it did so primarily in  what became the most agriculturally productive region of the country, the rich Yangtze  delta (a.k.a. Jiangnan), the very region that Dr. King toured in 1909.31 Li has examined in detail farming practices near the city of Suzhou in Changshu Coun- ty, typified by a pair of brothers named Tan. Their farm consisted of a remarkably  interrelated and complementary series of contrived agro-ecosystems, including dry  land crop fields, irrigated paddies, and fish ponds, from which they harvested cereals,  fruit, vegetables, chicken, fish, and other commodities. Their farm featured intensified  recycling and tight nutrient loops, which gave them a lot more food and fiber, includ- ing highly profitable silk. The result was a much larger income than most farmers had  enjoyed before. A key ingredient in that process of innovation was the common use of  human manure. Every ounce of the stuff came to be utilized because every ounce was  now worth a lot in cash. 30 William Shurtleff and Akiko Aoyagi, “History of Soybean Crushing: Soy Oil and Soybean Meal,” from un- published manuscript, History of Soybeans and Soyfoods, 1100 B.C. to the 1980s (Lafayette, CA: Soyinfo  Center, 2007), http://www.soyinfocenter.com. 31 See Li Bozhong, “A Quantitative Analysis of the Demand for Fertilizer in the Jiangnan Region during the  Ming and Qing Period: The First Discussion of the Fertilizer Problem of Ming and Qing Dynasties,” Qing  History Journal (1999): 30–38, 108. But Mark Elvin has argued that an earlier agricultural revolution  occurred between the eighth and twelfth centuries, based on “the mastery of wet-field rice cultivation,  which allowed a great southward migration.” One aspect of that medieval revolution was the improvement  of soil preparation for rice transplants, including the use of human manure. See Elvin, The Pattern of the  Chinese Past (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1973), 113, 118–20. </page> <page sequence="30"> 30 RCC Perspectives: Transformations During the Ming and Qing dynasties, which lasted from 1368 to 1911 CE, Li’s so-called  “ecological agriculture” spread across the broad flatlands of Jiangnan, becoming more  and more popular and essential to that region’s economy. With the intensive applica- tion of human wastes came not only more abundant food but also a more sanitized  landscape. Farmers were assiduously combing the countryside for human wastes,  while at the same time they were buying the wastes of towns and cities. The result  was a tidier-looking country and city, though the air was redolent with toilet stench. Across the whole delta and beyond, a rationalized trade in human wastes developed  over this period. It was part of a broader tide of intensified “commercialization” that  characterized the region. Markets came into existence for almost every product grown  on those intensely managed farms and for the muck needed to restore them. More  tightly than ever, markets tied city and countryside together into a single web of pro- ductivity, prosperity, and economic rationality. Now the odor of excrement came to  smell like money.32 This new agriculture seems to have developed mainly in southern China near the  coast. It was far less prominent in the north. An imperial treatise published in 1737,  during the early Qing dynasty, complained that while the southerners seemed to  “treasure nightsoil as if it were gold,” the northerners remained ignorant of its value.  “Therefore, the streets in the north are not clean. The land is filthy. . . . The northern- ers should follow Jiangnan’s example. Every household should collect night soil.”33  Why didn’t the northerners, this government official wanted to know, see the potential  wealth in human excrement? Because they were, in his opinion, less intelligent and  enterprising. Or was it because they were not eager to take on the task of making city  life more salubrious by collecting the urbanites’ wastes? Or because they were reluc- tant to change their practices due to the fact that they did not feel the same pressure to  change as their southern counterparts? Perhaps their soils had not been so thoroughly  depleted, or their numbers did not press on the land so heavily. 32 For an overview of what the author calls “agrarian urbanization,” see Xue Yong, “‘Treasure Nightsoil as if  It Were Gold’: Economic and Ecological Links between Urban and Rural Areas in Late Imperial Jiangnan,”  Late Imperial China 26 (June 2005): 41–71. 33  Xue Yong, “Treasure Nightsoil as if It Were Gold,” 60–61.

In the early modern period it was the southern cities on or  near the coast that became the largest, fastest-growing, and richest in all of China.  Hangzhou (formerly known as Hangchow), sitting at the head of Hangzhou Bay, began  exploding in numbers and importance after it was made the southern terminus of the  Grand Canal, an artificial river which reached all the way to Beijing by 609 CE. Over  subsequent centuries the city served as a major seaport, until by the mid-nineteenth  century it became one of the largest cities on earth. Hangzhou was also a prefecture,  or political division, in the province of Zhejiang, and as such its total population ex- ceeded three million by 1820. Another city-prefecture, Suzhou (Soochow), located  within the Yangtze delta, counted 6.5 million inhabitants by 1851, while in the same  year its sister city, Nanjing, located in the very heartland of that delta, counted 6.2  million residents.34 Cities swelled so hugely because surplus people from rural districts migrated to them,  looking for work. Upon arrival, the newcomers often had no public or private toilets to  serve them; therefore, they were forced to void their wastes along the streets or wher- ever they could. Noticing how the feces piled up, shrewd minds saw an opportunity for  making a profit and began collecting those wastes and selling them to farmers back in  the countryside. Many of the new migrants were among the leaders in the business,  collecting manure by scraping it from the streets and emptying household buckets and  night stools. This odiferous waste was called “night soil” because it was collected in  the early morning, after nighttime use of household privies or chamber pots. The night  soil collectors figured out how and where to find the best manure and which routes out  of town would lead straight to farmers. The farmers paid them well for more fertilizer,  in order to produce more food for the city. This back-and-forth exchange became the  basis of a new economy, unprecedented for scale and profit in the world. Scholars today have created a fancy phrase for this changing geography of muck:  “metabolic rift.” It means that body wastes came to be generated mainly in urban  places, far from the fields that fed most of the people. Metabolism refers to the chem- 34 These statistics are from Liang Fangzhong, The Statistics of the Household and Population, Farmland  and Land Tax in Ancient China (Beijing: Zhonghua Book Campany, 2008), 430–37, 446–47, 450–51; Cao  Shuji, The History of China’s Population, vol. 4, Ming Dynasty (Shanghai: Fudan University Press, 2000),  137–38; and Cao Shuji, The History of China’s Population, vol. 5, Qing Dynasty (Shanghai: Fudan Univer- sity Press, 2001), 72–77, 85–86, 105–7.  </page> <page sequence="32"> 32 RCC Perspectives: Transformations istry of staying alive—the process of matter and energy exchange that goes on within  a living organism to keep it from dying. The social organizations created by humans  must follow the same metabolic laws as all organisms. For thousands of years farmers  had derived whatever nutrients they needed close to home. Given a small, dispersed,  and fairly steady population, they could grow crops for a long time in the same place  without going far afield. But with larger numbers of people came migration, resettle- ment, urbanization, trade, and commercialization—and then a rift began to appear  and widen between city and country, leaving both places impoverished, depleted, and  polluted. Such became the fate of some parts of China by the Ming period, and even  more so, by the Qing. Food left farms and journeyed to cities, whereas body wastes  piled up in the same cities, becoming a deadly pollutant and an offense to urban noses.  The phrase “metabolic rift” comes from American sociologist John Bellamy Foster,  who was inspired by the radical social criticism of Karl Marx. Both teacher and fol- lower have blamed Western capitalism for this serious breakdown in human metabo- lism. Capitalist investment in agriculture, Marx noted, pushed people from the land— remember those infamous eighteenth-century enclosure acts in Britain that forced  so many tenant farmers off their fields and into towns and cities. Capitalist relations,  Marx declared, disturbs “the metabolic interaction between man and the earth, i.e.,  it prevents the return to the soil of its constituent elements consumed by man in the  form of food and clothing; hence it hinders the operation of the eternal natural condi- tion for the lasting fertility of the soil.” He summed up his critique in a pithy and much  quoted phrase: “All progress in capitalist agriculture is a progress in the art, not only  of robbing the worker, but of robbing the soil.”35 But this Marxist explanation runs the danger of an oversimplification of history, exag- gerating the role of the West and perpetuating a myth of ancient pre-capitalist, non- Western harmony on the land. China in fact began to experience a “metabolic rift”  centuries before capitalism emerged in Western Europe and began forcing people into  cities. Not until the late twentieth century did China become truly “capitalistic” in its  mainstream thinking, in government policies, or in social hierarchy. Before that, busi- nesspeople and business principles did not rule the country. Capitalism, which makes  35 Karl Marx, Capital: A Critique of Political Economy (reprint, New York: Modern Library, 1906), 554–55.

A merchant class, to be sure, existed in China  for many centuries, but it was not highly esteemed or honored, ranking below farmers,  laborers, and government officials, and the merchants did not rule over the agrarian  state. Certainly, state leaders had often tried to promote “development,” encouraging  technological innovation for the sake of expanding social wealth. Unmistakably they  had sought the conquest of nature, but no businesspeople had led that conquest. It  was the farmers who had spearheaded China’s traditional conquest of nature. In Jiang- nan, the farmers and state together had developed a system of intensive agriculture  and spawned the biggest cities. There, well before capitalist England or Europe, a  stark metabolic rift emerged. Humans may have tried to rejoin what had been sundered in nature, but doing so  would have required both rural and urban innovation. Li Bozhong offers a telling ex- ample of how a few Chinese people tried to overcome metabolic rift by adopting new  ideas and methods. It comes from a village located far from urban centers and lacking  sufficient fertilizer to meet its needs. In desperation the adults and children learned to  go along the roads collecting the feces of travelers who happened to answer the call  of nature. Then someone came up with a better idea: build a clean, comfortable public  toilet—a three-room palace painted in glistening white—and offer the facility along  with free toilet paper to those passing through. The point was to entice the traveler to  leave a deposit of his or her manure. Thus the town could collect excrement from well  beyond its limits.36 Where farmers lived nearer a town or city, a heap of treasure lay just over the horizon  and within much easier reach. There was so much muck in the city going to waste. All  that was needed was a group of middlemen, called fenfu, to take over its collection and  redistribution to the farmers. By the early modern period the feces being spread on  farms along China’s coast were largely coming from such urban centers as Shanghai,  Hangzhou, Ningbo, Suzhou, and Nanjing. An army of men driving wheeled carts be- came a familiar presence on city streets, combing the main avenues and byways, look- ing for human wastes everywhere. Their carts could carry six to 10 covered wooden  36 Li Bozhong (in “A Quantitative Analysis of the Demand for Fertilizer in the Jiangnan Region during the  Ming and Qing Period”), illustrates the “toilet economy” through the story Digging New Holes: The Miser  Became a Rich Man (掘新坑铿鬼成财), written by the Master of the Zhuoran Pavilion. </page> <page sequence="34"> 34 RCC Perspectives: Transformations containers, each holding as much as 60 pounds (27 kilograms) of excrement. Or where  draft animals and carts were in short supply, unemployed men could be hired at low  wages to carry the heavy loads of feces on poles resting on their aching shoulders. A picturesque feature of the muck trade was the gondolas, or long narrow boats,  devoted exclusively to distribution. Franklin King saw them in operation in the early  twentieth century, collecting urban wastes in Suzhou and floating them far into the  countryside. Men and animals brought pails of muck to large empty lots located out- side the city, selling it at the rate of a cent per pail. Here the muck was spread, dried,  and sanitized. Nearby were segregated docks designated for gondolas to tie up and  load the fertilizer on board. “The boats,” King wrote in a letter, “are carefully washed  outside and covered before leaving the city and the offensiveness of the practice is not  nearly so great as you might think.”37 Each year the city of Suzhou, from its foreign  quarters alone, shipped out 276,000 tons (250,382 metric tonnes) of excrement.

King was as impressed by the gondolier’s cheery work attitudes as he was with the  farmers’. In his pages we can almost hear the boatmen poling their craft through rural  districts and shouting enthusiastically, “Here comes your muck!” Along the way they  may have sung many romantic tunes about willow trees swaying over the water or a  37 Franklin King Papers, Box 2, folder 2, page 40. </page> <page sequence="35"> The Good Muck 35 maiden’s dark eyes inviting a lover, warbling like the gondoliers of Venice who floated  on Italian canals also redolent with excrement. Did the farmers who received all the  muck from the cities also sing lovely songs as they ladled the purchased poop onto  growing plants, so carefully feeding each new sprig of rice? To treat human body wastes as a valuable commodity, bought and sold in markets, re- turning them to the soil after they had been separated from it by urban migration, was  a revolutionary step in China’s transformation of the natural environment. It required  farmers who were prepared mentally and economically to get the most out of feces. In  the cities it required a class of laborers who formed a human drainpipe to the fields.  And then it depended on an elaborate scale of value differentiating the different types  of human excrement. The body wastes of Hangzhou’s elite, because of their better  health, which came from eating more diversified diets, ranked as the most valuable.  The feces of the poorer classes brought a lower price. Even in excrement markets  there was an elaborate hierarchy. Pig manure was ranked too, but not so highly as hu- man, and usually it was confined to a particular set of crops, while sheep manure was  esteemed best for others. Urine had its own special market, river mud another price  and use, while old bones and slaughterhouse blood and offal had still another.  By the time of King’s visit, the Jiangnan region had become adept in extracting fertility  out of a nauseating chaos. They had created an advanced system of waste recycling,  which paid large profits to a group of merchants but also yielded large dividends to the  agrarian state in the form of tribute or taxation. Not everyone shared fully in the labor  or in the wealth that made this system function so well. In the city as on the farm some  people gathered all the crap while others gathered most of the money. Historian Cao Mu has probed the archives of the coastal city of Tianjin and uncov- ered fascinating insights into the early-twentieth-century muck trade.38 Tianjin was a  northern treaty port that had been carved up by the imperial powers of Britain, France,  Italy, Japan, Germany, and other nations into nine concessions, creating an unusu- ally international commingling of peoples in comparison to the rest of China. Here as  elsewhere, people once had defecated anywhere they could, on the streets or in back- yards. But that helter-skelter way of disposal became intolerable with denser settle- 38 Cao Mu, “The Public Lavatory of Tianjin: A Change of Urban Faeces Disposal in the Process of Moderni- zation,” Global Environment 9 (2016): 196–218. </page> <page sequence="36"> 36 RCC Perspectives: Transformations ment. Overcoming the unsanitary conditions became one of the city government’s  main projects, especially after Westerners began demanding greater cleanliness. Inhabitants of the different foreign quarters urged the construction of elaborate sewers  that would wash all wastes into the sea, as cities in Europe and the United States were  doing. But before that expensive investment in infrastructure could be taken seriously,  Tianjin began licensing and constructing public lavatories. By the late 1940s almost five  hundred such facilities existed. They were not all equal in size, comfort, or accessibility.  But generally they were located within reach of every citizen—making street pollution  unnecessary, concentrating waste deposits in designated spaces, not too far away from  people in case of urgent need and requiring only a short walk on a cold morning. Some  residents seldom used those public lavatories, either because they were too rich to need  a communal facility or too weak and infirm to walk to one. But most people learned to  go there, paying a small fee for access, and they were better off because no longer were  they forced to dwell amongst their own or others’ muck accumulating along the narrow  hutongs, or alleyways, lined with courtyard residences.  The quality of those public lavatories improved steadily. At first they were often no more  than straw shelters, with grass-matted walls and tattered roofs, open to the wind and  prying eyes. New or old, however, those facilities required one to lower oneself over a  dark and redolent cesspool—squatting down on one’s haunches while swatting away  the buzzing flies. And in the public lavatories one had no choice but to move one’s  bowels while visiting with the neighbors or hearing their fights. Privacy was impossible. So bad were the earliest structures that in 1937, according to Cao, Tianjin’s Public  Health Bureau had to pass regulations specifying that “each lavatory have a red brick  wall, a lead roof, a screen door and windows, concrete floor and squat pits, and a seep- ing pit to discharge urine. The inside and outside of the wall must be coated with ce- ment one meter thick, and the building regulations of concrete grooves and clay tanks  below the ground were to be decided according to the government’s judgment.”39 But  construction regulations alone could not achieve high standards of maintenance or  teach people better habits of use, nor did they end all controversy or struggle over who  had the right to collect and who to sell the public’s excreta. 39 Cao’s source for these new regulations is “Renovating the City’s Public Lavatory, 1937,” The Archive of  Tianjin, J0001-3-000624. </page> <page sequence="37"> The Good Muck 37 One especially fierce battle occurred between a publicly licensed lavatory owner  named Ma, and an unlicensed competitor, a Mr. Wu, who had “squatted” in another  sense: he had boldly seized space on the street and put up an outdoor privy for his  restaurant, competing for the local trade without government approval. Each rival ac- cused the other of endangering public health through poor sanitation. The battle went  on until mediators intervened and backed Ma, but only on the condition that he must  clean up his squalid facility. Pure laissez-faire economics was not tolerable in this busi- ness. Yet there were always would-be monopolists who tried to grab control of all the  public lavatories across the city and corner the fertilizer market. They wanted to grasp  for themselves the substantial gain that came from selling muck to farmers. None of those muck chains that appeared in Suzhou or Tianjin, Beijing or Shanghai,  would endure. Already by the mid-twentieth century, forces were at work breaking  them apart, reopening the metabolic rift, allowing human feces once more to be wast- ed, poisoning the air and polluting the land. III Before we follow the collapse of the excremental economy in our time, we need to ask  more pointedly why it came into existence at all: why, and not merely when. Why did  China’s peasants come to rely so heavily on human excrement to produce food? Farm- ers elsewhere commonly scorned the practice as too “dirty,” and they still do so in  parts of Yunnan among the non-Han minority peoples. The explanation for China’s ex- ceptionalism on this matter can be linked to another, larger question: Why over many  centuries did China’s peasant farmers devour so much of what was natural around  them—forests, grasslands, wetlands, mountain slopes—destroying so many ecosys- tems needed by other species? Why did peasants send into extinction the country’s  elephants, tigers, and rhinos, along with birds, fishes, and insects of so many dazzling  colors and shapes?40 The answer to that question, like the answer as to why excre- ment was needed so badly, is the same: because there were so many human bellies to  fill—too many in fact for the soil to support without more and more excreta. That is the  simple and, indeed, obvious answer, but explaining why there were so many people  crowding China’s lands is a bit more complicated. 40 Mark Elvin, The Retreat of the Elephants: An Environmental History of China (New Haven: Yale University  Press, 2004), 9–85. </page> <page sequence="38"> 38 RCC Perspectives: Transformations Peasants fought against and killed nature not because they hated it or because they  were motivated by modern capitalist greed. On the contrary, their folk religion told  them that nature was the home of many spirits that must be revered, or at least feared.  But after kowtowing to the spirits within nature, they did not ask themselves the ques- tion Albert Howard thought all farmers should ask: What practical lessons can we  learn from nature in order to live sustainably in this place? Learning such lessons  would have required deliberately keeping some of the forest intact and entering it  respectfully in order to observe how nature works. Instead, wholesale destruction out- paced humble observation.  The peasants left almost nothing that could serve as a teaching resource. In place of  the wild they constructed an increasingly human-made and human-centered land- scape, though more so in some places than others. If one could call Jiangnan’s farms  “ecological,” as Li Bozhong does, they were never ecological in the sense of care- fully preserving the natural landscape and using it as a model for humans. “Ecologi- cal” when used as a label for traditional societies means only that they recycled their  wastes, used fish carcasses or mud to feed their crops, and so forth. Peasants were  not ecological in a modern scientific sense. They were, instead, economical—thrifty  and careful with nutrients, but all the same intent on extermination and appropriation. Following the invention of agriculture, peasants all over the planet began to destroy  the wild nature that had evolved over millions of years. They did so in order to support  their own reproduction, to feed their growing number of mouths. Long before the rise  of consumer societies, where needs and wants have become virtually infinite, peasant  societies felt many gnawing needs and wants of their own, especially the urge to eat  and have sexual intercourse. Why should we view those needs as more pure or good  than the “needs” stoked and nurtured in shopping malls? From the perspective of non- human species, one human need was not better than another. In the face of aggressive  human needs, they must retreat and find safer, less populated frontiers where people  were scarce, until finally there might be no place left to go. China has, to be sure, a long history of reproductive self-control that must be acknowl- edged, but it was practiced for economic survival, not ecological harmony. None of the  methods the peasants used to prevent pregnancy or to manage family size—including,  most horribly, female infanticide—ever brought them into a lasting state of natural  </page> <page sequence="39"> The Good Muck 39 harmony or equilibrium. Nor did those halting, poorly understood, and sometimes vio- lent population-control methods prevent the ongoing, relentless assault on the land.  While facing squarely this central truth in history, we do not necessarily have to en- dorse the old-fashioned Malthusian doctrine about the inevitability of poverty. Thomas  Malthus, author of Essay on the Principle of Population, first published in 1798, after  witnessing a huge increase in the number of poor people in England, concluded that  producing more food would fail to alleviate hunger. More production might even lead  to more misery, for it was the nature of people, he believed, to breed and overshoot the  land’s capacity to produce. That oversimplified formula, one he later softened some- what, blamed the human condition on inner drives established by the Divine Creator.  But today we must insist that there was never any divine decree that made people  want to reproduce. There was only innate self-interest, even if that self-interest might  be amenable to cultural change.  By giving birth to lots of children, China’s peasants hoped to have offspring (male chil- dren especially) to depend on in old age. Who but one’s offspring would be there to  help at the end of life? For thousands of years neither the village nor the state offered  any old-age assistance. More children were the only form of pension available. So little  children came along like cabbages in the field: planted with calculation, watered and fed  with nutrients, stocked up for the rough days ahead. A surplus of children assured that  there would always be someone around to provide for the parents’ comfort and security.  The Danish economist Ester Boserup, who is favored today far more than Malthus, pro- vided an optimistic alternative theory. She too granted that population always presses  on natural resources, but she contended that more children led not to impoverishment  but to agricultural innovation. Or as she put it, population is “the independent variable  which in its turn is a major factor determining agricultural developments.”41 As children  become more numerous, a food crisis ensues. All might seem hopeless, hunger foreor- dained. But then farmers learn how to shorten their fallow patterns, from 20 or 30 years  to five years or fewer, until eventually they do away with fallowing altogether. They fig- 41 Ester Boserup, The Conditions of Agricultural Growth: The Economics of Agrarian Change under Popu- lation Pressures (London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1965), 4.

To do that, however, requires finding  fertilizers that can increase productivity, or practicing irrigation, or creating new breeds  of plants and animals that can use resources more efficiently. Boserup spent several years in Asia observing its struggle for economic development  and concluded cheerfully that demographic increase has always been a blessing, never  a curse. Population pressure pushes societies upward toward a higher civilization and  material abundance for all. Hunters and gatherers managed the earth hardly at all, so  over time they had to give way to peasant farmers, who in turn must give way to those  armed with modern technology. Every new baby means another brain ready to contrib- ute to that progressive narrative, another hope for innovation, and another brick in the  road toward abundance.  The flaw in Boserupian economics is that humans cannot expect to go on improving  their land forever, overcoming any and all limits in nature, never encountering any set- backs. The first lands to be conquered are the easiest, but then it gets harder and harder,  and more and more expensive, to keep the process moving forward. In opposition to  Malthusian pessimism, Boserup offered an equally simple optimism. She pinned her  hopes on the human mind’s infinite resourcefulness, glossing over the contrary evi- dence and ignoring the dark chapters of recurrent land abuse, ecological decline, and  social collapse. Never fully acknowledged in Boserup’s writings is that more people are  dying from malnutrition today than ever before. To avoid such disasters people have  been forced to work like demons. The quest for survival has pushed societies toward  “enhanced labor productivity”—a dignified way of saying “enslavement to work.” And  to gain that productivity, those in positions of power again and again have intensified the  burdens on the poor while seizing the fruits for themselves. Trying to meet the most fundamental of imperatives, the survival of self and offspring,  the peasant farmers of China, as elsewhere, kept trying to expand output. They mo- nopolized the process of photosynthesis. Always they tried to get more food out of the  same old fields. According to Dwight Perkins, in the period from 1368 to 1968 China  increased its agricultural output by no less than 400 percent. The conquest of new land,  he calculates, explains one half of that increase, while “the other half was the result of a  doubling in the average output per unit area, which was again a development powered  by the population growth.” In other words, Chinese farmers figured out how to produce  </page> <page sequence="41"> The Good Muck 41 twice as much foodstuff on the same acres. One of the most effective ways of doing that  was to work longer and longer hours; another was to increase the number of workers,  and still another was to lard the land with fertilizer.42 Today China, which once supported only a few thousand humans, supports a billion and  a half, the most people of any nation by far. One can celebrate that accumulation of hu- manity as a glorious achievement, a defiant rebuke to all the Malthusian pessimists. Or  one can see it as a tragedy for the earth, a leading cause of the modern environmental  crisis, and a vandalizing of our natural legacy. In any case, it now seems clear that such  increases in food or population will be nearly impossible to quadruple again over the  next six centuries. Perhaps the best summary of China’s demography comes from Judith Banister, a spe- cialist in population history and China’s in particular. She sums up the country’s record  in these terse numbers: The population apparently fluctuated between 37 and 60 million for a thousand  years, showing no consistent trend. The first recorded instance of sustained popu- lation growth (averaging an estimated 1.2 percent a year) took place in the last  half of the eleventh century under the Song (Sung) Dynasty, but this trend was  reversed by subsequent centuries of dynastic struggle, civil war, Mongol invasion,  and bubonic plague. Then, starting from the early years of the Ming Dynasty in the  late fourteenth century, China experienced six centuries of population growth. Only  twice was this growth checked, once because of the fall of the Ming Dynasty in the  early seventeenth century, and once during the Taiping Rebellion that hastened the  decline of the Qing (Ch’ing) Dynasty in the late nineteenth century. . . . The period  of most rapid population growth (1749–1851) saw more than a doubling of China’s  population in a century. 42 Dwight H.

The pressure would not  end there.43 After 1851 the population went on increasing exponentially, until demo- graphic curves were bending almost vertically upward, like a rocket heading straight  into outer space. Surely that extraordinary in- crease in human beings has  been China’s most distinc- tive feature and most pow- erful determinant of social  and environmental change.

Add to the  equation the recurrent changes in the world’s and China’s climate, shifting from dry  years to wet to dry again, and the past begins to look, in John Brooke’s phrase, like  “a rough journey.”44 Population change—and mostly it has been population increase,  whether slow and gradual or fast and furious—has been one of the greatest drivers of  history, and too often we simply ignore it. Or we may try to justify it, as both Malthus  and Boserup did, as a kind of providential force, pressing us onward to “higher levels  of civilization,” even when those increased human numbers may have brought not an  advance but a severe decline in the quality and variety of life. The peasants of China drove themselves hard straight into a feces-based economy.  They did so to escape a fate they were making for themselves, and that others ruling  over them had helped them make. They solved resource shortages by becoming ever  more resourceful, displaying knowledge and skill in that process, forcing themselves  to work from sunrise to sunset, forcing every other being in their household to do the  43 Judith Banister, “A Brief History of China’s Population,” in The Population of Modern China, ed.

In very  recent times, change has taken a turn toward the invention and use of chemical fer- tilizers coming out of a scientific laboratory. During the early part of the twentieth  century, scientists in Europe figured out how to create fertilizer out of the very air  around us and from fossil gas pumped from the ground, a breakthrough that seemed  to promise an altogether superior remedy, with no apparent drawbacks, for restoring  degraded, depleted soils. Here is Albert Howard speaking in 1940, complaining that chemistry would make it  harder for his farming model under development in Indore to succeed and be put into  common practice: Artificial manures are widely used. The feature of the manuring of the West is the  use of artificial manures. The factories engaged during the Great War in the fixa- tion of atmospheric nitrogen for the manufacture of explosives had to find other  markets, the use of nitrogenous fertilizers in agriculture increased, until to-day the  majority of farmers and market gardeners base their manurial programme on the  cheapest forms of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) on the market.  What may be conveniently described as the NPK mentality dominates farming alike  in the experimental stations and the countryside. Vested interests, entrenched in  time of national emergency, have gained a stranglehold.  Artificial manures involve less labour and less trouble than farm-yard manure. . . .  For the moment farming has been made to pay. But there is another side to this pic- ture. These chemicals and these machines can do nothing to keep the soil in good  heart. By their use the processes of growth can never be balanced by the processes  of decay. All that they can accomplish is the transfer of the soil’s capital to current  account.45 45 Howard, Agricultural Testament, 14. </page> <page sequence="44"> 44 RCC Perspectives: Transformations Earlier, Franklin King had known little of chemical fertilizers—they were mostly a futur- istic dream during his lifetime. But by the 1930s and 40s, chemical (artificial or commer- cial) fertilizers were becoming ubiquitous. They promised to fulfill Boserupian prom- ises, to increase agricultural production without limits. As Howard feared, however, they  might “do nothing to keep the soil in good heart.” During World War I, the German chemist Fritz Haber discovered how to convert a gas,  atmospheric nitrogen, into liquid ammonia by bonding that gas to hydrogen derived  from natural gas, a fossil fuel. Nitrogen was abundant in the air, and Germany and  other nations first learned how to extract it for use in armaments manufacturing. To  aid Germany’s defense, the chemical company BASF assigned one of its top scientists  Carl Bosch the job of using nitrogen to make explosives. Then after the war, what  came to be called the Haber-Bosch process of nitrogen extraction was turned from  making explosives to making chemical fertilizers. Liquid ammonia, rich in nitrogen, was the base for that fertilizer. It could be combined  with phosphorous and potash—the latter chemicals were easily mined in various parts  of the world—and, presto, a new generation of “multi-nutrient” fertilizers came on the  market. They dramatically altered farming, making fertilizer seem cheaper than it had  ever been and a lot more pleasant to handle.46 All over the world, farmers began buying the magical N in the form of liquid ammonia  or dry-powder urea, along with P and K, to apply to their crops. New seed varieties  designed to absorb those elements more efficiently appeared on the market, and the  result was astonishingly higher yields in the countryside. This was true for all the basic  foodstuffs and fibers—vegetables, cereals, cotton, and feed for livestock. But that enhanced production came at a high cost, not in terms of money as much as  in environmental quality. Muck quickly dropped out of the farmer’s list of “resources”  and became once more “waste,” dismissed for its low economic value. Now without  a productive role to play, muck became once again a pollutant, although now it was  46 The best account is Vaclav Smil, Enriching the Earth: Fritz Haber, Carl Bosch, and the Transformation  of World Food Production (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2004). See also his papers, “Nitrogen Cycle and  World Food Production,” World Agriculture 2 (2011): 9–13; and “Detonator of the Population Explosion,”  Nature 400 (1999): 415. The Haber-Bosch process is one of the leading reasons why the world population  has increased from 1.6 billion in 1900 to 7.4 billion today. </page> <page sequence="45"> The Good Muck 45 being generated in prodigious quantities by the billions of people crowding the planet.  Muck that was no longer part of agriculture became once again dangerous stuff, foul- ing streams and lakes, creating algal blooms, killing a wide spectrum of other species. After several decades of importing chemical fertilizers from other countries, China  began building its own nitrogen factories. The biggest in Republican China, and for a  short while the biggest in East Asia, was named Yongli; founded in Nanjing in 1933, it  was ruined soon after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Then in 1975, just one  year before Mao Zedong died, a large national facility came into production, marking  a great leap forward into the chemical age. Just as communism broke down the old  unequal land ownership patterns, it also turned farmers into consumers of chemical  fertilizers. Eventually China was producing and consuming more of the miracle addi- tives than any other nation on earth.47 Today, its factories turn out some 50 million tons  (45 million metric tonnes) a year, about half of a world total of more than one hundred  million metric tonnes. Those two figures may be among the most important statistics  in modern economics. Cheap mass production of synthetic fertilizers has begun to revolutionize the practices  of even the smallest Chinese farmers, allowing them to keep working the land for a few  more years until they are worn out and expendable. National Geographic writer Dan  Charles tells the story of an elderly man near Nanjing, Song Linyuan, who has farmed  the same 1.3-acre parcel his whole life. In pre-chemical days he annually spread on his  rice crops some 130 pounds (60 kilograms) of nitrogen—all of which came from muck.  The old manure-based farming was hard work for an old man—including so much  painful stooping to insert rice plants into the paddies, then the meticulous spooning  out of liquid and biosolid manures, and finally the harvesting and threshing of the rice  crops. Weary of work, the old man decided to try spreading urea instead of excrement.  It proved so easy and inexpensive, and so effective in results, that he soon escalated  his usage to 500 pounds (227 kilograms) of nitrogen a year. Remarkably, his yields  more than doubled to 7,200 pounds (3,266 kilograms) per acre. Never mind that most  of the fertilizer he spread was wasted; it was never taken up by the plants because  47 Kai Zhang, “The Evolution and Development of Chinese Agricultural Fertilization in the Last Hundred  Years,” Agricultural History of China 3 (2000): 107–13. </page> <page sequence="46"> 46 RCC Perspectives: Transformations it leached into groundwater or ran off into ditches and streams. But what this small  farmer saw and cared about was not the money he wasted on unused fertilizer, but the  bounteous crop he harvested and the painful labor he avoided.48  Today, how many Chinese producers and consumers have become dependent on rice  and other foods raised with chemical fertilizers? The answer is almost everybody.  Whether consumers reside in a city or rural area, purchase food in supermarkets or  raise it for direct consumption, they are eating chemical fertilizer. Astonishingly, some  80 percent of the nitrogen in Chinese bodies now comes from food produced with  the aid of chemical fertilizers. So change is going on deep within the modernized  human body. When does such change become damaging? As fear spreads about the  unknown health consequences, China’s supermarkets have begun to promote “organi- cally raised” fruits and vegetables, which claim to use no or little commercial fertil- izers or pesticides. However, it remains to be seen whether a nation the size of China  can be fed organically, or whether new safety concerns may arise as the next round of  agricultural innovation unfolds. Night soil has not completely disappeared from the farm. It is still part of Chinese food  production. Around Tai Lake, for example, a few farmers continue to collect and store  their family wastes and use them on crops. Large ceramic tanks or concrete pits are  in plain view around their houses or outbuildings. A sluice may connect a farmer’s  pig stall with a night-soil storage tank, mixing animal with human manure and urine.  But these days the supply of that older organic fertilizer is so small that it cannot be  depended on for growing the major cereals like rice or wheat. Excreta are now used  almost exclusively on small vegetable patches. Perhaps we should not waste our pity  on the old-fashioned vegetable farmer who is still ladling that old smelly stuff out of a  bucket and spreading it over lettuce and broccoli. She or he may be making a better  income than ever before. Among supermarket consumers it is a common belief that  bok choy (Chinese cabbage) grown with human excrement has better flavor than other  kinds. Certainly, it costs more.49 48 Dan Charles, “Our Fertilized World,” National Geographic 223 (May 2013): 94–110.

There are strong economic and hu- manitarian reasons for that shift. It has brought food abundance and a more balanced  diet. Working the land has become easier than it was in the old days. Modern methods  have allowed millions of laborers to abandon their home villages and relocate to cities,  withdrawing their energies from agricultural production and putting them to use in  washing the windows of silver-gray skyscrapers or raking through overflowing gar- bage bins outside restaurants and dining halls.  Besides the loss of rural population, with its hidden toll in personal feelings, and be- sides the acceleration of social inequality, has come a host of environmental calami- ties. Chief among them is the growing eutrophication of China’s waterways. Eventu- ally, the superabundant chemical fertilizers leach into lakes and rivers, causing algae  blooms that deplete suspended oxygen and kill once-vibrant ecosystems. Along the  seacoast the fertilizer industry is responsible for a series of “dead zones” at the mouth  of every river—watery expanses where almost nothing can live under the newly preva- lent anaerobic conditions, which are fatal not only to marine species but also to the  fishermen who depend on them to live.  Many decades ago the Western scientists King and Howard came to Asia seeking  to learn from a very old model of farming, one they hoped would be more natural  and sustainable. But since then a powerful tsunami of population pressures, recurrent  famines, the economic imperatives of industrialization, urbanization, and capitalism,  along with many new technologies, have washed over and wiped out the permanen- cy they sought. Not completely so, for awareness of the threat that unutilized body  wastes or excessive chemical fertilizers can bring has spread across the land and, by  the twenty-first century, that awareness has begun to find its voice in protest. But at  the time Howard died in 1947, the writing was already on the wall. Even China, which  for a long time stood fast as a holdout for traditional methods of building fertility,  would join the modern flood tide and even ride the waves.   As those Western scientists did, we value tradition and for good reason. Whatever is  traditional can represent hard-won wisdom. From the rich fund of traditional experi- ence, field-testing has gone on over long expanses of time that cannot be duplicated  in any academic laboratory. Tradition can offer guidance to what works over the long  </page> <page sequence="48"> 48 RCC Perspectives: Transformations term and what can minimize risk. In agriculture as elsewhere, we do well to take seri- ously the old ways that have stood the test of time. Yet any tradition, no matter how wise or rational, can suddenly become a dead-end  from which there is no escape. Instead of evolving, agriculture can become involut- ed, turning in on itself, failing to innovate sufficiently to keep up with demand, and  proving unable to adapt. This has been frequently identified as China’s great problem  before the days of Chairman Mao—the curse of involution. Fixed on maintaining tra- dition, farmers failed to create new ideas and their communities found themselves  in a downward spiral until they began to vanish into the soils they once exploited.  Traditions can carry the seeds of their own destruction, as when China’s preferences  for large families and high fertility became so dysfunctional that it drove the country  relentlessly into the violent whirlpool of upheaval and revolution. For many Westerners, the most innovative contribution of Chinese agriculture was that  of spreading human muck on fields from which people ate. For a long time, that practice  proved effective in solving two problems: turning a dangerous pollutant of both city and  countryside into a natural resource, and using that resource to feed an ever-growing  population. Mark one up for peasants! But then that old practice ran out of efficacy and  it collapsed for more than one reason. China could not continue down that road forever.  It could not sustain itself on its own excrement. In holding fast to that tradition, people  were forced into a state of degradation that should not have been allowed to continue. In  the context of a shrinking planet on which too many people are burdening the soils and  yet demanding a cleaner, healthier, and easier lifestyle, China’s recent trajectory means  its excremental past has lost out in the struggle for existence. Farmers have been forced  to ditch their traditions and embrace modernity.  When tradition fails, science and technology may come to the rescue, or at least that  is our hope. With the aid of sciences like ecology we may discover how to put human  wastes where they can do little or no damage, how to restore soil fertility in a manner  that is safe and labor friendly, and how to recycle all the muck we produce day after  day and make it once more a national treasure. At the same time modern science  is never without drawbacks. Every innovation, including the latest sewage treatment  plant designed to the highest engineering standards, may bring complications and  unwanted consequences. We can only press forward in hope, tempered by the realism  that comes from heeding tradition and experience.  </page> <page sequence="49"> The Good Muck 49 Fellow historians, don’t turn away from this tangled story of bodies, nutrients, and re- sources. Don’t turn up your noses at the stench that once permeated fields and dwell- ings, soiling clothing and hands and making stomachs heave. Don’t run away from  the foul odors that still gather around our cities and farms. Don’t ignore the centrality  of agriculture to our history of living within the natural world. Don’t over-idealize,  as some have done, the traditional agriculture of China or romanticize its poor over- worked people, who were forced by their own fecundity to collect and make use of  their body wastes simply to survive year after year. Don’t assume that every scientific  advance is in fact a step forward for nature and humanity.  The lesson of this story is that every utopia, whether of the past or future, tradition or  modernity, eludes us when we stare down at our own excrement.  * This paper began as a plenary talk to the Harvard University / Boston College confer- ence on “Resourceful Things: An Interdisciplinary Symposium on Resource Exploration  and Exploitation in China,” 20–22 April 2016, which was organized by Ling Zhang.
