<plain_text><page sequence="1">FULANI-HAUSA ARCHITECTURE LABELLE PRUSSIN n 1804, after the Fulani defeated the numerous Gobir cavalry at Tabkin Kwotto, Uthman Dan Fodio's daughter exulted that "Yunfa fled from bare-legged herdsmen,/ Who had neither mail nor horseman;/ We that had been chased like hares/ Can now live in houses." The verse embodies an architectural ideal, one that encapsulates the architectural process set in motion by the Fulani jihad during the opening decades of the nineteenth century in the West-Central Sudan of Africa.1 The Fulani-inspired, Fulani-led jihad established a Fulani-dominated govern- ment whose primary task was to integrate disparate peoples with a kin-based social structure within its conquest boundaries.2 Despite the common cultural identity that characterized the indigenous Hausa groupings in the savannah of what is now northern Nigeria and southern Niger, the area was one of great heterogeneity. There was surprisingly little political cohesion among the Hausa city-states that occupied the region at the end of the eighteenth century. It has also been suggested that even though the original aim of thejihad was Islamic reform, "the most lasting consequence of the movement was a profound political, social, cultural, religious, economic, demographic, and intellectual revolution totally unprece- dented in its scope and intensity in the his- tory of the West-Central Sudan."3 The fact that its original aim was Islamic reform also suggests that all aspects of the revolution were cast in the frame of a set of Islamic values. 1. BEHAVIOR IN SPACE DICTATED BY THE CARDINAL DIRECTION OF MECCA DURING PRAYERS OF THE TABASKI CELEBRATION, DJENNE, MALI. THE FRIDAY MOSQUE WAS TOO SMALL TO ACCOMMODATE THE CITY POPULACE- HENCE THE OPEN-AIR ASSEMBLY. The establishment of the Sokoto Cali- phate and the attendant Fulani Emirate that pledged allegiance to it also consoli- dated the previously isolated and alienated Fulani groupings into a single community with common interests, objectives, and standards - hence with a new, separate identity under which the disparate, barely defined Hausa states were subsumed. The revolution wrought a transformation from pastoral, nomadic life-styles to sedentary ones, from social networks based on kin relations and al- legiances to innumerable Earth-based centers to a political network with alle- giance to a centralized state structure in an urban setting. In so doing, it also created a new aesthetic, a new set of symbols, and a new language of political architecture radically different tech- nologically, formally, and iconographi- cally from other savannah architectures, which have all been haphazardly grouped under the vague, generic term "Sudanese style."4 This paper describes the architectural process set in motion by the revolution, a process that not only reflected the chang- ing nature of Fulani society but which it- self gradually became an active instru- ment in establishing and reinforcing the Sokoto Caliphate. While this description makes little pretense to the scholastic rigor required by the social sciences, it does reveal to considerable degree both the nature of architectural selectivity and the nature of those components in the architectural repertoire that appear to persist over time despite deep-rooted socio-cultural and economic change. The present lack of evidence precludes the sug- gestion of a precise chronology for this pattern of change, although inherent in the corpus of the material cited is the assumption that just as the Fulani jihad effected a qualitative change in the society at large, so the architecture of that society became crystallized into a visually unique style. Further assumptions implicit in this paper are first, that in less-differentiated societies, not only are art forms multi- vocal, embodying a number of asso- ciative meanings, but the efficacy of their symbolism is applied across a spectrum of functionally equivalent behavioral contexts; and second, that the concrete, physical man-environment relationship in these societies is imbued with an existen- tial, supranatural, religious meaning, and 2.

The subject matter that concerns us here depends on the assumption that nomadic, transient structures are as much architecture as monumental, permanent buildings are, and that they are imbued with the same kinds of symbolism as the more acceptable, traditional architectural forms. Furthermore, underlying concep- tual and behavioral patterns that order the environment operate on a continuum, dissolving the specificity of building into the whole of the man-built environment. This concept is quite contrary to the tradi- tional architectural stance that defines architecture as "enclosed space," which draws a sharp line between architecture and urban form ("negative" and "positive" space), and views the man-built environment without the abstractions man attaches to the physical space he has created. The patterns that mark man's behavior in space extend beyond the bounds of physical experience; they include the space he defines conceptually. Although Islam had been introduced into the West-Central Sudan by the fifteenth century, its early protagonists, the merchant-scholars, had a minimal, isolated influence on the existing rural milieu. In those instances where Islam stimulated the growth of urban centers, their architectural imagery reflected religious and cultural ties with the Magreb. The critical interface between Islam and urbanization is not only embodied in the literature of Islam, but has been con- sidered by a number of scholars in various disciplines. The Muqaddimah of Ibn Khaldun contains numerous references to the importance of urban settlement and, by extension, the necessity and "nobility" of the "Craft of Architecture."5 The cata- lytic nature of Islam in early urban FEMALE HIERARCHY woman's tomb "' '" z: 0 corral fire p *" `;:&gt; - -e..

The Mukhtasar of Khalil ben Ishaq, a set of fourteenth-century commentaries that form the legal foundation of Malekite law in North Africa, constitutes an entire system of jurisprudence relating to civil, criminal, and religious behavior. It elaborates in great detail the specific prescriptions and proscriptions binding on every true believer. Because the appli- cation of this corpus of common law extends into building practice per se, it virtually constitutes a building code and a set of zoning ordinances. The spatial organization of every Islamized urban center, whether it be Fes in Morocco, El Oued in Algeria, Djenn6 in Mali, or Zaria in northern Nigeria, reflects the codi- fication of Malekite common law and manifests a similar physical config- uration. One of the basic assumptions of Malekite law is that private property, and by extension private space, is primary.8 It is this underlying concept that permits anyone who owns two houses facing each other on a public street to tie them together by means of an overhead passerelle. A number of other prescriptions clearly reflect the emphasis on visual privacy and the primacy of the private domain. For example, any new aperture that might give visual access to another person's property through a wall is forbidden. Although the law in no way interferes with increasing the height of a building above its adjoining neighbors (even though light and air are thereby cut off), if such in- creased height allows one a view into a neighbor's courtyard, it is forbidden. Doorways should be located so that one cannot see from one's own doorway into the vestibule of a nearby house; hence, two doorways facing on an alleyway should always be located at a distance from each other. No one may open a shop opposite the entrance to another's house, and no one may climb his date palm unless he previously informs the neighbor whose house provides a potential view.9 Thus, it is the physical boundaries of space that become omnipresent in the spatial definition of family. The domestic domain is closed from outside view. The relative importance of the public way is subsumed, and the expansion of private space into public space is centrifugal. But physical boundaries are not themselves considered private property: they are merely an instrument in the achievement of visual, not necessarily sonic, privacy. Thus, for example, each house owner has the right to build directly onto his neigh- bor's wall without specific permission from that neighbor.1? While these examples are embodied in those statutes relating to civil and crimi- nal law, there are several aspects of the law derivative of religious prescription that are also relevant to the definition of space. With the adaptation of Islam, one conceptual center, Mecca, became a focal point for linear direction. That center was represented by the ka'ba, a simple oratory, roughly 25 by 25 elbows square. Malekite law prescribes that the ka'ba should serve as the fundamental proto- type for the construction of all mosques, that the mihrab indicating the direction of Mecca should be located in the center of the qibla wall (the wall facing Mecca), and that the faithful should rank themselves in regular lines behind the imam, parallel to the qibla wall. Furthermore, kinetic behavior is ritualized by the pious turns and steps and by the position of the body vis-a-vis the ka'ba, as well as by the tactile contact with its peripheral plinth (Fig. 1).11 Another set of prescriptions bears more directly on the question of sedentarism. It is specifically stated that one of the primary goals of Islam is the conse- cration of a mosque to celebrate the solemnity of a Friday, and that the condi- tions of validity for such a mosque are that those who have consecrated them- selves should intend to remain in a fixed place. Furthermore, the construction of the mosque must be of substantial build- ing materials, and it should have a perma- nent roof.12 Another example of the establishment of conceptual space in geometric terms can be found in prescribed burial prac- tices. Although the bier of a woman might be covered with a rounded structure "modelled after the shape of a camel's back," that of a man should be rec- tangular and flat, and the body should be placed lying on its right side with the face turned towards Mecca. The tomb and its opening are preferably built of brick, and coffins (implying mobility) are for- bidden."3 Thus, not only was a focal point referent in directionality established, but an ideal, in the form of a square, dictated behavioral patterns. Given the inherent interrelationship among the religious, political, and economic components of Islam, one can assume that attempts to realize the ideal would pervade not only religious behavior, but political and economic behavior as well, and consequently, those structures that housed such activities. First mosques, then reception chambers and palaces, finally compound walls, city walls, and citadel walls strove to emulate the conceptually prescribed form. The square became a spatial requisite, not only for mosques but for all other spaces con- sidered sacred, such as reception ante- chambers, bedrooms, and the personal lodgings of Islamic military, religious, political or economic dignitaries. 10</page><page sequence="4">If we consider the spatial organization of those populations having a long history of sedentarism in the West African savan- nah, the evidence suggests an underlying spatial order that focuses on an in- digenous center of the Universe. Cosmol- ogies, myths of origin, autochthonous ancestries all revolve around a family or kin-based center in the Earth, located either in the residential compound or the village center. Myths of origin refer to primordial emergence from the earth, to ancestry that inhabits the earth below foot. The material and ritual expression of these myths is expressed by reference to the subterranean dwellings of primordial ancestors, by the placement of ancestral pillars and shrines either directly in the center of a compound or at its entrance, by the location of granaries imbued with sacred meaning in the compound center, by the planting of central poles symbol- izing the point of origin and a vertical axis between earth and sky, and by the burial of deceased elders within compound walls.'4 Concepts of area and direction appear to be less critical, as witnessed by the fact that distance is frequently given in terms of time and landmarks rather than by cardinal orientation or measurable dis- tance. If one looks at the neighboring nomadic populations, however, the very nature of transhumance imbues their concep- tualization of space with a directional quality. Thus, the myths of origin among nomadic peoples, as well as the host of hypotheses on their origins offered by various scholars, suggest migration to or from a place, a center. Even today, the absence of any ancestral cult among even semi-nomadic groups contrasts sharply with its continuing presence among neigh- boring sedentary populations.'5 Further- more, burial rites and practices, usually a clue to the cosmology of man-environ- ment relations, appear to be of minimal import among nomadic or semi-seden- tary peoples. Northern Nigeria, traditionally occu- pied by sedentary Hausa agriculturalists, was subjected, over the centuries, to numerous incursions by pagan or super- ficially Islamized nomadic Fulani groupings as well as by Tuareg kin groups. In addition, various Songhai-related peoples moved into contiguous areas. While long term, imperceptible inter- action between all these ethnic groups certainly took place, the violent changes wrought by the Fulani jihad primarily involved two: Fulani and Hausa.'6 Consideration of nomadic Fulani spatial organization by various scholars suggests a well-established pattern in their ordering of the physical environment 17 (Fig. 3). The homestead, a simple circular enclosure formed by a brush fence, always opens and fronts on the west. Within, the bounded circle is bisected along its diameter by a calf rope. The western hemicircle and its entrance, including the corral, the corral fire, and all herding activities, encompass the male domain. The eastern half, within which are the domestic fire(s) and the sleeping shelters, is the female domain. It has also been sug- gested that masculine hierarchies are ar- ranged in space from south to north and feminine hierarchies from north to south. Thus, a cluster of homesteads is arranged along a north-south axis, while genera- tional depth is expressed from west to east. The above described spatial order is equally binding upon the Bororo (the least Islamized, "true" nomadic Fulani) as upon the Torobe, the most highly Islam- ized noble aristocracy, which migrated from Futa Toro and constituted the jihad leadership.18 In contrast to the Fulani, the traditions of the sedentary pagan Hausa all suggest a conceptual organization of space around a "center." Perusal of the early travelers' accounts suggests that prior to and well after the jihad, pagan Hausa space was organized around a center. House units as well as compound walls were circular in form.19 At the turn of this century, refer- ence was made to the erection of a gansalmi, a long upright pole in the center of the enclosures built for various rites, and to the poles erected in the center of Hausa villages around which wrestling matches were held. The tradition recorded was that as long as the pole remained standing, the prowess of the village youth would continue, but if the pole were blown down, it could not be raised until the next generation.2 Reference was also made at the turn of the century to the full pot of water, dedicated to the god of rain and storms, kept in the center of each compound.21 While he does not directly consider the importance of a central post in Hausa ritual, Nicolas' recent study of spatial structure in Hausa cosmology suggests that a "center" was critically important in the conceptual organization of cities and villages and in the layout of the house compound itself (Figs. 4, 5).22 He also suggests that the central post as well as the four corner posts that demar- cate space was replaced by pottery in which various talismans were placed, and the pottery was then buried in the ground. Both early and late accounts make refer- ence to the non- and pre-Islamic Hausa custom of house burial.23 That the act of burial within one's compound was itself perhaps a symbolic act of settlement is suggested by the fact that at Sokoto "the Felatahs ... bury their dead in the house where they die. .."24 The subsequent shift to prescribed burial sites outside the city walls and specific Islamic funerary arrangements reflected the shift in centrality from an existential ancestral location to Mecca, the newly adapted Center of the Universe.

Griaule has suggested that among the Dogon, the field layout as well as the compounds are arranged in a spiral, originating from and revolving around a central axis - the primordial village and its founding ancestors (Fig. 6). The field organization of the Hausa, as Nicolas has suggested, is based on a direction pattern, moving first from east to west and then from north to south (Fig. 7). The Hausa spatial orientation suggested by Nicolas, however, appears to reflect a conceptual compromise to the conflict between sedentary centrality and nomadic directionality, reinforced by Islamic prescription. The material expression of the Hausa compromise can still be seen in the occasional coexistence of a central place in the compound and a prescribed entrance orientation. For example, to those Hausa who respect "their" tradition, the entrance should always be on the west, so that on entering one always faces toward the east (Mecca). The first wife builds her house on the north; the last wife, on the south. What has been currently defined as Hausa "tradition," however, appears to reflect an attempt to reorganize space according to the Islamic ideal. While the inherent directionality of Fulani nomadic space provided a frame- work more easily adapted to the Islamic ideal, realization of the ideal was initially achieved only in what might be termed monumental building programs required by the jihad, i.e., structures directly sponsored by and built for its political, religious, economic, and military leader- ship. In his description of Kano in the 1850s, Barth noted that "in the quarters of the ruling race, the Fulbe, conical huts of thatchwork and gondo tree were prevalent," while "the governor's hall was clearly a rather sophisticated rectangular construction."25 Tremearne suggested, at the turn of the century, that throughout Hausaland it was only the mosques and the largest houses that were square.26 Since the Fulani jihad was, in its first decades, a military venture, it was in the building of fortification systems that the clearest expression of the Islamic ideal was manifested. Thus, the original walls of Sokoto, seat of the Caliphate, were in the form of a perfect square, with four gateways, one in the center of each side of the square (Fig. 9).27 The original city of Bauchi had its four cardinally oriented gates. Again, the aerial view of an un- identified archaeological site on what was the frontier of the Caliphate is highly suggestive of the pattern of ribat con- struction. The guide to the uniform pattern was apparently several pamphlets written by Muhamed Bello, the Caliph of Sokoto, in which he drew upon the classi- cal authorities and the lessons of the early Muslim conquests described by the early authorities.28 9. PLAN OF THE CITY OF SOKOTO, NIGERIA, AS RECORDED BY HENRY BARTH IN 1853. ALTHOUGH FOUR GATEWAYS HAD BEEN OBSERVED BY DENHAM AND CLAPPERTON, BY THE TIME OF BARTH'S ARRIVAL THIRTY YEARS LATER, THE FOUR HAD BEEN CONVERTED TO EIGHT, TWO EQUALLY- SPACED ON EACH OF THE FOUR FACES OF THE CITY WALL. Most revealing of all for the suggested synthesis is a description of the setting out of a building recorded in a Hausa text translated in 1932: "When they are about to lay the foundations of the wall, it would be best if Tanko gave them ropes and pegs to set up. They should tie the rope to the pegs and align the sides lest they be crooked, or lest one be longer than the other. It is best that the compound should be exactly rectangular. The plan of the house is best if laid out in this way. "One must take care about the height, lest one hut be higher than another. It is better to arrange it so that they are all of the same level. "Take Tanko, for example. He had plenty of money and of everything. He wanted to build a new compound. He was not able to do it himself, but had to call in Audu the builder ... Tanko said he wanted a good square compound with four huts, a mud-roofed house, a square house, and an entrance hut; the door of the house to face south or west."29 The text not only recalls some of the pre- scriptions referred to above in the discus- sion of Malekite law, but it also suggests the addition of value-laden preferences in the articulation of space. That the ideal of Islamic space was only selectively realized is obvious from the morphology of any West African Islamized urban center today. Other, more critical determinants continue to prevail in the ordering of space. From the air, these centers simulate a geometry created by the convergence of numerous circles, each one enclosing an open court- yard that revolves around a center. The traditional structure of the Hausa compounds - and, to some extent, those of the Fulani - lent itself easily to the omnipresent Muslim concept of family with its emphasis on privacy and the segregation of the sexes. The introduction of solidly built earthen walls in lieu of mat walls also served to emphasize the openings, placing greater importance on the line of mediation between public and private space - particularly in the light of visual curtailment. That the bounding circular wall, and in turn its single point of entry - the reception chamber - continue to be of prime import is evi- denced, for example, by the fact that among the Hausa, as well as sedentarized Fulani, the two architectural elements that remain constant over time are the perimeter wall and the zaure (Fig. 10).30 Further evidence for the importance of wall and entrance comes from the observ- able building sequence in a squatter settle- ment just outside of Niamey. The first act, the act of establishing a declaration of settlement, was not the implantation of a post, but the erection of a perimeter wall high enough to prevent any view from the outside, and an entrance. Only then does the digging of a well, within the enclosed space, begin. After the well is dug, one or several mat-frame tents are erected. Even- tually, these will be replaced by earthen structures.31 Just as the square appears to have embodied the Islamic ideal of spatial mor- phology, so the dome represented an architectural idea. The ubiquitous presence of domes in northern Nigeria and southern Niger as a symbol of Islam contrasts sharply with its absence in the Western Sudan. The explanation lies, in part, with the major shift in trans-Saharan avenues of Islamic penetration, which occurred in the seventeenth century, from the Magreb to Tripoli and Cairo. While the development of the so-called Hausa vaults and domes may have been I -\' a.4 10. THE DOCUMENTED EVOLUTION OF A HAUSA COM- POUND AT ZARIA, NIGERIA.

INTERIOR OF THE MOSQUE AT DAURA, NIGERIA. 13</page><page sequence="7">instigated and encouraged by the desire to simulate the formal and visual imagery of Islam in northeastern Africa, the foun- dation for its innovative technology derives from the sedentarization process of traditional Fulani nomadic tent struc- tures. These "Hausa" vaults were selectively used for those architectural components critical to the reinforcement of Fulani hegemony in the consolidation of the Caliphate. The "Hausa" vault and the "Hausa" dome are based on a structural principle completely different from the North African, Roman-derived stone domes. The latter depend upon the strength of stone in compression. Keystones and buttressing (or tension rods) are neces- sary for stability. On the other hand, the "Hausa" domes incorporate, in nascent form, the same structural principles that govern reinforced, pre-stressed concrete design (Fig. 8). The bent armatures, in tension, take the horizontal thrust normally resisted by buttresses and tension rods and interact with the compressive quality of earth. It was the development of this technology that permitted the transplantation of the symbolic imagery of Islam and in turn created a unique, Fulani-derived archi- tecture(Figs. 11, 12). The nineteenth-century literature is sur- prisingly rich in references not only to this architecture of vaults and domes but also to the context in which they were observed The mosque at Sokoto, built in 1824 as the seat of the Fulani Caliphate (and, by association, the most important monumental structure in the Fulani rise to 11. A FULANI MATFRAME TENT ARMATURE rSUtete^,^ ;X ;-A 12. A SONGHAI MATFRAME TENT ARMATURE. power), boasted arches and wooden pillars plastered over with clay and then highly ornamented. The dome in the inner apartment of the Sultan of Sokoto was supported by eight ornamental arches converging on "a bright plate of brass in its center" and an encircling balustrade. At Kano, the governor's hall had concealed rafters supporting the very elevated ceiling, and "two lofty arches of clay, very neatly polished and orna- mented, appeared to support the whole." In Zinder, at the turn of the century, Fourneau observed a "remarkable house owned at one time by a Tripolitanian trader" with "typical ribbed arches." As far north as Agades, it was noted that "larger rooms which cannot be spanned by one length of rafter are vaulted inside with a false arch of mud, concealing canti- lever timbering; the effect is that of a series of massive Gothic arches, plain but often of noble proportions."32 The change in social structure effected by the sedentarization process was germinal to the development of this inno- vative building technology. The critical aspect of the change was the shift in ownership of, and jurisdiction over, the residential structure. Among the nomadic peoples of the West African savannah, all property relating to the domestic domain, including the bed, canopied or not, the tent, whether it be a mat, skin, or thatch- covered one, and its armature, belongs to the wife. It is also the women who assem- ble and dismantle the domestic structures. Even in instances where the women do not weave the mats or tapestries, or tan the skins, it is the responsibility of the wife's family to provide them, either as part of the dowry or upon the birth of the first child.33 The single deviation from this pat- tern is when there is a central support for the tent structure: then the husband plants and erects the central post. Among the sedentary populations of the savannah, on the other hand, con- struction, ownership, and jurisdiction over earthen structures of any kind, regardless of their form or technology, are in the hands of the male members of the household or kinship group. With the sedentarization of a nomadic tent, the mat walls are replaced by an earthen wall, whether it be coil or brick; the tent armature is enveloped in an earthen covering, and mobile interior furnishings are gradually replaced by earth-molded ones (Figs. 13, 14). As the armature becomes attached to, then embedded in the earthen walls, the woman loses proprietorship over the domicile structure and those furnishings molded out of earth. Ultimately, all that she retains ownership of are the interior furnishings that continue to constitute her dowry, such as a wedding pillow and the assort- ment of utensils associated with food preparation and the procreation of offspring.34 The combination of earth and armature reinforcement - just as in the case of 14</page><page sequence="8">13. A "HAUSA" VAULT UNDER CONSTRUCTION AT TAHOUA, NIGER. more recent technological advances - led to a tremendous increase in the size and magnitude of enclosed space without central or intermediate supports. But the concept of "center," as well as an echo of former female jurisdiction, persists. Written charms continue to be buried in the center of these enclosed spaces, and bags of talismans are hung from the arch structure itself. Brass, china, and more recently enamelware plates, embedded at rib intersections or meeting points, are still common. The continued practice is rationalized by the belief that the placing of the plate at the arch or rib intersection is a structural requisite. "When the plate loosens and falls, the arches are no longer stable."35 It is tempting to suggest that the brass plate persists as an existential symbol of the former matrilineal kinship structure. The vaulted roof is called baka, and the term itself supports the argument for a Fulani origin. The term derives not from Hausa, but from the Fulani verb bakka, meaning "to smooth over, as wet clay; to daub over." A variant of the term is bakkana, "to daub on." Both terms describe the building process in vault con- struction. The earth is daubed onto the armature. A related term, bake or bakeji, or "scabbard" or "sheath," carries the associated meaning of enveloping some- thing. Another linguistic clue comes from the term for the raffia palm fronds used for the rafters, gwangwala. In Fulani, there is a related term, gangawal, which is used in reference to the inner, suspended bands in a conical roof as well as to the rim of any basket.36 In contrast to the specific usage of the term bakka, there are two generic terms used throughout the Western Sudan as well as in Hausaland: soro and bene. They are used in reference to any square, earthen house with an upper story or ter- race, and to any tower or fortified wall system. Since the terms are found in the greatest contextual range in Songhai, their usage suggests a Songhai origin and a long-established tradition of earthen con- struction. The innovative vaulting system above, deriving from a nomadic, mat- frame form, constitutes a development quite distinct from the more generalized building tradition.37 The most elaborate vaulting systems are always found in the entrance and reception chambers of walled enclosures. They are the quintessential statement of entrance, providing depth to the critical break in the continuity of protective surface (Figs. 15, 16). In discussing the Caliph's court as the final court of appeal, Adeleye noted that the court officer was known as kofa, the term for "door" in both Hausa and Fulani. The first court- yard, the "male" domain, is often called the kofar gida, or entrance courtyard.38 Entrance as an architectural event was further emphasized by the role of the horse in the Fulani conquest. Since it is precisely in the entrance chamber that the horse is stabled, the ritual and symbolism that accrued around the horse merged with that of entrance per se, to create an even more powerful symbolic statement in the enlarged, enclosed space and greater surface area.39 The anomaly between the Fulani attribution for the vaults and domes and the generally assumed Hausa origin for them also appears to reflect the socio- political nature of the conquest. The Fulani ruling aristocracy, the torodbe, originally came from the Futa Toro and the Futa Djallon where a domed form was already part of their visual and formal environment (Fig. 17). They warred under the banner of an Islamic imagery, 14. HYPOTHETICAL TRANSITION FROM A MATFRAME TENT TO AN EARTHEN STRUCTURE. CREATING THE SO-CALLED HAUSA VAULTS AND DOMES. emanating not from the Mahgreb but from Tripolitania and Cairo, where domes symbolize the faith. But they brought no tradition of earthen dome construction or its building expertise with them, since Futa Djallon domed forms are thatch. It was the sedentary Hausa who possessed the building skills in earth and who provided the labor for construction.40 It was the process of sedentarization, with its implications for ownership and juris- diction over residential structures, that set the stage for the technological leap. While the building expertise in earthen con- struction was in the hands of the Hausa, the arches and armatures, as well as the stylistic ideals which inspired them, were introduced by the Fulani leadership in the wake of the jihad. The revolution that effected the innovative building tech- nology also created thereby a new archi- tectural forn, used selectively in those spaces critical to the establishment and acknowledgment of political cohesion and consolidation. 15</page><page sequence="9">Line of balcony ?IAII I -?l- _.._.?-.._.....l TOP. 15.

THE SHARI'A OR ENTRANCE COURT OF THE FRIDAY MOSQUE AT ZARIA CLEARLY ILLUSTRATES THE TRANSITION FROM ONE FORMAT TO THE OTHER. THE FRAMING IS BASED ON A CIRCULAR LAYOUT. BUT THE WALLS BOUNDING THE ENCLOSED SPACE FORM A SQUARE. Just as the "Hausa" vaults were the child of sedentarization, so were many aspects of the emphasis on surface. Surface, in earthen construction, is critical to both the wall's stability and its lifespan.41 Among traditional West African savannah societies, the resur- facing of a wall is an annual ritual. The recognition of the critical points in surface breaks, such as openings into walls, is expressed by the emphasis on their decor- ation and elaboration. Although permanence is, in many in- stances, less critical in the minds of compound builders than it is in our privately-owned property and monu- mentally-oriented culture, it is empiri- cally recognized that this final surfacing is critical to even the minimal lifespan of any earthen structure. Communal structures - whether they be shrines, palaces, mosques, or meeting places - represent continuity and longevity. A longer life- span is inherent in their function, and the annual resurfacing becomes a social rather than a family obligation. It is no accident that those buildings which are 16 17.

IT IS REFLECTED IN THE FOUR ENTRANCES, ONE ON EACH SIDE. critical to a belief system were the first to be endowed with a more permanent, concrete finish. Nor is it accident that the greater emphasis on the surface of "permanent" structures finds expression in the elaborateness of wall decoration. If we assume that architecture fulfills a linguistic role, then communication is effected, to considerable degree, through the visual sense. The surface of an archi- tectural form constitutes a graphic system, revealing space as well as form to both user and viewer. Furthermore, surfaces are called upon to play a far greater role in communication in non- or semi-literate societies than in more highly developed, technological societies where communi- cation can be effected through a wide range of aural and visual media. Thus, the empirical requirements of an earthen structure are reinforced by this second, equally important function. Various kinds of artifacts on one's body, whether cicatrization, mask, or amulet, are richly documented in the liter- ature on West Africa. They serve not only as ethnic identification, but more impor- tantly, as protective envelopes, warding off danger and the unknown. In point of fact, scarification that establishes identity provides protection via affiliation. The widespread practice is most marked in critical behavioral contexts, such as war- fare. The use of protective symbols, how- ever, is not limited to the body. Those facilities critical to a society's viability and continuity are equally endowed with them. Thus, in subsistence societies, such symbols will be found on oars, boats, granary walls, trappings, and domestic herds. With the emergence of nascent political structures, material elements essential to and associated with the estab- lishment and reinforcement of power be- came the new recipients of protective symbol. For example, war tunics were studded with the material representations of conceptually efficacious symbols - horns, bones, and feathers. Goody's discussion of the horse and the earth in the Western Sudan also explains why the horse is enveloped in specially designed and embroidered quilts, becoming virtually an armor embellished with a protective surface.42 With the introduction of Islam, the substitution of Islamic symbol for pagan symbol was like "taking out a super- natural insurance policy with Islam." The war tunic of an Ashanti captain, illus- trated in 1817, was hung not only with horns and bones, but with Islamic amulets, just as the war tunic of Samory, leader of a late nineteenth-century Manding jihad was. The ease with which Islamic symbol was incorporated into the underlying system of pagan symbolism can be explained by the nature of Islamic symbol itself. Although Trimingham has suggested that Islam brought no changes in psychological attitudes toward magic, it is quite obvious that the symbols used to validate that magic power did change. The Arabic script lent itself with the greatest ease to adaptation because of its sacred, magical quality. "Arabic writing, even more so than the language, became a sacred symbol of Islam.43 Two examples of the substitution of Islamic script for animist symbol are the cabalistic squares on a Fulani war tunic, now in the Musee de l'Homme (Fig. 21), and on an oar used by the Sorko fishermen. 18.

The term for talisman, katumede, derives from the Arabic khatem, "magic design" or "magic drawing," and these magic designs or drawings, within which the script itself is often framed, are related to the history of the magic square, to developments in 19. EMBROIDERY DETAIL ON AN OLD WOMAN'S BOUBOU, OR ROBE, FOUND EQUALLY IN OUALATA, MAURITANIA; DJENNE, MALI; AND TAHOUA, NIGER. AL- THOUGH OTHER AUTHORS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THE MOTIF IS FOUND ON MEN'S DRESS, AT DJENNE IT IS WORN EXCLUSIVELY BY OLD WOMEN. HOWEVER, SIMILAR MOTIFS USING ALTERNATING BLACK AND WHITE BLOCKS WITHIN THE FRAME OF A DIAGONALLY-ARRANGED MAGIC SQUARE ARE EQUAL- LY PREVALENT IN HAUSA EMBROIDERY. Islamic mathematics and to the divinatory powers of Islamic mathematicians.44 The association between Arabic script, magic, and sacrality was clearly suggested by Doutt6, when he wrote, "Since the graphic signs which represented the words are much easier to handle than the sounds (particularly since the signs were in the process of being incorporated into another language system), and are capable of enduring, as they have a material form, it is inevitable that magical force is seen as encapsulated in them; in other words, writing itself is reputed to have magical powers."45 He noted further that, in a material representation, redistribution can be easily made along Euclidian lines and geometric patterns. The designs formed this way, mostly rectangular or polygonal, are called jadwal in Arabic, meaning "picture" (Figs. 19, 20). That the same process was equally operative for architecture is suggested by the fact that the Maltese cross, which Denham and Clapperton observed on the shields of Tuareg, Fulani, and Bornu horsemen, was also "moulded in a sort of low relief ... on the clay plaster of their huts. Crosses of other forms [were] also sometimes cut in the doors of their houses."46 Trimingham also cites a Muslim Temne's house, in which the symbols of three religions were inscribed on the lintel of a single doorway: at the top, a painted Christian text; below, a cloth on which a metal talisman was tied; and beneath it, a paper printed with Islamic texts, designs, and cabalistic signs.47 The geometric pattern of the magic square appears to have served as the archetype for the most commonly used Islamic motif in Hausaland today, the daki motif, or so-called wise-man's knot, from the elaborate embroidery on the robe of a devout Muslim to the facades and public walls of significant buildings. The application of cabalistic squares, formulae, and sacred writing to wall surfaces is itself a logical extension of the underlying protective role ascribed to it in other contexts. Those structures symbolizing newly acquired political power and social status were enveloped with a magical protective coat. The proc- ess was identical to that which occurred in North Africa, as any number of examples of Islamic architecture will attest to (Fig. 18). Almost without exception, these abstractions of script and magic squares are concentrated on entrance portals, at door and window openings, and at breaks in surface planes, such as at corners and parapets. Traditionally, openings of all kinds appear to have been fraught with danger - perhaps because they are conceived as planes of mediation and transition. The literature is rich in refer- ences to ritual that occurs at entrances and to the various devices used to protect these.48 The literature is equally rich in references to the various ways in which elements of Islam have crept into the pagan ritual staged at entrances, as well as to the actual participation by marabouts, scribes, and holy men in Fulani rites of birth, puberty, marriage, and death. It is no wonder then that entrances would enjoy the greatest concentration of abstracted Islamic symbol (Cover, Fig. 2). Just as the newly developed building forms took on a sacred quality, so the surfaces of these sacred forms took on sacred meaning. There appears to be a direct correspondence between those ABOVE: 20.

THE RECEPTION ROC architectural elements which were considered sacred in tent structures and those which receive particular attention in permanent earthen structures. Thus, the elaborate, rich texture of interior tent wall hangings was transposed onto an elaborate bas relief in stucco surfaces. In lieu of elaborately carved staves and tent posts, the ribs of vaults and domes were intricately incised; in lieu of the complex of domestic utensils ranged along a tent interior, one finds them embedded in the plasterwork or simulated in flatwork patterns. In the West African savannah, wall construction is traditionally a male responsibility, and the application of the finished surface, whether it be elaborately embellished or simply rendered, is a female responsibility. The single, pro- nounced exception to this tradition is in the Islamized urban centers, where a kind of dichotomy has taken place. The men are responsible for all exterior decoration, while the women retain responsibility for the surface finish (hence the design) of interior spaces - and most specifically, their own set of rooms. This dichotomy, derivative of several factors, accounts for some aspects of continuity as well as change in the architectural repertoire. The most obvious, a marked distinction between interior and exterior surface design, results from changes in the nature of consecrated space, historical change in the social structure, and the artist respon- sible for the wall design. Exterior surface design - flamboyant, arabesque, and flowing- represents what is, in fact, an abstraction of Arabic script, writ large on the public surface, protecting and sacralizing the space within. Interior design, characterized more frequently by linear or simple geometric patterns, and on occasion by anthropomorphic repre- sentation, suggests a continuity from tent traditions and the sacrality of the woman's domain in a nomadic society. The rich tent hangings in a Fulani wife's )M OF SIDI KA, AGADES, NIGER. tent are further enriched by the wide assortment of pots and pans which form part of her dowry. This richness is in sharp contrast to the rather diffuse, faded hues of the exterior straw mats. In the case of earthen structures, the pots and pans are still used to decorate interior walls. After the marriage has been consum- mated and the earthen walls constructed, the dowry is ceremonially carried to the wife's new home where it is plastered, piece by piece, into the earthen wall, creating through a new medium a colorful pattern of tangential circles with shining brass bowls and imported enamelware. It is this continued practice that led me to suggest the symbolic nature of the brass plate inserted at the intersection of the Hausa ribs. The pattern of the plates is not unique to the area we are considering. It appears to be present in the interior rooms of a number of urban centers that developed in the context of settling nomads. In the city of Ghadames, an oasis in the Fezzan, northwest Libya, near the Algerian border, there is a long-standing stylistic tradition in which copperware in the shape of plates, pitchers, etc., is used to "decorate" the interior house walls of the Berber quarters. They are the essence of the house ornamentation, and it is by their importance that the family fortune is judged. The copperware has no practical usage, and the people of Ghadames look on it as having only a decorative function. Yet, one who sells the copperware house ornaments is considered to have sunk to the depths of misfortune, and it is considered shameful to mention the name of anyone seen selling them in public, suggesting that the decorative ware carries far more than a purely decorative role in the family habitat. Due south of Ghadames and the Sahara Desert, in the oasis city of Agades with the large Tuareg (Berber-related) population, one finds a parallel tradition. The interior walls of the reception chamber of one of the city's prominent dignitaries are endowed with an intensive surface ornamentation so overwhelming that it almost belies any sense of interior space. Indeed, the emphasis on interior enclosed space, suggested by the value-laden judgments in Ghadames, appears to have reached its ultimate - it has turned into pure music (Fig. 22). The Fulani jihad was the first instance in West African history where nomadic sedentarism and political hegemony constituted part of the same process. This unique set of circumstances accounts for the peculiar evolution of what is today called Hausa architecture. It was the Fulani leadership with its nomadic tradition and a set of aesthetic values derived from the tent that effected the continuities and changes described above, continuities that in turn contributed the essential components of a new spatial and architectural imagery. That the physical change was effected far more rapidly than is generally assumed for stylistic change in architectural historiography can be accounted for by the rapid societal change itself, contrasting sharply with the gradual, imperceptible changes asso- ciated with the conservatism of rural societies. In was the breakdown in traditional, closed society that permitted the develop- ment of a new building technology. That building technology became the hand- maiden for a new architectural imagery, an imagery essential to the establishment of a new set of symbols that would serve to reinforce and strengthen the political cohesion and hegemony of the Fulani Caliphate and its Emirates. Unlike the previous gradual process of urbanization and Islamization which marked West African history, for the first time the visual imagery of a tent, symbolizing Fulani conquest, meshed perfectly with the visual ideal of the dome - the symbol of Islam. For the first time, the spatial organization of nomadic space synchron- ized perfectly with the Islamic tenets of social behavior. Perhaps, when one con- siders that the idea of the dome itself, as Smith has suggested, derived from the Near Eastern "Tent of Appearances," and when one considers the urbanizing nature of Islam, then the continuities and changes described above seem rather obvious. A classic Fulani manuscript from the beginning of the nineteenth century, in which architectural analogies are used to exhort the faithful to prayer provides, perhaps, an equally cogent illustration of the interfaces we have tried to describe:49 "Elle est en religion, a propos de fermet6,/ Comme est la crepissure pour un maconnerie./ La religion se degrade en l'absence de priere,/ Comme un mur se degrade sans fondation premiere./ Comment dont tiendrait un mur, je vous le demande,/ Qui ne soit pas pose sur fondation premiere?" - Notes, page 97 19 kip I r</page><page sequence="13">the right profile one can still detect the crack that marked the originally square base, now shortened and reduced in width. Seen from the back, the original piece and the mutilated statuette show the same vertical ridge on the back of the head- dress, identical details in the breaks in the posterior of the headdress's lateral wings, and the same curve of the charm mukata wa yanga slung across the back. The defects in the wood in the back of the sculptures correspond, as does the cart- ridge-pouch with its lock and triangle motif. A vertical crack in the original base can be seen in the reduced base of the statuette in the American collection. A detail of the left foot of the mutilated statuette shows that part of the small toe has been sliced off along the side. A leg of the quadruped had overlapped the foot; to remove the magical figure and quad- ruped, the dealer of the Tshibinda Ilunga figure was forced to cut off a bit of the main figure's toe. The American collectors also pointed out that the statuette is coated with var- nish ("old varnish"), and this point I had noted in my descriptions in 1957, 1966, and 1973. Further, they mention that "brush marks" are visible on the light film of foreign coating. I think it is needless to insist on addi- tional corresponding points between the original work and the mutilated piece. The sculptor who, in the last century, created this work of art with love and sensitivity, in a spirit faithful to the proto- type of Tshibinda Ilunga, the hunter-hero, but in a personal and original way, should surely deserve respect for his creation. Marie-Louise Bastin Universite Libre de Bruxelles Notes, page 100 MORE ON A UTHENTICITY Speaking as a sculptor and collector of ethnographical art for thirty years, the most important feature to look for in a work of art is the unmistakable visual evidence of inspiration, which is apparent to the trained eye. A sculptor must have a feeling for his creation and be involved in- timately with his subject to produce any- thing of outstanding merit. A forgery, that is, a facsimile produced with the express purpose of falsifying tribal origin and use, purporting to be what it is in fact not, invariably lacks the vitality and spirit of the authentic. A talented artist may be expected to produce his best for an impor- tant patron or special ceremony, and this expertise is not easily duplicated. On the other hand, a bored artist, learner, or non- professional doing his own thing may produce a lackluster object that is gen- uine but hardly inspired. General guidelines are practical; never- theless it is the course of wisdom to judge each case on its own merits and not be too quick to condemn out of hand an un- familiar example or technique. What may be a general rule in one circumstance may not apply in another. To illustrate, a dark patina on wood comes about in a natural way through normal use, handling, oils, anointings, smoke and dirt - or it may have existed from the start as part of the artist's original finishing process. In ZaTre, northern Nigeria, etc., this latter practice is at times used on lighter-toned woods. The process is achieved by carefully scorching the surface of the wood with a hot iron, as in early American poker work. Polishing follows, then time and use add their hallmarks. On ivory, an opaque, chalk-like tone can indicate age, but not always - a large number of Pende pendants displaying this patina are fakes. Old and used examples have a mellow translucent quality due to contact with the human body, and this is also true of bone examples. A fine genuine object may be taken for a fake if the patina is removed. To remove these cosmetic credentials by stripping is a crime against history, but if the detail is so obliterated with matter that the carving cannot be appreciated, then with great skill the sculpture may be re- leased from its cocoon. Generally, the carving technique of the European is quite different from that of the African artist. The African with his iron adze uses a chopping technique, with the tool motion directed toward himself. He generally takes small chips or bites in hard, tough wood and longer bites and splits in easier-to-work wood; working deep, as for a helmet mask or bowl, may require a digging-out process. The Euro- pean with steel chisels works away from himself in a pushing rather than the pull- ing technique of the traditional tribal artist. If it can be absolutely established that the style, costume, coiffure, or carving technique of a piece is completely foreign to the framework of the society in ques- tion or the period indicated, the object may indeed be suspect. The question, however, is still not resolved - some innovative soul may have borrowed, adopted or adapted legitimately new ideas he was exposed to. The Northwest Coast Indians of Canada in the early days gave mystical recognition to the letters they observed as being of importance to their seafaring visitors. Without regard for their meaning, these alphabetical letters were sometimes incorporated into the de- signs of their works of art. Without motivation, experimentation and relative freedom, an artist and his artistic heritage will stagnate. When the first progressive European artists were ex- posed to African art, they were en- chanted. To them, it presented fresh, free originality, boldness and balanced composition, in contrast with the rococo craftsman or copyist who reproduces from nature with photographic accuracy. The African artist at his best excells in producing exciting, imaginative and rela- tively original works within the frame- work of what is acceptable to his tribal concepts: consider the splendid variety of ibeji figures. The fake copy lacks this spontaneous element, as it is a studied imitative production. In order to be free of suspicion, a genuine African sculpture should not be too pretty, fussy and detailed - or too simple, crude and stiff. The type of material, technique, patina, and correct tribal style in the period made would all be factors that would have to be con- sidered along with the quality of inspi- ration possessed by the "right" piece. This quality of inspiration is best determined by one having artistic ability. The excel- lence of an inspired artist's composition cannot be judged by a purely technical analysis, any more than a tone-deaf person could adjudicate a musical compo- sition. Ideally, art and technology should be married, each complementing the other. Every genuine historical example has a story to tell and is worth collecting. It need not be a masterpiece to have a charisma of its own and delight its new owner, as it did the previous owners who preserved it. D. G.

Although consideration of the spatial behavior of the various Tuareg groups as well as the Songhai-related ethnic groups is beyond the purview of this discussion, it is relevant to note that a number of similarities to both Fulani and Hausa patterns do exist. A comparison with Tuareg practices would undoubtedly reveal further insights into the nature of the archi- tectural process in the area under concern. 17.

One of the major difficulties in specifically ascribing the new building technology to the Fulani is that the wide range of tent forms found in the West African savannah and sahel are used interchangeably by a number of nomadic peoples. The "beehive" huts referred to by Nicolaisen are used not only by the Fulani, but also by the Tuareg, the Songhai, and the Bela. The "barrel vaulted" roofs are used by the Tuareg, Songhai, and Fulani. Among the Tuareg, there is a particularly inter- esting set of traditions referring specifically to the central post, perhaps in recognition of the critical structural role of a central post in any tension structure. The term for this central post, tamakait, derives from the verb "to support," used not in a structural sense but in a moral sense.

In Songhai, the term "soro" means "on high," and it pref- aces many architectural terms relating to the upper story, such as soro batuma for upper terrace, soro lendye for upper veran- dah, soro tye for earthen stairs up to the terrace, and soro tabai for parapet. Fieldnotes, Djenne, Mali, 1971. 38. Adeleye, Power and Diplomacy ..., p. 28. In Fulani, the verb "to greet" is kofnol, and the plural, kofli, means "greeting." Taylor gives the following definition: "A slave on duty at the palace door - one to be propitiated before access can be had to the king." There appears to be a close asso- ciation with the role of the Vizier in North Africa who was also considered as the doorway to an audience with the Sultan. Last, The Sokoto Caliphate, p. 20, also comments on the location of the meeting place of the council at Degel. It was at the en- trance to the Shaikh's compound. There is also an interesting rendition of the"cage-like" reception tent at the entrance to the palace of the Sultan of Bournou in Denham and Clapperton's account. 39. Jack Goody, Technology, Tradition, and the State in Africa (London: Oxford University Press, 1971), Chapter 4, contains a most relevant discussion on the opposition between earth and horse in polity and ritual among a number of West African peoples. The discussion has considerable material for the explanation of architectural configuration at entrances. 40. Oral traditions of the origin of the Hausa builders, re- corded at Zinder in 1945, suggest an Arab, a Tuareg, or an Eastern origin. Other verbal traditions suggest a Habe origin. References can be found to the male Hausa slaves who did the building for the Fulani scions. The style of the Sokoto mosque is attributed to a master builder, native to Zaria, whose father had been in Egypt and had there acquired a smattering of knowledge of Moorish architecture. Foureau, D'Alger au Congo. II, p. 363. 41. The critical aspect of surface is not diminished by variation in building technique, whether it be coil, banco, handmolded, or cast brick. Only with the use of kiln-dried brick does rendering become superfluous. 42. Goody, Technology, Tradition .... Chapter 4. 43. Franz Rosenthal, "Significant Uses of Arabic Writing", Four Essays on Art and Literature in Islam (Leiden: Brill, 1971), p. 53. 44. There also appears to have been a number of instances in which mathematics was directly associated with the building process, and a mathematician and a builder were often one and the same person. Ibn Khaldun, The Muqaddimah, II, p. 363. Renaud's discussion of the writings of Ibn al-Banna de Mar- rakesh also suggests a link, since al-Banna is a common sur- name in North Africa for masterbuilder. Ibn Khaldun also refers to the "curious process of calcul entitled hisab an-nim," a divinatory method notably used when two kings declare war, in order to know which will be the conqueror. H.P.J.

The same phenomenon occurred in North African Islamic architecture. Another example of the materialization of the Arabic script is the Egyptian practice of curing disease by writing certain passages from the Koran on the inner surface of an earthenware bowl, then pouring in some water, stirring until the writing is washed off, then gulping down the water, "to which the sacred words, with all their beneficient power (vertu), have been transferred."

IBlBIO METALWORK, Notes,from page23 The material for this article was gathered largely in 1976, during the course of ethnographic research under the employ- ment of the Nigerian Federal Department of Antiquities. I should like to thank Mr. Abu S. Edet, Antiquities Assistant, Oron Museum, and Mr. Akan E. Anamukot for their ready co- operation in the field. 1. There are a number of publications on Ibibio art and material culture. My article on "The Ibibio Musical Pot" (African Arts 1973, VII, 1) describes the techniques of a typical Ibibio potter. Ibibio funerary cement sculpture is described by Ulli Beier in his article, "Ibibio Monuments" (Nigeria Maga- zine 1956, 51), and V. F. Butler in "Cement Sculpture in East- ern Nigeria" (Nigeria Magazine 1963, 77). John C. Messenger has written several excellent papers on various aspects of art and drama among the Annang Ibibio, e. g., "The Role of the Carver in Anang Society" in The Traditional Artist in African Societies, Indiana University Press, 1973, and "Anang Art, Drama and Social Control" (African Studies Bulletin 1962, 5:2). There are several publications on the carved ancestral figures of the Oron Ibibio, notably K. C. Murray's "Ekpu: The Ancestor Figures of Oron, Southern Nigeria" (Burlington Magazine 1947, 89). An exhibition of the traditional arts and crafts of the Cross River area is currently being mounted in the Federal Department of Antiquities' new museum at Oron. 2. I have a forthcoming article, "Efik Beaten Brass," which de- scribes the history, production and use of this ware in some detail. The present article and the one referred to above are part of a series of publications on the metalwork of the Cross River area, which also includes a paper entitled "Cross River Bronzes." 3. Ibit is also the Ibibio word for the common wooden mem- brane drum. 4. Metal thicknesses were measured with a micrometer. Hearth temperatures were recorded with the aid of a thermoelectric py- rometer, supplied by the University of London, Central Re- search Fund. DANUBI SHRINE, Notes,frompage37 An earlier draft of this paper was presented at the Third Tri- ennial Symposium on Traditional African Art, Columbia Uni- versity, April 1974. Subsequent revisions received helpful com- ments from Douglas Fraser, Nicholas Pweddon, Karl Reis- man, Arnold Rubin, Susan Vogel, and James Willis. A special debt of thanks is expressed to Dan Crowley for his many thoughtful suggestions. 1. Fieldwork in Adamawa and southern Sardauna Provinces was conducted from September 1969 through March 1971 and was supported by a Field Grant and Fellowship from the Cultural Anthropology section of the National Institute of Mental Health, and by assistance from the Program of African Studies, Northwestern University. The status of Research Associate was granted by Ahmadu Bello University. For accommodation and research assistance in Sama areas I am grateful to Karl and Janine Reisman, and to the Hon. Philip, Gang Maken (District Head) of Yelwa. Karl Reisman accom- panied me to Danubi and shared with me many of his insights into Sama language and culture. I alone, however, remain responsible for any omissions or misinterpretations of data that may occur in this paper. 2. The "B" in Bachama is a glottalized bilabial plosive, and should be represented as "hooked." It should be noted that spellings of native terms in this paper may not accord precisely with phonetic transcription. 3. I recorded similar traditions among the Kona, a Jukun chiefdom (see also Rubin 1969). They claim to have migrated together with the Bachama and Bata whom they call, collec- tively. "Kungba," a term derived from the Bachama kur ngba, "hold my waist" (i.e., "follow me"). Chamba are nowhere mentioned in their migration legends, however. 4. The original Chamba group seems to have been the "Leko." These are the dominant group at Toungo; this must be the group Meek refers to. The "Daka" are also of Leko descent, although their language and customs have become increas- ingly distinct from their parent group. The origin of the term "Daka" is unclear, but it is considered abusive by the people, who call themselves "Sama." They are also sometimes referred to as "Nyaganyare" meaning, according to Percival (1938), something like "Do you hear?" in their language, i.e., referring to people who speak an unintelligible language. The Ledo and Donga groups both call themselves "Samba." "Chamba" seems to have been a Fulani corruption. Where I have used this term in this paper, it is meant to refer to all offshoots col- lectively. 5. In 1958 the British Administration consolidated Yebbi and Gurum Pawa under one administration with its headquarters at Nabung, later called Yelwa. In 1961, following the United Nations referendum in which the southern Mandated Areas elected to join the Cameroons, the Sama were incorporated into the Chamba Native Authority with headquarters at Ganye. 6. Other Adamawa societies believe the souls of their deceased depart for areas with whose people they recognize histories of friendly relations. For example, Mbula, Bwaza, and Dong souls go to Bille, where they can be "met" on market days. 7. Kpalame means "red" or "yellow." Nzo-kpalame is a new- born infant whose skin pigment has not fully manifested itself; the royal twin from whom Bachama are descended was Zaro Kpalame, "The Yellow Twin." I can offer no suggestion at this time as to any symbolism inherent in the concept of "The Red Land." 8. Karl Reisman supplied me with additional information on the Sama bull-roarer. It is referred to in terms of its "voice," which says, "dang dii dii mi." Dang is "to be obsessed," mi is "child." The rest is apparently onomatopoeic. The ceremony of the bull-roarer seems to be one for children, who leave little piles of Bambara nuts outside their compounds for it on the evening of the night it is to "come out." It is not a game, however; children hold it in extreme respect. Possibly it could be seen as an agent of social control, particularly important in the socialization of children. It belongs to a class of "small fearful creatures" called koko-mi, "spirits of, or for, children." 9. I have been unable to locate this place. 10. Samajoke with brothers-in-law. 11. Recent maps of the area place a village called Mbulo about sixteen kilometers to the north of Yelwa, and indicate it as a District Headquarters. This is most likely a cartographic error; 98</page></plain_text>
