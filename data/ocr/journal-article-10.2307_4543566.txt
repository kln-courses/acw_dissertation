<plain_text><page sequence="1">55 DARWIN AND HEGEL. By D. G. RITCHIE. IN every age philosophy has been affected by the sciences, i.e., the methods and conceptions which are used in the attempt to make some particular province or aspect of the universe intelligible have exer- cised a fascination over those who are seeking to understand the universe as a whole. And this is only natural: for the philosopher, who is really the philosopher of his own age and not the survival from an earlier epoch, is the prodact of the same intellectual move- ment which has led to the adoption of new methods and new conceptions among those who are pursaino special branches of knowledge. The difference between the genuine philosopher and the average seeker for " completely unified knowledge " is that the former has a fuller and clearer consciousness of the methods and conceptions he is using, and is less likely to apply them uncritically and in disregard of the subject-matter to which he is applying them. Mathematics was the only science that had outgrown the merest infancy among. the Greeks. And in the Pythagoreans we have an example of philosophers who were completely carried away by the fascination of the conceptions of number and figure. In defining justice as " a square number " the Pythagoreans were for the first time attempting to make ethics " scientific," i.e., to lift reflection on human conduct out of the region of proverbial moralising by applying to it the most scientific categories of which they knew. Plato has puzzled many generatious of commentators by those mystic numbers which he introduces into his philosophy; in all likelihood he only half believed in them (if so much as that), and he seems to be playing an elaborate and rather cruel joke on literal-minded persons, hint.ing all the while at the inadequacy of the Pythagorean symbols. Aristotle introduced mathematical formula into ethics, but only with carefully expressed modifications. His conception of scientific method comes, indeed, too exclusively from mathematics; but he is in advance of many modern moralists in seeing that buman conduct at least is too complex to be studied by mathematical methods. It might be objected, that in mediaeval philosophy the principle I have laid down did not hold, but that the reverse was the case, that philosophy was not affected by the sciences, but that the sciences were "Ccorrupted by metaphysics." The study of nature, however, was by no means that on which the medieval intellect exerciscd itself. There were in truth only two " sciences " in which the medieval mind</page><page sequence="2">56 took a living interest, viz., moral theology and law-that is to say, the application of a supposed divine code to the particular cases of human conduct and the application in the same way of a human code assumed to be of supreme excellence. Physics was only a tradition (of course I am speak-ing roughly of what is true " on the whole "). The words of Aristotle or of Galen were accepted on authority. In these sciences, however, where authority is a matter of necessity, the utmost ingenuity of mind could be exercised in bringing general principles to bear on particular cases. Thus the abstract, deductive, and argumentative method actually employed in the sciences of legal and moral casuistry reacted on the interpretation given to Aristotelian logic and on the general theory of method adopted. Aristotelian logic was itself based on the method of geometry. Add to this the mediseval habit of bowing to the authority of the written word in every department of thought and life, and we can easily see the source of the mediaeval conception of system in philosophy. In the seventeenth century the effect of geometrical method on Hobbes and on Spinoza is sufficiently conspicuous.* The conceptions of mechanical physics assert themselves throaghout this, and still more in the following ccntury, even where the philosopher, in the interests of literary form, is careful to eschew the appearance of science. John Stuart Mill's phrase, " mental chemistry " (Eaant- nation of Hamilton, p. 357, ed. 5), suggests a new set of categories which raise the " association " psychologists above the level of their predecessors who used the categories of mechanics. In the present age the most conspicuously advancing science is biology; and the categories of organism and evolution are freely transferred to philosophy with the great advantage of lifting it out of the more abstract conceptions of mathematics or mechanics, but too often with insufficient consciousness of what is being done, so that striking metaphors are mistaken for indisputable facts or laws. Now, there were " evolutionists " before Darwin, and even before Mr. Herbert Spencer, who seems to wish to take out a patent for the invention of the theory, and conspicuously calls the attention of a careless public to the fact that his essay on Progress: its Law and * With regard to Hobbes, compare Aubrey's story, quoted by Professor G. Croom Robertson Hobbes, p. 31: " He was forty years old before lhe looked on geometry, which happened accidentally: being in a gentleman's library in -, Euclid's Eltements lay open, and it was the 47th Prop., Lib. I. So he reads the proposition. ' By G--,' says he, ' this is impossible!' So he reads the demonstration, which referred him back to another, which he also read, et sic deince.ps, that at last he was demonstratively convinced of that truth. This made him in love with geometry."</page><page sequence="3">57 Cause appeared in April, 1857, whereas the Origin of Species did not see the light till October, 1859 (see preface to 4th edition of First Principles). Evolution is in every one's mouth now, and the writings of Mr. Spencer have done a great deal (along with the discoveries of Darwin) to make the conception familiar. But nothing grows up quite suddenly. During the latter half of last century many isolated thinkers had in this or that department of science come to apply the idea of development. Though in Kant as a philosopher the idea of evolution, and indeed the whole conception of historical growth, is conspicuously absent,* yet the same Kant, as a man of science, was the author of the nebular hypothesis. Vico and Montesquie, had, still earlier, suggested a way of looking at human inistitations, which was not fully understood till several generations had passed Above all, in biology Erasmus Darwin (Zoonomia, 1794) foreshadowed' the work of his grandson. Buffon, Geoffrey St. Hilaire, Lamarck, had all attacked the orthodox dogma of immutable species; and perhaps Lord Monboddo should not be forgotten, for his speculatioiis on the origin of man became widely familiar, since the very shallowest wits could raise a laugh about them. Goethe, who, as an old man of eighty-one, was more excited by the news of the dispute between Cavier and St. Hilaire than by the news of the July Revolution, had forty years before (1790) published his iMetamorphoses of Plants. Thus Hegel grew ap in an intellectual atmosphere in which the conception of evolution, and especially of biological evolution, was no incon- siderable element. For Goethe's general view of nature he had the greatest sympathy-so much so indeed as to lead him to defend Goethe's theory of colour against the Newtonian theory, a defence which has brought Hegel into much discredit with the modern scientific mind. What attracted Hegel in Goethe's view of nature (as Mr. S. Alexander has well pointed out in Mind, xi, p. 511), was that sense of uniity or totality in nature which the poet's feeling grasps, but which is apt to escape the analysis of the scientific understanding (Cf. lVaturphilosophie, pp. 317, 318, 483): anid it was perhaps worth while Lo remind the world that to reg,ard light as composed of different Of course such a statement is only relatively true-i.e., if we compare Kant with Hegel and other philosopllers of this century. Kaiit does maintain the idea of progress in human society, and explains it as due to the "unisocial sociability of men "-by which ho clearly means " repulsioni" ancl "attraction" (concepts borrowed from physic&gt;). He is quite aware tlhat tlc "original conltrct" never took place as a matter of fact in history, but he prefers to tlhink out problems of politics with the help of these unhistorical fictioils. Here, as every- where, the abstract line which Kant dr-aws between what is a priori and what is a posteriori-between the form of tlhouglht anid the miiatter of cxpericl.:ce-prcevnts him from seeing a thlouglht-process in the tilmc-proecss. E</page><page sequence="4">.58 colours is only a way of making the concrete facts of nature intelli. gible to ourselves. In the same spirit Heoel complains (p. 489) that the botanists of his time did not appreciate Goethe's Metamorphoses of Plants, and " did not know what to make of it, just because what was represented therein was a totality (ehen weil ein Ganzes darin dargesteilt wurde.) " Goethe gets behind the differance whiclh to the ordinary eye and mind splits up a plant into a combination of iunlike parts (root, stem, branch, leaves, blossoms, fruit) and sees all these as the differentiations of an identical nature (Grundwesen). In his Zcr ilforphologie (written in 1795, published in 1807) Goethe formulates the law that " the more imperfect a being is the more do its individual parts resemble each other, and the more do these parts resemb7c the whole. The mnore perfect the being is the more dissimilar are its parts. In the former case the parts are more or less a repetition of the whole; in the latter case they are totally unlike the whole. The more the parts resemble each other, the less suboldi- nation is there of one to thle other. Sutbordinatiqn of parts indicates high griade of organisation " (Lewes' Life of Goethe, p. 358). We are familiar with this in another form: " the change from an indefiniite incoherent homogeneity to a definite coherent heterogeneity." Goethe has anticipated Von Baer's law, enunciated in respect of emibryology (1828), which forms the essential part of the formula MIr. Spencer as a plhilosopher has applied to the whole universe. Evolution was thus familiar to Hegel, both the theory and the word. Everywhere in Hegel we read about Entwickelung; but of Evolution he does not speak in so friendly a tone. " The two forms in which the series of stages in nature have been apprehended are Evolution and Emanation " (Naturphil., p. 34). By the first., he explains, is meant the process from the less perfect to the more perfect; by the seconid the process from the more perfect to the less perfect. Of the two he prefers the conception of Emanation, because it explains the lower from the point of view of the higher, whereas Evolution carries one back " into the darkness of the past," and only gives us a selies of stages following one another in timle. "The time-difference has no interest whatever for thought" (p. 32). This is undoubtedly a hard saying. The man who can prefer the Oricutal conception of Emanation to the modern scientific conception of Evolu tion mig,ht seem to be more fit to be expounded by the Theosophical Society than to be seriously considered by the contemporaries of Mr. Herbert Spencer. " We must interpret the more developed by the less developed," says Mlr. Spencer (Data of Ethic.s, p. 7); and at least ninety-nine out of every hundred scientific stude-uts would cry "Amlien." But is tllis what tlley are themselves doing ? They tell us about the less developed organisms or societies (or whatever may</page><page sequence="5">59 be the subject of investigation), and then they go on to tell us about the more developed. But are they really interpreting the higher by the lower? Let us listen to another philosopher who approached philosophy from the side of biology. In his Study of Pslchology G. H. Lewes writes as follows -" Once recognising the necessity of observing, the sentient activities of men and of animals, and of interpreting these by reference to their organic conditions, what more natural suoggestion than that our study should begin with animals? The comparative simplicity of their organisms and their manifestations would seem to mark themn as furniislhiing, the safest proleaomena to Human Psychology. I have already stated (in the preface to Problems of Life and Mind) that in 1860 I was led to collect materials with this view, but that fuller consideration slhowed it to be impracticable. To show w%vhy it was impracticable will be an answer to my Russian critic, M. Wyrouboff, who objects to miy 'sin against scientific met.hod' in not proceeding from phellomena that are general and simple to those that are special and complex; I ought, he thinks, to have made the exposition of the simpler cerebral pheniomena n animals precede that of the more complex phenomena in man. This was my own opinion till experience proved its mistake. I fouand myself constantly thwarted by the fallacies of anthropomorphic interpretation. It was impossible, even approximately, to eliminate these before a clear outline of the specially human elements was secured," &amp;c. (pp. 118, 119). Farther on he says: " It is clear that we should never rightly understand vital phenomena were we to beg,in our study of Life by contemplating its simplest manifestations in the animal series; we can only understand tlle Amceba and the Polype by a light reflected from the study of Mlan" (p. 122). What makes it seem possible for the scientific investigator " to begin at the beginning" is the fact that he is not doing so. The student of the Amceba happens to be, not an Amceba, but a specimen of a highly developed vertebrate, and knows at least something about the dilferen- tiated organs and functions of his own body. Professor Freeman "explains" the English Constitution bv quoting Tacitus about the Germans and by describing the Landesgenleinden of Uri and Appen- slell, &amp;C., &amp;c.: but then we all know somethiing about our present constitution. Even Professor Freeman, houwever much he may dislike "Mlodern " History, cannot help living and thinking in a veiy modern period. Now this I take to be the element of truth in Hegel's preference for Emanation over Evolution. We only -understand a part of anything when we can look at it as the part of a whole, and we only understand the elementary stages when we k-now them as the elementary stages of something more highly developed. This is true E 2</page><page sequence="6">60 in each special branch of knowledge, and it is true in the attempt to think the universe as a whole. Hegel's " development " (Entwickelung) is not a time-process, but a thought-process; yet Hegel's method of exposition is such that the thought-process is apt to be read as if were meant to be a time-process. To avoid misunderstanding him we must, as has been said, "read Hegel backwards." "He presents everything synthetically," says Professor Seth (Heyelianism antd Personality, p. 90), " though it must first have been got analytically by an ordinary process of reflection upon the facts which are the common property of every thinker." There has been much innocent laughter over Hegel's absurdity in saying that Beinc is the same thing as Nothing, and that Being and Nothing between them produced Becoming. But, if we take the conception of " Becoming " and analyse it, we find that it does imply both Being, and Not-being. Thiat which becomes is that which wvas not but now is. The Eleaties were puzzled by the conception of MIotion, just because they were trying- to think the whole of reality under the category of Being-, and did not see that Not-beiing was involved as well. So, on the other hatid, the Heracleiteans seemed t.o make everything slip away iii a flux, because they took the category of Becoming, as ultimate and did not recognise that it iniplied the category of Being. The beginning of Hegel's Logic is, amoiig other things, a memorandum of Plato's solution of these old controversies. So again, if we are told that Identity passes over into Difference, and that the two produce Likeness and Unlikeness (I am not attempt- ing to follow the miinutiw of Hegel's statement here), we shall see the point of this better by taking the concept of Likeness and asking what it implies-a question that is by no means superfluous, for Eng,lish philosophy has tended to take the category of similarity as if it were ultimate. Thus J. S. Mill says, "Likeness and unlikeness cannot be resolved into anything else" (Logic, i., p. 75). Hume, in his T.reatise of Htumnan Nctture, resolves " identity" into " resemblance." "This propension," he says, " to bestow an identity on our resembling perceptions produces the fiction of a continued existence " (p. 209, edit. Selby-Bigge). In treating of the Laws of Association, Mr. Speticer aims at reducing contiguity to similarity (Principles of Psychulogy, ? 120, vol. i., p. 267). Mr. Bosanquet has pointed out that, "Mr. Spencer is more of an atomist than anyone else has ever been, for he says that the syllogism must have four terms, i.e., the middle term is not identical in its two relations, but only similar" (Essays and Addresses, p. 167). Mr. Bosanquet is working out the subject from the other side, attacking the delusion of English philosophers that identity necessarily excludes difference. It is</page><page sequence="7">61 because of their abstract conception of identity that some of them have been led on to the attempt of getting rid of identity altogether in psychology and logic. If, then, we read Hegel backwards, we find that his logic and the whole of his philosophy consist in this perpetual " criticism of categories," i.e., in an analysis of the terms and concepts which ordinary tbinking, and the various special sciences use as current coin without testing their real value. But the results of this " criticism of categories " Hegel arranges so as to present the appearance of a completed system; the self-development of thought from the simplest to tlhe most complex stages; the less adequate conceptions showing their imperfections, and so, by criticising them- selves, as it were, leading us on to the more adequate, fuller, and "truer " ways of thinking. This is Hegel's manner of satisfying the demand for " completely unified knowledge." But because of this metbod of exposition he is peculiarly liable to be misunderstood and misrepresented. The tendency to mistake a thought-process for a time-process arises from our desire to substitute the easier form of picture-thinking for the more difficult effort of grasping the separate elements in their totality. And it is a tencdency which may mislead even philosophers themselves and still more their followers. Thus Aristotle carefully defines the logical term as that " into which the proposition is resolved " (et' sv 'tfV6Ta w 7po.aaLTs). But when " terms " come to be treated of as the first part of logic, then the temptation is to explain the proposition as arising out of a com- bination of terms. So, again, when the process of inference has been analysed into premises and conclusion, the premises come to be regarded as if they existed first in time, and as if the conclusion was afterwards tacked on to them-a piece of picture-thinki-ng whiich has exposed to uunerited attack the Aristotelian analysis of reasoning. So, too, because we can think of society as recognising certain rights in its members, the individuals with their rights come to be pictured as existing prior to the formation of society, in an imaginary state of nature. To take an example from another regioin-Space is analysed into its three dimensions; then the geometrician, for method's sake, treats of two dimensions first and afterwards goes on to treat of three dimensions. And so some people fancy that you can go on to spaces of four, five, or any number of dimensions; whereas there is, as a matter of fact, no "going on " at all - Space of one or of two dimensions with which we are supposed to start is an abstraction from the only real space. Why, it may be asked, did Hegel adopt this treacherous mode of exposition ? Two reasons may be given. In the first place, he was influenced, as we have seen, by the Neoplatonic idea of Emanation;</page><page sequence="8">62 but there is this all-important difference between Hegel and the Neoplatoiiists, that he gets beyond the idea of differentiation as mere loss or evil, aild sees in it a necessary step in t.he movement to a higher unity. Titus the idea of Emanation in his hands passes over into the idea of development from the abstract to the concrete But, in the second place, tllis development or thought-process does show itself as a timie-process. Hegel's remark in the Natwsphilosoph;e (p. 33) must not be taken to mean anything more than that a meJ-e after-one-another in time is of no philosopphical or scientific interest; thus, e.g., the scientific historiau will not write mere annals. Ainnals are the mnaterials for history, and are not yet history. Above all in the history of philosophy does the connection between the thought- process and the time-process come to the surface. The history of philosoplhy gave Hegel hiis clue to the logical development of the categories. The simpler and more abstract categories come first in time in the process by which the human consciousness becomes gradually aware of the conceptions underlying ordinary thought and language. In the histor-y of philosophy we have a development from the simpler to the mote complex, like that which Evolutionists see in the physical universe. Professor Wallace has well compared Hegel's discovery of the self-development of thought by means of the clue given him inl the history of philosophy to Darwin's discovery of the process of evolution in the organic world by the help of the clue given him by " artificial selection." " Philosophy," says Professor Wallace, "is to the general growth of intellig,ence what artificial.breeding is to the variation of species under natural conditions " (The Logic of Hegel, Prolegomena, p. ex). I should quite agree with Prof. Seth (Hegelianism anid Personality, p. 170) that Hegel's greatest strength lies just in his interpretation of history-i.e., of the process of human evolation in all its depart- ments. But Prof. beth blames Hogel for transferrinog to the development in time the thought-process described in the Logic, without any justification except the ambiguity in the word " develop- ment" (p. 159). I have just tried to show that the history of philosophy itself is Hegel's justification for the transference; and I think that if he is to be blamed at all, it should rather be for statingr the thought-process in the Logic, so that it looks like a time-process. I suppose the belief still prevails about Hegel that he is an a yriori metaphysician who spins theolies out of his head regardless of facts. And this reproach is held to apply with special force to his Plhilosophy of Nature. What Hegel himself says is something very different. " Not only must philosophy be in harmany with experience, but empirical natural science is the presupposition and CoILdition of the rise and formation of the philosophical science of</page><page sequence="9">63 nature.' The synthetic thinking of the philosopher must follow after and depend upon the results of the analytic process of scientific research. This being so, it must be remembered in respect of Hegel's Philosophy of Nature, that much of the natural science which supplied him with his material and his problems is now out of date; so that his Philosophy of Nature cannot have the same interest and value for us as his Astlhetic, or his Philosophy of Religion, or his Philosophy of History, though even in these departments we occasionally feel that the philosopher is working with somewhat antiquatecd materials, and not always dealing with what have come to be our chief problems. Secondly, Hegel's warmest admirers must admit that Hegel has his prejudices-patriotic prej udices in the main. His sympathy with Goethe's conception of nature was, on the whole, a beneficial influence; bat it helped to make him unappreciative of Newton. And, thirdly, Hegel has less interest in nature than in the works of the human mind. He is undergoing the reaction against the deification of Natare, as something higher and better than man. " Vanini says that a straw is enough to reveal the being of God; " but, adds Hegel, " any idea of the mind, the poorest of its fancies, the play of its most accidental moods, every word is a more excellent reason for recognising the beingo of God than any single natural object what- ever " (.YLturphilosophie, p. 29). Again, " Even an arbitrary volition -nay, even a bad volition-is infinitely higher than the regular movements of the stars or than the innocence of the plants; for a wrong, human volition is the error of a thinking spiritual being." (lb., p. 30.)* Grant all this, it may be said, and what then is the use of bring- ing Hegel's name into connection with Darwin's? There might be some reason for considering hiis attitude to evolution as he saw it represented in the T3iologie (1802-5) of Treviranus, and in the Phtilosophie Zoologique (1809) of Lamarck, and some reason, perhaps, for blamino him for his want of appreciation of the first beoinnings of the great scientific revolution of this century. I thinJk, howxever, it is worth while to see whether we can get any help, not from details in Hegel, but from his general method and spirit of philosophising, in making the attempt to think nature and human society as they present thlemselves to us now ill the lighD of Darwin's theory of natural selection. Of evolution Hegel had heard-some- * Cf. the passage near the beginning of the "Introduction" of the ?:stIetic: " If we look at it formally-i.e., only considering in what way it exists, not what there is in it-even a silly fLacv such as may pass through a man's head is Aiger than any product of Nature; for such a fancy mu-st at least be characterised by intellectual being and by freedom." (Bosanquet's Trainsaation, p. 3.)</page><page sequence="10">what impatiently, perhaps-but not of natural selection. Blut neither had Treviranus nor Lamarck; neither had Mr. Herbert Spencer when ke elaborated the groundwork of his system. Even in the fifth edition (1884) of First Principles, " natural selection " is only allowed to appear in a footnote, which footnote is intended to minimise the importance of Darwin's discovery (p. 447). Now it is "natural selection " which seems to me the really epoch-making scieintific theory; it is this that has produced that "change of categoories" which, as Hegel says (Natlurphil., p. 19), is the essential thing in all revolutions, whether in the sciences or in hwpnan history. Evolution in the form in which Mr. Spencer, for instance, formulates it, is only a further carrying out of an idea which may be traced back to the Ionian hylicists; "n atural selection " introduces a quite new method of looking at nature, and it has the furtber advan- tage of being, not a metaphysical specalation, but an undeniable fact. What, then, is the effect of the theory of natural selection on Hegel's philosophy ? Hegel's method of philosophising Nature could adjust itself quite easily to the new scientific theory. The factors which Darwin assumes for his theory are-Variation, Heredity, Struggle for Existence. Now are not Heredity and Variation just particular forms of the categories of Identily and Difference, whose union and interaction produce the actually existino kinds of living beings, i.e., those determinate similarities and dissimilarities which constitute " species " ? But this result-definite, clearly marked kinds, comes about through struggle, i.e., through negation, the constant elimination of the less fit. Survival of the fittest, on Darwin's theory, comes about only through the negative process of destruction. In the stage of mere Nature this negativity is mechani- cal and external. In the hig,her stage of consciousness (spirit) this neogativity is self-determined, free-as I shall try to show later on. This attempt at Hegelianising natural selection may seem fanciful. We know that Hegel's formuae have been read into Shlakespeare's plays and iinto various inconsistent types of religious creed: and people become suspicious of formulae so very elastic. I think, however, my interpretation is valid so far as it goes, though it would not count for much except for reasons I now go on to con- sider. There is one matter on which I think that most admirers of fleoel, unless they be of the very straitest orthodoxy, would allow thlat his view of Nature needs some correction. I mean his con- ception of " the Contingent " (das Zufdllige). That infinite variety mhich is sometimes praised as " the freedom of Nature," or even as "the divinity of Nature," Hegel regards as not the glory but the</page><page sequence="11">defect and impotency of Nature. (Naturphil., p. 37; cf. the small Logic; Werke vi, pp. 288, 290; Wallace's Translation, pp. 227, 228). Thought has in nature gone out of itself into its " othier" - its extreme opposite-irrationality. And that is why nature is like a wild Bacchantic god (Naturphil., p. 24). This conception of the " contingency " and " weakness " of nature is a survival in Begel of the Platonic and Aristotelian con- cept.ion of matter. In Plato's view the world in space and time must, just because it is in space and time, fall short of what its Artificer wished. So with Aristotle, " Chance " is an objective cause working in rerun natura, not a, name for our ignorance. Professor Seth seems to hold that nature is illogical or noli-rational, but that Hegel falls into a " most transparent fallacy " in sayino that con- tingency is itself a category-a form of the Idea. which "has no less than other forms of tile Idea its due office in the world of objects." " To say that a thing is contingent or accidental," argues Professor Seth, "is to say in so many words, that we can give no rational account of why it is as it is, and not otherwise." (Hegelianism and Personality, p. 137.) In this criticism I think that Professor Seth has approved of the more defective part of Hegel's statement, and has con- demned the part in which Hegel shows most insight. Darwin's thieory of natural selection seeums to me, while helping as all moderii science does to correct the despair of giving, a ratio-nal account of what appears to us merely accidental, at the same time completely to justify Hegel in regarding this seeming non-rationality of nature as itself a form of the rational. The theory of natural selection pre- supposes (it is somet.imes even made an objection to it that it does so presuppose) a tendency to variation in nature. There mlist be this for natural selection to work upon. Thus the non-rationality (indefinite variability) has its reason-in a sense in which that was never recognised before. Of course this tendency to variation is of itself a fact to be explained; and biolooists feel themselves oblig ed now to face problems that might have been put aside as insoluble by scientific men in the days before this new conception of natural selec- tion revolutionised their science. Professor Seth asks: " What locgical connection is there between the different qualities of things-between the smell of a rose, for example, and its shape; or between the taste of an orange and its colour? " This seems to me rather an unlucky question. We feel sure now that there must be some. The scent of flowers, the taste of fruits, their colours, shapes, &amp;c., are not regarded now as " acci- dental " results of a fortuitous concourse of atoms or as the mere fancy work of a capricious maker, but as connected in some way</page><page sequence="12">66 with the means through which the plant is reproduced, and the species aided in its competition with others by the insects which carry its pollen and the birds which carry its seeds. Thus, in some plants, successive adoption of self-fertilisation and insect-fertilisation can be read off from the complicated shape of the corolla.* I do not know whether the particular problems, suggested by Professor Seth, about the rose and the orange have been solved. But quite analogous problems have been, such as-Why do white flowers often give out their scent only by night?t Cats and red clover might seem to have no more logical connection than Tenterden Steeple and Goodwin Sands; but Mr. Darwin has shown how the tiourishing of red clover depends on the flourishing of cats, who eat the field-mice, who eat the bumble bees, who fertilise the red clover."' What distinguishes Darwin's tlheory from other theories of evolution is the kind of explanation it gives. Hegel complains, and I think justly, that merely to go back "'inito the darkness of the past," or merely to say, "first there was the simple and then the complex was evolved out of it," and so on, is not to explain nature; it is only to give a chironological table of events-real or imaginary. We want to know " Why?" To refer us back to the homogeneous and undifferentiated is to give "the material cause " (To c' oV) of what has happened: it is not to explain wly what has happened has happened. But the theory of nataral selection does explain "Why." Such a form or characteristic has been of advantage, of utility to the species, and therefore has favoured its continuance. Darwin restores "final causes" to their proper place in science- final causes in the Alistotelian, not in the Stoic or "Bridgewater Treatise," sense.? " The Good" a a means of explanation thus regains the impor- tance which Plato claimed for it. He makes Socrates complain that Anaxagoras, after asserting that Reason was the cause or principle of all things, went on to assign only "material" causes of things, wher-eas if we are to give a rational explanation we must do so by showing- how the grood was realised in the world (Phcrdo, 97, 98). Plato was too hlastily trying to see everything in the light of the one supreme good-the end of the universe as a whole. And Aristotle's caution was not unnecessary-" the good for man is not ' Cf. A.

This con- ception of Final Causes, which the theory of Natural Selection restores, is not the cruder form of teleologry which attempts to explain everything in the universe by showing that it serves the good of man. Each species has come to be what it is by pursuing (if we may speak metaphorically) its own good. Each iildividual is preserved by its own good. In the conflict between individuals and between kinds that whiclh is better equipped for the particular stru,ggle is selected. From many points of view, e.g., from ours- either as the species of haman beings, or ours, as members of this or that society, or ours, as individuals-what happens may be very far from what we consider our good, yet it must be the better adapted for success which succeeds. This is a truism when stated thus: but from this it follows that the explanation of structures, habits, &amp;c., must be found in the end or purpose that tlhey serve. This substitution of Final Cause for Efficient or MIaterial Cause as the more important category is as significant for us now as it seemed to be to Aristotle. And of all modern philosophers Hegel has recognised most fully this significance of the conception of End. On this head even his critic, Professor Seth, allows that he represents " what is profoundest and best in modern philosophy " (Hegelianism antd Personality, p. 83). Let me trace some consequences of the theory of natural selection in Ethics-where the applications of it are perhaps the most inter- esting to us. In Ethics the theory of natural selection has vindicated all that has proved most permaneutly valuable in Utilitarianism, while correcting those parts of the theory which made the negative work of the Intaitionalist critic very easy. Right and wrong appear now as what help or hinder the good of the society-whatever the society may be. The happiness of the individual, as Professor Clifford pointed out (Lectures and Essayd, ii, p. 173), is of no use to the community, except in so far as it makes him a more efficient citizen. Thus ethics is again, as to Aristotle -and to Hecgel, closely bound up with politics. The ethical en(d for the individual must be a social end-a common good (whatever the community may be). Natural selection (as I have tried to show more fully elsewhere*) is a perfectly adequate cause to account for the rise of morality-in that same sense of "cause "in which we use the term in scientific explanations of natural pheniomena. Regarded as events in time, the appearance of consciousuess and the capacity for language with * Art. on " Natural Selection and the Spiritual World," in Weafom as&amp;ter Reoiew, May, 1890, reprinted in 2nd edit. of Darivinism and Poltics (1891).

The facts of consciousness, of reflection, of self-consciousness, how- ever, make an enormous difference in the character of this struggle. Nat.ural selection in its lower stages-tlhose with which the natulralist is familiar-works solely by the destraction of t.he less favourably circamstanced organismis and species. Natural selection among "articulate-speaking," thinking mortals, who can "look before and after," works in other ways as well. Morality, to begin with, means those feelinas and acts and habits which are advantageous to the welfare of the commanity. Mlorality comes to mean the conscious and deliberate adoption of those feelings and acts and habits which are advantageous to the welfare of the community; and reflection makes it possible to alter the conception of what the community is, whose welfare is to be considered. In human history, except. where there has been retrogression, we find an advance in the ideals of life, i.e., man has been coming to a fuller and fuller consciousness of the end or good at which from the first, merely as a social animal, he has been blindly striving. It is worth while referring to retrogres- sions, because such cases show us to what an extent morality and all other differences between man and the animals, between the highest and the lowest races of human being,s, are due to the influence of social institutions and not to any original, innate, or inherited instincts. Long centuries of civilisation do not prevent mankind from reverting to a condition not far from that of the lowest races, where circumstances, such as a terrible pestilence, long-continued warfare, a barbarian invasion or life among savages, have removed the ordinary restraints of civilisation. Still these are exceptional conditioins. What may appear to be a gener-al breakdown and return to barbarism may be the transition to a new and, in some respects, higher type of social organisation. For in human evolution we are forcibly reminded that progress does not go on in a straight line ; but, just because thought enters into the process, at each step there is an attempt to correct the one-sidedness of the preceding stage. In the history of philosophy this " dialectic movement" comes clearly to the surface. The philosopher who is not a mere echo of what has become a dogmatic system is driven, by reflection on the prevalent manner of thinking, to lay stress on the aspects of truth which have been neglected. But the criticism he applies to his predecessors miust in due time be applied to him. The great constructive philosophers seem indeed to gather up itto their tlhought all the elements that existed scattered in preceding systems; but the time comes when a new criticismn and then a newv, reconstruction are needed, if philosophy</page><page sequence="15">69 is to remain living and not to be fossilised in a traditional dogma. "Let us follow whithersoever the argument leads us;" and, if we do not let ourselves become "misologists," we must hold fast this Atheniaii faith in the valune of the perpetual conflict of ideas, which is the highest form of the struggle for existence. But what comes out clearly, and with some consciousness on the part of those con- cerned, in the history of philosophy is also going on in all other parts of human evolution. If natural selection operated among human beings exactly as in the lower organic world, there would be no advance except by the destruction of all the individuals composing an unsuccessful form of social organism. In the lower stages of human history that must have happened often enough. In the higher stages the organism may change without the members of it being destroyed; the race (the merely natural element) is not in- separably linked to the fate of all its institutions, its laniguage, religion, form of government, &amp;c. A vigorous race may live through many political and social institutions; on the other hand, successful institutions may become the possession of many races. Now in the history of civilisation generally we can see, though not in every respect so clearly as in the history of philosophy, this criticism of customs and ideas going on. Revolutions, peaceable or otherwise, are the transitions from one stage to another, provoking generally a counter-revolution, but in progressive societies, helping the forward movement throug-h whatever apparently zigzag courses. Mr. Herbert Spencer thinks that the movement of human progress is all in one direction-fiom status to contract. Any attempts to get rid of some of the anarchy of individualism he can only interpret as a return to militancy. A follower of Hegel would agree with the average man that it is no such thing. We are not returning, to the Mliddle Ages, but advancing to a new stage which shall reconcile both elements. Of course this new staoe will not be final-though we are always apt to look on the stage just ahead of us as if it were final, because it is what to us seems most needed. Defects, one-sidedness in it, will show themselves and need correction, perhaps at first by opposite exaggera- tions. The correction may take place niore and more through peaceful debate, instead of throug,h fighting. A still higher stage would be reached when people themselves made the corr ection instead of leaving it to a rival party to do so: the dialectic movement may go on within the soul. This seems to me a type of interpretation of human evolution which is in entire accordance with Darwin's theory of natural selection, and which yet admits of wha.t is most valuable in Hegel's dialectic method. The analysis of the conception of punishment in Mr. Alexander's Moral Order and 1rog,'ess (pp. 327-313) seems to rme</page><page sequence="16">70 a most admirable example of such a reconciliation of Darwinian and Hegelian evolution. "Panishment in man," says MIr. Alexander, "corresponds to the struggle of the dominant variety with other varieties. . . . We punish in order to extirpate ideals which offend the dominant or general ideal. But in nature, conflict means the extinction of individual animals; in punishment it is sufficient that the false ideal is extinguished, and it is not necessary always that the person himself should be destroyed." Punishment, as Mr. Alexander puts it in summing up, has three characters: "It is retributive in so far as it falls under the general law that resistance to the dominant type recoils upon the resistant or guilty creature: it is preventive in so far as, being a statutory enact- ment, it aims at securing the maintenance of the law irrespective of the individual's cbaracter. But this latter characteristic is secondary, and the former is comprehended under the third idea, that of reforma- tion, which is the superior form under which retribution appears when the type is a mental ideal and is effected by conscious persons." Thlis account of Punishment is Darwinian in its application of the concept of natural selection. It is Hegelian in its recognition of the diverse elements that enter inlto the idea of punishment, unlike the rival oiie-sided theories on the subject; and it is Heg,elian above all in its recognition that what seem the extreme opposite theories of retribution and reformation are, after all, different stages of the same concept. Hegel's treatment of ethical questions agrees with that of the evolutionists in two main respects-both of which have been made grounds of objection- to his philosophy. (1) The complete separation, wvhich Kantian ethics and the ethics of the Intaitionalist school make between " ought " and " is," tends to disappear. Heoel protests vigorously against the philosophical weakiness of Fichte's perpetual Sollen, and seems to take up an almost " Philistine " attitude towards the enthusiasm of the romantic dreamer or of the reformer indignant with the abuses of society. Similarly we know that a very general consequence of the evolutionary and hiistorical view of society has been to aid the reaction agoainst the revolutionary appeal to " natural rights," and to support a political and social conservatism of the type so brilliantly illustrated in this country by Burke. And in Ethics the evolutionary moralists tend to do away with the distinction between moral laws and laws of nature, to treat moral action as not distinct in kind from action in general. (2) Hegel's ethics are a part of his "Philosophy of Lawi, "; the familiar separations between politics and ethics, between society and tlle indlividual, appear only as aspects of Xwnat caninot properly be tloughlt of ap.-rt from each other. So, too, ethics to the evolutionist is a bri.ncih of sociology. And to both</page><page sequence="17">7t Hegel and the evolationist the reproaclh is sometimes made that they ignore the significance of personality. Now, first, as to Hegel's too passive acquiescence in fact, let me admit, once for all, that that is the great flaw in his practical philosophy. All wisdom seeme(d to culminate in Hegel's Encyclo- pcedia, all history in the Prussian bureaucracy of 1820; and Hegel's orthodox disciples were ready to weep that there remained no more realms for the world-spirit to conquer. But this "finality" is an inconsistency in Hegel's application of his philosophy. The same dialectic movement which had brought the buman spirit to the stage at which Hegel found it and interpreted it must urge it onwards. Yet Hegel's error is only the exaggeration of his perfectly so-and feeling that the philosopher as such has only to do with what has already come into existence-the same sound feeling which, as I have alieady shown, makes him insist that the philosophy of nature must follow and cannot anticipate the course of the physical sciences. Heogel's famous dictum " The Real is the Rational," has been a stumbling-block to many, in spite of what he himself says in explanation of it (in the Introduction to the Encyclopaedia). Mere existence is a very different thing, from reality. Professor Seth (Hegelianism anzd Personality, p. 203) treats this distinction as a " quibble " on Hegel's part. Surely it is a perfectly legitimate use of that fatally ambiguous word " real." The use of " real " in antithesis to " sham " is common enouigh; and, as a matter of fact, it is more of a quibble, when those who boast themselves "Realists" in philosophy take advantage of this popular mnoral connotation of the term "real " to claim support for themselves in their polemic against Idealism, when e.g. they tell us that an atom is somethiiug more real than a thougoht. This is true in t.he senise that the atom must be thouglht of as being in space; but thle ordinary mind takes it as if it meant that the atom is more important. That " the real is the rational" is a doctrine which is implied in, and may be well illustrated by, the theory of natural selection. All sorts oF variations occur, i.e. they exist; but only those that prove to b)e of some value persist. Whatever maintains itself must do so because of some rationality that it has or had. When the rationality ceases, we have an appearance and not a reality, a sham that is doomed to perish. This, as we know, is the one lesson that Carlyle read in history. Hegel's temperament and his circumstances led him to lay less stress on the converse of his proposition: "The Rational is the Real." It does not matter how few lbold an opinion now, if their opinion is wliat makes for the greater well-being of society, they have got " the root of the matter" in tlem, and their opinion wil]</page><page sequence="18">72 ultimately prevail. The Idea, as Hegel himself would say, cannot remain a mere " ought to be," it must make itself real. It may take a long time; but time is indifferent to it. Similarly, the evolutionist is apt to decry all attempts to better the world. He knows that all institutions, practices, &amp;c., that have established themselves must have done so because of some value they had (some rationality); but, occnpied as he is in studying past and existing forms, he is apt not to see the promise in new variations. Of course of these new variations (i.e., new ideals, new projects, &amp;c.) a great many will fail. Even a man of inventive genius may make a lot of " anreal" inven- tions. It needs a sort of prophetic intuition to see what makes for welfare in the future. But on the priniciple of natural selection, whatever institution or type of conduct ceases to serve the well-being of society, is doomed to perish by the working of those same forces of struggle which at one time gave it reality and predominance. Whether it perishes, dragg,ing with it the happiness and the lives of human beings or not, will depend on whether it perishes by the mere natural struggle, or is peaceably set aside by the conscious act of the r eformer anticipating on behalf of his society and obviating the cruel process of mere natural selection. Hegel's philosophic endeavour to see the rationality of all established institutions has sometimes been condemned as an un- reasoning optimism. But we have seen that he does not mean that, " Whatever is, is right." And his optimism is no more than that faith in the ultimate rationality of the universe, which is the presupposition (however unexpressed or unrecognised) of all scientific interpretation and of all practical effort. To come to the second great objection made to Hegel-Professor Seth complains (and with widespread sympathy) that in Hegel's system there "is room only for one Self-consciousness: finite selves are wiped out, and nature, deprived of any life of its own, becomes, as it were, the still mirror in which the one Self-consciousness con- templates itself " (Hegelianism and Personality, p. 162). The individual is supposed to be a fatal objection to Hegel's system; he will get in the way oF it and throw it off the rails. But, perhaps, we may recall George Stephenson's answer to the objection about the cow getting in the way of the steam-engine: " It would be very awkward for the coo." And this conception of the abstract individual -the favoui-ite idolon of popular philosophy-is destroyed by the logic of Idealism, whether in the region of Metaphysics or of Ethics. Of conrse each of us, if we had been makinog the universe, might have made his own individual self the centre of it; but logic teaches us that we cannot thiiik the universe righitly from our individual point of view, and life teac!:es us that we must not live it from our iindividual</page><page sequence="19">point of view. If we try to do so, to any very great extent, our neighbours may be obliged to shut us up in an asylum or to hang us, in the interest of something that is greater than the individual self. And so we find that the real incdividual is not the individual in isolation from and in distinction from all other individuals, but is a synthesis of the universal and particular self. The scientific study of nature shows us that not only is nature "careless of the sing,le life," but that even the type or species is transitory, that thie infinite diversity of kinds and individuals does not exclude the essential unity of nature. And thus the modern man of science, if he tak-es to philosophy, is generally able to appreciate Spinoza. Hegel, however, has risen above the category of substance. Self-consciousness is to him the highest category, and, as Professor Seth admits (p. 89), is "our best key to the ultimate nature of existence as a whole." Butwhat is this "Self-consciousness" ? Is it God, or is it the individual self, or is it a mere abstract universal ? Is the critic, wlho asks these questions, quite sure what he means by " God," and by "the individual self," aild that what he ineans by thlese terms represents an intelligible reality, and not merely the pictur e-thirnking of ordinary beliefs ? Is it not, at least, a hypothesis vorth taking account of, that in our consciousness of self we have the clearest manifestation of the unity which scieince prcsapposes in the universe? Hegel admits-in perfect accord with the most materialistic science-that spirit conmes from nature; nature is the potentiality of spirit. But, if we take this conception of potentiality quite seriously, will it not be necarer the whole truth to say, with Hegel, that spirit, being out of itself, estranged from itself in nature, comes to itself in human consciousniess? The separateness and isolation of one self- conscious being from another is only a necessary consequence of the manifestation of spirit in space and time. It is the negativity which makes the manifestation possible. But the "truth" of our separate selfhoods is only to be found in our ultimate unity, which religion calls " God," wlhich ethics calls " goodness "--a unity which is not the abstract " One " of the Neoplatonist, but an organic unity realised in a society which is not a mere aggregate of individuals, but a spiritual body animated by that love which is the highbest religious conception of Deity. Let me recall what I said before about the concept of " Final Cause," or "the Good." Might not a philosophlical theology sub- stitute this concept for that of " First Cause " P' I slhall riot enquire how far the consequences might be favourable to orthodoxy (of any particular species) or not; but at least such a theology would be more in accordance with a truly etlhical religion. Hegel's critics are puzzled by wlhat secnis tblc uimion of mystical F</page><page sequence="20">74 theology with "the crudest materialism." Regard his system ini its general outlines (I am not thinking of details or applications) as a great speculative hypothesis-is it not a strong argument in favour of this hypothesis that it can at the same time accept without reserve the results of scientific discovery, however materialistic they may seem, and can yet explain, and to some extent justify, the specula- tions of those great religious thinkers who have attempted sincerely, but perhaps too boldly, to grasp in their thought of God the whole secret of the Universe ? If we may judge by past experience, all attempts on the part, of "Intuitionists " to meet Evolutionists on questions of " origins " are doomed to failure: one untenable position has to be surrendered after another. The Idealist makes no such attempt. He only insists tbat, after we have had as complete a history as can be given of how things have come to be what they are, we are justified in looking back from our vantage ground and seeing, in the past evolution the gradual " unrolling, " of the meaning, that we only fully understand at the end of the process. The process is not completed; and therefore this attempt has to be renewed for each generation. But at every stage it is in the highest that we know that we must seek the key to the philosophical interpretation of nature and of man.</page></plain_text>
