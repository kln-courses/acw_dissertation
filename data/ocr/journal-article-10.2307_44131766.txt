Arakawa, Weight Without Place, No. 1 (1981), a 29-color lithograph with screenprint signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 55. Each print is 37-1/4x67-3/4 in. and was printed on Arches paper at Handworks and Maurel Studios in New York. The print is an ambitious balance of color, pattern, and words representing Arakawa's continued philosophic investigation of "The Mechanism of Mean- ing." Colors are light, atmospheric, often closely modulated blends. Patterns include various dots, arrows that suggest clock hands, and arrows suggesting air currents, all visual evidence that "within a moment of distance there will be two or three centers. . . . Out of all this movement and within it as well a sense of weight without place will develop." These words and more are printed in large letters across the sheet and repeated in a companion print, Weight Without Place, No. 2 (1981), a 12-color lithograph with screenprint and em- bossing signed and numbered by the artist in an edition to be determined. Each print is 37-1/2x65-3/4 in. and was printed on Arches buff paper at Handworks, Maurel Studios, and Brand X Editions in New York. Here the text occurs twice, once large and flopped up- side down and again right side up and reduced. Three words are debossed and two embossed. The clock arrows recur along with a cross pat- tern and various double-printed entendres, metaphors for Arakawa's ever dialectic ap- proach to art. Although his recent prints are larger and more complicated than ever - one screen had to be farmed out to the larger press at Brand X - his effort to visually present the philosophical complexities of thought and be- ing is the same. Price: $3,250 each. Published by the artist, New York. Distributed by Ron- ald Feldman Fine Arts, New York, where a se- lection of recent Arakawa prints is on view up- town through January. Georg Baselitz, Faustkämpfer ( 1977), a black and white linocut signed and numbered by the artist in seven variants to date. Each print is 87-1/2x56 in. and was printed by the artist on Chamoispapier at his studio outside Ham- burg, Germany. Baselitz reworked his im- age - a standing male, naturally upside down - over the years, printing the first Faust- kämpfer in 1977, the fourth in 1979, etc. For a discussion of Baselitz prints, some of the most interesting of any by contemporary German artists, see page 165. Price: $2,500. Published by the artist, Hamburg. Available in New York at Brooke Alexander, Inc. Carolyn Brady, Anemones on Red Table (1981), an aquatint with spit bite signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 50 with four artist's proofs. Each print is 35-1/2x29-3/4 in. and was printed on Rives BFK paper by Maurice Payne in New York. A still life of par- ticular immediacy and charm, the reds and purples of anemones are subtly reflected in a clear glass vase on a red table. Price: $1,000. Published by 724 Prints, New York. Patrick Caulfield, Grey Pipe (1981) a three- color screenprint signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 75. Each print is 28-1/2x29 in. and was printed on Arches velin at Kelpra Studio in London. Price: $400. Pink Jug (1981), a four-color screenprint signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 80. Each print is 38-3/4x31-3/4 in. and was printed on Arches velin at Kelpra Studio in London. Price: $500. A pipe in a bowl and a pitcher are isolated against a solid ground, each image built with the barest, the boldest of solid line and color. Excellent prints. Published by Wad- dington Graphics, London. Lucinda Childs and Robert Wilson, Un- titled (1981), two pairs of intaglios signed and numbered by the artists in editions of 100 with seven exhibition sets and 24 artists' proofs each. Each print is 15-1/2x22 in. (paper size) and was printed on German Etching paper by John Shera and Nancy Sato at Aeropress in New York. Paired are a soft- and hard- ground etching by Childs that is 6-3/4x11 in. (plate size) and a print by Wilson that is 6-1/2x11-3/4 in. (plate size) and aquatint with drypoint, sanding, and scraping. Childs has drawn dance notations from her new production, Rel- ative Calm , recently performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, for which Wilson did the lighting and decor. Each of his prints projects a stage plan. Grants were not enough to cover production costs, so these benefit prints - ele- gant indeed - were priced to sell. Act quickly. Price: set of two $250.

Joe Goode, Untitled (1981), a series of seven lithographs in two parts with gunshot signed and numbered by the artist in editions of 30 each. Each diptych is 14-3/4x23-1/2 in. and was printed on handmade Twinrocker papers at Cirrus Editions in Los Angeles. Two sheets, each a different color, were printed with an all- over painterly pattern for each edition. These were then shot, ten at a time, by the artist with a beebee gun at a distance of some 30-40 ft. at his ranch in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. Created in the process are prints with a pleas- ing passive/aggressive ambivalence. The gun- shot patterns vary with each in the editions, as do the powder burns. Price: $450 each. Pub- lished by Cirrus Editions, Los Angeles. Michael Graves, Composite Landscape { 1981), a black and white etching signed and num- bered by the artist in an edition of 125 with 12 artist's proofs. Each print is 8-1/4x8-1/4 iñ. (plate size) and 20-3/4x15-3/4 in. (paper size) and was printed on mulberry paper chine collé on J. Barcham Green paper by Jane Kent with Sally Sturman in New York. Rendered is a spacey, fantasy view of Rome. Buildings of various shapes, not always so serious, straddle the hills and dot the valley. The noted architect did the print as a contribution to benefit the American Academy in Rome. He is a fellow. Price: $300. Published by the Society of Fel- lows of the American Academy in Rome. Dis- tributed by the Mezzanine Gallery, Metro- politan Museum of Art, New York. Andrew Hudson, Bill in Dark Glasses (1981), a 13 -color lithograph signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 25 with four artist's proofs. Each print is 35-1/2x57-3/4 in. and was printed on Rives BFK roll paper by David Adamson at Atlantic Editions in Richmond, 180</page><page sequence="2">Virginia. Bill in Dark Glasses is one of five prints in the Richmond Lithograph Series , each drawn di- rectly on the plate by the artist, who imported his favorite models Tom, Bill, and Marilyn to Richmond, along with various paintings, etc., from his studio to make himself feel at home. The spontaneity shows as he freely combines figures and objects and brushstrokes. Hudson has worked figuratively since the mid- '60s - "You could say I'm a precursor of the New Image, I suppose" - and with Marilyn for 11-1/2 years. "In another 3-1/2, I'll overtake Manet and Victorine." Obviously, his time has come. Price: $500. Published by the artist, Washington. Available in New York at Tibor de Nagy Gallery. Peter Huttinger, Not Playing with a Full Deck (1981), a three-part lithograph signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 20. Each print is 13-9/16x17-5/8 in. and was printed recto and verso on Arches paper at Prasada Press in Cincinnati. One side was then hand-colored. The cover is 19-3/8x14-1/4 in. and was printed on Rives BFK gray paper. Chicago funk, Cincinnati-style. Each sheet bears 11 playing cards, each face an eccentric sketch, Huttinger generally favoring such in- consistencies as anthropomorphic houses, soft daggers, male-females, etc. Appropriately enough, the print's cover bears the joker im- age. Big deal. Price: $225. Published by Pra- sada Press, Cincinnati. Shoichi Ida, Surface Is the Between - Paper Be- tween Raindrops and Water Stain (1981), a two- color lithograph signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 22. Each print is 30x22 in. and was printed on Mino Kozo Japanese paper chine collé on German Etching at Pra- sada Press in Cincinnati. Ten trial proofs were printed on Rives BFK gray newsprint. Ida continues to find new ways to print "in-be- tweens." Using a template, he burned two edges of the Kozo paper, which he then printed on the verso with water stains. A raindrop im- age was then printed on the recto of both sheets. More in-betweens from this interesting Japanese artist are to be expected, for he is cur- rently artist-in-residence at Prasada Press for one year. Price: $180. Published by Prasada Press, Cincinnati. Allen Jones, Impromptu (1981), a four-part lithograph signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 80. Each print is 44x80 in. and was printed on Arches velin paper by Ian Law- son in Herefordshire. The four parts add up to a clever view of a burlesque theater as seen from the stage, with a stripper's shadow, a prompter, and in the distance, the audience. The sheets are irregularly cut to make a special space for each. Jones plays it right with this one. Price: $1,200. Published by Waddington Graphics, London. Craig Kauffman, Untitled (1981), a litho- graph signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 45. Each print is 41x23 in. and was printed on Arches 88 paper at Cirrus Editions in Los Angeles. Kauffman pits energy vs. structure in this new print, which is a looser, more painterly image than earlier works, as well as more engaging. Shapes seem to swing from pivotal points in the composition; brushy color breaks out of linear boundaries. The Cal- ifornia artist's recent paintings show the same freedom. Price: $650. Published by Cirrus Editions, Los Angeles. Joyce Kozloff, San Francisco Victorian (1981), a 43-color spit-bite aquatint with hard ground, soft ground, and embossing signed and num- bered by the artist in an edition of 25 with ten artist's proofs. Each print is 23-3/8x31-7/8 in. and was printed on Somerset textured paper by Paul Singdahlsen and Marcia Bartholme at Crown Pont Press in Oakland. It's no surprise that working at Crown Point Press led Kozloff to do a print inspired by San Franciscan Vic- torian ornament. Unlike her earlier work with Islamic and Indian motifs, San Francisco Victor- ian is an open, airy pattern using seven distinc- tive shapes: stars, ovals, triangles, shells, cres- cents, daisies, and diamonds. A star is at cen- ter, and the other shapes radiate around it. These shapes come from cookie cutters Kozloff has used in her tilework, and each is filled in with pattern. The crescents and shells are tex- tured markings; the daisies and diamonds have linear motifs from Victorian ornaments; the 13 stars bear a different fruit or blossom, much like 19th-century lithos on seed packets; the daisies and stars are embossed. Some patterns can be seen from a distance, and others only close up. Kozloff has called herself "romantic," "old-fashioned," and "compul- sive." San Francisco Victorian makes these con- temporary virtues. Price: prepublication $1,200; publication $1,500. A handpainted frame is planned. Published by Crown Point Press, Oakland. Ronald Markham, Cityscape (1981), a litho- graph with collage signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 28 with three artist's proofs. Each print is 22x30-1/4 in. and was printed on Arches paper by David Keister and Christopher Laehy and cut and assembled by the artist and Pegram Harrison at Echo Press in Bloomington, Indiana. Cityscape was con- ceived as a collage, much as the artist's paint- ings are constructions of cut masonite. Build- ings, six airplanes, a road, etc., were printed on two sheets of paper, which were then cut and assembled in layers, with the buildings be- hind the road and the planes overhead. Pic- tured is the slightly wacky city Poe Poe in Muk- fa, a country Markham invented some 20 years ago and still finds amusing. It is. Price: $500. Published by Echo Press, Bloomington. Bruce Nauman, No and No - State (1981), two lithographs signed and numbered by the artist in editions of 25. Each print is 30x43 in. and was printed on Arches cover paper at Gemini G.E.L. in Los Angeles. The two states were printed with the same colors and the same plate and stone. In No the stone was printed first in black, followed by the plate in white. Any white over black created a blue gray tone. In No - State the order of printing was reversed, with the white plate followed by the black stone. The image in each is the word "no," of course, newly enlivened with much painterly dazzle. These are two of several recent edi- tions, the first Naumans released for some time. Price: $650 each. Published by Gemini G.E.L. , Los Angeles. Available in New York at Castelli Graphics. Jay Phillips, Serrano Suite (1981), a suite of five screenprints, diecut and folded, signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 44 with four to six artist's proofs. Each print is c. 37x40x3 in. and was screened in 15 or 16 David Salle, Until Photographs Could Be Taken from Earth Satellites , aquatint (29x41 in.), 1981.

Courtesy Waddington Graphics. screens on recto and verso of four-ply museum rag board by Gary Reams and Robert Knisel in Los Angeles. Individual titles are Bel Air Gate , Beverly , Hancock Park , Hollywood , and Melrose. Like Phillips' painted aluminum sculp- tures, each screenprint is a bold combination of stripes and painterly patterns cut and folded into eccentric shapes vaguely resembling a gate or vase with flowers. Printing occurs both recto and verso, and some elements repeat through the series. This is an original and ambitious project - the first prints for publisher Roy Boyd but not for Jay Phillips, who formerly worked at Gemini G.E.L. Price: suite of five $4,275 framed in plexiglass. Published by Roy Boyd Gallery, Chicago and Los Angeles. David Salle, Until Photographs Could Be Taken from Earth Satellites (1981), a portfolio of eight black and white aquatints signed and num- bered by the artist in an edition of ten with ten artist's proofs. Each print is 29x41 in. (bleed image) and was printed on Rives BFK paper by Brenda Złamany at Jeryl Parker Editions in New York. The original idea for Salle's first print project was "density," he explains. "Something very packed, with a lot of activity and a lot of overlapping, more than I'd tried in my painting." Various techniques were ex- plored at Jeryl Parker's, ending with Salle's drawing images - some new, some familiar - on one plate for each edition with a soft litho crayon. He would return to add images until à plate satisfied. Tests were not made along the way. When the editions were printed, the litho line acted as a resist, creating a negative image - a new, very handsome approach to an old technique. Salle now finds a greater degree of density in his paintings. Excellent prints. Price: portfolio $5,500. Published by Parasol Press, New York. Harriet Shorr, Cattleyas for Odette (1981), a 25-color aquatint signed and numbered by the ' artist in an edition of 85 with ten artist's proofs. Each print is 29-1/2x42 in. (bleed image) and was printed on Arches paper at K. Caraccio in New York. The print recreates the image of a recent painting, Shorr bringing lamp, flowers, etc. , to K. Carraccio's studio so she could draw directly on the steel plates and proof often. Printing on steel, rather than steel-faced cop- per, eased printing so many colors - an experi- ment for both artist and printer that worked. Price: $600. Published by Orion Editions, New York. Edward Steichen, Edward Steichen: The Early Years 1900-1927 (1981) a portfolio of 12 photo- gravures in an edition of 1,000 with 1000 artist's proofs. Each print is 16x20 in. in hori- zontal and vertical format, and the first 500 were printed on Rives BFK paper in Saint- Prex, Switzerland, from plates made by Jon Goodman in Millerton, New York. The sec- ond 500 will be printed on a different paper. Aperture contracted with Steichen in 1969 to reproduce a selection of the artist's images. This portfolio contains 12, among them The Flatiron (1905) and Moonrise (1904). These will not be stamped or signed but can be distin- guished from earlier prints in several ways: paper, size of image, and platemark. Three Pears and an Apple (c. 1921) and Heavy Roses (1914) were never printed as photogravures until now. Price: portfolio $1,250. Published by Aperture, Millerton. Pat Steir, Abstraction , Belief, Desire { 1981), an etching signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 35 with ten artist's proofs. Each print is 36x48-1/2 in. (plate size) and 42x61 in. (paper size) and was printed on Arches 88 roll paper by Hidejatsu Takada and Peter Petten- gill at Crown Point Press in Oakland. This is a print with a complicated image and, according to the artist, a complicated message. Three rectangular panels were printed on one sheet - "like chapters in a novel" - along with vari- ous of the artist's words and markings. In the first panel rows of triangles, squares, etc., rep- resent abstraction. In the second panel some geometric forms suggest three dimensions, and the space could either be a flat picture plane or deep space. The third panel introduces an illu- sion of space with perspective and various drawn images. Steir considers her art not ex- pressive but subjective, not personal but uni- versal in its allusions to art history - "in this print not so much with specific artists, but gen- erally with classical art: Michelangelo, Leo- nardo, Tintoretto, but also with Gaugin and Van Gogh." All this and more she explains in an interview with Kathan Brown available from Crown Point Press for $3. Price: $3,000. Published by Crown Point Press, Oakland. Paul Strand, Portfolio ///and /F(1976-77), two portfolios of ten photographs signed by the artist's wife Hazel Strand and stamped with the seal of the Paul Strand Foundation in an edition of 100 with ten artist's proofs. Each print was printed on silver gelatin paper by Richard Benson in Newport, Rhode Island. Sizes vary. The portfolios include such Strand classics as White Fence (1916), Blind Woman (1916), and The Family, Luzzara, Italy (1954). Price: portfolios $12,500 each. Published by Michael Hoffman in association with the Paul Strand Foundation, Millerton. Joe Tilson, Kore (1981), an etching with aquatint signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 50. Each print is 71-1/2x17 in. and was printed on handmade Italian Paper at Vigna Antoniniana (2 RC) in Rome. Price: $900. Proscinemi for Persephone (1981), an aqua- tint with collaged etchings signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 50. Each print is 26x38 in. (plate size) and 31-3/4x47-3/4 in. (paper size) and was printed at 107 Workshop, Wiltshire. Price: $500. Both prints reflect Tilson 's current fascination with proscinemi, the images left behind in sacred places by pilgrims to show their gratitude to the ( continued on page 187) Peter Huttinger, Not Playing with a Full Deck , litho- graph in three parts, 1981.

(continued from page 182) gods for a safe journey, an early form of graffiti practiced by the Greeks in Egypt. In Proscinemi for Persephone these images - including Persephone's apple, Plato's cube, and various magic numbers and symbols - are lined up in three rows. In Kore they form a vertical, very handsome ladder. Tilson writes, "These attest to the earlier views of the sacred nature of all life and certain places, rivers, streams, etc., in opposition to the Christian views of the dominance of man over woman, animals and nature that led to the desacralization of nature, the closing down of the oracles and the cutting down of the graves of Demeter, and is one of the factors that have led to the disastrous im- balance of today. But ... I don't want to leave you with the idea that I am an artist who has let his brains go to his head! In a way these notes are like the underlying structure of an iceberg whose tip curtains the meaning. The tip being the print. ..." Published by Waddington Graphics, London. Alan Turner, Tree Felled by Swirl I, II, III (1981), a series of three lithographs signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 45. Each print is 46-1/2x34 in. and was printed on Arches roll paper by Maurice Sanchez in New York. The three forrp an explicit narrative, ex- plains Turner. /shows the tree "in schematized form," its branches neatly straightened out. Nature enters in II, "throwing all out of kilter.'

Andy Warhol, Shoes (1980), a series of five screenprints with diamond dust signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 60 with ten artist's proofs.

Available in New York Castelli Graphics. Susan Weil, Siena (1981), a lithograph with screenprint signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 14 with one artist's proof. Each print is c. 45x30 in. and was printed on Rives BFK roll paper by Craig O'Brien at Styria Studio in New York. A black wash was printed on one side of the paper. Both sides were then screenprinted, graphite thrown by the artist through a wide open mesh screen on one side and various colored pigments on the other. The sheet was overprinted with a heavy coat of varnish. Finally, Weil crumpled the sheets while wet to create vertical wallpieces, each unique, that require no framing. The printing sequence she considers a metaphor for time, a theme central to her work; the variants within one format allude to the duality of simultane- ous chance and constancy, each work being further proof of "never the same/ the same always.' ' The works are handsome as well, and a series of four in brighter colors is planned. Price: $600. Published by Styria Studio, New York.</page></plain_text>
