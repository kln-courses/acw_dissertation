<plain_text><page sequence="1">9 Filleted Christianity and Fanatical Communism By Li am Brophy, Ph.B. COMMUNISM possesses one supreme twofold advantage : its structure and object are unmistakably clear. It has the stark simplicity of outline and the ruthless efficiency of a gibbet. Modern anthropocentric Humanism is rather like a jellyfish. Its translucent verge is ambiguously and charmingly vague. Nevertheless, it is there. Communism speaks, or rather shrieks, with one voice the world over whenever the workers thereof unite. Unlike the members of the countless Socialistic pink compromises they have pushed their theories to the common, recognisable rendezvous where all extremes meet. Rabid Red is Red from Russia to Peru, save to the abandoned sufferers from dialectic Daltonism. No two Humanists seem to be in accord on the nature and function of their theory of life. Modern Humanists have nothing like the Communist Manifesto, unless it Ibe Marins the Epicurean. The Communists have their way and rule of life laid down in Das Kapital, as interpreted by Lenin. The nearest approach to the Marxian masterpiece on the modern Humanistic plane is probably Matthew Arnold's Culture and Anarchy, which seems to have become a sign of contradiction among the intelligentsia. We cannot imagine the followers of the Humanistic More (Paul Elmer, not the sainted martyr Thomas) being rallied to a Brotherhood of the Beautiful to such widely accepted cries as : " Humanists of the World, unite. You have nothing to lose but your brains." We shall confine ourselves to the consideration of modern</page><page sequence="2">10 THE IRISH MONTHLY anthropocentric Humanism as distinct from Hellenistic Human ism, Renaissance Humanism and Christian, or Theocentrie Humanism. For, to anticipate a question, there is a Christian Humanism. It has been admirably portrayed by P?re Charmont, S.J., in his LJHumanisme et VHumain, by Jacques Maritain in his Humanisme Int?gral, by Gerald Vann, O.P., in his lucid and lyrical On Being Human, and by the Abb? Br?mond in Autour de VHumanisme. Even when we confine ourselves thus we find an amount of ambiguity. But, as Father Vann observes, we shall find three notions common to all forms of modern Humanism : the love of beauty in all its manifestations? the completion of the personality in all its powers in a unified coherence, and the enthronement of humanity over the earth. Modern anthropomorphic Humanism has more in common with Marxism, or what Maritain calls Socialist Humanism, than might at first sight appear. Communism has made it perfectly clear that it rejects the whole burden of Christianity. Humanism rejects the whole dogmatic framework of Christianity. Its aim is to preserve the emotions of Christianity without the belief, t&lt;? gather the heirlooms of the Christian centuries in art, music and literature, while denying the Real Presence for Whom such marvels were wrought in plinth and poem. Witness the interest shown by the litt?rateurs in Catholicism during the fin-de-si?cle period, and their determination to regard the Mass as a tableau set in " the comely order of the sanctuary " and not as a Drama of Divine immolation. Wilde and Dowson were drawn by Grace through the Gate Called Beautiful into the Temple of Truth and left us in De Profundis and Non Sum Qualis Eram the experience of souls which found that the merely human did not suffice, the tragic testaments of those who sought beauty out side the pulchritudo antiqua et tarn nova. Humanists would retain the aestheticism of Christianity without its asceticism, and</page><page sequence="3">CHRISTIANITY AND FANATICAL COMMUNISM 11 ?reject the Credo with its definite and binding dogmas, for the more accommodating Sentio. This filleted Christianity, no less than fanatical Communism, elaims to be a complete Weltanschauung, capable of replacing the Christian religion. " The future of poetry is immense, because in poetry, where it is worthy of its high destinies, our race, as time goes on, will find an ever surer and surer stay. There is not a creed which is not shaken, not an accredited dogma which is not shown to be questionable, not a received tradition which does not threaten to dissolve. Our religion has materialised itself in the supposed fact ; it has attached its emotions to the fact, and now the fact is failing it. But for poetry the idea is everything ;. the rest is a world of illusion, of divine illusion. Poetry attaches its emotion to the idea ; the idea is the fact. The strongest part of our religion to-day is its unconscious poetry." Thus Matthew Arnold in his essay The Study of Poetry. His plans and proposals for substituting poetry for dogma are explained at length in his Literature and Dogma, and modern Humanists were shown how art could be made to take the place of religion in the mission of guiding, healing, comforting and sanctifying mankind. It is doubtful if the attempt deceived even the Humanists themselves. Many religious-minded men tried Christianity and found it too difficult. They made retreats and, as they withdrew, the cult of the Crucified was slowly rejected in favour of the cult of L'art pour Vart. That is what happened in the case of Tolstoi, Gide and the more modern I. A. Richards, who loves to repeat Shelley's dictum that the basis of morality is laid, not by the preachers, but by the poets. Yet, it must be elear to all but the most fanatical of Humanists that men are not made good by refining their sense of aesthetic appreciation, but by submitting their intellects and wills to dogmatic imperatives, for which reason poetry can never take the place of dogma, nor</page><page sequence="4">12 THE IRISH MONTHLY gracefulness the place of Grace. Swinburne's Hymn of Man with its final line : " Glory to Man in the highest, for Man is the master of things," sounds suspiciously like the ranting in rhythms of a man who is trying to convince himself by the copious use of bravura and blasphemies. This typically Human ist poem is surely one of the most unconvincing in modern literature. Judged by Arnold's standard it is not poetry at alL The Humanist attempt to construct a " Christianity without tears "?and without Christ?was fascinating as far as it went, but it did not go into the highways and byways, among the halt and the maimed. Its beautifully ineffectual gospel never reached the proletariat. Communism, which aspires to be a world religion, addressed itself precisely to that part of humanity, by far the greater p|rt, which the Humanists despise. The cult of the Beautiful they would sweep the way of all bourgeois things. Works of art have no place in the labour theory of value. It is one of the many paradoxes of Communism that, while it claims to replace spirit by matter, matter somehow becomes transmuted to spirit itself in the fire of Bolshevik zeal, which becomes a religious faith. Berdyaev and Spinka have shown by their masterly analysis how surprisingly like Christianity is Communism?as like as a caricature. Communism challenges Christianity on its own ground and claims no less than it to be a world religion, demanding the allegiance of the whole man. It claims, like modern Humanism, to perfect the personality of the individual, and, like Humanism again, it adheres to the Pelagian principle that man alone, through himself alone, can attain to his own perfection. Nicholas Berydaev has shown in his keenly analytic book, The End of Our Time, how unsuspectedly the Pelagian Man haunts both extremes, and how pathetically he links them : " The Humanist view of life lost its freshness long ago ; it has fallen into decrepitude and can no longer rely on itself as it did</page><page sequence="5">CHRISTIANITY AND FANATICAL COMMUNISM 18 so movingly in its youth. Destructive contradictions have appeared in its heart, a morbid scepticism has sapped its energy. . . . The promises of Humanism have not been ful filled. Man is tired to death and is ready to rest in any kind of Collectivity that may come. Jacques Maritain in his VHumanisme int?grale and Religion and Culture has shown that Socialist Humanism is really part of the same Pelagian process as Humanism. The terror of the Trotskyites, such are the strange revolutions of history, was the final working out of the magnificence of the trecento. A morbid scepticism has indeed eaten the heart out of Humanism, and robbed it of its old ?lan. When we compare it with Communism we recall Yeats' lines : " The best lack all conviction, while the worst Are full of passionate intensity." Beside the flaring torch of Bolshevism the Humanism ardour seems like a cold phosphorescent glow. The Communists are enthused with a barbaric optimism in the right and strength of their cause which contrasts with what Pater refers to as " the inexhaustible discontent, languor, and home-sickness, that end less regret, the chords of which ring through all our modern (Humanist) literature. ' ' America has been the trying-ground and testing-place for countless political, economic, social and cultural experiments. It is there, more clearly than anywhere in the Old World, that we see the forces of Humanism and Communism confront each other. On the Humanist side there are men such as Paul Elmer More, Irving Babbitt and Van Wyck Brooks, who adhere to the traditional school of the New England Transcendentalists.</page><page sequence="6">14 THE IRISH MONTHLY They are men living in the stream of the European tradition, cherishing the heritage of Christian culture that has descended to them through their Puritan forefathers. On the opposing anti-traditionalist, Marxian side there are such men as Ernest Hemingway, Theodore Dreiser, Sinclair Lewis, Carl Sandburg, Sherwood Anderson and other " jazzy impressionalists ", whose very decarbonised prose, borrowed from Gertrude Stein, aims at obliterating all memory of the Christian tradition of our civil isation. But however softly the Humanists might sing of the lacrymae return9 these latter, as Van Wyck Brooks said, " turned literature into a sort of weeping wall from which nothing rose but the sound of lamentations and curses ". It is difficult to estimate the Christian content of American Humanism. Mr. T. S. Eliot, who became an Anglo-Catholic, dismisses Babbitt's Humanism as " a by-product of Protestant theology in its last agonies ". Mr. Babbitt himself has made the revealing state ment that : i6 The honest thinker, whatever his own preference, must begin by admitting that, though religion can get along without Humanism, Humanism cannot get along without religion." The attitude of the modern Humanists in America in face of Communism has been very clearly and fatalistically expressed by Joseph Wood Krutch in his book The Modern Temper. He points out that the decadent civilisations of the past were not saved by their philosophers, but by the influx of simpler peoples who had centuries yet to live ' ' before their minds should be ripe for despair ". The Roman intelligentsia, of whose number Pater's Marius was one, realised that the future of civilisation belonged to the barbarians of the north, " for the very reason that they were incapable of assimilating ancient thought ". Going by the Spengleresque cycle of cultures it then appears that the Russians are the new barbarians who are to inherit the</page><page sequence="7">CHRISTIANITY A?ND FANATICAL COMMUNISM 15 earth : " As a result of the conditions (of Russian backward ness) there has already developed in Russia a new philosophy of life which, in spite of the fact that it has taken a form influenced by modern industrial conditions, is easily recognisable as being essentially primitive in its simplicity. Sweeping aside the intel lectual problems of Europe, refusing even in its art to concern itself with the psychology of the individual soul, Communism assumes that nothing is really important except those things upon which the welfare of the race depends, and in assuming that it is assuming exactly what a primitive society always assumes. . . . Thanks to the fact that the perfect Communist is not aware of the existence of any problems more subtle than those involved in the production and distribution of wealth, he can throw himself into the business of living with a firm faith in the value of what he is doing. . . . Hence, to the good Com munist, as to the good tribesman, any question concerning the meaning of life is itself completely meaningless. . . . He has a sort of god, but his god is in reality what anthropologists call a culture-god ; merely, that is to say, the spirit which presides over and infuses itself with the germination of the seed, the ripening of the fruit, or the whirring of the machine." (The Modern Temper, Joseph Wood Krutch. Robert M. McBride and Co., New York.) And what, we may ask, is the answer of Humanism in face of this threat and challenge to its very existence? It is a mere fatalistic acquiescence to the inevitable, as confirmed as Catullus'?" The world may be rejuvenated in one way or another, but we will not. Scepticism has entered too deeply into our souls ever to be replaced by faith, and we can never forget the things which the new barbarians (Comr munists) will never need to have known. . . . Leaving the future to those who have faith in it . . . we may permit our selves to exclaim, a little rhetorically perhaps :</page><page sequence="8">16 THE IRISH MONTHLY ' Hail, horrors, hail, Infernal world. And thou profoundest hell, Receive thy new possessor.' " It is remarkable that Humanism and Communism derive their leading ideas from Christian inspiration. It is only when the Humanist idea of personal perfection and the Communist idea of " mutual aid " are regrafted on to the tree of the Christian religion that they will live and bear enduring fruit. Humanism has not fulfilled its promises. Communism may bring another Dark Age over the earth, but it has within it the seeds of its own death?the denial of the essential part of man and of his deepest need. In Catholicism the virtues of Humanism and Communism can be reconciled and completed, for she alone is the final rendezvous of all man's highest reveries, the marvellous ?omplexio oppositorum.</page></plain_text>
