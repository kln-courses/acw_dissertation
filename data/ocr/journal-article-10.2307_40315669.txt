<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEW DATA ON THE PRE-NEOLITHIC PERIOD OF THE ANGARA REGION* M. P. AKSENOV and G. I. MEDVEDEV (Translated by Roger Powers) In recent years work has been carried out on the study of the sites of the Pre-Neolithic period of the Angara region. In the present article the results of investigations at Verkholenskaia Gora ( 1963) and Krasnyi IAr ( 1964) are set forth. In the article a regional scheme is given which summarize the re- sults of the excavations carried out (Table 1). Archaeological finds from the quarry of Verkho- lenskaia Gora were already known in the first quarter of the 19th century (Gedenshtrom 1830). Beginning with this period fortuitous finds were occasionally turned in at Irkutsk by quarry workers. Certain finds fell into the hands of members of the East Siberian Section of the Russian Geographical Society. Thus, in 1874 a representation of a fish made from talc from the Verkholenskaia quarries was submitted to N. I. Vitkovskii ( 1889). In 1893 M. P. Ovchinnikov discovered a site receiving the designation "Verkholenskaia Gora" in the region of the quarry of Zharnokovaia Ravine. Down to 1919 he visited the site several times and collected a vast collection from the surface of a field, the large part of which is preserved in the Irkutsk Re- gional Museum/'1' From 1919 to 1928 investigation of the Verkho- lenskaia site was carried out by Irkutsk State University under the direction of Professor B. E. Petri. As a result of the systematic excavations considerable factual material was collected. Part of the archaeological material was published by B. E. Petri in a series of articles. On the basis of the comparison with the West European classifica- tion scheme the age of the site was preliminarily determined as Late Palaeolithic (Petri 1921, 1922a and b, 1923, 1926, 1927, 1928). The material was not divided stratigraphically and was considered Translated from Izvestiia Vostochno-Sibir- skogo Otdela Geo grafiche sko go Obshchestva SSSR, Tom 65, pp. 153-165.

At this time the dating remained as before (Sosnovskii 1934). In the archaeological literature Verkholenskaia Gora was included in the interpretation of Petri and Sosnovskii as a stratified site (Sosnovskii 1934) of the Late Palaeolithic ("a late stage of the Magda- lenian," see Petri 1926). From 1928 to 1959 Verkholen- skaia Gora was sporadically studied by various ar- chaeologists. The majority of them limited them- selves to collecting surface material, scattered testing and superficial examination (Gerasimov, Debets, Podgorbunskii, Rudenko, Khoroshikh, and Polesskikh). Materials of B. E. Petri and of subsequent in- vestigations were not completely published in this period, and all ideas about Verkholenskaia Gora were formulated on the basis of previous summaries by Petri and Sosnovskii. In 1959, in connection with large scale studies on the stratified settlement of Ust'Belaia, there arose the acute necessity of connecting the ma- terials of the latter with the complex of Verkholen- skaia Gora. An area of the site was subjected to exploratory excavations situated somewhat higher on the slope than the excavations of B. E. Petri. A comparison of the results obtained with Petri1 s material gave a basis for considering the site as Mesolithic and containing a single component. As before, Verkholenskaia Gora was united in one group with "Badai" sites and Ust'-Belaia. The problem of the chronological and cultural subdivision within this group had not appeared. It became possible to continue the excavations begun in 1959 only in 1963. At this time there were accumulated new ma- terials from sites of the Pre-Neolithic period in the Angara Valley, in light of which the data obtained in 1959 became clearly inadequate for the determination of the status of the culture of Verkholenskaia Gora in the Stone Age of the Cis-Baikal. Excavations in 1963 were continued down slope 213 Arctic Anthropology V-l, 1968</page><page sequence="2">214 Arctic Anthropology V-l Table 1.

E. Petri's excavations. Two Mesolithic cul- tural horizons were established. Horizon I lay at a depth of 20 cm. under the level of the old plow zone in a loam rich in humic content. Thickness of this horizon is on the average of 3 0 cm. with insig- nificant fluctuations from side to side. Horizon II lay in a yellowish brown loam in a strongly cal- cified place. The thickness of this horizon varied from 20 to 170 cm. This is explained by the fact that the deposits of this horizon fill ancient frost cracks. In the period of the initial occupation by man at Verkholenskaia Gora the process of leveling the ruptured surface of the slope was not conclu- sively completed. As a result, the nature of the deposition of the finds of this horizon accurately document the strongly irregular relief of the ancient surface. Several small cracks with remains that had found their way to a depth of up to 80 cm. were fixed in 1959. On the basis of this the conclusion was drawn that the site contained a single component (Medvedev 1961). In the process of excavation in 1963 it was made clear that the problem of the cracks had more essential significance for char- acterizing the site than had occurred earlier. The initial settlers of Verkholenskaia Gora rationally utilized the ancient microrelief. The huge cracks which cut up the slope of the ravine were not simply places of accumulation of fill of cultural remains but were inhabited just as the remaining part of the site. A rich complex of cultural remains was dis- covered in the crack excavated in 1963 in the vicinity of two hearths situated in its wider portions. At the time of the formation of the deposits of the upper cultural horizon the leveling of the surface of the site by slope wash was basically completed, and hence the peculiarity of the ancient relief was already no longer dictating the character of the settlement. The question of the stratified nature of the site cannot be decided at the present moment in all full- ness and it demands the carrying out of further investigation. At any rate, the picture of the cul- tural stratigraphy on Verkholenskaia Gora is no less complicated than in Ust'Belaia, even more so in that there is not a clear division into horizons which are insured by deposits of flood plain alluvium. The existing data attest to the division of the whole deposit of cultural remains into two geneti- cally related complexes of differing age. Further- more, there is no sharp typological diversity be- tween the inventories of horizons I and II. The difference is noted on the whole in the plan of the quantitative proportions of the different forms of tools. For example, in horizon I lateral burins of the Verkholenskaia type (Fig. 1, Nos. 5-10; Fig. 3, Nos. 1-4, 7-9) comprise a little more than 3% of all tools, while in the lower horizon their share comes to about 10%. Skreblos (Fig. 1, No. 19; Fig. 3, No. 18) are more numerous in horizon II (Horizon I, 0.4%; II, 5%); prismatic blades predominate in horizon I (70%:46%); the ratio of cores by horizon is almost equal, 10.5% in horizon I and 11.2% in horizon II. In the first horizon the predominant part of the cores (Fig. 2, Nos. 14-15, 18-21, 23) are better defined and are morphologically more distinguishable than in the lower horizon; 8% as opposed to 11.2% fall into the amorphous type and blanks. Blades and flakes with end retouch and antler harpoons (Fig. 5) were found only in horizon II, but ornaments made from agamatolite (Fig. 1, Nos. 2-3), perforators, knives made on prismatic blades, and conical and prismatic cores are only found in horizon I. A sharp difference is observable in the character of the dis- tribution of finds by area in the levels. Whereas in horizon I finds are rather evenly scattered over all areas and do not form any sort of complex which shows as a consequence of a considerable displace- ment of the finds from their original location down on the slope of the ravine, now, as indicated above, the large part of the finds of level two are concen- trated near a hearth. The objects in this horizon, found at the bottom of a crack, were subjected to an insignificant mixture in this horizon. In the process of denudation these objects were carried down, covered the synchronous remains at the bottom of the crack, and in their turn were buried by the sub- sequent deposits. The process of filling the crack, epigenetic by relationship to the time of the forma- tion of cultural horizon II, evidently proceeded at a rapid rate. By this is explained the good preserva- tion of the cultural finds of the level. All of the bone tools and the vast majority of the faunal re- mains from Verkholenskaia Gora were recorded in horizon II. In 1963, all of the rather unidentifiable bones were discovered in horizon I. In the faunal collection from level II there were identified horse, auroch, moose, roe deer, red deer, fish: sturgeon, taimen* * pike, perch;1 and birds. The fauna is char- acteristic for sites of the Early Mesolithic of the Angara Valley. Such representatives of Upper Palaeo- lithic fauna as mammoth and rhinoceros are com- pletely absent. However, horse, bison and reindeer still remain objects of .the hunt, but there are also representatives of the new forest fauna; roe cleer and moose. In the general character of the inventory, the stratigraphic position and palaeontological data, horizon II of Verkholenskaia Gora chronologically corresponds to horizons XIV to XV of Ust'Belaia, *A fish of the Salmon family abounding in the rivers of Siberia. - Tr. ^chtyo fauna identified by reader A.

However, one must note that the cultural complex of the Verkholen- skaia site differs from the above group of sites and has far more traits in common with sites of the Trans-Baikal (Oshurkovo) (Okladnikov 1959). On this basis, the culture of Verkholenskaia Gora is different and independent; its roots are linked with the Trans -Baikal culture area, and it represents its western branch. On the whole, horizon I of Verkholenskaia Gora is analogous with the consolidated horizon of Ust1- Belaia and Lenkovka and is synchronized with them. In the summer of 1964 new data on the Palaeo- lithic site of Krasnyi IAr were obtained. The site was discovered in 19 57 by A. P. Oklad- nikov and investigated in 19 57 and 1959 by a section of the Bratsk Archaeological Expedition of the Len- ingrad Section of the Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR under the direction of Z. A. Abramova. The results of the investigation were put together in the article "Krasnyi IAr: A New Palaeolithic Site on the Angara" (Abramova 1965). During the excavations of 19 57 and 19 59, a formation of diluvial deposits of the 16 to ZO m. terrace of the Angara was opened up to a depth of 3.23 m. Three cultural horizons were recorded at a depth of 2.60 m. to 3.23 m. In the opinion of Z. A. Abramova these horizons, which are not far apart from one another in time, reflect the subsequent evolution of the local Palaeo- lithic culture of Mal'ta and Buref. From this, the author notes analogies of Krasnyi IAr in the com- plexes of the Yenisei sites Afontova Gora II and III (Abramova 1965). During the excavation of the site in 1964 by the expedition of Irkutsk State University, the old- est cultural horizon was discovered in a deep erosion cut formed by running water parallel to the old excavation. The exploratory excavation (45 square meters) situated in the side of a ravine enabled us to elu- cidate the stratigraphic relationship of the dis- covered horizon with the early well known and distinctive cultural complex discovered in it. The cultural remains lie at a depth of 4.10 m. from the surface and are separated from the upper series of cultural deposits by a sterile layer with a thickness of 0.7 to 1.0 m. consisting of sandy loams with fine fragmented bands of loam. The remains of a semi-circular hearth lined with slabs of local slate were discovered in the center of the opened area. The main mass of the inventory is concentrated within a radius of two meters of the fire pit. The complex of remains of human activity in this horizon includes within its crude quartzite pebble-like cores, big pebble flakes, wedge-shaped microcores made from dark flint, lateral and medial burins made on prismatic blades of argolite, micro- blades and scaley flakes (cheshuichatyi) of chal- cedony, skreblo-like quartzite tools, a chopper made from a quartzite pebble, chopping tools of subrec- tangular form, a knife made on a big regular prismatic blade, and unidentifiable bone tools (awl?, blank for a neddle?)(Fig. 6). The fauna is represented by rhinoceros, bison, reindeer and arctic fox ( ?). As a result of the exca- vation, data were secured which supplement the geo- logical characteristics of the cultural deposits and render their dating more precise. The cultural re- mains were contained in a thick 7 meter formation of diluvial deposits which included in the stratigraphy a series of layers of a brown loam formation which was strongly ferriferous in the lower part and closely distinguished against the background of monotonous sandy loam. At present it is difficult to firmly distinguish separate horizons of cultural deposits corresponding to the two generations of loams: horizons I through III distinguished by Z. A. Abramova are joined to the third series of loams from the top, horizon IV, to the fourth. Moreover, a few scattered finds of whole and split bones of mammals were recorded in the fifth series of loams at 0.80 m. below the fourth cultural horizon. It is entirely possible that below horizon IV in the lower diluvial strata older cultural deposits could be discovered. A similar situation is possible for the upper deposits. Flint tools with the com- plete absence of pottery were found at the base of the modern soil. These very late finds could subse- quently be linked with transitional complexes with horizons I through III. The Pleistocene age of horizons I through III evokes no doubt already by their position in the lower parts of the diluvium of the second terrace of the Angara. In addition, sharply expressed phenomena clearly of cryogenetic character were fixed in the section. These frost cracks probably have to do with two generations of successive glaciation which occurred on one occasion only in the lower (IV) cultural hori- zon, not embracing the upper, and on another occa- sion they disturbed all of the cultural deposits. Thus, in accordance with new data on the Anthropogene (Quaternary) of Siberia (Ravskii and Tseitlin 1965), the examined cultural horizons can be attributed on the whole, by geological age, to the first half of the Sartan glaciation. The archaeo- logical age of the cultural deposits of Krasnyi IAr can be dated to the Late Palaeolithic. To speak about genetic connections of horizon IV with the culture of Mal'ta and Buret1 is without any basis whatsoever. Rather, available material attest to the</page><page sequence="7">Aksenov &amp; Medvedev: Pre-Neolithic Period of the Angara Region 219 CQ ! &lt;D S co t- i I O S O &lt;o •iH fO M Ui 0) 0) i Pu, I S 2 CO i- i t- t I O a (6 S o 2</page><page sequence="8">220 Arctic Anthropology V-l CO "3 2 I t- i I O (6 ü M co 'o x: CD LO i Uh tó 8 4-* 2 CO á (O s i Uh</page><page sequence="9">Aksenov &amp; Medvedev: Pre-Neolithic Period of the Angara Region 221 differences and can point either to the existence of a large chronological gap between these complexes or to a different ance story for the culture of Krasnyi IAr. There is still less of a basis to link the origin of horizons I through III with the Mal'ta stage. The blade technique, on the basis of which Z. A. Abram- ova related the cultures of Krasnyi IAr and Mal'ta, has much more in common with techniques of the Mesolithic complexes of the Angara region. About this attests such groups of the inventory as gobi, wedge-shaped and microcores, artifacts made from small prismatic blades, skreblos, and also the en- tirely different type of settlement. In contrast to the semi-subterranean dwellings of the Mal'ta- Buret' type, here one can suppose the presence of light above ground structures. The material summarized enables us to specify and supplement the regional scheme of the periodi- zation of the Pre-Neolithic period of the Angara region proposed by us in 1963 (Medvedev and Aksenov 1963). All existing materials on the ar- chaeology, geology and palaeontology in the region under consideration were utilized at the time in completing the new scheme (Table 1). The oldest archaeological site in the territory of the Cis-Baikal is illustrated by finds of N. I. Sokolov and N. V. Tiumentsev (1949) in Malyi Kot ravine. The location was very poorly investigated. The complete absence of archaeological data for the considerable chronological gap between Malyi Kot and the Mal'ta-Buret' Palaeolithic does not at present allow the inclusion of the site in the scheme. As before, the oldest and documented is illus- trated by the Palaeolithic complex of Mal'ta and Buret1. Problems of the geology of both sites are not finely solved. Available absolute dates on bone from the Mal'ta site are conflicting and not one of them can be accepted at present. Nevertheless, the attributing of Mal'ta and Buret' to the time of the Zyrianka Glaciation apparently evokes no doubts among geologists (Ravskii et al. 1964; Logachev et al. 1964). . The distinctive aspect of the cultural complex of these sites leaves no doubt in their antiquity with respect to the remaining sites of the Angara region (Gerasimov 1931, 1935, 1958, I960, 1961). In the ancient history of the region Mal'ta and Buret1 comprise a separate, completely distinct cultural-chronological stage which has not been connected up to now by transitional links with the following stages of the evolution of culture. Ten- tatively, to this stage one can attribute the Military Hospital site (Irkutsk), the information about which is extremely scanty (Cherskii 1872; Petri 1928; Arembovskii 1958). The following stage could conditionally be called Ust'Osinsk after its most studied site of Krasnyi IAr, situated near the mouth of the Osa River, a right tributary of the Angara. Besides the site of Krasnyi IAr, we also assign to this stage the locations of Buret' II and Shamotnyi Zavod (the lower level of Badai; Logachev et al. 1964) which are weakly studied but geologically do not exceed the limits of the stage. We must consider as earliest in this group hori- zon IV of Krasnyi IAr, geologically dated to the end of the Karginsk Interglacial or the beginning of the Sartan. On the basis of palaeontological and geo- logical data of synchronous horizon IV of Krasnyi IAr, one can consider the site of Kaiskaia Gora. The Ust' Osinsk stage is completed by the com- plex of horizons I through III of Krasnyi IAr. Geo- logically it can be placed in the middle sub-horizon of the Sartan. Archaeologically it represents the transition link from the Palaeolithic of the Angara to the Mesolithic. In the Ust'Osinsk stage there oc- curred a change within the hunting economy of the Palaeolithic linked with a general change in the natural conditions at the end of the Pleistocene. The conclusion of this process is visible in Mesolithic time. The Mesolithic of the Angara re- gion is subdivided into two periods which include three cultural-chronological stages. The Early Mesolithic period, named on the basis of the Badai-Verkholenskaia sites, includes the fol- lowing group of sites: Fediaevo, Cheremushnik, Shamotnyi Zavod (Badai), upper level, the upper complex of Mal'ta, Ust' Belaia (Horizons XI through XV) and Verkholenskaia Gora, horizon II. The geo- logical age of these sites is determined as the end of the Sartan to the beginning of the Holocene. A transition is visible in the economy from the hunting of herd animals of the open spaces to taiga hunting and fishing. The appearance of the domesti- cated dog (Verkholenskaia Gora and Ust' Belaia) and the bow and arrow occurred for the first time. The group of these sites occur in two regional com- plexes, Badai and Verkholenskaia, reflecting a change of the cultural-ethnic order. The problems about the roots of this phenomenon demand supple- mentary work. The Verkholenskaia culture has many similarities with the cultures of the Trans-Baikal sites. The Badai complex evidently reflects the genesis of a local culture. The Late Mesolithic is divided into the Ust1 Belaia and Khina stages, in which the latter is dis- tinguished on stratigraphic grounds. Geologically this period is placed completely in the Holocene. The final transition to taiga hunting is noted in the economy. Fishing stands out as an independent im- portant economic branch with a specialized inventory. The development of active interaction is observed in the complexes of sites which reflects the estab- lishment of close interrelated links between the various tribal groups.</page><page sequence="10">2 22 Arctic Anthropology V-l The Khina stage concludes the Pre-Neolithic period in the archaeology of the Angara region.
