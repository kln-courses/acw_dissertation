<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE GENESIS OF STAR ALAKER 25 Patrick A. McCarthy The Genesis of Star Maker Olaf Stapledon's Star Maker (1937), a cosmic epic that combines bewildering magnitudes with precise and arresting details, remains one of the enduring classics of science fiction. Stapledon worked steadily on the novel over four years, struggling first with its bold and unconventional metaphysical specula- tions and then with its narrative shape. In a very real sense, however, Star Maker had been on his mind, in one form or another, for more than two decades prior to its publication. The process by which Stapledon slowly conceived, drafted, and revised the novel until it satisfied him is my subject. The extant evidence of this process consists of 1) early letters and poems that introduce themes to which Stapledon would return in the novel; 2) his first extended development of a cosmic narrative in a book manuscript originally called "In a Glass Darkly," a title later changed to "The Sleeping Beauty"; 3) an early partial draft of Star Maker, later published as Nebula Maker; 4) notes for subsequent revision of the novel; and 5) the holograph manuscript and corrected page proofs. The first two of these components overlap chronologi- cally; otherwise, however, the history that I trace reveals a pattern of growth and development as Stapledon first conceived a number of crucial ideas and then sought a form to accommodate them. Rather than describe in detail each part of this fairly complex process, I plan to demonstrate in broad terms how Star Maker grew in Stapledon's imagination. All notes and unpublished works cited are housed in the Stapledon Archive, part of Special Collections and Archives at the Sydney Jones Library, University of Liverpool. Apart from letters and other papers, mainly of a personal nature, still held by the Stapledon family, the Archive is the main repository for Stapledon's correspondence, manuscripts, notebooks, lecture notes, scrapbooks, and other primary sources. As such, it is an indispensable resource for anyone conducting research on Stapledon's science fiction. 1 1. Thematic Precursors. Star Maker begins with its unnamed (but clearly autobiographical) narrator sitting outside at night after quarreling with his wife. His sense of the "futility" and "unreality" of his marriage, combined with anxiety over the "sick world" of the 1930s (I.1. 1-2),2 leads him to wonder what meaning their lives might have in relation to the cosmos. Unexpectedly, his vision alters, the familiar setting recedes, and he finds himself in a disembodied state, mentally travelling through space at a tremendous rate of speed. Soon he is in an unfamiliar part of the galaxy where he visits the first of many alien worlds, a planet that he calls the Other Earth because of its basic similarity to our world. Later worlds prove far more alien, but the narrator is able to comprehend them because his mind has expanded through its linkage to the minds of cosmic explorers from elsewhere in the universe. Together they form</page><page sequence="2">26 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 31 (2004) a "cosmic mind" that envisions the creative force behind the universe, which the narrator calls the Star Maker. Finally, the cosmic voyager finds himself back on Earth. Only a fraction of a second has passed since he left, it seems to him, trillions of years earlier, but he has gained the perspective he needs to balance worship of the stars with devotion to human life. In some respects, Star Maker is less a novel than a visionary poem or philosophical fiction: despite some brilliant narrative effects, for example, it does not develop character and plot in the usual senses of those terms. (It is typical of Stapledon's method that only one individual character in the novel, an alien named Bvalltu, is given a name.) Stapledon's emphasis on metaphysics rather than on conventional narrative reflects the fact that long before he began writing science fiction he imagined for himself a career as a poet and philoso- pher. Thus it is significant that his poetic and philosophical writings reflect many of the same concerns as the novel. Stapledon's early writings include a book of poems published in 1914 as Latter-Day Psalms, a title intended to suggest that he was working in the prophetic mode of Thomas Carlyle's Latter-Day Pamphlets (1850). Robert Crossley has noted several connections between Star Maker and Latter-Day Psalms: for example, "The City," the opening poem, "looks forward to the finer-tuned agnostic questioning of the 1937 theological romance Star Maker," and the settings of "Spirit," "Omnipotence," and "The Heavens Declare," whose speaker sits "on a hillside contemplating the distant, icy stars with the teeming populace of the city spread out beneath him," resemble the narrative setting of Star Maker (Crossley 114). Several of the poems also address the fundamental question of Star Maker: is the universe the creation of a fundamen- tally just and loving God, or do human values have any cosmic meaning at all? In "Who Art Thou?", for example, the speaker, with the same mixture of agnosticism and piety as the novel's narrator, says to God, "Thou art beautiful, and abhorrest that which is vile. Who art thou that hast made thyself beautiful out of the sorrow of men?" (6). Likewise the poem "God," as I have noted elsewhere, entertains two possibilities that are especially relevant to StarMaker: that the spirit may survive the death of the physical universe and that ours might be only one of a long series of universes (McCarthy 19). Underlying the whole collection is the narrator's alternation between social involvement and ecstatic detachment from human concerns. Stapledon's attempt to reconcile these two attitudes in Star Maker will culminate in the narrator's final affirmation that when viewed in "the cold light of the stars, symbol of the hypercosmical reality, with its crystal ecstasy ... the human crisis does not lose but gains significance" (XVI.333-34). In Latter-Day Psalms the first two poems set up this alternation between involvement and detachment: "The City" angrily condemns God for doing nothing to alleviate the stifling conditions of slum life, but "Spirit" turns to the heavens, where the speaker fimds peace and beauty. An attempt to reconcile human suffering with divine perfection also appears in "Humanity," whose speaker is addressed by "the Soul of All Men." In this poem, the Soul's yearning to "make [itselfl perfect ... beautiful in the eyes of God" leads to a vision in which the Soul "will stand before [God] joyful as a</page><page sequence="3">THE GENESIS OF STAR AL1KER 27 bride [and] be for him a bride or a sacrifice according to his will" (8). The Soul of All Men is an early draft of another evolving spirit, the cosmic spirit in Star Maker, whose perfected form Stapledon imagines as "the Church Cosmical, fit at last to be the bride of God." Unlike "Humanity," however, Star Maker immediately challenges this relatively comforting vision as the narrator recognizes that "the Star Maker had made me not to be his bride, nor yet his treasured child, but for some other end" (XIII.3.288). As in this instance, Stapledon's themes typically become more complex and ironic when they resurface in Star Maker. Written in the early days of World War I, the last two poems of Latter-Day Psalms, "War" and "Peace," express different ways of regarding the conflict. "War" explores the perverse religious feeling in each side's belief that it is carrying out God's will against a Satanic enemy; "Peace," on the other hand, imagines a possible future of human unity. Stapledon's letters of the time indicate his own deeply divided feelings about the war. On December 1, 1914, writing to his Australian cousin Agnes Miller (whom he would marry in 1919), he described his "miserable state of doubt and vacillation" about whether or not to join what was then an all-volunteer army, and on December 16 he wrote, "Oh I am sick of all this mess we are making. But there's collective responsibil- ity &amp; the burden must be shared, &amp; the sacrifice.... The world might be noble surely in these days after so long experience. But we bicker &amp; fight and slander our enemies, and are altogether like monkeys" (65, 66).? He soon attempted to reconcile these conflicting sentiments by joining the Friends' Ambulance Unit, organized by the Society of Friends (Quakers). Stationed in France and Belgium during the war, Stapledon wrote long letters to Agnes that combined courtship with speculation on any number of subjects, including ideas to which he would return in Star Maker. A year before the onset of hostilities, Stapledon was already writing to Agnes that "the spirit of the [human] race, as a being in itself, [will live] on" after the end of the world, and that the "soul" of the human race might be eternal (August 17, 1913 [19]). Some months later he confessed to "always vainly speculating as to the life that may be on Mars and elsewhere, and in other systems," adding, "if there is intelligence in other worlds how different must it be from ours, not merely greater or less, but utterly different and incompre- hensible" (March 1, 1914 [32]).4 Again and again ideas familiar to the reader of Star Maker surface, in one form or another, in letters to Agnes: an account of how a lettuce might feel when it is uprooted (July 5, 1915 [89-90]) is clearly the product of a mind that could imagine alien Plant Men (Star Maker VII.3),5 and speculation on "what it would be like if one could really enter into the mind and being of another person" (October 12, 1917 [251]) sets up an idea Stapledon would develop in Star Maker and elsewhere. One letter (September 16, 1915 [100-102]) anticipates not only some of Star Maker's themes but its narrative form as well. In the letter Stapledon says that while sleeping outside under the bright stars he dreamed that Agnes called to him and held out her hands. Together, they soared through space until he kissed her. Then everything changed: they were able to enter directly into the minds</page><page sequence="4">28 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 31 (2004) of every sentient creature in the universe and to say of each, "It is I." This vision of oneness with all beings was the result of their kiss, which removed them from human strife. Nonetheless, things changed again-and again: first they became "a real flesh and blood couple up there in the skies" (102), happy in their love, and then time itself was transformed so that the present incorpo- rated both the past and the future. At last he saw "the Truth"; but awakening alone in his sleeping bag, he was unable to tell her what truth he had perceived in his dream. This dream vision is a highly romantic version of Star Maker's more austere narrative. Whereas in the letter Stapledon soars through space with Agnes, in the novel he leaves her behind, finding company with Bvalltu and other alien minds before finally returning to earth at the end. It is true that in Star Maker the narrator's marriage, clearly based on the union of Olaf and Agnes Stapledon, becomes a model of the symbiosis that he seeks throughout the cosmos, but it is also clear that in order to understand this human relationship he must separate himself from it-that human values must be tested against "the cold light of the stars" (XVI.333). Perhaps more important than these differences, however, is the way both the letter and the novel involve a transformation of time and culminate in the narrator's inability to describe his experience. The dream's incorporation of the past and future into the present anticipates the last of the three time scales that Stapledon eventually appended to Star Maker, a circular version of eternal time in which all times are always present. In Star Maker, too, the narrator will say that he cannot clearly recall what he experienced on his cosmic voyage, and that in any event human language is insufficient to express his high vision except through anthropomor- phic metaphors that inevitably distort the nature of the experience. During the 1920s, Stapledon, hoping to embark on a career as an academic philosopher, received his PhD in Philosophy at the University of Liverpool (1925) and published A Modern Theory of Ethics (1929), his first book since Latter-Day Psalms. At the same time he continued to write poems that often included metaphysical and/or astronomical speculations. His 1924 poem "Ad Astra" balances the hope "that love must be all" against the bleak recognition that "the stars toil/ toward the dark goal/ of God's art" (264), a perspective that foreshadows the depiction of the Star Maker as a rather detached cosmic artist.6 "Star Worship" (1926) begins by setting human and cosmic perspectives against one another: "After the stage-play 'Man'-the glass wherein Ego admires herself-see the stars!/ Aloof, exact, sexless, most unhuman-therefore most worshipful." And in the late 1920s, inspired at least in part by a 1926 paper, "Recent Developments of Cosmical Physics," by James Jeans, Stapledon began writing a series of poems speculating on what Crossley calls "the philosophical implications of the inhuman distances between us and the stars, the vast disproportion between human and cosmic interests" (177). The poems in the sequence, which Stapledon initially called "Astronomical Posters," often introduce themes to which he would return in Star Maker. For example, of the three "astronomical" poems printed in An Olaf Stapledon Reader (304-06), Poem 2 derides the childish idea that we are important to the</page><page sequence="5">THE GENESIS OF STAR MAKER 29 stars, Poem 15 imagines humanity's possible encounter with a far more intelligent species, and Poem 17 treats mankind as such a small part of the universe that our entire history might pass unnoticed by God. (In Star Maker that history is summarized in a paragraph.) Other poems take up such subjects as the brevity of our existence (Poems 3 and 6), the rareness and fragility of intelligence throughout the universe (Poem 4), and the dual possibilities that mankind might be the germ of the cosmic egg (Poem 9) or that God may destroy the cosmic egg (Poem 10). In Poem 7 we have a preview of Star Maker's portrayal of stars as intelligent beings who come to regard planetary life as a disease (in the poem, the sun destroys the Earth in an effort to eradicate the pestilence of humanity); Poem 16, which speculates that God may be regarded as a cosmic artist, foreshadows the characterization of the Star Maker in similar terms. Even minor details, like the idea that planets are formed by the near encounter of stars (Poem 5), prove intriguing when they resurface in Star Maker, whose narrator remarks, "I knew well that the birth of planets was due to the close approach of two or more stars, and that such accidents must be very uncommon" (II.22).7 The major difference between these early soundings of Stapledon's themes and their later forms is that, in "Astronomical Posters" they are discrete speculations on such subjects as alien life and intelligence, whereas in Star Maker they are woven into a narrative that contextualizes them and allows the themes to resonate against one another. 2. "The Sleeping Beauty." Stapledon's poems and letters provide us with evidence of his recurrent concern with the themes of Star Maker over a period of two decades before he turned to fiction, but apart from the letter to Agnes about his dream of a cosmic journey they do not develop a narrative. Still, Crossley astutely notes that they form part of "a visionary myth, growing in [Stapledon's] mind, of the human place within the inhuman reaches of space and time" (Crossley 179). Stapledon abandoned "Astronomical Posters" and wrote on the manuscript a note that summed up his judgment of the project as a failure. The problem, Crossley observes, lay in the form, not the ideas, and the solution lay in the invention of "a genre that combined features of the chronicle- history, the satirical voyage, the scientific romance, and the philosophical conte" -the genre of Last and First Men and Star Maker (Crossley 180). Yet by this time Stapledon had already written several drafts of another such mixed- genre book, a manuscript that he began before World War I as "In a Glass Darkly," revised as "The Sleeping Beauty," and abandoned in the early 1920s. Apart from an early draft, the book survives only as a partial carbon typescript (missing title page, table of contents, and the first two chapters) in the Stapledon Archive. The alternate titles of the book point in different ways to Stapledon's characteristic theme of spiritual and mental "awakening." The first title alludes to St. Paul's distinction between this world, in which "we see through a glass, darkly," and heaven, where we will see truth directly, "face to face" (1 Corinthians 13:12). Another sort of awakening into a higher state of awareness is suggested by the story of Sleeping Beauty, who in Stapledon's myth</page><page sequence="6">30 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 31 (2004) represents humanity, the incipiently waking race of his 1934 polemical volume Waking World. Stapledon uses the same metaphor of "racial awakening" in his first two novels, Last and First Men (1930) and Last Men in London (1932), but in Star Maker, with its vastly greater magnitudes, it is the "cosmic mind" rather than simply the human race that awakens. Like Star Maker, "The Sleeping Beauty" builds toward the expression of a myth or vision of the spirit's true relationship to its creator. The structure may be seen in the following list of chapters in the extant portion of the manuscript: Chapter III: Mind Chapter IV: Action Chapter V: Beauty Chapter VI: Love Chapter VII: Community Chapter VIII: The World at Its Worst Chapter IX: Symbols Chapter X: Service Chapter XI: A Myth of God and Spirit Appendix Each chapter takes up a subject concerned with the understanding and development of spirit; most chapters end with a poem related to the preceding exposition. In chapter IX, "Symbols," Stapledon introduces the Sleeping Beauty as a figure for "the Soul of All. For she is the winged spirit that shall waken out of the cosmic egg" (SA D1. 19.7, 14). In the following section he develops this idea into the myth of a sleeping spirit that can be awakened only through the "kiss" of an unseen prince who may be identified with "Circumstance, or Fate, or God" (16).8 The awakened spirit will see her unseen creator, yet this event, although in the distant future, is not the ultimate goal of spirit: rather, there will be further goals, incomprehensible to us at present, that will emerge from the awakened life of the spirit. In addition to the theme of awakening, Stapledon's depiction of the spirit as female and the creator as male, introduced in Latter- Day Psalms, will continue in Star Maker. Chapter X, "Service," culminates in the statement that "this is the end of Spirit, to have done with desire and to have peace being one with God" (SA D 1. 19. 8).9 This fairly conventional idea is followed by the very unconventional chapter XI, "A Myth of God and Spirit," the clearest forerunner of Star Maker that Stapledon was to produce until the 1930s: a cosmic history detailing the growth and nature of Spirit and its relation to God or Fate. The style of the chapter, based on the opening chapters of Genesis, resembles that of the later visionary chapters of Star Maker that present a mythic version of the beginning. Although the myth developed here is essentially simpler and less ambiguous than the one in Star Maker, in which the narrator is torn between the compul- sion to worship the fulfillment of fate and his rejection of suffering as part of that fulfillment, it is a distant first draft of the mature vision of Star Maker. One other point of comparison between "The Sleeping Beauty" and Star Maker is the inclusion of the Appendix, beginning with three pages of</page><page sequence="7">THE GENESIS OF STAR MAKER 31 "Defmitions." The terms defined are crucial to the book's argument, and Stapledon wants to make certain that readers understand what he means by a range of terms: "the World," "a world," "a spirit," "a soul," "life," "Life," "Spirit," "the Soul of the World," "God," "love," "community," "commu- nion," "beauty," "Beauty," and "Fate."l? The terms appear to be arranged randomly, and the definitions are not particularly remarkable, but this list is a forerunner of the Glossary that Stapledon originally planned to include with Star Maker. " 3. Nebula Maker. In 1930, at the age of 44, Stapledon found success with the publication of his first novel, Last and First Men, a future history of the human race that covers two billion years. He followed this with a less successful companion novel, Last Men in London (1932), and one of the most interest- ing-and in some ways most disturbing-"superman" novels ever published, Odd John (1935). Long before Odd John appeared in print, however, Stapledon was at work on a visionary cosmic epic that he called his "Cosmos-book" or "book about the stars" (Crossley 229). Only at a relatively late stage did he settle on the title Star Maker for this book. Near the end of Odd John, before the title character and other members of his utopian colony commit suicide, John entrusts to the narrator both a series of "scientific records" and "an amazing document, written by John himself, and purporting to give an account of the whole story of the Cosmos" (XXII, 187). John's "document" is based on a preliminary draft of Star Maker that Stapledon began writing in 1933. In that version, the narrator watches the creation of the universe and the development of the great nebulae, which are treated in so anthropomorphic a manner that some of them represent human types ("Fire Bolt" is a revolutionary, "Bright Heart" a martyr for the cause of peace). Abruptly, Stapledon abandoned the draft, later labeling it "Discarded MS. of Star-Maker," and relegated it to a drawer, where it remained for nearly four decades until Harvey Satty discovered the manuscript and published it under the title Nebula Maker; it has since been reissued along with another abandoned work, Four Encounters. Very little of the Nebula Maker version appears in Star Maker, for Stapledon did not revise the earlier draft: instead, he started over from scratch. Some reasons for his dissatisfaction with the earlier stage of the novel may be inferred from the comments of friends who read the draft. Naomi Mitchison, for example, was worried by what she called "this God business" and annoyed that in the manuscript God is "so MALE all the time"; L.H. Myers offered similar, although less colorfully expressed, criticism (Crossley 230). In revising the novel, Stapledon responded to these objections. The result was a dramatically different novel. Several fundamental changes may be illustrated by a comparison of Star Maker with the opening statement of Nebula Maker: "I have seen God creating the cosmos, watching its growth, and finally destroying it." The most obvious change is that in Star Maker the creative force is no longer "God" but "the Star Maker," a phrase more consistent with Stapledon's description of himself as an agnostic mystic. Moreover, rather than follow the creation, evolution, and</page><page sequence="8">32 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 31 (2004) destruction of the universe in chronological order, Star Maker focuses on the expansion of the narrator's vision as he moves from the familiar and human to the most inhuman elements of the universe. Thus he first visits the Other Men, an extraterrestrial species that can be understood in human terms, and then moves on to increasingly alien forms of intelligence. The narrative voice of Star Maker is also more complex than in Nebula Maker: in Star Maker the narrator is still an Englishman, clearly based on Stapledon himself, but during the cosmic voyage he is also part of a communal mind that understands more than our narrator can comprehend or can clearly recollect as an individual human being. Finally, in Star Maker even a term like "the cosmos" can no longer be used with such assurance as it was in Nebula Maker, since Stapledon eventually imagined not one cosmos but a series of cosmic creations of which our own universe, from beginning to end, is far from the last. The move from Nebula Maker to Star Maker was a dramatic one that signaled Stapledon's increasing confidence. Despite his objections to orthodox religions, Stapledon had referred to "God" consistently in his writings, from Latter-Day Psalms, which contains a poem entitled "God," through "The Sleeping Beauty, " whose appendix includes a definition of "God," and on to the Nebula Maker draft. Moreover, at the same time that it attempts to embrace the cosmos, Star Maker is a far more personal book than its predecessor. It is true that Stapledon introduces aspects of his own life into Nebula Maker: for example, "In a mean suburb of a dark commercial city, had I not known a woman? Was she not fair though marred, gentle, though turning to bitterness?" (20). 12 The dark commercial city is Liverpool; the "mean suburb" is an unflattering portrayal of West Kirby, where Stapledon lived at the time; and the "woman" is based on Agnes. In Star Maker, however, occasional personal references are replaced by a repeated emphasis on the narrator's marriage as an example of "intricate symbiosis" and "a microcosm of true community" (Star Maker I. 1.1 &amp; 3). It is the light of personal love against which Stapledon will set the light of impersonal worship of the stars, as he attempts to discover ways in which the human and the cosmic might be meaningful to one another. What vexed Stapledon the most at this point, however, was not simply his struggle with the concepts of his cosmos-book but his search for an appropriate form. The manuscript of Nebula Maker begins with two descriptions of the book's structure: first a "Synopsis of the Book" and then "Contents." The Synopsis, which is reproduced in "Nebula Maker" &amp; "Four Encounters" (4), indicates that Stapledon's plans for the novel went far beyond the sections that he actually wrote at this time, since all fifteen chapters of Nebula Maker are included within the first four chapters of the Synopsis: Synopsis of the Book Preface Chapter I Starlight on a Hill II Creation III First Waking: The Great Nebulae IV Interlude V Second Waking: Stars</page><page sequence="9">THE GENESIS OF STAR MAKER 33 VI Interlude VII Third Waking: Vermin VIII Cosmical Warfare IX Climax and Degeneration X Interlude XI God and his Creature XII Many Creations XIII Back to Earth The difference between this linear progression from the beginning of the cosmos through later cosmic creations and the far more complex narrative structure of Star Maker, which is tied to the widening of the narrator's consciousness, is one of the most important distinctions between these two stages of Stapledon's imaginative creation. 4. Notes for Revision. In 1934 or 1935 Stapledon abandoned the Nebula Maker draft of his cosmos-book and began working on a strikingly different version of his novel. The direction of the new draft was affected by several factors, among them Stapledon's involvement in public debate over the role of the League of Nations, the Spanish Civil War, and the increasing threat to peace from Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany.'3 The effect of this political involvement on Star Maker was twofold. On the one hand, references to current events are far more frequent in Star Maker than in Nebula Maker, and they serve a more important function. In Nebula Maker a Pan-Cosmical League of nebulae, modeled on the League of Nations, attempts to maintain peace among the nebulae but fails when "a brigand empire [i.e., Italy], breaking all its pledges, overran a neighbouring tract of unorganized groups" (Nebula Maker 9.84); in Star Maker this body becomes the League that tries unsuccessfully to stop the "mad worlds" from destroying other worlds, and the event is a crucial one in cosmic history. Conversely, however, Stapledon determined to maintain a balance in the novel between the book's political and social satire, conveyed through its portrayal of extraterrestrial races that resemble human beings in some way, and his increasing conviction that the universe as a whole resisted being reduced to human terms: thus in Star Maker the League is no longer composed of nebulae but of planetary species. The nebulae themselves make a return in Star Maker, but they retain their essential otherness rather than being anthropomorphized. As a result, the universe of Star Maker is both stranger and more familiar than that of Nebula Maker. The Stapledon Archive contains two notebooks with extensive notes for Star Maker. One (SA B5.69), which according to the archive inventory dates to July 1935, is especially interesting because it includes ideas that found their way into the published version of the novel as well as some that Stapledon abandoned. The first page, headed "General Notes," includes a list of "Mental Types": Nebular: Lawrence-ish Stellar: "celestial"; angelic-simple Vermin: indv-tortured, c'plex, in vast cosmos super indv-</page><page sequence="10">34 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 31 (2004) The progression here suggests the evolution of consciousness in the universe, from the nebulae, who resemble D.H. Lawrence in their reliance on instinct, to the stars, and then planetary beings, who in turn form the basis of a super- individual or group-mind like the cosmic mind or spirit. Apart from the analogy to Lawrence, these elements survive in the novel, although not necessarily within the narrative frame Stapledon had imagined in July 1935. The narrative form of the book at that point may be seen in the notebook's preliminary table of contents (SA B5.69, 2): Synopsis Prologue An incident in space Stars and Vermin View of the Galaxy The Stellar Society Intergalactic Relations Vermin of the Stars Back to the Nebular Era God creates the Cosmos History of the Nebulae Crisis of Nebular History Decline of the Nebulae Last phase of the Cosmos Universal war of stars and vermin Peace, impoverishment, disintegration Death of the Cosmos God and the Cosmos The artist's Intention The Cosmos enlarges God Inadequacy of the Cosmos to God's new need God's many cosmical creations Past cosmical creatures Review o[fl present Cosmos Future cosmical creatures Eternity Back to Earth Appendices14 The narrative sketched here is fleshed out later in the notebook. In the prologue Stapledon would have taken stock of his own life as an example of the present crisis in human history, which he sees as both a biological and a spiritual struggle. In response to his complaint, God speaks in his mind, and the ensuing chapters might be a vision that results from God's words. ("God," it will be noted, is not yet the "Star Maker.") "An incident in space" is a version of the Other Earth episode of Star Maker, but with a significant twist: it ends with conflict between "Stars and Vermin," apparently because the "Other Sun" is disturbed by the Other Men and "takes action," as in Poem 7 of "Astronomical Posters." There is no indication, at this stage, that the description of the Other</page><page sequence="11">THE GENESIS OF STAR AL4KER 35 Earth would become the rich satire on human behavior and 1930s political history that we find in Star Maker. The third chapter in this outline, "Stars and Vermin, " became the identically titled chapter 11 of Star Maker, but crucial intervening parts of the Star Maker narrative are missing from the draft outline: descriptions of numerous forms of alien planetary life, the "mad worlds" episode (which is largely a satire on Fascism), and the development of the exploratory group-mind that will evolve into the cosmic mind. Indeed, the whole rationale for Star Maker's narration, the emergence of a communal cosmic awareness under the direction of the symbiotic race of Ichthyoids and Arachnoids, is quite different from the one implied in these notes, which seems still-as in Nebula Maker-to be merely the vision of an individual man. Conversely, the entirety of this projected draft, apart from "Back to the Nebular Era," is different from anything we find in Nebula Maker. The notes indicate that the narrative was to be punctuated by "God's commentaries, &amp; cries of indvs" (SA B5.69, 1). God is much more personal, if not particularly likeable, in this intermediate stage than in Star Maker, where the creator disdains commentary. Here, God has a sadistic streak: the notes for the "Vermin of the Stars" section, for example, indicate that, after the sentient stars and the individual beings on planets recognize each other as forms of intelligent life, "each calls on God"-apparently invoking religion against a perceived enemy-and "God laughs" (7). In "Decline of the Nebulae," when the nebulae disintegrate into stars, "the stars shout for joy"; once again, "God laughs" (11). At the end of "Death of the Cosmos," one observer is left, and one sound: "laughter of God" (14). Stapledon had read Rudolf Otto's The Idea of the Holy in 1934 (Crossley 241), shortly before composing these notes, for in Philosophy and Living (1939) Stapledon comments of Otto's book that it "stresses awe as an element in religious experience, and is important as a corrective to the much commoner idea that the essence of religion is the conviction of the deity's friendliness" (460). In Stapledon's version of the creator, as in Otto's, there is little "friendliness." At the end of the synopsis the word "Appendices," scribbled on as an afterthought, indicates that Stapledon thought of adding some explanatory material. It is possible that this material was to include the glossary that he eventually wrote for Star Maker, much as "The Sleeping Beauty" ends with an Appendix that includes a set of key definitions. The appendices, however, would almost certainly have included temporal scales, much like the ones that Stapledon inserted at various points in Last and First Men, and perhaps spatial scales as well, since the temporal and spatial magnitudes of his work were becoming increasingly important. The Stapledon Archive includes several drafts of time and space scales,'5 and while it is impossible to say exactly when Stapledon drew the charts, he almost certainly had them in mind as a possible addition to the book that was becoming Star Maker. The other surviving notebook for Star Maker (SA B5.68) derives from a later stage, as is evident from the list of contents for the book:</page><page sequence="12">36 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 31 (2004) Star Maker Preface 1 Earth 2 The Other Earth 3 Worlds Innumerable 4 Interlude 5 The Stars 6 Galactic Warfare 7 Interlude 8 The Nebulae 9 Many Creations 10 Island Finale Stapledon had finally settled on a title, Star Maker, for his cosmos-book, and the narrative was taking shape. The phrase "Worlds Innumerable," which became the title of the fifth chapter in the published book, appears here for the first time. Since in the novel that chapter surveys such exemplary forms of extraterrestrial life as the "Human Echinoderms" and the "Nautiloids," it is clear that by this time Stapledon had decided that the Other Earth would not be his only example of planetary life elsewhere in the galaxy. The second page provides even more striking evidence that Star Maker had advanced toward its published form. Headed "Alternative Opening," the page begins with an early version of the book's opening pages. The first paragraph reads as follows: I gazed one night up to the bright heaven, and I asked, which star in all that throng is a planet-attended sun? And is there anywhere another Man? (SA B5.68; pages in this notebook are generally unnumbered) Looking at the sky, the narrator imagines that one "quivering point" of light is "that other sun, with his attendant tribe of worlds; or had been, epochs ago." This gives way to a brief vision of the beginnings of the Earth and then a parallel vision of the distant planet on which develops a species he calls "Other Man." The next few pages consist largely of a visionary flight across Europe that begins in England and crosses the Channel to France, where there is a struggle between "the ancient passions of the tribe and the modern passion for an ordered world." Across the Pyrenees the narrator sees that "tribal passions had already triumphed," and he follows this reference to Franco with a description of Mussolini's Rome as "city of empire and of deity, and the obsession of past glory." The draft breaks off abruptly after "Across the Adriatic I saw the gulfs and mountains of Greece, where in the morning kilted shepherds would be piping beside fallen pillars." Some of this imaginative survey of Europe survives in Star Maker, but it is moved to the Epilogue and augmented into a vision of the entire world. The early draft indicates that at this point Stapledon had not conceived of the vision of the world as a sequel to his cosmic voyage; moreover, he appears not to have distinguished, as he would later, between this purely imaginative vision and the narrator's flight through the universe as "a disembodied, wandering view-point" (Star Maker 11.25).</page><page sequence="13">THE GENESIS OF STAR MAKER 37 The remainder of the notebook consists of redraftings of passages that can be found in the opening pages of Star Maker. Although he quickly settled on the opening of the novel-"One night when I had tasted bitterness I went out on to the hill. Dark heather checked my feet" (Star Maker 1. 1.1)-which is repeated, with only minor changes in punctuation, from one draft to another, revisions in subsequent paragraphs show that Stapledon was particularly concerned with refining his prose in this introductory section. In the last of these redraftings (which actually appears before the others in the file), the first two paragraphs are basically the same as in the published text, with one significant exception: the sentence about the narrator's house that now reads "There the children were born, those sudden new lives" (Star Maker I. 1.1) appears more elaborately in the notebook as "There the children were born, those sudden new lives, already escaping by day like little busy flies out of the windows, but at night still homing." The reference to Stapledon's two children, Mary Sydney and John David, reveals how personal this cosmic book had become. 5. The Holograph Manuscript and the Page Proofs. In the handwritten manuscript for Star Maker the passage about the children is expanded further: There the children were born, those sudden new lives. Soon they began escaping by day like little busy flies out of the windows, though at night still homing. And soon, how soon, they would go out into the world gravely, anxiously, and with high hope, to make lives of their own. (SA B1.21) The first sentence survived into Star Maker, but the next two are crossed out in the manuscript, perhaps because they seemed too sentimental or more personal than Stapledon wanted the novel to be. (It is interesting that in the manuscript the first part of chapter I, "The Earth," was originally entitled "Personal" before being changed to "The Starting Point.") The excision was not part of a general attempt to streamline the book's prose: at this stage Stapledon rarely deleted a passage without substituting another, and generally the substitution was longer than the original. As in other manuscripts (for example, the draft of the Nebula Maker version), Stapledon wrote on the right-hand pages of a notebook, using the facing versos strictly for revisions. Sometimes the revisions amounted to the insertion of extensive passages, and occasionally the left-hand pages are as dense with writing as those on the right. Some of the most memorable passages in Star Maker originated in additions to the manuscript. There are also passages not crossed out in the manuscript that were eliminated later, probably from the typescript (which has not survived). Crossley gives a fine example, a long paragraph from the Epilogue that began with a glimpse of the Abyssinian struggle against Italian invaders and led to a vision of Africans preparing to rebel against colonialism elsewhere. In Star Maker, he observes, this "splendid passage is flattened into three cautious sentences": "Far southward, black men slept beside the great lakes. Elephants trampled the crops. Further still, where Dutch and English profit by the Negro millions, those hosts were stirred by vague dreams of freedom" (Crossley 241-42; Star Maker XVI.33 1).</page><page sequence="14">38 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 31 (2004) The Epilogue's pointed political message was muted by other changes as well. For example, Stapledon marked for insertion the following passage that was deleted at a later stage: Then what of the Americans? Is their part played? Is their vigour already congealed into rigid social patterns and trivial cultural forms, or is it still fluid, and capable of adopting the forms of the new world? Is it, after all, the Americans, and no others, that have the leading part to play in determining the new world-form? (SA B1.21, facing 353) Perhaps even more striking is the passage that completes this vision of a trip around the world: Ahead, beyond Ireland, I saw the few midnight lamps of a suburb, and on a dark hill a seated figure, with back turned westward: myself, among the once- pioneering British people. A great, but now a disheartened people. They had given the world the remote ideal of democracy and the actual, dangerous wealth of mechanical power. But now, from the whole island, there seemed to rise a vague mist of perplexity and fear. For where was democracy? And for whose profit was power used? Even the gay and care-free were at heart anxious. (SA B1.21, 353) Neither passage appears in Star Maker. Crossley (241-42) traces Stapledon's deletions of specific political references to the advice of his friend L.H. Myers, who believed that they undercut the novel's cosmic speculations, and to Stapledon's own fear that his novel might soon be dated. I agree with Crossley that these deletions are unfortunate, and can only add that, luckily, Stapledon did not take Myers's advice on another point: in December 1936, only a few months before Stapledon fmished his final draft and wrote the preface, Myers wrote to say that although he liked the ending, he wished the "survey of earth" could be relegated to an "appendix" (SA H2A.21, letter 113). What is most remarkable, however, is how close the holograph manuscript is to Star Maker as it was finally published. The vast difference between the manuscript and the surviving notes that preceded it indicates that there must have been other notebooks, perhaps even another full-scale draft, before the holograph. Once Stapledon reached this stage he could have published the novel as it stood, without alteration. After the holograph no new episodes, no alien species, were introduced into Star Maker. Apart from the reduction in specific political references, most of the late changes in the text involve stylistic revisions, relatively brief elaborations of points, or transitional passages. What had changed by the time Stapledon wrote the manuscript is fundamen- tal to Star Maker. For one thing, there is the idea that the narrator, as a participant in the events of the novel, is both "I" and "we": both an individual human being and a part of a collective mentality composed of beings from many different species. For another, the narrative now constantly plays the narrator's personal life, with its anxieties and disappointments and small triumphs, against the cosmic scheme of the narrative; meanwhile, events elsewhere in the cosmos are often, although not invariably, related in some way to the conflicts and</page><page sequence="15">THE GENESIS OF STAR AL4KER 39 crises of the 1930s. In addition, many of the most interesting alien beings are first described in this draft. Moreover, Stapledon had by this time conceived of setting up an extended parallel between Star Maker and Dante's Divine Comedy.16 Beginning in darkness, moving toward a vision of the Star Maker, and concluding with a perception of the truth that makes his life meaningful, Stapledon's narrator undergoes a cosmic voyage that is comparable in many points to Dante's: he and the other alien explorers whom he meets are even assisted in their explorations by the intercession of the symbiotic race of Inchthyoids and Arachnoids, whose role is reminiscent of Virgil's and Beatrice's in the Comedy. Again, like Dante, who concludes Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso each with the word stelle (stars), Stapledon keeps the stars constantly in mind, and often in sight. The narrator-protagonists of the Comedy and Star Maker both turn to the heavens for something greater than themselves-for what Stapledon calls the "hypercosmical reality." Both authors would agree that the meaning of human life cannot be found exclusively within the human world, only in something whose magnitudes eclipse ours. Yet Dante's image of God, at the end of Paradiso, as "the Love which moves the sun and the other stars" is quite distinct from Stapledon's vision of the Star Maker: Dante's God creates the universe out of love and demands love in return, but the Star Maker is otherwise motivated. In Stapledon's vision, love is more important to humanity than to the Star Maker, who creates primarily out of a desire for aesthetic fulfillment and self-contemplation. In his journey throughout the cosmos the narrator hopes to find a direct correspondence between human values-especially love-and those of the universe, but those hopes are never realized. Watching the Star Maker design cosmos after cosmos, the narrator sees in the creator's attitude toward the beings of our universe something new, a love without pity. In the end, the creative spirit subjects everything to "the cold, clear, crystal ecstasy of contemplation" (XV.3.326). The contrast with Dante's vision, in which divine love rules all, sharpens and highlights Stapledon's combination of agnostic skepticism and a yearning toward spiritual communion. There was at least one typescript for Star Maker, but the only direct evidence of its existence appears on the contents page for the holograph, where a note indicates that the page numbers are not those of the manuscript but of the typescript. Unfortunately, the typescript has disappeared, along with the galley proofs. The page proofs, however, are in the Stapledon Archive (SA E4), and Stapledon's revisions of proofs indicate that he used this final opportunity not only to make corrections of punctuation, spelling, font, and alignment, but also to introduce final improvements in the book wherever possible: for example, he scrutinized the text for passages in which he had inadvertently repeated a word to see whether or not he should vary his phrasing. Occasionally Stapledon considered a possible change and then deleted it, as on the top of page 142, where he wrote "individuality of the cloud in the mob of clouds" before crossing it out. Most of the changes are cosmetic, but there is one significant addition: the entire final paragraph of chapter IX, "The Community of Worlds, "</page><page sequence="16">40 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 31 (2004) beginning "It was during the age of the galactic utopia" (222), was added in Stapledon's hand to the page proofs. Seemingly the result of a last-minute thought, this paragraph demonstrates how the Plant Men, although "long- extinct," were contacted telepathically and in that way made their contribution to the growth of spirit in the cosmos aeons after their demise. 6. Star Maker. Star Maker's metaphysical speculations, blending of Einsteinian relativity with theology, and daring narrative perspective fared better with critics than with ordinary readers: the book sold poorly, and there was no American edition during Stapledon's lifetime. Stapledon was disappointed with the novel's sales, but he must have been heartened by the reviews. Bertrand Russell's review in the London Mercury was especially positive and perceptive. Impressed by the book's science, amused by its speculation that from the viewpoint of a star we planetary beings might all be regarded as vermin, appreciative of the "quality of austere beauty" in its style, Russell found in the conclusion to Star Maker "a fine intellectual courage," and he paid Stapledon the ultimate compliment: that in attempting "to understand the cosmos better than it has hitherto been understood" he had contributed to "the world's understanding of itself" (297-98). In that respect, Russell says, Stapledon's "achievement is not merely personal" (298). Stapledon would have been gratified to share his accomplishment with humanity at large. Yet the manuscript evidence remains to demonstrate that on the immediate level, at least, Star Maker was the product of one man's lifetime fascination with our relation to the stars and with the possibility of finding a form to accommodate his vision of the cosmos. From the theological specula- tions of Latter-Day Psalms and other poems, through early attempts to create a narrative, to the 100-page draft of Nebula Maker that he discarded because it seemed inadequate for his purpose, up to the final correction of page proofs, Stapledon dedicated himself to articulating his vision of the cosmic background against which we lead our lives. NOTES This essay grew out of my research for a scholarly edition of Star Maker, forthcoming from Wesleyan University Press (2004). I have reused some material from my introduction and annotations to that volume. 1. Materials in the Stapledon Archive are cited in this study by the abbreviation SA followed by category (e.g., Dl for manuscripts of unpublished prose) and item and page numbers. My thanks to Andy Sawyer for assistance in using the Archive and to Robert Crossley, literary executor of the Stapledon Estate, for permission to quote unpublished materials. 2. Star Maker's odd-numbered chapters are divided into numbered sections; even- numbered chapters are not. In my citations, which are based on the first edition, I have listed chapter number, section number (if any), and page number(s): e.g., III.2.33-34 for chapter III, section 2, pages 33-34. 3. Quotations from Stapledon's letters to Agnes are all from Talking Across the World. On the volunteer army, see Crossley 127.</page><page sequence="17">THE GENESIS OF STAR MAKER 41 4. Stapledon's comment on the fundamental strangeness of alien intelligence anticipates J.B.S. Haldane's comment that "the universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose" (286). 5. Stapledon also explored the possibility of representing a vegetative state of awareness in his posthumously published story, "The Man Who Became a Tree," which he composed sometime in the 1940s (An Olaf Stapledon Reader 124-3 1). 6. A related, if somewhat absurd, image occurs in Stapledon's poem "Smoke," published immediately after "Ad Astra": God is portrayed as an architect who, while planning heaven, lights a cigarette whose smoke is the universe. 7. A likely source for this (now outdated) theory of planet-formation is the first chapter of Luyten's The Pageant of the Stars (1929), which Stapledon cites in his "Note on Magnitude" at the end of Star Maker: "We know that head-on collisions between two stars occur not much more than about once in every trillion years for the whole universe. A close approach will be much more frequent, and especially in the denser parts of the universe it may well occur thousands or millions of times more often" (Luyten 3). These "close approaches," Luyten says, are the source of planetary systems. Stapledon's note in the "Astronomical Posters" manuscript indicates that the ending of Poem 5 refers to this theory. 8. The importance of the kiss in this version of Stapledon's ur-narrative might owe something to fact that in his 1915 letter to Agnes about his dream of a cosmic voyage, described above, their kiss transforms their journey through space into an experience of community with the entire cosmos. 9. The pages of this chapter are unnumbered. In the left margin of each page are notes that summarize the narrative, much in the manner of Coleridge's marginal notes for The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. 10. The typescript includes notes that indicate Stapledon's indecision on a few points: whether to use the term Cosmos instead of the World; whether to include an entry on the mind; whether or not to capitalize Fate. 11. Apart from the entry on size, which he revised slightly as "A Note on Magnitude," Stapledon deleted the glossary from the first edition of Star Maker. Uncovered decades later and first published in 1986, it has since been appended to some editions of Star Maker and will be included with the annotated Wesleyan University Press edition. The glossary exists in two forms: the earlier version is appended to the holograph manuscript of Star Maker, and the later (and more complete) version is a typescript. 12. In the manuscript this passage is an addition (SA B 1.12.1, facing 8). Another addition on the same manuscript page speculates that God may be an artist and the cosmos a prelude to "some more finished work," a theme introduced awkwardly into Nebula Maker (2.19) and more deftly into Star Maker. 13. See, for example, Crossley 233-35 and 238, and Smith, on Stapledon's public debate in the letters column of the Liverpool Post with an anonymous antagonist who called himself "Ignotus" ("unknown") and ridiculed Stapledon's positions, especially his qualified pacifism and his support of the League of Nations as a means of combatting Fascist aggression. 14. In the manuscript the three subsections of "God and the Cosmos" are crossed out. The first is replaced, in the margin, by "Vision of God contemplating" and the second by "God reviews his creation"; the third title is illegible but is probably a truncated form of "The Objectified Myth of the Bride of God," the title used for this section later in the notebook.</page><page sequence="18">42 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 31 (2004) 15. SA I. 1.1, 1-5, and I. 1.2, 1-8. (The inventory lists all of the scales, both temporal and spatial, as "Time Chart[s] for Star Maker.")

ABSTRACT Olaf Stapledon's Star Maker evolved in the author's imagination for more than two decades before its publication in 1937. This evolution may be traced first in poems, letters, and an unpublished philosophical manuscript, then in several stages of revision of Stapledon's "cosmos book." Examining evidence from the poems of Latter-Day Psalms (1914) through the author's final corrections of page proofs, this article demonstrates ways in which Stapledon struggled first with the ideas, then with the narrative shape, of his vision of the cosmos and its relation to human life.</page></plain_text>
