<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Scene of the Parinirv?na on a Recently Excavated Stone Reliquary of the Tang Dynasty by Patricia Eichenbaum Karetzky In 1957 while repairing a temple in the north east of the city a tomb chamber was discovered in Lingtai County, Gansu Province (Cheng 1983: 48). The chamber contained an ornately carved and polychromed reliquary, six sculpted tiles, a lengthy tomb record dated to the mid Tang period, and several other ceramic, metal and lacquer tomb objects. Among these articles the recently published reliquary is the most interesting example of Tang mortuary art with its exterior bas relief scenes of the Parinirv?na of the Buddha (fig. 1) and ascent of the soul (fig. 2). The coffer was found on a low square base adorned with floral carvings at the center of the room. The lower part of the left and right chamber walls were inlaid with six sculpted brick tiles, each of which had a seated Buddha or heavenly musician framed by an ogee shaped arch (fig. 3). The tomb record, a square of white limestone, was fixed into the top of the basement wall; from the center of the stone, where a hole had been drilled, a bronze mirror was suspended (fig. 4). The tomb record is written in a beautiful florid script of 23 lines, each of which has 23 characters; each side of the tomb record has three fine line-engraved portraits on it i1). The tomb record names Chen Weijiang whose zi was Shou-zhib who once attained the ranks of: Escort Yamen of the Tactical Armed Forces of the Spirit of the Left of Lingtai garrison (2), the Emolument of Senior Offical of the Yingjingguan, Inspector of the Guests of the Prince, Higher Pillar of the State. He died in the fourth year of Dazhong, A.D. 850c, at the age of 67, and was buried in the same year in Lingtai County, to the northwest of Yuanyaoti passd. The tomb record relates that Chen, well versed in Buddhist and Taoist texts, dedicated himself to the way of the sage and medical skills. The irregular circumstances that led to this reliquary being placed in the basement of the temple are somewhat mysterious and there is some question of whether the tomb record, drilled at its center, belongs to the coffer. The basement of the temple is connected to that of a pagoda; 0) These portraits were not reproduced in Cheng's report. (2) A great deal of discussion and research was devoted to interpreting the rank and historic period of when that rank was in commission by the authors of the archaeological report.

Parinirv?na scene, east side. the sacred complex which includes a larger temple, is believed to have existed since the Song. It has been assumed, however, that the objects found in the basement of the temple are of a greater antiquity than the temple, and that the latter was built over the remains of the tomb chamber (3). A similar circumstance was found in Shanxi in Zhangtaie where a Tang reliquary was also found in the basement of the temple (Shanxi Province 1961: 286). The miniature coffin is made of grey limestone; its front measures 35.7 cm. high, the back 28.5; its front is 19.4 cm. broad, the back is 16.2 cm. It is 45.6 cm. long. The lid is 24 cm. wide at the front and only 21.2 at the back and is 47 cm. long. The lid is joined to the body. The shape of the coffer is architectural, in imitation of a palatial structure with overhanging eaves. Along the periphery of the lid up-turned (3) This is the assumption of the authors of the. report. 216 [2]</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 2 - Tang stone reliquary from Lingtai, Gansu.

The sides of the lid are organized into architectural bays framed by plain pilasters; the central one, on each of the four sides, has a Sishen*, one of the Spirit Animals of the cardinal directions. The upper perimeter of the coffer body has a continuous row of up-turned lotus leaves. On both short ends of the coffin are a doorway flanked by two guardians; on the long sides the narrative compositions are carved. The base of the reliquary has three narrow registers: the top of up-turned lotus leaves, each of which carries a large round ball, the center is plain but for unadorned pilasters, and the bottom also has down-turned lotus leaves, each carrying a ball. Many of the decorative themes on Chen's sarcophagus are ubiquitous in Chinese mortuary art. The basic treatment of the coffin as a palatial structure is employed in several Tang stone coffins (Omura 1925: figs. 54-55); this theme is in keeping with the ancient Chinese belief that the dead should be interred as splendidly as possible. The use of the Sisheny the spirit animals of the four directions, as supernatural creatures is prevalent since the Han period; and the guardian figures have an antiquity at least 218 [4]</page><page sequence="5">as old as Qinshihuangdi's magnificent mounds. Unlike common usage, Chen's coffin has guardian figures placed at both the north and south ends; more commonly in Six Dynasties funereal art they appear at the south end only. As for these guardians, they are of Western appearance, a fashion since the Six Dynasties Period ? their hair is drawn up into top knots, they have 'deep' eyes, prominent noses, and wear red gowns that are tied at the waist and fall over their long skirts and tall boots. Their hands are crossed in front of their bodies, resting on the hilts of their swords. They turn towards the central portal, their faces grimacing fiercely. The guardians on the north end differ in that they wear armor below which their gowns flow; they have drums suspended in front of their chests, and they turn in contrapposto ? their upper bodies facing outwards (4). Traces of gold and blue pigment can be seen on their garments. The scene of the death of the Buddha is dramatically told on the eastern side of the coffin. Narrative details reveal rather clearly the ancient Gandharan Indian prototypes that were transmitted east so many centuries earlier (fig. 5). The creation of the death scene around a reclining Buddha was invented only after the common era when Gandharan artists were brought into contact with the art of classical antiquity. Until that time, for five hundred years the architectural form of a hemispherical dome, the st?pa was the symbol for the historical event of the death of the Buddha and the major focus of worship. The symbol of the stupa was successful in avoiding the anthropomorphic portrayal of the Buddha which had been proscribed, and of the suffering of his followers; and yet the st?pa conveyed the universal significance of the event. The Gandharan artist, stimulated by the great tradition of narrative art in the West, created a new scene of the passing away of the Buddha as well as a complete cycle of scenes re-enacting the dramatic events from the final farewell to his followers, his last sermon, his passing away, cremation and division of the relics. It was also at this time that the anthropomorphic image of the Buddha was created and freely worshipped, it is this icon which is the focus of these scenes. But of all the illustrated episodes it was the final farewell that was most frequently represented ? the Buddha was shown reclining on his right side, supporting his head with his right arm, and lying on a funeral couch. His garments do not obey the laws of gravity, but rather remain in U-shaped folds, as if the figure were still standing. All around his bed mourners grieve in various states of intensity. The Parinirv?na was infrequently depicted in the greater Buddhist world however. Perhaps it was due to the east Asian aesthetic that avoided representing human suffering, or the fact that in Buddhist thought such displays of emotion only reveal a lack of enlightenment due to emotional attachments, so no such portrayals would be made that could elict empathetic feelings of attachment. Unlike the Christian crucifix, the passing away of the Buddha never became the focus of worship. It was the meditating Buddha that replaced the aniconic symbol of the st?pa as a major icon. Not only is the Parinirv?na seldom illustrated, but in many (4) These figures also are not reproduced in the report. [5] 219</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 5 - Parinirv?na Scene from Mardan, Gandharan, currently in Peshawar. cases it is only the reclining Buddha, without his sorrowful worshippers, as in the Guptan stele from S?rn?th that is recreated (Karetzky 1987: 268), sometimes in colossal scale such as at Ajant? or in Sri Lanka at Polonn?ruwa or in the far North-West in Afghanistan at Tapa Sard?r in Ghazni or Adzina Tepa in Tadjikistan (Snellgrove 1978: figs. 68, 144, 145). The Tang Parinirv?na scene is quite similar to the Gandharan prototypes. The same figural dispositions are preserved, although the identity of some of the characters has been altered. It is still the reclining Buddha with garments falling in U-shaped folds, in defiance of the laws of nature; his topknot is painted blue, his whole body is golden in color. The format of single figure at either end of the funeral couch is maintained. In Indian examples it is traditionally two monks ? the young Ananda who administered to the Buddha's physical needs (including the arrangements for the funeral) stands at the head of the bed and the elder K?syapa is placed at the feet. The Mah?pariniw?nas?tra relates the events: at the time of the passing away of the 220 [6]</page><page sequence="7">Buddha, K?syapa was travelling through the countryside; he arrived too late and was unable to bid farewell to the Buddha. The coffin, however refused to ignite for the cremation until K?syapa arrived, then the feet of the Buddha miraculously emerged from the funeral wrappings so that K?syapa could make obeisance and only then did the funeral pyre spontaneously combust, as if by its own volition (Rhys Davids 1969: 126 ff.). In the Tang example the single figure at the head and foot of the couch is identified as being female, distinguished from one another only by the different colors of the garments (Cheng 1983: 48). At the head of the bed she wears a green dress, leans forward towards the couch touching her chest with her right hand, her left hangs by her side. At the foot of the bed she stands with both hands resting on her hips, her head is turned toward the couch, and she is dressed in purple. The authors of the archaeological report identify the figures as M?y? circumambulating the coffin of the Buddha as related in the Mah?m?y?s?tra. This scripture was translated into Chinese in the last quarter of the 5th century in Nanking; one section has been translated as follows (Soper 1959: 166): Thereupon Mah? M?y? [...] came down from the sky, hastening to the place where the twin trees grew. On searching the sala grove and seeing from a distance the Buddha's coffin, she was overcome by unbearable sorrow. When the gods had sprinkled water on her face and so brought her back to consciousness, she went straightway to the coffin, and bowed her head upon it in adoration [...]. Then the World-honored One, using His supernatural powers, commanded all of the lids of His multilayered coffin to open spontaneously. He himself rose out of the coffin with His hands pressed together, bursting forth like a lion-king who rushes from his cave; while from every one of the hair-pores of His body there shown forth 1000 rays of light, each containing 1000 miraculously-created Buddhas. There is no extant representation of the episode between the Buddha and his mother in Gandharan or early Central Asian art (3) but there are several late Chinese examples. These illustrate the cycle of events of the Parinirv?na and show the scene of farewell to M?y?. Two versions are from the Tang; the earliest is the Parinirv?na stele from Shanxi datable to A.D. 692 (Soper 1959: 159 ff.), a second is painted on a ceiling at a cave-chapel at Dunhuangg ? Cave 420 from the Sui Period (Chugoku Sekkutsu, II, 1982: pi. 67) and the third is a stele whose back is engraved with these themes; it is dated to the second year of Kaiyuanh, A.D. 715 (Omura 1915: pi. 32). In advanced stages of the evolution of pictorial narratives, the conflation of scenes occurs; thus M?y? is eventually placed among the mourners of the last farewell although (5) For example the earliest Central Asian depiction is the telling of King Aj?tasatru the news of the death of the Buddha by means of a picture, from Kizil's M?y?h?hle (M?y? Cave), see Gr?nwedel 1912: 168, where Subhadra, a Malla, two Bodhisattvas, a monk and a prince attend the event; the painting is ascribed to the 5th-6th century. [7] 221</page><page sequence="8">there is no textual basis for her being at that event. The earliest depiction of M?y? at the Parinirv?na comes from the Northern Qi period at Xiangtangshan1 where she is alone in front of the funeral couch (Mizuno 1937: pi. 23a). At Dunhuang in the Sui Dynasty Cave, 280, a female figure is placed near the head of the bed; she is seated on an hour-glass shaped base that has lotus petals at the top; her feet rest on a smaller, simpler lotus base (Chugoku Sekkutsu, II, 1982: pi. 114). She wears a crown, a long gown with scarf thrown diagonally across her left shoulder, her left hand almost touches her cheek, her right rests on her lap. This same figure is found in Cave 295 also at Dunhuang from the mid Tang era (Chugoku Sekkutsu II, 1982: pi. 42). But these female depictions are quite extraordinary and short-lived. Sometime around the Song Dynasty the representation of M?y? is altered ? she is shown descending from heaven where she was reincarnated after her premature death following the birth of the Buddha. Having resumed the female form she inhabited as M?y?, she descends on a cloud, hovering over the leafy tops of the trees of the Sala grove from where she watches the events of the Parinirv?na like the example from WanfosiJ attributed to the Song Dynasty (Huang ling Wanfosi 1965: 39). This image of M?y? floating on a cloud, dressed as a courtier becomes a feature of the Parinirv?na scene, especially in the Japanese paintings, the earliest and best known of which is the one at K?yasan dated to 1086 (Moran 1974: 89). In the end M?y?'s inclusion in the Parinirv?na may be viewed as an accommodation to the Chinese propriety of filial piety; the tenacity of that belief is evident in the Buddhist inscriptions beginning in the Wei Period at Lung men ? these express the wish for blessings to be conferred on family members and ancestors (Soper 1959a: 135 ff.). The Tang reliquary depiction then is evidence of the transition from the independent scene of M?y? and the Buddha alone to the final version of M?y? watching the event from her cloudy perch. The group of three men standing behind the funeral bed is also a standard figural convention of Gandharan origin. Traditionally the area behind the bed was reserved for the Mallas, the princely devotes of the Buddha. These characters were shown demonstratively mourning ? their heads hung down, their limbs akimbo. Being less enlightened than the members of the sangha, they still had emotional attachments and so grieved piteously at the Buddha's passing away. At Maijishank in Gansu Province, for example four characters stand behind the bed in the scene of the Parinirv?na found in small scale in the upper right section of a stele from Cave 133 ascribed to the 6th century (Sullivan 1965: pi. 10). Here the figures show their grief: one touches the head of the Buddha, the second beats his chest, the third raises both hands to his face and the fourth, placed somewhat higher on the right, clasps his hands together in the manibus iunctis gesture of prayer. There are in addition only the two standing figures at either end of the bed and no Sala trees or other narrative details. Another depiction from Majishan is painted on a section of ceiling in Cave 27, also ascribed to the 6th century (Sullivan 1965: pi. 102); here the event is attended by 15 figures, the spatial relationships are made clear for the figures that are grouped together seated on mats ? three in the foreground, three by the head, nine behind 222 [8]</page><page sequence="9">the bed, one at the foot. Of those behind the bed one falls over onto the body of the Buddha, weeping, while another throws his hands over his head in a gesture of desperation. These two grieving mourners became stock images of the Parinirv?na in Gandharan art. At Dunhuang, in the Sui cave of 280, ten figures are placed behind the bed ? one grasps his hair in his two hands and falls forward on to the couch {Chugoku Sekkutsu, II, 1982: pi. 114). Another figure, number ten, may be identified as the Bodhisattva Guanyin because he holds a small water jar in his right hand; the second of these figures is clearly identifiable as a Buddha by his garment and topknot, perhaps it is Maitreya who like M?y? (by the head) has descended from Tusita heaven to witness the great decease. At the foot are two figures, a deva who stands with his hands clasped in prayer gesture and K?syapa who kneels reverently. In front of the bed another deva, in a spasm of grief, falls backwards in a faint; three Sala trees are placed in the background. Cave 295 from the Sui period preserves the same composition in its entirety adding only the meditating figure of Subhadra seated encircled by flames at the foot of the bed (Chugoku Sekkutsu, II, 1982: 42). He was the last convert of the Buddha and achieved enlightenment with the last words of the Buddha (Rhys Davids 1969: 105). The figural disposition of Cave 280 is completely reproduced but the figures are drawn far more dramatically. It is almost comic to see a Buddha incline his head and wipe the tears from his eyes, or Guanyin reach out to touch the Buddha's reclining body; or K?syapa grab the Buddha's toes. The climax in the expression of mourning figures can be seen in Cave 159 where some of the figures lacerate themselves with knives and draw blood; such acts of mourning must reflect actual funeral rituals practiced on the north-western borders of China (Akiyama 1969: pi. 65). The addition of the Buddha and Bodhisattvas to the Parinirv?na is evidence of a growing supernatural element which eventually includes all manner of creatures ? guardian kings of the four quarters, lions, and in the case of the back of the Tang stele of A.D. 715, a double headed phoenix. A tendency to multiply the number of participants, to 69 people in the painting of Cave 420 of the Sui {Chugoku Sekkutsu, II, 1982: pi. 76) is also prevalent in the later examples. Both of these tendencies ? to expand the number of the audience, and to include supernatural creatures and members of the animal world become part of the final formulation of the Mah?parinirv?na as preserved in the Japanese Nehan painting tradition (Moran 1974: 89 ff.). In the Tang reliquary depiction there are no narrative figures placed before the bed. To the left of the Buddha a monk kneels, supporting his head with his right hand; behind him another monk covers his face with his right hand swathed in his garment. Next two mourning monks grieve supporting each other as they weep ? their hands rest on each other's shoulders. In front of them another monk appears to have fainted and is being held up by one who cradles his shoulders in his arms. Behind them, is the tenth monk, he sits with his head resting on the palm of his left hand, in a meditative gesture. At the extreme left are two mourning devas: one kowtows in the foreground, facing away from the reclining Buddha. Behind him, in the air the second deva falls backwards beating his chest with his two fists. Some of the figures [9] 223</page><page sequence="10">on the left side of the composition were traditionally placed in front of the bed ? groups of monks were common in representations both at Dunhuang and Maijishan, like the deva who falls backwards. This alteration in the figural arrangement may be attributed to the adoption of some of the compositional devices of the horizontal scroll which reads from right to left. The once huge composition of the Parinirv?na is broken up into several scenes each of which can be viewed independently in a continuous right to left motion. The weeping monks and fainting devas are transposed from the area in front of the bed to the extreme left and the many-layered space created by the placement of overlapping figures at either side, in front and behind the bed of the Western prototypes has been separated into individual units that are strung together like pearls. Comparison with the earliest scenes of the Parinirv?na at Dunhuang, Cave 428 from the early 6th century {Chugoku Sekkutsu, I, 1982: 164) with its more Western space (all of the narrative figures are in rows behind the bed) illustrates the differences between the Western convention of a climactic moment of multiple events and the Chinese single action scenes viewed in continuous time. In summation, the reliquary depiction is quite clearly adapted to the Chinese indigenous preferences ? the inclusion of M?y?, spatial organization, and narrative technique; but the ancient Gandharan prototypes are still quite apparent. The scene has been abbreviated ? there are no Sala trees, no Subhadra; only the ten disciples, two devas and M?y?; there are no extra details, a requisite perhaps of the small size of the reliquary. Portrayals of the Parinirv?na are extremely rare among the extant remains of Buddhist art that survived the triple persecutions of the Northern and Tang Dynasties and the modern era. There are few recorded paintings or sculptures of the Parinirv?na in the histories. The Jin Dynasty Shi Shuo Xin Yu compiled by Liu Yiqing (A.D. 404-44) mentions two depictions (Soper 1959a: 13) and in the Pi qui ni juan also of the Jin Dynasty is mention of a Parinirv?na being commissioned by a nun, and under the Song Dynasty entry another Parinirv?na scene is recorded (Soper 1959a: 40). A colossal Buddha entering nirvana was ordered by Mengxun who established the Northern Liang kingdom which encompassed Dunhuang in the early 5th century (Ch'en 1972: 88). It was Mengxun's spiritual advisor, Dharmaraksa, who translated the Mah? parinirv?na s?tra from Sanskrit to Chinese. The sixteen-foot reclining Buddha sponsored by Mengxun was erected in honor of his mother. The rarity of Parinirv?na scenes in China may be partly understood in light of the traditional Chinese aesthetic which eschewed depictions of violence and high emotional content. To show figures weeping, having lost control of their emotions was considered improper by Confucian standards where mastery of the inner self was esteemed and grief was not subject to public display. In a culture where the emphasis was on the living and thoughts of the afterlife remained vague for millennia, scenes of death or dying were never portrayed and tombs, since the Han period were decorated with images of banqueting, musical parties dancing and other entertainments or of moral instruction (virtuous women, paragons of filial piety, heros of antiquity). The sight of the reclining Buddha as the crowning element in stone stele like those of the Gupta and P?la periods was not reproduced in China, 224 [10]</page><page sequence="11">where the indigenous theme of the dragon replaced it (Matsubara 1966: 117). Moreover stories of spiritual masters like Huishi1 who could select the time of their death (as Buddha had) pass into that state in an upright seated position and remain that way for an indefinite period of time before putrefaction took place were widely circulated and admired (Ware 1933: 135 ff.). Although depictions of the passing away of the Buddha were extremely limited the scripture, Mah?parinirv?nas?tra was widely read; it enjoyed such popularity that a school of devotees dedicated themselves to that particular text as others had around the Lotus S?tra or the Prajn?p?ramit?s?tra. According to Nanjio's catalogue there were seven translations made from the Sanskrit to Chinese during the period from the 3rd to 6th century when Xuanzang labored over it (6). In its complete version it is the longest of the Buddhist scriptures; five of the Chinese translations are categorized as Mahayanist, the remaining three belong to the Theravada. The Stein expedition at the beginning of this century found 760 copies at Dunhuang, of which only nine were dated (Giles 1944: 172). At Xiangtangshan where the engraving of scriptures rivalled the sculptors' art there are 120 steles of the Mah?parinirv?nas?tra carved (7). The popularity of this scripture transcended any simple interest in the narration of the death cycle; but the verbal biography had no more receptive an audience than the illustrations had. It was rather the doctrine of eternity that had the appeal. In the scripture heavenly rewards were promised for the practice of pious actions, but nirvana was everlasting. 'Nirvana is like a flame that is never diminished; it is a state that is unchanging, into which nothing again passes nor leaves' {Mah?parinirv?nas?tra, Daiz?ky?, vol. XII: 35, 627). The state of nirvana is attainable by all, even the most corrupt man can achieve it (Wright 1973: 293). The Mah?parinirv?nas?tra was regarded as the final, ultimate doctrine of the Buddha because it was the last one preached prior to the passing away. As such the former doctrines were only partial truths in comparison to the final sermon. One recorded devotee of the scripture was Tanyan (d. A.D. 588) who wrote a commentary on it and whose disciples were remembered even during the Sui and Tang (Ch'en 1972: 180). Thus the promise of nirvana, an eternal and unchanging state which was attainable by all was the essential theme of the nirvana school. The depiction on the west side of the reliquary is the ascent of the soul of the 'tomb master'; the composition is comprised of ten figures. At the north end is the tomb master riding on a bank of clouds; he has one hand resting on his hip, the other is raised at the elbow. Being transmitted on the same cloud bank, and sitting slightly in front of him, is a seated Buddha. The Buddha is not appreciably larger in size, he (6) Nanjio 1975: 42, no. 113 was translated by Dharmaraksa A.D. 423, no. 118 by Fa Xian in the 4th century; or no. 123 translated by Xuanzhang. (7) Tokiwa &amp; Sekino (1951: 61): there were 210 steles of the Lotus S?tra and 360 of the Prajn?p?ramit?s?tra. [11] 225</page><page sequence="12">sits with his right hand resting in his lap, the left lies on his knee. Behind the tomb master is a standing figure, with both hands clasped in the sleeves of his robe. In front of the Buddha figure are three men; their hands are clasped in front of their chests, their heads are turned towards the tomb master; they appear to be smiling. Leading the heavenly ascent are three musicians ? the first holds two cymbals in his outstretched hands, behind him another blows a pipe, the third strikes a small round hand drum with a clapper, he turns his face back smiling beatifically as he gazes upon the tomb master. A fourth figure performs the sleeve dance. The tomb master is dressed in typical Chinese fashion, in a wide, long-sleeved, belted gown in kimono style with a cloth high-crested cap. His attendant similarly wears a long-sleeved belted robe. The Buddha has both shoulders covered by his garment, but his chest and mid section are clearly visible. The second group of figures welcoming the deceased are not dressed in traditional garb; they wear short tunics that are belted at the waist; the front of their skirts is hitched up into their belts (8) while the back hangs down over their narrow trousers and tall boots. It appears as if they have a scarf thrown over their right shoulder. The musicians wear more common dress: long-sleeved belted tunics, also hitched at the waist, over narrow trousers and tall boots. Their hair is close-cropped in contrast to the second group who wear low cloth turban-like head wraps. This depiction of the ascent of the soul has a striking similarity to representations of ascents to the afterlife on Taoist coffins of the 6th century like one recently discovered in Luoyang (Karetzky 1983: 1 ff.). There too the tomb master is transported among an entourage of musicians and celestials. Male orchestras were popular funerary themes since the Han; one mid 8th century tomb near Sian, that of Si Sixu, has a male performing the sleeve dance painted on the walls; and sculpted on the tomb tiles of Tengxian of the 6th century in Honan is an all male orchestra marching in procession. The rebirth of the soul in Buddhist literature is promised to all followers of Amida in the Sukh?vati-vy?ha, translated as early as the 2nd century; the faithful are reborn in the Paradise of the West (Soper 1959a: 167). For the most pious worshippers of Amida, a personal escort to heaven by the Buddha of the West was promised. The oldest extant representation of the Western Paradise is from the mid 6th century at Xiangtangshan (Sickman 1956: pi. 42) and numerous examples of the paradise with its celestial towers, jewelled pavilions, lotus ponds, divine music makers and dancers are painted on the walls of the cave chapels at Dunhuang from the Tang period. There descending on clouds that fill the skies are Buddhas of other realms with their small entourages who assemble to hear the sermon of the Buddha of the West (10). The (8) A tomb figurine of the Tang has similarly done the same adjusting of his skirt length; see A Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Oriental Arts 1970: vol. I, pi. 90. (9) Akiyama (1969); for a Han tomb banquet scene with male orchestra, see Liao Yang p. 117; for the tomb of Si Sixu dated 745, see p. 115; for the Teng Xien tiles see A Pictorial Encyclopedia 1970: pi. 72. (10) Chugoku Sekkutsu Tonko Bakkotsu 1982: vol. II, pi. 103 for Cave 217, and pi. 171 for Cave 445. 226 [12]</page><page sequence="13">placing of the ascent of the soul on the western side of the reliquary makes identification of the Buddha escorting the tomb master with Amida or one of his emissaries plausible; but no known representation of the escort of Amida can be cited as precedent although the so-called 'Raigo' paintings become so very popular in Heian Japan (Seckel 1963: 95). Turning to the Tang stele of 715 with the Parinirv?na cycle engraved on its reverse face, is an image of the ascent of the Buddha in the upper right-hand side: there transported on a cloud and surrounded by attendants the Buddha Shaka goes up to heaven (following his cremation pictured on the left). But it is unlike the reliquary depiction where the tomb master, and not the Buddha, is clearly being transported, accompanied by a Buddha. Whether the destination of the soul is understood to be the Paradise of the West or the Paradise of Shaka, as described in the Lotus S?tra (Soper 1959a: 182) is not entirely clear. By the Tang era however the doctrine of four paradises of the cardinal directions was formulated and Shaka and Amida each have their own (Soper 1959a: 183). It is interesting to view the reliquary and its ornamentation in relation to like objects. The use of reliquaries shaped as architectural miniatures has a great antiquity. Among the earliest reliquaries of Gandh?ra is the 'Kaniska' reliquary dated by inscription to the first year of his reign (Rowland 1967: pi. 38a): it is a canister shape with lid decorated with various deities ? Buddha, Indra, Brahma, and Kaniska himself. The Bimaran reliquary has a taller shape and lacks its lid; it too is adorned with deities including the Buddha who are housed in an ogee-arched arcade (Rowland 1956: pi. 38b). Many such coffers have been found in Gandh?ra attesting to its widespread popularity (Osaka National Museum 1984: pi. Ill, nos. 1-3). In addition the Guardian King of the North was identifiable by his attribute ? a st?pa-shaped reliquary which he holds aloft in his right hand, as he is seen at Longmen in the Fengxian temple dated 672-75 {Lungmen Shihkou 1969: pi. 113). In China st?pa-shaped reliquaries are found. One painted on the wall of cave 428 at Dunhuang ascribed to the early 6th century (Chugoku Bukkutsu, I, 1982: pi. 165) was based on a Gandharan original, as was the 'Asokan Reliquary' housed in a temple in Zejiang named after the famous relic, the Ayuwangsi (Soper 1940: 657). A Tang object is similarly fashioned (Omura 1915, III: pi. 432, 647). All these Chinese Gandharan-style st?pas have narrative ornament carved on their sides ? episodes from the life of the Buddha. The Tang reliquary with the Parinirv?na scene is part of the ancient tradition of architecturally shaped containers with narrative decoration of the events from the life of the Buddha, but it has been altered to accommodate Chinese preferences in its palatial shape and narrative style. The question remains do the various objects found in the temple basement belong to the same period of time. The tomb of Chen Weijiang, disrupted by the building of the temple was restored and incorporated into the basement of the temple, according to the theory of the authors of the archaeological report. The epitaph was fixed into the upper part of the wall, a hole was drilled through the center, and a mirror suspended from it. Placed at the center of the room, the reliquary was supported [13] 227</page><page sequence="14">by a brick base; the tomb tiles with seated Buddhas or celestial musicians were set into the side walls. As for appropriateness the tomb record states that Chen was a devotee of Buddhism as well as Taoism, and that he was knowledgeable in the scriptures; though which specific scriptures are not identified. As for place, both the temple and Chen's commission of Escort Yamen and his burial site are all located in Lingtai county. But in a stylistic analysis of the reliquary both the narrative and decorative ornament seem considerably earlier than the date provided by the tomb record of A.D. 850. For example, in the Parinirv?na scene the figures are more complexly and interestingly grouped behind and to the left of the death bed than in the Dunhuang Sui paintings. Moreover the small groups of figures are convincingly drawn in naturalistic scale, dramatically posed and individually responding to the event. The variety of characters, poses and dramatic content, and richness of spatial definition by placement of the figures are more similar to the 692 steles or the 715 engraving, but the artificiality, mannerism and exaggeration of the late Tang period, exemplified by Cave 159 at Dunhuang are lacking. In addition, the style of the Buddha carved in the ascent scene is characteristic of the early 8th century when the International style with its Western emphasis on the body and naturalistic detail is apparent. The garment for example, covers both shoulders, but falls clear of the chest and mid section, exposing them to view ? the body is modelled, anatomically defined and fleshy, like the Buddhas of the early Tang at Tianlongshanm Cave XXI (Sickman 1957: pi. 55 b). The informality of the pose, relaxed treatment of the drapery and natural scale betray a period earlier than the mature Tang with its formal, austere and majestic Buddhas. Finally the reliquary has a stepped hour-glass shaped base decorated with upturned and downturned lotus petals. This style of base was in use as early as the 5th century in bronze icons of seated Buddhas such as the one dated 477 of the Northern Wei and which continues on well into the Tang, for example at Longmen, Kanjinqsi from the early 8th century or the stone stele from the Zhangan period (n). The raised round balls on the double lotus leaves of the pedestal is also a motif which can be found among 5th century Buddhist bases; for example the Northern Wei bronze seated Buddha dated 443, or the stone seated Buddha from the Imperial Household collection in Tokyo dated 638 (12). In summation the reliquary seems to be over 100 years earlier in its date of manufacture than the death date of Chen, but it still may have been one of Chen's or his family's possessions preserved as an antique and then appropriated for his ashes.
