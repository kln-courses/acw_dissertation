<plain_text><page sequence="1">Low-Involvement Learning: Memory without Evaluation SCOTT A. HAWKINS STEPHEN J. HOCH* In three learning experiments we examined how subjects' level of involvement during initial exposure to consumer trivia influences what they learn and what they sub- sequently come to believe. Subjects rated consumer trivia statements aq more true when they had been exposed to those statements earlier in the experiment. Simple repetition increased subsequent truth ratings. Moreover, when subjects processed the information during initial exposure in a less involving fashion, the effect of repetition on truth became more pronounced. Familiarity emerged as a key mediator of the truth effect. When subjects experienced an "it rings a bell" reaction, they judged the information to be more true. Finally, under low-involvement processing, the truth effect increased when subjects engaged in a processing task (rote rehearsal) that increased familiarity without increasing evaluative processing of the information. C onsumers confront a daily barrage of marketing information. Previous studies have estimated that the average American consumer is exposed to between 200 and 500 promotional messages every day (Britt, Adams, and Miller 1972). Furthermore, these messages often occur at a frenetic pace. Clearly, consumers do not actively process all of these messages. Bauer and Greyser (1968) found that consumers were aware of only about 15 percent of the daily promotional activity in their environment. In addition, only 30 percent of the noticed ads generated any active processing (i.e., consumers reported that the ads were informative, en- joyable, annoying, or offensive). This suggests that con- sumers process many promotional messages with min- imal levels of involvement. Often exposure conditions do not afford consumers the opportunity to engage in extensive processing of message details. Moreover, even when situational factors are more conducive to elabo- rative processing, consumer motivation is likely to be low because the outcomes of most purchase decisions tend to be inconsequential (Deighton 1983). Krugman (1965) was one of the first to argue that the high-involvement persuasion model, which portrays advertising as a means to overcome resistant attitudes, might not always offer the most appropriate criteria for gauging advertising effectiveness (also see Hoch and Deighton 1989). Krugman (1965, pp. 350-35 1) argued that "so much of TV advertising content is trivial and sometimes even silly. Nevertheless, trivia have their own special qualities, and some of these may be important to our understanding of the commercial or the non- commercial use and impact of mass media.. . . Much of advertising content is learned as meaningless non- sense material . . . nonsensical a la Ebbinghaus and unimportant a la Hovland alike." We agree with Krug- man, and, thus, the objective of this article is to study marketing communication as a form of consumer trivia-and to see how memory for such trivia, by itself, can influence consumers' beliefs. Numerous persuasion studies have found that the memory-persuasion link is weak, at best. So why should we study memory? The reason is that we focus on the learning of consumer beliefs, not persuasion. In clut- tered, fast-moving media environments in which mo- tivation and opportunity to engage in elaborative pro- cessing are low, we contend that memory will emerge as an important determinant of consumer belief. The rest of the article is organized as follows. First, we position our work with respect to existing research on low-involvement decision making, persuasion, and learning. Next, we present the results of three learning experiments that required subjects to process a large number of consumption-related trivia statements under different levels of involvement. In line with previous research, we found that higher involvement (greater elaboration) led to better memory. However, the infor- mation that subjects did remember had a greater impact on belief when it was learned under low involvement. *Scott A.

In a final experiment we demonstrate that some low-involvement processing tasks generate better memory than others. A low-in- volvement, rote rehearsal processing task generated better memory without increasing evaluative processing of information, thereby yielding the largest repetition- induced increases in belief. We conclude by relating our findings to current marketing communication practice. LOW-INVOLVEMENT DECISION MAKING, PERSUASION, AND LEARNING Earlier we suggested that consumers often lack the motivation, ability, or opportunity to respond to mar- keting communications in a thoughtful manner. Batra and Ray (1986) refer to these deficits as the antecedents of low-involvement processing. To place our work in an appropriate context, we will review briefly the in- volvement literature in consumer behavior as it relates to decision making, persuasion, and learning. Low-Involvement Decision Making In the late 1970s both Kassarjian (1978) and 01- s'havsky and Granbois (1979) questioned the general- izability of research on multiattribute choice heuristics to real consumer behavior. They argued that for many purchases a deliberate decision process never occurs, because consumers are not sufficiently motivated to think deeply about the mundane consumption decisions they usually face. Indeed, Hoyer (1984) found little ev- idence of extensive, in-store decision making during laundry detergent purchases: consumers often em- ployed simple heuristics (e.g., "Buy the cheapest brand"). A number of recent studies have examined the decision heuristics that consumers employ when they lack the ability, opportunity, or motivation to en- gage in a more effortful decision strategy. For example, Sujan (1985) found that novices (i.e., low-ability con- sumers) rely on schema-based category affect whereas experts more often engage in attribute-based evaluation. Alba and Marmorstein (1987) found that memory for simple frequency information concerning the number of positive attributes relative to the number of negative attributes can influence judgment and choice when other relevant types of information have been poorly encoded, poorly understood, or are difficult to retrieve. Hoyer and Brown (1990), examining another heuristic for low-involvement decision making, found that con- sumers who are aware of the name of one of the brands in a product category will repeatedly choose that brand, even when it offers objectively determined lower quality. Consumers who are unfamiliar with the brand names often will experiment with and eventually settle on a brand that offers higher quality. Time pressure commonly influences consumers' op- portunity to engage in effortful decision strategies. Payne, Bettman, and Johnson (1988) demonstrate that consumers who are faced with making a choice under time pressure (lack of opportunity) will accelerate in- formation processing, ignore certain pieces of infor- mation, or shift to simpler heuristics. Perhaps the sim- plest low-involvement decision heuristic involves the retrieval of previously formed affect associated with the product (Peter and Nord 1982). Lynch, Marmorstein, and Weigold (1988) report that consumers retrieve pre- viously formed evaluations of products when these are accessible and diagnostic. In sum, consumers often make quick decisions with little or no cognitive elab- oration on choice-relevant information. In such situa- tions memory for product information or evaluations may play an important role. Involvement and Persuasion Involvement also plays an important role in the per- suasion process. Numerous studies have found that high involvement increases memory for message information (e.g., Gardner, Mitchell, and Russo 1985). Celsi and Olson (1988) and Greenwald and Leavitt (1984) argue that this better memory results from elaborative pro- cessing, which facilitates the encoding and organization of the message within the individual's existing cognitive structure. Higher involvement increases the accessibility of message details, which leads to improved recall and shorter response latencies. High involvement also increases the number of the consumer's own thoughts generated in reaction to a persuasive message (Greenwald 1968). Osterhouse and Brock (1970) found that distraction (low opportunity) led to increased attitude change by inhibiting the gen- eration of counterarguments. This result would suggest that low involvement leads to greater persuasion. This is indeed what happens when the appeal is counterat- titudinal, because such messages tend to elicit counter- argumentation. However, for proattitudinal appeals, high involvement can increase persuasion because the additional thoughts that subjects generate tend to be positive (Petty and Cacioppo 1979). In addition to the sheer number of cognitive re- sponses, high involvement also produces more "cen- tral" thoughts. Chaiken (1980) and Petty, Cacioppo, and Schumann (1983) have demonstrated that periph- eral cues, like the credibility and attractiveness of the source, have a much bigger impact on persuasion under low-involvement conditions. Note, however, that even peripheral processing involves some elaboration, albeit with "less relevant" cues. The level of involvement also interacts with message repetition. Cacioppo and Petty (1979) showed that there is an inverted U relation between repetition and per- suasion, in which attitudes first increase and then de- crease with exposure. Cognitive responses clearly me-</page><page sequence="3">214 JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH diated persuasion, as favorable thoughts first increased and then decreased with continued exposure while neg- ative thoughts displayed the opposite pattern. Thus, the first few exposures allowed subjects to appreciate the favorable implications of the message, but subsequent presentations encouraged subjects to generate more criticisms of the persuasive message. Likewise, Batra and Ray (1986) demonstrated that repetition of message arguments will lead to an eventual decline in the fa- vorability of consumer attitudes under high involve- ment, but they also made the interesting finding that repetition continues to increase the favorability of at- titudes under low-involvement message processing. In summary, involvement increases memory but of- ten decreases persuasion. As Batra and Ray ( 1986) sug- gested, repetition tends to increase brand attitudes in low-involvement conditions in which support and counterargument generation are low. However, in- creased involvement increases self-generated evaluative thoughts. As Sternthal and Craig ( 1982) cogently argue, it is almost always the case that message content will be phrased in a more positive light than the thoughts generated by the audience. So, at the time of learning, not only is the marketer's message learned, consumers also learn their own evaluation of the message. These consumer evaluations dilute the favorability of the strongly positioned advocacy, especially under high in- volvement, when more own thoughts are generated. Greenwald and Leavitt (1984) present a general framework to capture the variations in processing across levels of involvement. They argue that it is useful to consider not only the antecedent conditions of a con- sumer's level of involvement, but also the cognitive processing associated with different levels of involve- ment. Their framework consists of four levels of in- creasingly effortful symbolic analysis: preattention, fo- cal attention, comprehension, and elaboration. At the lowest levels, processing is restricted to sensory buffering and feature analysis, while at the highest levels pro- cessing involves linking the message to existing con- ceptual knowledge. For Greenwald and Leavitt, the level of involvement is conceptualized as the amount of at- tentional capacity devoted to encoding a particular piece of information (Craik and Lockhart 1972). In presenting our experimental work, we will return to Greenwald and Leavitt's framework to motivate our involvement manipulations. Low-Involvement Learning and Belief Although persuasion research on involvement has been informative, we feel that the full range of involve- ment levels has not been adequately explored. To be specific, the low-involvement conditions in the typical cognitive-response persuasion experiment still seem reasonably involving compared with the natural con- ditions under which consumers inattentively process advertising information.' Much of the previously cited work on involvement has invoked Krugman's (1965) initial conceptualization, but few studies have focused on the particular task that was central to Krugman's argument. Krugman's thesis was that consumers learn infor- mation from marketing communications in different manners depending on their level of involvement. He proposed that an uninvolved "public lets down its guard to the repetitive commercial use of the television me- dium and that it easily changes its ways of perceiving products and brands and its purchasing behavior with- out thinking very much about it at the time of TV ex- posure or at any time prior to purchase, and without then changing verbalized attitudes" (Krugman 1965, p. 354). Assael (1984, p. 82) provides an illustration of the type of processing that Krugman suggested: "The consumer sits in front of the television and sees an ad- vertisement for Morton Salt that describes it as 'easy to pour.' Stifling a yawn, the consumer is thinking about anything but salt. The advertisement is not really eval- uated. It is seen, and a few bits and pieces of information are stored in the consumer's mind without any active cognitive process. But over time an association of Mor- ton Salt with ease of pouring is established." This ex- ample highlights three aspects of low-involvement learning. First, low-involvement learning occurs when consumers attend to marketing communications with- out explicitly intending to evaluate and learn from the message. Second, without an explicit intention to eval- uate the message, the consumer does not link the mes- sage to personal needs, brand beliefs, or past experi- ences. Third, with continued repetition, the consumer comes to believe the claim that is being made in the message. According to this view of consumer learning, simple repetition of a message can be an effective means of changing consumers' beliefs about products. Krugman's view of low-involvement learning and belief change quite obviously was influenced by classical attitude theorists (e.g., Hovland, Janis, and Kelley 1953) who assumed an intrinsic relation between memory and persuasion. Two decades of research on cognitive re- sponse and the elaboration likelihood model (Petty and Cacioppo 1986) have shown that the classical view was naive and oversold. The link between memory and per- suasion is much more complicated than originally be- lieved. For the consumer actively processing informa- tion, message memory is only one of many information sources (e.g., the consumer's own thoughts, experience, word-of-mouth) influencing belief. We suspect, how- ever, that for the less attentive, low-involvement con- sumer, the memory-belief relation is more important 'One could argue that personal relevance is relatively low in any experimental setting. However, situational or response involvement is likely to be relatively high in studies that place great emphasis on the explicit generation and explanation of a relatively small number of responses.</page><page sequence="4">LOW-INVOLVEMENT LEARNING 215 and more direct. So, to learn more about the relation between low-involvement learning and belief change, we turn to recent research on memory in the verbal learning tradition that examines the role of sheer rep- etition on belief formation. The Truth Effect. Hasher, Goldstein, and Toppino (1977) reported an early demonstration of the impact of repetition on belief. Subjects judged the validity of general knowledge statements from various categories (e.g., politics, science, art). These judgments were made during three separate sessions at two-week intervals. There was no feedback provided to subjects on the ac- tual truth value of statements. The findings indicated that "repeated statements were more likely to be judged true than similar, non-repeated statements" (Hasher et al. 1977, p. 111). This repetition-induced increase in judged validity now goes under the rubric of the "truth effect." A number of studies have tested the generality of the truth effect and found that it is robust across a variety of stimuli and procedures. The increase in judged va- lidity does not depend on the actual truth value of the statement (Arkes, Hackett, and Boehm 1989; Bacon 1979; Gigerenzer 1984; Hasher et al. 1977; Schwartz 1982). In addition, repetition increases agreement with opinion statements (e.g., "judges are far too lenient on criminals") as well as factual trivia statements (Arkes et al. 1989). Schwartz (1982) found that repetition can increase judged validity even when the repetitions occur within the same experimental session, and Gigerenzer (1984) found that the magnitude of the truth effect did not depend on whether there was a one- or two-week delay between sessions. A second procedural variation involves the task performed during the initial exposure to the stimuli. Early studies of the truth effect required subjects to assess the validity of the statements during the first session. Schwartz (1982) found that repetition increased the perceived validity statements even when subjects were instructed to "try to remember the mean- ing" of the statements in the first session.2 Mechanisms. Bacon (1979) was one of the first to suggest a mechanism for the operation of the truth effect: The critical mediator of belief is the subjects' awareness that the item has been previously encoun- tered. That is, only those statements that are recognized as having been repeated should increase in validity. We label this the recognition account. Although perceived and actual repetition statuses are closely related, they can be empirically distinguished. Bacon (1979) collected recognition data for each statement and classified re- sponses to each type of statement (new, old) by their perceived repetition status (new, old). Perceived repe- tition status had a significant impact on truth ratings, while actual repetition status was only marginally sig- nificant; thus, recognition is a critical determinant of the truth effect. A second explanation for the truth effect also invokes the notion that subjects infer validity on the basis of other characteristics of the memory trace (cf. Roediger 1990). Thefamiliarity account postulates that repetition increases familiarity with the semantic content in the statement and that this familiarity serves as a cue to validity independent of the ability to recognize the con- text of exposure. Schwartz (1982) found that experi- mental presentation of statements increased subjects' perceptions that they had heard the statement both be- fore and in the experiment. Begg, Armour, and Kerr (1985) had subjects initially read a list of gene'ral topics and later rate the truth of related or unrelated state- ments. Simply exposing subjects to the general topic was sufficient to increase their belief in later, related statements (see also Arkes, Boehm, and Xu 1991). The familiarity account suggests that subjects ask themselves the question, Does this statement generally ring a bell? and if they answer in the affirmative, they judge the statement to be more true. Arkes et al. (1989) also present findings consistent with the familiarity hypothesis. They replicated the truth effect, but only when subjects reported some ex- pertise with the topic areas. They suggest that the failure to find a truth effect for low-expertise domains reflects the deficit that novices have in remembering any topic- relevant material (Chase and Simon 1973). That is, repetition does not increase familiarity as much for novices, because they lack sufficient prior knowledge to encode the exposure in memory. The familiarity account is distinguished from the recognition account because it operates at a more gen- eral level. Rather than postulate that subjects explicitly perform a recognition judgment (i.e., retrieving the particular context of the previous occurrence) before assessing validity, it suggests that repetition activates or primes the general topic, which creates a sense of familiarity and a consequent increase in belief. Al- though there is a psychological distinction between rec- ognition and familiarity (Mandler 1980), we will not explicitly address the distinction between these two mechanisms in this article. In the first two experiments we assume that recognition judgments provide a useful surrogate measure of familiarity. In the third experi- ment we explicitly ask subjects to indicate their degree of familiarity with each of the claims. Why might consumers rely on memory for a claim to assess its validity? One possibility is that people might find it easier to determine whether they have previously heard a claim than to explicitly retrieve relevant infor- mation from memory to compute the plausibility of that claim (Reder 1979). Thus, familiarity might serve as a cue to validity in the same manner that ease of retrieval (availability) is used as a cue to judge proba- bility (Tversky and Kahneman 1973). In addition, fa- 2Note, however, that Schwartz (1982) did not explicitly manipulate the initial processing task within her experiments.</page><page sequence="5">216 JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH miliarity might be a good cue to validity in many con- texts. If everyday conversation is guided by a desire to convey useful and correct information (Grice 1975), then familiar statements are more likely to be true than unfamiliar statements. Note, however, that heuristics can have unintended negative consequences when used in inappropriate circumstances. For example, Lichten- stein et al. (1978) demonstrated that the relative fre- quency of media reporting on causes of death influences the memorability of various causes of death and has an impact on judgments of the probability of various causes of death. The problem with using the availability heu- ristic in this context is that actual frequencies are only weakly correlated with the frequency of media reports. EXPERIMENT 1 In this first study, we had three goals. First, we wanted to see if we could produce a reliable truth effect using stimuli closer to what consumers would be exposed to in the marketplace: product-related claims. Second, we were interested in the role of memory in generating the truth effect. Although previous studies have shown that the truth effect is related to recognition judgments (Ba- con 1979), studies of the mere exposure effect (repetition leads to increased liking of stimuli) have concluded that recognition is not necessary to generate increases in af- fect (Bornstein 1989). To clarify the relationship (or lack thereof) between the truth effect and the mere ex- posure effect, it is important to investigate the role of memory as a mediating factor. Consequently, we also included a measure of memory for the claims (a rec- ognition judgment). Finally, we wanted to examine the influence of processing involvement at initial exposure on the truth effect. Our hypothesis, which was based on Krugman's (1965) thinking, was that the truth effect would be greater following low-involvement learning. Specifically, low-involvement subjects would be more likely to rely on familiarity when assessing truth, be- cause they would have generated fewer of their own evaluative thoughts during session 1. With a high-in- volvement processing task, subjects can rely on their sense of familiarity and/or their own evaluative thoughts, which are easily accessible because of their activation during session 1. Thus, when the claims are initially learned under high involvement, the influence of memory for the claim may be diluted by the avail- ability of relevant personal knowledge activated during the initial elaborative processing task. Method The basic experimental procedure was common to all three studies reported here and was similar to pre- vious truth-effect studies. Subjects were shown con- sumption-related trivia statements during two different sessions. Some of the statements were shown in either the first or second session, and other statements were repeated in both sessions. Stimulus Development. Over 250 consumption-re- lated statements were generated for pretesting. The statements were inspired by a variety of sources, in- cluding consumer testing services (e.g., Consumer Re- ports, Consumer's Research), consumption advice newspaper columns (e.g., "Hints from Heloise"), pub- lished industry statistics (e.g., Billboard, Variety, Pro- gressive Grocer), and health and medicine reference books. Each statement was verifiable as true or false according to the above-mentioned sources. The items were generated to maximize heterogeneity. Half the statements were actually true; the other half were false. Some statements concerned specific brands (e.g., Lis- terine), and others referred to more general categories, including products (ibuprofen, chicken) and medical problems (Lyme disease, warts). Some statements spoke about specific product attributes (length of warranty), and some involved more global evaluations (the "best" or "worst" brand of x). Some statements were explicitly comparative (brand X is better than brand Y), and oth- ers were noncomparative. Finally, statements were worded either in a positive tone that mentioned benefits or in a negative tone that mentioned drawbacks. Illus- trative statements are displayed in Table 1 (this table indicates the range of statements used in the experi- ments but not their relative frequencies). The statements were then shown to 109 people from the same population as the experimental subjects. Re- spondents rated the likely truth of the statements on a one-to-seven ("definitely false" to "definitely true") scale. Our goal was to develop a set of experimental stimuli that were ambiguous with respect to truth value but, at the same time, not so obscure that subjects would have no relevant prior knowledge about the subject matter (see Arkes et al. 1989). The 156 statements se- lected as experimental stimuli had mean truth ratings that ranged from 3.2 to 4.8 in the pretest. Only items with unimodal truth distributions were selected. The mean rating of the true items was 4.13, and, for the false items, it was 4.14. Procedure. The statements were presented to sub- jects on a color computer monitor. Subjects participated in two sessions separated by an unrelated filler task that lasted a minimum of 20 minutes. The experiment lasted about one hour. For each subject, the 156 items were randomly divided into three sets of 52: subjects saw new items once during session 1 (new 1 items); subjects saw a different set of new items once during session 2 (new2 items); and subjects saw repeated (old) items during both sessions. Not only did each subject see unique, randomly created sets of new 1, new2, and old items, but the statements also were presented to each subject in a different random order. These two forms of randomization minimize potential confounds that could result from prior familiarity and primacy or re- cency effects. The computer also controlled how long</page><page sequence="6">LOW-INVOLVEMENT LEARNING 217 TABLE I ILLUSTRATIVE CONSUMER TRIVIA STATEMENTS USED IN THE EXPERIMENTS Statement Truth Specificity Evaluation Valence Comparative Consumers are more satisfied with State Farm homeowner's insurance than with Allstate T Brand Global Positive Comparative Red Lobster is the largest full-service dinner restaurant in the United States T Brand Global Positive Noncomparative Weight Watchers is the worst-selling name-brand sweetener T Brand Global Negative Noncomparative Prolonged use of Alka-Seltzer can lead to the formation of kidney stones T Brand Attribute Negative Noncomparative Antihistamines have no effect on the common cold T Nonbrand Attribute Negative Noncomparative All nondietetic margarines contain the same amount of saturated fat F Nonbrand Attribute Negative Noncomparative Buffered aspirin tends to work more slowly than unbuffered aspirin F Nonbrand Attribute Negative Comparative Stone-ground flour retains more nutrients than conventional flour F Nonbrand Attribute Positive Comparative Rose hips vitamin C is better for the body than synthetic vitamin C F Nonbrand Global Positive Comparative The municipal water in Houston was rated higher on sensory qualities (e.g., x taste, smell) than the municipal water in New York City F Brand Global Positive Comparative each item was exposed and recorded subjects' ratings and response times. In session 1, subjects saw a total of 104 statements, 52 newl and 52 old items. Unlike previous studies of the truth effect, ours actually manipulated the subject's processing task during the first exposure. Half of the subjects engaged in a high-involvement, truth-evalua- tion task. They rated the truth or falsity of each item on the seven-point scale previously described (subjects also used the same scale during session 2). The other half of the subjects engaged in a low-involvement, com- prehension task (Lichtenstein and Srull 1987) by rating each statement on a seven-point scale (1 = "difficult to understand" and 7 = "easy to understand"). Note that this ordering of task involvement corresponds directly to Greenwald and Leavitt's (1984) hierarchy, which implies that the truth evaluation task (Do I believe it?) will create more elaborative processing than a compre- hension task (Do I understand it?). During session 2, subjects saw 52 new2 items and the 52 old items. For each item, they first made a truth judgment on the seven-point scale, and then they made a recognition judgment, indicating whether they had previously seen the item in session 1 (yes or no). Two other independent variables were manipulated: item exposure time in session 1 and delay between sessions 1 and 2. In session 1, items stayed on the screen for either three seconds or eight seconds. In addition, be- tween sessions 1 and 2 there was either a 20-minute delay (the unrelated filler task) or a one-week delay. The objective of these manipulations was to influence both the opportunity for high-involvement processing (exposure time) and the level of memory for the items (delay). Subjects and Design. Subjects were 96 undergrad- uate and graduate students who were paid six dollars each for their participation. The basic design was a 24 factorial. Item type (old vs. new) was a repeated factor. Level of processing involvement (evaluation vs. com- prehension instructions), session 1 exposure time (three seconds vs. eight seconds), and delay between sessions (20 minutes vs. one week) were between-subjects fac- tors. Results Analyses were conducted at the level of both the sub- ject and the individual item. Recognition scores, re- action times, and truth ratings served as dependent variables. The exposure-duration variable will not be considered further in our reporting of results, because it was never significant as a main effect or as part of any interactions.3 Statistical tests (F-tests) at the subject level are based on 1, 92 degrees of freedom, and tests at the item level are based on 1, 155 degrees of freedom. Recognition Performance. Across the board, rec- ognition rates were very high; subjects made correct recognition judgments more than 85 percent of the time. A MANOVA was conducted with percent correct recognition as the repeated measure (i.e., hit rate for old items and correct rejections for new items). It is surprising that recognition rates were higher for new (X = .90) than for old (X = .8 1) items (F = 17.8, p &lt; .001). Delay between sessions also had a pronounced effect on recognition accuracy (no delay, X = .92; delay, X - .79; F = 49.4, p &lt; .000 1). Finally, high-involvement processing (X = .89) produced better recognition per- formance than low-involvement processing (X= .82; F = 14.2, p &lt; .001). There were no significant inter- actions. Analyses of reaction times uncovered results con- gruent with the recognition data. First, subjects re- sponded to old items (X = 5.6 seconds) faster than to 3Although we provided eight seconds in the high-exposure-duration condition, the average subject's processing time during this initial exposure was only about four seconds. Thus, subjects failed to use this opportunity to generate meaningful elaborations.</page><page sequence="7">218 JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH FIGURE 1 TRUTH RATINGS FOR ACTUAL AND PERCEIVED OLD AND NEW ITEMS BY LEVEL OF INVOLVEMENT: EXPERIMENT 1 Average Truth Rating 4.8 * Perceived Old Actual Old 4.6- 4.4 - * Actual New ..............

However, we did find that the difference between old and new items was greater under high involvement (old minus new X. - 1.3 seconds) than under low involve- ment (old minus new X: -0.5 seconds; F = 1 1.0, p &lt; .001). Simple effects tests indicate that the reaction times are equivalent across involvement for new items (X = 6.4 vs. 6.6 seconds), but reaction times for old items were significantly shorter for the high-involve- ment task than for the low-involvement task (X = 5.1 vs. 6.2 seconds). This last result, coupled with the rec- ognition data, suggests that our involvement manipu- lation did indeed encourage subjects to process the stimuli at different levels of detail during session 1; the higher-involvement truth-evaluation task made re- peated items more accessible during session 2 (Reder 1979). Truth Judgments. Two sets of analyses are reported. The first set of analyses used average truth ratings of old and new items during session 2 as a repeated de- pendent variable; this analysis measures the effect of actual repetition status. We also computed average truth ratings on the basis of perceived repetition status (i.e., whether the subjects thought they had or had not seen the item in session 1). The statistically significant effects are shown in Figure 1. In terms of actual repetition status, as shown by the solid lines, there was a significant main effect of repetition (F = 23.0, p &lt; .000 1): old items FIGURE 2 PATH ANALYSES SHOWING RELATIONS AMONG REPETITION, RECOGNITION, AND TRUTH RATINGS BY LEVEL OF INVOLVEMENT: EXPERIMENT 1 High Involvement .07 (-.06) Repetition -83 Recognition (316 &gt;Truth Low Involvement .23 (0.0) Repetition 63 Recognition .46 &gt; Truth (.46) NOTE.-Numbers represent simple linear regression coefficients; numbers in parentheses are multiple regression coefficients. were evaluated as more true than new items (old minus new: X = .15). Simple effects tests confirm that the truth effect was significant in both the low- (old minus new: X= .23) and high- (old minus new: X= .07) involve- ment conditions (both p's &lt; .05). These results replicate the basic truth effect found in previous studies, this time using consumer trivia. Also there was a significant rep- etition-by-involvement interaction (F = 6.6, p &lt; .01), as indicated by the fanning out between the old and new lines in Figure 1. Truth ratings of old items in- creased substantially across levels of involvement (p &lt; .001), whereas involvement had no effect on new items (p &gt; .2). When perceived repetition status serves as the dependent variable, both the repetition main effect (F = 67.3, p &lt; .0001) and the repetition-by- involvement interaction (F = 13.0, p &lt; .001) become more pronounced. Delay between sessions and exposure time had no effect on truth ratings in either the actual or perceived repetition data. Moreover, the actual truth of the items had no effect on the results. Both actually true and actually false items were judged more valid after repetition. In the second set of analyses, hierarchical regression models were fitted to the 104 truth ratings in session 2 on a subject-by-subject basis. For each subject, truth ratings were regressed on repetition status (old vs. new2); recognition status (yes vs. no); and both repe- tition status and recognition status. In addition, rec- ognition was regressed on repetition. Average linear regression coefficients for the two involvement condi- tions are reported in path diagrams in Figure 2; multiple regression coefficients are in parentheses. The multiple regression coefficients are useful in detecting mediating relations between repetition, recognition, and the cri-</page><page sequence="8">LOW-INVOLVEMENT LEARNING 219 terion-truth ratings. These unstandardized coefficients correspond closely to the previously reported (old minus new) effect sizes. First consider the results for repetition status. There is a main effect of repetition; the average coefficient of .15 is significantly different from zero (F = 22.6, p &lt; .0001). Moreover, low-involvement processing leads to a larger truth effect (X = .23) than high-involvement processing (X= .07; F = 6.5, p &lt; .0 1), although both simple effects are significantly different from zero (p &lt; .05). What is more interesting is that, when recog- nition is included in the model (as in an ANCOVA), the positive effect of repetition is eliminated. In fact, the repetition effect reverses sign (X =-.03), though it is not significant (F &lt; 1). The repetition-by-involvement interaction also drops to nonsignificance (F &lt; 1). This analysis suggests that recognition, which we assume is a surrogate for familiarity, is mediating the truth effect. As expected, repetition has a large influence on recog- nition (X = .73). High-involvement processing increases the influence of repetition on recognition (X = .83 vs. .63; F = 13.3, p &lt; .00 1), and delay has a similar impact (X = .83 vs. .56; F = 46.2, p &lt; .0001). Finally, in ex- amining the effect of recognition on truth ratings, we find that recognition exerts a much greater influence on truth ratings after low-involvement learning (X = .46) than after high-involvement learning (X = .16; F 14.9, p &lt; .001). This result suggests that subjects rely much less on the recognition cue after engaging in high-involvement processing in session 1. The dimin- ished impact of recognition on truth ratings under high involvement probably occurs because high-involvement subjects can retrieve their previous session 1 truth rat- ings (Lynch et al. 1988) and because relevant prior knowledge is more accessible as a result of earlier ac- tivation (see the recognition data reported earlier). This interpretation is consistent with results reported by Srull (1983), who found a smaller truth effect for subjects with high levels of expertise. Presumably, expert subjects have relevant prior knowledge that is more accessible and are less likely to rely exclusively on the familiarity of the statement to judge its validity. Individual Item Analyses. We also analyzed the data at the item level by collapsing across subjects. For each item, we computed a variety of new variables. Us- ing an item's average understanding rating (from the low-involvement condition) and the item's average truth effect (the difference between the mean truth rat- ings for the item when it is presented once or twice), we found a positive correlation between understanda- bility and the truth effect (r = .22, p &lt; .01). It is possible that items that are difficult to understand may not "connect" with existing knowledge. These items are less likely to be encoded at session 1 and seem less familiar when repeated during session 2. This interpretation is consistent with the significant positive correlation be- tween the mean understanding rating for an item and the correct recognition rate for that item (r = .19, p &lt; .01). To determine whether the truth effect is equally likely for all items, we also developed a proxy for an item's difficulty (i.e., the percentage of subjects correctly iden- tifying an item's actual truth value). An item's relative difficulty was calculated as the absolute difference be- tween its actual truth value (1 = false, 7 = true) and its average truth rating. Here we found a curvilinear re- lation between truth and difficulty (both the linear and quadratic coefficients of a multiple regression were sig- nificant at the .0001 level); easier items (i.e., items that were obviously true or false) showed the smallest truth effects (multiple r = .33, p &lt; .0001). The "optimal" truth effect was achieved when the absolute deviation between actual truth and average truth ratings was 3.1 (or an average truth rating of about four on a seven- point scale for both true and false items). Thus, items with the most ambiguous truth status are the most likely to show an increase in validity as a function of repeated exposure: it is very unlikely that an item that is known with a high degree of certainty to be true or false will be rated differently on the basis of small changes in repetition-induced familiarity. Finally, we examined relations between the type of item and the truth effect. The only significant difference we found was that pos- itively worded items were associated with larger truth effects than negatively worded items (t = 2.1, p &lt; .05). This may be due to the fact that much of the con- sumption-oriented information encountered in day-to- day life is positively worded (e.g., advertising messages) and, therefore, positively worded trivia may seem more natural. Discussion This first experiment produced several key findings. First, we replicated the basic truth effect using con- sumption-oriented statements, which are closer to what consumers might encounter in the commercial world. Second, we found that the level of processing involve- ment moderated the effect of repetition: low-involve- ment, nonevaluative processing led to a larger truth ef- fect. Third, item memory served as a critical mediator of the truth effect, especially after low-involvement processing. Apparently, repetition increases the prob- ability that an item "rings a bell" at later viewing. As an aside, in the early stages of this research, we failed to replicate the truth effect using a different set of con- sumption statements. We speculate that one reason for the null findings was that recognition performance was quite low, only 64 percent correct hits. In retrospect, many of the items referred to fairly obscure brands ("Vivid liquid, all-fabric bleach doesn't whiten very well") and concerned quite specific, often technical points of fact ("The Amana refrigerator has a crisper with an adjustable humidity control"). It is possible that these stimuli were so novel that subjects did not have</page><page sequence="9">220 JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH enough related prior knowledge to facilitate encoding (Arkes et al. 1989). That is, repetition of an item did not ring a bell because subjects did not have any bells to ring. Of course, it is possible that with higher levels of repetition we could have obtained the truth effect in the earlier study. Whether this analysis is correct, when we developed the current experimental stimuli, we consciously created items that were easier to remember. It is worth noting how the truth effect diverges from the mere exposure effect in terms of recognition. Rec- ognition appears to be a necessary condition for the truth effect, whereas, for mere exposure, recognition is usually inhibitory (Bornstein 1989; cf. Obermiller 1985). Similarly, in studies of lexical access, brief re- petitive exposures (&lt;100 milliseconds) can improve performance by enhancing perceptual fluency without necessarily increasing recognition (Jacoby and Kelley 1987). Because our truth stimuli are complex and high in semantic content (at least compared with the tones, symbols, words, and nonwords used in mere exposure and perceptual fluency research), nonrecognition may well indicate virtual lack of activation or, at least, too little activation to cut through the clutter. EXPERIMENT 2 Our design of this study was guided by three findings from study 1 that at first seem contradictory: low-in- volvement processing produced a larger truth effect than high-involvement processing; item recognition (famil- iarity) was a critical mediator of the truth effect, es- pecially after low-involvement processing; and low-in- volvement processing produced substantially lower recognition performance. How can we reconcile the facts that recognition is a key mediator of the truth effect and that the processing condition producing the largest truth effect also leads to lower recognition? High-involvement processing leads to greater elab- oration, which, in turn, leads to greater retention and recognition. High involvement also produces more evaluative processing, based on the consumer's own thoughts, that may well limit the effects of familiarity. Thus, high involvement not only increases memory for the claim, it also increases the accessibility of relevant personal knowledge, which can also be used to assess the validity of the claim. Our goal in this study, there- fore, was to see whether we could increase the truth effect by increasing memory for the claims without in- creasing involvement and without encouraging evalu- ative processing during the first exposure. To do this we provided some subjects with an additional retrieval cue during session 2. Each item was paired with the same unique symbol during both the session 1 and ses- sion 2 exposures. Research on paired-associates learning indicates that recognition performance increases when both the item and its associate are presented at the test (Underwood 1983). We speculated that the symbol would increase memory and recognition much like a company logo or a picture accompanying an ad does (Childers and Houston 1984). Our prediction was that there would be an interaction between a symbol's pres- ence and the level of involvement. Specifically, the effect of involvement on the truth effect would be even greater when symbols were present by virtue of increasing rec- ognition without increasing evaluative processing. Method The method was virtually identical to that used in experiment 1; the same stimuli, dependent variables, and procedure were used. The only difference was that the differential exposure condition was dropped (ex- posure was a constant eight seconds) and a symbol con- dition (symbol present vs. absent) was added. The com- puter generated 180 unique symbols based on different combinations of five colors (e.g., red, blue), 12 shapes (e.g., square, triangle, circle), and three sizes (small, medium, large). For each subject, a unique symbol was paired with each of the 156 items. For the repeated (old) items, the same symbol appeared with the item during both sessions. Subjects were instructed to associate the symbol with the item because it would help them re- member the material better for a later recognition test. During session 2, subjects were reminded that if they recognized the symbol, then they had seen the item be- fore. Subjects and Design. Subjects were 96 undergrad- uate and graduate students who were paid six dollars each for their participation. The basic design was a 24 factorial. Item type (old vs. new) was a repeated factor. Level of processing involvement (evaluation vs. com- prehension instructions), delay between sessions (20 minutes vs. one week), and symbol (present vs. absent) were between-subjects factors. Results and Discussion The experiment failed in its basic objective; nev- ertheless, it was informative. First, the symbol manip- ulation did not work. Symbols had no effect on the truth effect. This lack of significant results, however, did little to impugn the logic behind our attempt to enhance the truth effect by increasing memory performance without increasing evaluative processing. This is because sym- bols had absolutely no effect on recognition perfor- mance for old items (symbols present, X = .86; and symbols absent, X = .84). Second, we replicated all the findings reported in experiment 1. In fact, we ran all the previously reported analyses again, after aggregating the data sets from both experiments. We collapsed across both the exposure condition in experiment 1 and the symbol condition in experiment 2 and included an- other independent variable to control for experiment (1 or 2). With the doubling of degrees of freedom, all effects were highly significant (repetition: F = 62.5, p &lt; .000 1; repetition by involvement: F = 14.5, p &lt; .00 1).</page><page sequence="10">LOW-INVOLVEMENT LEARNING 221 Moreover, there were no main effects or interactions due to the experiment. The first two studies indicated that the basic truth effect was a finding of small but consistent magnitude and that processing involvement had an important moderating influence on the phe- nomenon. EXPERIMENT 3 In this study we again attempted to test whether the truth effect could be increased under low-involvement processing by increasing memory without coinciden- tally encouraging evaluative processing. Using the low- involvement processing condition (comprehension) as the base case, we implemented two additional condi- tions: orthographic processing instructions that we ex- pected would lower memory performance and reduce the truth effect; and rote rehearsal instructions that, though still not at a very deep level of processing, would result in increased memory and produce a larger truth effect. Method Procedure. The basic two-session procedure and stimuli used in this experiment were the same as in the first two studies. The different forms of low-involvement processing were instantiated through different exposure tasks during session 1. The baseline case was the com- prehension instructions used previously to encourage low-involvement processing. Subjects rated item un- derstandability on a one-to-seven scale. The rote re- hearsal task was designed to increase item memory without encouraging item evaluation. The instructions read, "In this study we are interested in your ability to remember these statements for short periods of time." Subjects saw each item for eight seconds; the computer screen went blank for five seconds, after which time subjects had to repeat the item aloud into a microphone connected to a tape recorder. During the five seconds when the screen was blank, subjects were told to re- hearse the item silently to themselves to help them remember it. The orthographic analysis condition was designed to encourage superficial, shallow processing in the sense described by Craik and Lockhart (1972) and Hyde and Jenkins (1973). The instructions read, "In this study we are interested in your ability to identify specific letters within the statements." When the item came onto the screen, a randomly generated letter (low- frequency letters were excluded) was displayed on the same screen. Within eight seconds, subjects had to count the number of occurrences of the particular letter and type it into the computer. Our expectation was that orthographic analysis would generate little increase in memory because it required an even lower level of pro- cessing involvement than the other tasks did (i.e., this task never required subjects to comprehend the mean- ing of the statement). After a 20-minute filler task, subjects began session 2. During this session, they rated the truth of 52 old (repeated) and 52 new2 items. Instead of a recognition test, subjects engaged in one of two familiarity rating tasks, both employing a one-to-seven ("definitely un- familiar" to "definitely familiar") scale. The first task asked subjects to rate their familiarity with each state- ment from session 1. Essentially, the session I famil- iarity task was a recognition task using the seven-point familiarity scale. The second task asked subjects to rate their preexperimentalfamiliarity with each item. Sub- jects rated their perceived level of familiarity with the item outside (i.e., before they entered) the experiment. Although we explicitly asked subjects to indicate their familiarity with the claims before the experiment, pre- vious research suggests that session 1 familiarity might spill over to create a more general feeling of familiarity (Underwood and Freund 1970). Each subject engaged in only one of the familiarity rating tasks, and these ratings were made immediately after making the truth rating for each item. Response times for these famil- iarity ratings also were measured. Subjects and Design. Subjects were 45 undergrad- uate and graduate students who were paid six dollars each for their participation. The basic design was a 2 X 3 X 2 factorial. Item type (old vs. new) was a repeated factor. The session 1 processing task (comprehension, rote rehearsal, orthographic analysis) and type of fa- miliarity task (session 1 vs. preexperimental familiarity) were between-subjects factors. All F-tests involving processing task are based on 2, 42 degrees of freedom. Results and Discussion Familiarity. To measure the influence of different low-involvement processing tasks on both session 1 and preexperimental familiarity, we computed the differ- ence between familiarity ratings for old and new items. As expected, repetition affected session 1 familiarity (old minus new: Xsesl = 3.8) much more than preexperi- mental familiarity (old minus new: Xpre = .6; F = 84.0, p &lt; .0001). Moreover, processing task had a large in- fluence on familiarity (F = 20.5, p &lt; .0001). Although the rote rehearsal task produced slightly larger increases in both forms of familiarity (old minus new: XsesI = 5.3; old minus new: Xpre = 1.07) than the compre- hension task (old minus new: Xsesi = 4.6; old minus new: Xpre = .72; all p's &lt; .05), the orthographic task had no influence on preexperimental familiarity (old minus new: Xpre =-.03) and only a modest effect on session 1 familiarity (old minus new: Xsesi = 1.4, p &lt; .05). A related finding emerges in the reaction-time data. First, repetition decreases reaction times (F = 31.4, p &lt; .0001), but only in the comprehension (old minus new: X= -.8 seconds) and rote rehearsal (old minus new: X = -1.1 seconds) conditions (response facilitation is mar- ginally greater in the rote rehearsal task than in the com- prehension task; p &lt; . 10); in the orthographic condition,</page><page sequence="11">222 JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH repetition has no effect (old minus new: X = -.01 sec- onds). Second, there was a small but statistically significant negative relation between reaction times and familiarity. The average of the within-subject correlations between reaction times and familiarity ratings was -.06 (F = 7.7, p &lt; .01).4 These data suggest that, unlike the symbol ma- nipulation employed in experiment 2, the rote rehearsal and orthographic processing instructions had the intended effects on memory performance. Truth Judgments. The overall truth effect was sig- nificant (old minus new: X = .14; F = 13.9, p &lt; .001). As predicted, there also was an interaction between repetition and processing task (F = 4.9, p &lt; .01); rote rehearsal produced a bigger truth effect (old minus new: X = .30) than either the comprehension (old minus new: X = .09) or the orthographic (old minus new: X = .03) processing tasks. The truth effect in the rote rehearsal and comprehension conditions were both significantly different from zero (p &lt; .05), whereas the orthographic condition produced no significant truth effect (p &gt; .5). However, the magnitudes of the truth effects for the comprehension and orthographic tasks were not sig- nificantly different. Thus, there appears to be a mini- mum level of processing that must occur for the truth effect to take place. The results from the regression modeling at the in- dividual subject level are summarized in Figure 3. For each processing task, the path diagrams show the in- terrelations among truth, repetition, and both session 1 familiarity and preexperimental familiarity. The two familiarity measures are shown together in the diagrams for ease of presentation, although for any one individual subject only one familiarity measure was collected. The numbers represent average, unstandardized linear regression coefficients; the numbers in parentheses are the unstandardized multiple regression coefficients when truth is regressed on both repetition and famil- iarity. There are several interesting results. First, as with the aggregate data, repetition has an influence on both ses- sion 1 (X = 3.75) and preexperimental (X = .58) fa- miliarity (F = 157.0, p &lt; .0001). However, repetition increases session 1 familiarity much more than preex- perimental familiarity (F = 84.0, p &lt; .0001). As can be seen in Figure 3, repetition-induced familiarity is con- fined to the comprehension and rote rehearsal condi- tions (F = 20.5, p &lt; .001). Apparently, the orthographic task required such a low level of processing involvement that it did not result in suffic-ient item activation; this was especially true in terms of preexperimental famil- iarity. Second, as in experiment 1, familiarity serves as the key mediator of the truth effect in all three low- involvement processing tasks. Although the linear FIGURE 3 PATH ANALYSES SHOWING RELATIONS AMONG REPETITION, FAMILIARITY, PREEXPERIMENTAL FAMILIARITY, AND TRUTH RATINGS BY PROCESSING TASK: EXPERIMENT 3 Comprehension .09 (-.03) 4 Farniliarity 03 Repetition (.03) Truth .72 Pre-experimental Familiarity Rote Rehearsal .31 (.06) le*0 5.

Finally, both forms of familiarity in- crease truth ratings (F = 25.1, p &lt; .0001), although preexperimental familiarity (X = .25) is more influential than session 1 familiarity (X = .06; F = 13.6, p &lt; .00 1). The reason for this difference may be that the preex- perimental familiarity scale is more sensitive to in- creases in the activation of prior relevant knowledge. The session 1 familiarity scale has a built-in ceiling ef- fect. The scale is limited to the familiarity associated with the session 1 episodic trace; it cannot detect cases of high activation that spill over into a more general, preexperimental familiarity (Underwood and Freund 1970). Experiment 3 clarifies the results from experiments 1 and 2. These studies indicate that familiarity is a key mediator of the truth effect even though the largest truth 4The individual within-subject correlations are based on 104 items. Although each of these correlations is small, the average of the 45 within-subject correlations is significantly different from zero.</page><page sequence="12">LOW-INVOLVEMENT LEARNING 223 effect occurred in the low-involvement task, which had the poorest memory performance. Our earlier discus- sion suggested that this result may have occurred be- cause the involvement manipulation coincidentally in- creased both memory performance and evaluative processing. Experiment 3 demonstrates that it is possible to increase memory for the claims without increasing evaluative processing. Because none of the low-in- volvement tasks in experiment 3 encourage the retrieval of relevant prior knowledge, the truth judgments are a function of the different levels of item memory induced by these tasks. GENERAL DISCUSSION One of the most salient characteristics of the current advertising environment is the seemingly endless rep- etition of product claims. Consumers have heard that Ivory soap is "99 and 44/100% pure" and that "it floats" for more than 100 years. Heinz has spent over 20 years conveying the idea that their ketchup is the thickest and richest around. They did this through relentless repetition, first of the physically verifiable claim that Heinz was the thickest (e.g., "slowest in the West," "their ketchup ran," "Anticipation"); later, they helped consumers make the inference that Heinz, by virtue of its superior viscosity, was also the richest and best tast- ing.'Today, Heinz owns two-thirds of the category and runs advertising repeating the same theme, but with younger actors and more stylish MTV backgrounds. As Rick Fizdale, president of Leo Burnett (the Heinz agency), recently said, "Building brands, for the present and over the long haul, is our business. When you find a classic, like United's 'Fly the Friendly Skies,' you don't tamper with it. Obviously, campaigns like this evolve. But they're never changed to conform with false fads and ephemeral trends" (Advertising Age 1991, pp. 6-7). This article reports one technique commonly employed to build brand knowledge in an increasingly cluttered communication environment-repetition of simple product claims. The truth effect reported in this research indicates that a single exposure to a product claim can increase consumers' memory for and belief in that claim. This truth effect is a small but reliable effect. We make no claims about generalizability, but it is clear that the commercial clutter would quickly swamp these single- exposure, familiarity-induced increases in belief. At the same time, however, it is important to consider what might happen to consumer belief after the multiple, spaced ex- posures that are typical for many convenience and shop- ping goods. Future research on the truth effect should examine higher levels of repetition, both distributed and massed. The goal of much advertising is to ensure that the consumer takes away one key copy point, be it a dis- tinctive product benefit ("lowest tar and nicotine") or a more fuzzy, ambiguous claim ("we try harder"). In low- involvement settings, it might be more profitable for ad- vertisers to go for frequency and sacrifice reach and length of the ad, and one of the contributing mechanisms might be familiarity-induced increases in belief. Also, there is a need to examine the influence of repetition from multiple sources. For example, consumers' firmly held beliefs about the dangers of cholesterol (exaggerated, according to many medical authorities) come from the ads and packaging of multiple manufacturers. Finally, note that the present re- sults suggest that the truth effect will only occur for items of ambiguous validity. Claims that are blatantly true or false are unlikely to increase belief as a function of rep- etition. Although we hesitate to say that our research offers straightforward recommendations for marketers, we do think that one aspect of our research deserves further at- tention in this regard. It concerns the finding that increases in memory and familiarity that are not accompanied by deeper levels of evaluative processing lead to larger in- creases in belief. Although much research supports the notion that deeper elaborative processing leads to greater memory (e.g., Hyde and Jenkins 1973), Nelson (1977) has shown that there are also means to increase memory within a particular level of processing. For instance, he found that repetition increased various memory measures at both the phonemic and the semantic levels. Similarly, rote rehearsal typically is not thought of as an elaborative form of processing, because it does little to prompt people to integrate new information with existing knowledge; however, rote rehearsal can increase memory. Advertisers routinely use mnemonic devices to increase rehearsal, in- cluding rote instructions ("R-O-L-A-I-D-S"), jingles ("I wish I were an Oscar Meyer wiener"), self-generation ("You can take Salem out of the country, but you can't take the country out of "), and rhymes ("A sprinkle a day helps keep odor away"). These everyday advertising tools serve to increase memory without increasing eval- uative processing. The present research indicates that these are exactly the conditions that lead to the greatest increase in belief of simple product claims, and this may be one of the reasons advertisers find them so attractive. Beliefs play an important role in a number of consumer activities. Research indicates that consumers' beliefs can influence their perception of prices (e.g., Thaler 1985), search behavior (e.g., Roedder John, Scott, and Bettman 1986), memories (e.g., Hirt 1990), attitudes (e.g., Fishbein and Ajzen 1975), and decision making (e.g., Lynch et al. 1988). Furthermore, the manner in which those beliefs are acquired may influence the impact that they have on subsequent behavior. For example, Baker and Lutz (1988) suggest that advertising is more effective when the level of involvement at message exposure is consistent with the level of involvement at the point of choice. Because many of the decisions that consumers make are not very im- portant, involvement at choice is often low. Given the importance of beliefs for consumer behavior and the range of formation mechanisms, it is crucial to understand how involvement at exposure influences learning. [Received August 1991.
