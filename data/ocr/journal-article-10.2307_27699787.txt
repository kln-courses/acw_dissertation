<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FEELING FOR NATURE IN OLD ENGLISH POETRY. THE purpose of the following pages is to examine those passages in Old English poetry which deal with nature in either its sublime or its common manifestations, and to dis cover by this means, if it be possible, the views and feelings of those who made the verses. In an age illuminated by art, and instructed by science, it is not easy to read honestly or to judge fairly the poetry of a people whose eyes, though physically like our own, certainly saw and reported otherwise than ours. It is proverbially true that we see that which we have eyes to see ; but we have eyes to see that which we have been taught to see, and largely that which others have seen. As all education con sists of learning to read, so all art consists of learning to see and to translate the vision. The educated man, and particularly the poet, of to-day looks through the eyes of the ages ; the artists and poets and seers of all times have dowered him with their wealth. He sees because and as they have seen. Consequently it is not easy for him to understand the view-point of men who in earlier years looked at nature through their own eyes, with out artistic and literary mediators, and, on the whole, found it interesting. This difficulty of comprehension is sometimes unnecessarily increased by putting into close proximity, or citing as parallel, passages from early and modern writers which may perhaps be similar in the bare outline or the initial conception, but have little in common save that they are both products of the human mind roused to activity by the same force. There are two dangers in such a comparison : first, that because the earlier composition is less elaborate and finished, its real value may be depreciated ; and secondly, that the finer feeling and subtler suggestion of the later may be read into the earlier, and thus its 439</page><page sequence="2">440 Hanscom, [Vol. V simplicity may be destroyed. Into one or the other of these two mistakes most study of early poetry falls ; in attempting to avoid them, one is likely to incur, perhaps justly, the criticism of coldness and lack of appreciation. Nevertheless, I have pre ferred to set forth the results of this study without reference to other literatures, or to later developments of English, and to exhibit passages only in the light which they themselves afford. For convenience I have followed the numbering of the lines in Grein's Bibliothek der Angels?chsischen Poesiey although I have constantly referred to later and more critical texts, and have availed myself freely of their emendations. Old English poetry has few references to spring, and these few are conventional and lifeless, evidently composed because the occasion demanded, rather than from any such intimate interest as inspired the numerous descriptions of winter. The earliest of these passages is in the Beowulf: i Another year came to the dwellings, as still it does, the gloriously bright weather which always keeps its season' (1133-1136). Very character istic is the description of spring in the Gnomic Verses (Cotton MS.) as the ' frostiest of seasons ' (6) ; and the same use of frost, hrlm, is found in the spirited passage of the Menologium: i Bedecked with frost, mad March journeys round the worldf (35-37). In the same poem is an effective description of jocund May: 'Thus quickly into the town, serene and soft, beauteous in adornment, with trees and plants, fair [May] comes gliding ' (76-78). In the Phoenix are some pretty lines, but conventional, like most of the poem: 'The gleam of the sun in the springtime, the symbol of life, awakens the treasures of earth, so that the fruits are renewed again after their kind* (253-257). Almost equally slight and unsatisfactory are the references to summer. There is a conventional expression, ' a summer-long day9; but, in general, duration of time is measured by the winter, as was natural among a people for whom that was the longest and severest portion of the year. Mention of the heat of the sun is not infrequent ; but the idea of extreme heat is not found except in a few passages like Phoenix 18, a free</page><page sequence="3">No. 4] Nature in Old English Poetry 441 translation from Lactantius, and Christ 1662, where 'the burn ing of the sun, is counted among the trials from which the blessed are exempt. Most passages dealing with summer are without color and feeling, like that in the Menologium, where summer is described as bringing the sun-bright days and warm weather, when the fields quickly bloom with flowers (88-95) ; and later in the same verses : ( The sun, brightest of stars, mounts into the heaven, to the highest [point] of the year, and from that declines, sinks to its setting; after this the fairest of lights among created things will look longer upon the world, will pass more slowly over the plains of earth , (109-115). Not unlike this in conventionality are the lines in the Phoenix in which the brightest gem, hottest sun, is referred to as shining over the shadows (208-211). In the Guthlac odors are mentioned in connection with summer, but generally they are unnoticed in Old English poetry : 'From his mouth came the sweetest of odors, such as in summer exhale in places securely founded, beautifully blooming with spicy plants, in fields flowing with honey ' (1247-1250). The Seafarer, permeated with exultation in wild nature, tells how the blossoming trees and blooming fields urge the Seafarer to wander afar over the tide-ways; while the cuckoo, the harbinger of summer, warns him with her moaning song, and foretells sorrow (48-54). Naturally, to a people dull to the beauty of spring and sum mer, autumn would not be a season productive of artistic and poetic feeling ; and the peculiar obtuseness of the English to color-effects made them indifferent to the special glory of the dying year. There are a few references to the autumn, but they are of a strictly utilitarian character. The Gnomic Verses (Cotton ms.), with their neat ticketing of all subjects with which they deal, classify this season as the most glorious?bringing to men the fruit which God sends (89). The Menologium preserves the popular names of October and November, WinterfyllerS (184) and Bl?tmonaS (195); the former, according to Bede, derived from the words for winter and the full of the moon, ' because after the full moon of this month winter begins.1 The signifi</page><page sequence="4">442 Hanscom, [Vol. V canee of the latter lies in the fact that to the heathen Saxons November was the month of sacrifice. From the slight attention paid to summer it naturally follows that there are few allusions to the flowers and fruits that adorn that season. If there were any delight in the color and scent of flowers, a point much to be doubted, it was of that general kind that does not consider specific details. Unquestionably the flora of England was far less varied and prolific than when Chaucer began our nature-poetry ; but along the edges of the cliffs, and over the fens, and by the outskirts of the forests, there must have been wee clinging vines and clustering plants that shot a ray of color against the dun background. They must have been there; but no one thought it worth while to say so, and the whole body of this poetry, wonderfully rich in appreciation of some aspects of nature, is almost unrelieved by sight or scent of flowers. The lily and the rose are each mentioned once in Riddle 4-1, confessedly of late and perhaps of secondary origin : c In fragrance I am far stronger than incense or the rose, that so peerless grows fair in the soil of the earth ; I am more delicate than she ; though the lily, bright with blossoms, is dear to mankind, I am better than she y (24-28). Aside from this purely conventional passage, there is no men tion of the names of flowers ; and none but the most general statements are made. In Christ and Satan (357-8) and the Pan ther (47-8) occur references to the pleasant scent of flowers similar to that in Gtdhlac, quoted above. In the Rimed Song is a rare allusion to the delight derived from the sight of blossoms, 'colors of joy, the hues of flowers' (4). Naturally the Phoenix has many verses in which flowers are mentioned ; but none are characteristic, and many are derivative. The longest may be quoted as an example of somewhat pretty writing of an indif ferent kind : ' There the sacred flowers of the forest never wane beneath the heavens, nor do the fair blossoms, the beauty of the trees, fall to the ground ; but there by a miracle the laden branches of the trees, the fruit ever new, stand for ever green on the grassy slope ' (73-8).</page><page sequence="5">No. 4] Nature in Old English Poetry 443 With one exception, fruits are seldom mentioned, and then only in a general and indefinite fashion. They are reckoned among the blessings of the autumn in three or four places ; and the Phoenix contains several passages in which they are grouped with leaves and flowers in mildly poetic phrases. Alone of the the fruits the apple made an impression by its individuality ; but the story of the temptation accounts for its prominence in relig ious verse, and there is nothing distinctive in its use in other poems. Other forms of vegetation seem to have made no more definite impression than flowers and plants. Wyrt, ' wort/ i plant/ is a word of wide application that apparently covered every growing thing not a tree. In a conveniently alliterative combination with wudu, ' wood/ i tree/ it is found in many passages com prising the entire botanical kingdom in two words. Edible qualities of plants are not noted ; but Riddle 6 refers to the 6 leeches who heal wounds with plants ' (10-12). There are two or three passages in which the word corn is used, but only in the sense of ( seed/ as literally in Phoenix 253, and figura tively in the Pune Song : 'hail is the whitest of seeds7 (25). Yet nature evidently marshaled her forces against civilization then as now, and even the early English, obdurate to the beauty and perfume of flowers, were impressed by the personality of thorn and briar. Part of the desolation pictured in the Wife9s Complaint is the ( bleak dwellings overgrown with briars, a habitation bereft of joy9 (31?2). In the Rune Song is a truly pointed description : ' The thorn is very sharp, hard to take hold of, extremely harsh to every one who rests upon it ' (3?5). Aside from these plants, the only other that is noticed is the grass and that but infrequently. In Beowulf's departure from Hrothgar's Court he trod the green sward, gr smolde (1881); and there are a few passages in later poems that in a casual fashion refer to the grass, sometimes with the obvious epithet c green.y But evidently the grass of the field was neither the delight nor the teacher it has been to other races. To trees the early English paid more attention in their poems,</page><page sequence="6">444 Hanscom, [Vol V especially in those of late date, giving the names of several varieties, although never with any marks of close observation or intimate knowledge. Riddle 12 has a very unpoetic passage suggesting the practical use of the beech : ' I am bigger and fatter than a fatted pig, a hog grunting in the beech-woods' (105-6). Riddle 56 mentions the hlin (maple?) (9) and oak (9), the hard yew (9) and sere holly (10). The latter is further characterized as good for burning in Gnomic Verses 80 (Exeter MS.). The Rune Song details three trees as follows : 'The birch is without fruit, bears twTigs likewise without fruit, is beautiful in its branches, lofty in its top, fairly adorned, laden with leaves, close to the sky ' (stanza 18). ' The oak is food for the flesh of the children of men in the world, goes constantly over the gannet's bath ; the ocean finds out whether the oak is a noble tree. The ash is very high, dear to man, strong in its stem, holds its place right well though many men fight against it ' (stanzas 25?26). Quite different is the use of the oak in the Wife's Complaint, where the forlorn woman mourns that she is forced to dwell in a cave under an oak (28 and 36). Only two trees not indigenous to Britain are mentioned, both in religious poems; the palm in Solomon and Saturn 12, 39, 167, and the olive in Genesis 1473, 1474 ; but in both cases only the names are given. References to the woods are numerous, as we should expect from a people desperately clinging to a strip of shore between the encroaching sea and the obstinate forest ; but apparently they looked ever eastward, and while they saw the mighty waters in myriad forms and had a name and phrase for each, they saw and felt but vaguely the massive depths that stretched behind. Yet in the beginning this was not so, for the longest and most detailed description in Beowulf is of the mysterious forest in which lay hidden the weird mere : ' Over it hang groves hoary with frost, firm-rooted trees overshadow the water. There any night a dread wonder may be seen, fire on the flood. No one lives among the children of men so wise as to know the depths of this. Though harried by dogs the heath-roamnig</page><page sequence="7">No. 4] Nature in Old English Poetry 445 hart, the strong-horned stag, may seek the forest, fleeing from far, he will yield his life, his very being, on the brink before he will hide his head therein' (1363-1372). With the exception of the verses dealing with the paradisiacal wood, Phoenix 71-84, the only other extended reference to the forest is that of the Wife9s Complaint, a part of which has been quoted above. The whole passage is replete with loneliness and longing ; something of the solitude and dreariness of the dark forest breathes through it. Less detailed than the description in Beowulf, it yet has atmosphere, and like it is evidently done from life: 'I was bidden to live among the trees of the forest, under an oak tree in a cave of the earth ; old is this earthen hall ; I perish with longing ; the valleys are dim, the hills tower on high. There are dear, loving friends in the world ; they rest on the marriage couch, while I in the dim light of morning walk alone around this earth-cave under the oak* (27-37). As to the special words applied to trees and woods, beam and trio are apparently perfect synonyms, and are used with almost equal frequency. Thus Grein's glossary gives twenty-four instances of beam, and twenty of trio, with the meaning ' tree ' or i wood.' Nor is there any distinguishable difference in the use of beam, holt, and wudu, signifying i woods3 or i forest/ The former is the more common, given twenty-seven times by Grein, holt nineteen, and wudu seventeen, but, so far as I can see, chance, or at most alliteration, determined the choice. For the 'green things growing/ the bud and blossom and fruitage of the year, and the seasons that brought them to per fection, it seems that the early English cared but little, or found but few and poor words in which to express their interest ; but not so with the remainder of the year. As is constantly appar ent in the study of early literatures, there are always words with which to clothe living ideas, and true feeling makes true poetry. If all the lines relating to winter could be eliminated, we might properly argue that our English ancestors were without power to express their appreciation of nature, but so long as these</page><page sequence="8">446 Hanscom, [Vol. V passages exist, we can never think of their authors as ' mute, inglorious' versifiers, but must acknowledge that, if they did not write of the calmer months with equal force, it was because of lack of poetic feeling, not of poetic ability. The fact seems to be that they were impressed only by stern and rough mani festations; when the great harp of nature was struck with sufficient strength, when the icy hand of winter smote the clanging strings, then they lifted up their voices and sang with glee of wailing wind and surging ocean. By an obvious synecdoche already noted, ' winter ' is used as a synonym of ' year.' Another common use of the word is as an intensifying prefix in compounds, either adjectives like winter biter and winter ceald, or nouns like winterrlm and wintersc?r. The oldest reference to winter is in Beowulf: ' He could not drive his ring-prowed vessel along the sea ; the sea surged in the storm, battled against the wind; winter locked the waves in its icy band' (1130-1133.) The Menologium gives a description of the blighting of the crops by the advent of winter, but it is neither spirited nor effective : ' Six days after, the winter's day roams afar, takes away the sun-bright autumn by its harrying band of rime and snow, fettered with frost by its lord's com mands, so that the green fields, the ornaments of earth, may not remain with us ' (203-207). Two other conventional passages occur in the Phoenix, 57-62 and 245-250. The latter tells of the reaping of the harvest ' before the coming of winter, lest the showers of rain should destroy them under the sky ; there they find sustenance, the delights of food, when frost and snow with mighty power cover the earth with the garments of winter.' This is original in the Old English version, but its inferiority is felt when one turns to the strongly poetic winter-pieces, as, for example, that in the Wanderer : ' The storms beat against these stony-cliffs, the rushing snowfall, the loud terror of winter, holds fast the earth, when the dark comes on, the night-shadows grow black, from the north drives the fierce hail storm in the face of men' (101-105). Similar to these are some lines in Andreas : ' The snow bound</page><page sequence="9">No. 4] Nature in Old English Poetry 447 the earth with wintry storms, the weather grew cold with hard hail-showers, as the hoary warriors, rime and frost, locked fast the home of man, the habitations of the people ; the lands were chilled by the cold icicles ; the glory of the water grew less ; over the rivers the ice bridged a wan water-way* (1257?1264). The longest and most spirited of all these passages is that in the Seafarer, where the screech of birds is heard above the boom of the sea, and the glint of their white wings shines over the foam of the breakers: 'That man whose lot on earth is happiest knows not how I, oppressed with care, bereft of kins men, covered with icicles, pass the winter on the paths of exile on the ice-cold sea. The hail flies in showers. There I heard nought but the sea roaring, the ice-cold wave, at times the song of the swan ; for pleasure I had the noise of the gannet, and the cry of the huilp in place of the laughter of men, for mead-drink the song of the mew. There the storms beat against the stony cliffs ; there the icy-feathered starn replies ; full oft screamed the eagle with his wet feathers. None of my protecting kins men could follow this wretched creature ; therefore, whoever biding in towns has the pleasure of life, few misfortunes, exul tant and flushed with wine, little understands how often weary I must remain on the path of the sea. The shades of night grow dark, from the north the snow falls, the frost binds the earth, the hail, coldest of seeds, falls on the ground ' (14-33). Surely the man who made these lines had the seeing eye and the hearing ear. With equal force and passion these old poets sang of storm and tempest, sometimes with exultation, sometimes with fear, but always with admiration, as became those who had seen the ' stormy winds fulfilling His will/ and had felt their passage over the great deep. Whoever the author of Exodus, Csednion or another, he knew the sea, and knew it at the north. Some thing of the old Viking rage rings through the finest passage of that poem, in which the destruction of the Egyptians is told in good Saxon phrases. With utter lack of historic consciousness, undisturbed by such modern bugaboos as anachronisms and</page><page sequence="10">448 Hanscom, [Vol. V local color, the poet looked from some northern fastness across the dark waves, saw them heaped on high by the hand of the Almighty, and described what he saw to those to whom the sight was but too familiar : ' The streams rose, the storm mounted high toward heavt n, the enemy shouted the greatest of battle cries ; the sky abo /e grew dark. . . . High over the warriors the wall of waters uprose, the headstrong ocean stream. The sand waited for the destined army when the flood of billows, the ever-cold sea with its salt waves, wont to wander, the naked messenger of woe, the fatal on-creeper, which overwhelmed the enemy, should come to search out the eternal foundations. The blue sky was stained with gore; the dashing flood, the path of seamen, threatened bloody terror, until the true God by Moses' hand released the proud [waves]. Wide it spread, swept in deadly circles, the flood foamed, the doomed yielded, the seas fell to earth, the sky was stirred, the bulwarks weakened, the waves burst forth, the towers of water melted when the Mighty, Heavens' Guardian, smote with His holy hand the warriors, that proud people.On the track of the warriors, high from heaven fell the handiwork of God ' (459-492). Evidently the exultation in this passage is other than that of religious zeal ; the author of this poem is not moved by dramatic feeling ; the joy is his own, not the Israelites'. No such emotion animates the account of the storm in Andreas, it is the obverse of the picture in Exodus. The sailors are most honestly and frankly afraid, and the terror of the storm has evidently struck close to the heart of the writer : ' The whale sea was stirred, deeply moved ; the horn-fish gamboled, glided about the sea, the gray mew circled greedy for carrion ; the candle of the sky grew dark, the winds rose, the waves crashed, the streams were stirred, the rigging creaked, wet with spray, the terror of the water rose with the power of its violence ; the thanes grew fearful ; no one of those who with Andrew sought the vessel on the streams of ocean thought that he would reach the land alive ' (370-380). In the same poem Andrew describes the storm stilled by Christ : ' It happened once before that,</page><page sequence="11">No. 4] Nature in Old English Poetry 449 faring forth on a boat over the surging waves, we tempted the waves; horrible seemed the fearsome water-ways, the ocean streams beat the seashore ; the sea often replied, one wave to another ; at times in the lap of the boat terror uprose from the bosom of the sea over the wave-traverser9 (438-445). The passages given above are mere descriptive digressions ; resembling them in general tone is one entire poem, Riddle 3, which manifestly deals with a storm at sea : ' At times I go, no man knoweth how, under the swelling of the waves to seek the earth, the bottom of the sea; the ocean is roused, the flood excited, the spray is tossed about; the whale-sea roars, rages loudly, the floods beat the shore, at times they hurl against the steep cliffs stones and sand, seaweed and wave. Then raging I move the earth overspread with the power of the flood, the wide sea-bottom. I cannot loose the covering of water until He who is my guide in every place permits. Tell, thoughtful man, who drew me from the bosom of the sea when the floods which covered me, the multitude of waves, grew stiller again ? ' A companion-piece to this is Riddle 2, one of the very few descriptions of a land-storm in the whole body of Old English poetry : ' Who among men is so quick and cunning of mind that he can declare who drives me on my path when I rise up strong, at times thunder fierce and glorious, at times with destruc tion journey over the earth, burn the people's buildings, ravage the dwellings, [so that] the smoke rises dark over the roof? There is tumult in the earth, violent death of men, when covered with water I shake the forests, the quick-growing groves, fell the trees, by high power sent afar to rush in flight' (1-11). Riddle I/, represents the storm-spirit whom the Lord binds fast, keeping his broad breast beneath the plains of earth ; he cannot escape from that misery ; but, he exults, ' I shake the homesteads of heroes ; the horned-halls tremble, the dwellings of men ; the high walls rock above the householders. Still seems the sky above the land, and quiet the sea until I thrust myself from my prison. . . . Sometimes from above I must rouse the waters, stir the streams, and drive to the shore the</page><page sequence="12">450 Hanscom, [Vol. V flint-gray flood ; the foaming wave fights against the [sea] wall ; dark above the deep rises a mountain [of water], black on its track comes another mingled with ocean, till near the march land they meet the high cliffs. Then the ship is clamorous, the shout of the seafarers ; the steep stone-cliffs quietly await the onslaught of the flood, the dashing of the waves, when the lofty throng crash against the crags. . . . Sometimes I rush along so that the dark cloudburst rides on my back, I scatter it afar full of lakes of water ; sometimes I cause it to glide together again. That is the mightiest sound, loudest tumult and commotion above the towns, when one fierce cloud comes against another, edge to edge. The swarthy shapes, scurrying over the people, belch forth fire, gleam with flame, and go crashing dark above the people with great din ; battling they advance, let fall the dark resounding [rain], moisture from their bosom, the waters from their womb ' (7-48). This riddle is equally applicable to the wind, and suggests the passage in Elene in which the wind is personified in true Aeolus fashion : ' He rises loud against men, hunts upon the clouds, wanders forth in rage, then suddenly grows calm, forcibly restrained in the prison-house, straitly confined' (1273-1277). This is the best, as it is the most extended, of such passages ; but the sound of the wind is heard through all Old English poetry. It wails in such alliterative phrases as holm won wt? winde (Beowulf 1131); y^Sgeblond ?p?stlgeft won t? wolcnum (Beowulf 1374) and r?gnas won mid winde (Genesis 214) ; in all of which we see the darkling of the waters as the wind sweeps across their face. It is such passages as these, vivid in suggestion, barren of detail, that convince us that the early English saw far more fully and accurately than they expressed. True to the genius of their language, they qualified by few epithets, but made such alliterative combinations as wind ond w g, wind ond wolcen, or used the noun with such vigorous verbs as fordrlfan, sw?gan, Ar?an. In Christ and Satan there are two expressions indicative of the horror with which the wind was regarded. In lines 320 and 386 hell is called the</page><page sequence="13">No. 4] Nature in Old English Poetry 451 windseh, the wind-hall ; and 136 has the same words, slightly modified, as fies windiga sele, ' this windy hall.' The term is found nowhere else, and imparts a Dantesque flavor to a passage full of ghastly suggestion. Other aspects of foul weather are numerous in all references to nature. The Wanderer endures ' frost and snow, mingled with hail ' (48) ; the snow binds the earth wintergeweorpum, ' with wintry tempests/Andreas 1257, and in Solomon and Saturn there is a spirited description : ' But why does the snow fall and hide the earth, cover the shoots of the plants, make fast the fruits, oppress and afflict them so that for a time they are withered by the cold ? Full often it tries the tribe of wild beasts, comes in wet storms, breaks down the gates of towns, sets forth boldly, ruins far more than the violence of the strong ' (301-307). A corresponding but less detailed ice-picture occurs in the Rune Song. It is noticeable here that the glint and gleam of the ice have attracted the poet's attention, and, with that quickness to see light rather than color which characterized the sight of the early English, he has given a brilliant bit of verse : ' Ice is immeasurably cold, excessively slippery, glistens as clear as glass, like jewels, a floor wrought by frost, a glorious sight ' (29-31). This is, however, the only passage in which the beauty of ice is noted ; but perhaps it is only a steam-heated and woolen-clad generation that is in a position to appreciate the picturesqueness of winter. All the other references to ice appeal to the sense of feeling rather than of sight. Thus the Seafarer, in his exultant recounting of the terrors of winter, against which, nevertheless, it is man's glory to contend, speaks of the 'ice-cold sea' (14) and the 'ice-cold wave' (18), and notes the call of the 'icy-feathered starn ' (24). In Beowulf is found the powerful figure, ' winter locked fast the wave in its icy bonds ' (1132,1133). Without attempting to explain the mean ing, one may refer in passing to the ' ring-prowed boat that stood at the haven, icy and ready to go/ bearing Scyld to the great deep when he turned again home (Beowulf 33). The figure of locking or binding fast is applied also to the</page><page sequence="14">452 Hanscom, [Vol. V frost, for which the words forst and hrlm are used, apparently interchangeably. In Beowulf the thawing of the frost is poeti cally expressed in a passage evidently from a Christian hand : ' When the Father frees the bands of frost, unwinds the ropes that fasten the waters ' (1609 and 1610). By a pleasant allitera tion two effective phrases are attained, ' fetters of frost,' Gnomic Verses 76 (Exeter MS.), and 'fettered with frost,' Menologium 205. The Seafarer feels his ' feet bound by frost in chilling chains' as he keeps his night-watch (10-11) ; and the Wanderer with saddened heart rows over ' the rime-cold sea ' (4). In these two poems the feeling of cold is most intense ; both furnish interesting examples of the effect of climate on the temper of nature poetry. The adjective hard is applied alike to frost and hail , and line 32 of the Seafarer, in which rime is called the ' coldest of seeds,' is matched by the couplet in the Rune Song : ' Hail is the whitest of seeds, it whirls from the clouds of heaven, showers of wind toss it about, then it turns to water' (24-25). This is the only attempted description of hail, other references to it being merely incidental in passages dealing with storms ; but these are sufficiently numerous to show that it was one of the dreaded manifestations of nature. Generally also rain is counted among the adverse forces, as, for example, in the list of the harmful conditions from which the paradisiacal home of the Phoenix is free from rain and snow (14) ; but in Azarias are found some unusual lines which seem to have a genuine feeling of tenderness : ' Full often, King of glory, Thou dost cause the mild morning rain for the benefit of men ; afterward many a plant shall start to life, also the trees of the forest shall renew their branches ' (80-84). The expression in Daniel, ' dew and dear shower ' (372), seems to be more alliterative than emotional ; but it is noticeable as one of the few references to the dew, all of them merely nominal. D?awigfef?era, ' dewy-feathered,' is applied to the raven (?) in Exodus 163, and to the ' wan bird,' here surely the raven, in Genesis 1984. Unless dew is used in the general</page><page sequence="15">No. 4] Nature in Old English Poetry 453 sense of moisture, the force of this epithet is not as easily dis cerned as is that of its companion ?rigfef?era, ' wet-winged/ applied to the eagle in Judith 210, Seafarer 25, and Elene 29 and 111. While the first part of the compound does not occur independently in English, its meaning is apparent from the Ice landic ?rigr, wet, from ?r, a drizzling rain. To the mist great attention is paid, almost as if it were of supernatural character ; and remembering the climate of the island, begirt with fogs and reeking with vapor, one does not wonder that these misty depths were peopled with strange shapes and uncanny monsters. The first account of Grendel is of one who 'all night long held the misty moors ' (Beowulf 161-162), and again ' came Grendel from the moor under the misty slopes ' (710-711). The whole description of the weird mere is of some mist-hung, miasmatic pool. Later the Christianized imagina tion transferred the enveloping mist from monster to fiend, and there occur such passages as ' Hell, the bottomless flood, amid the misty glooms ' ( Whale 47), and ' Now we suffer tortures in Hell, darkness and heat, grim, endless. God Himself has swept us into these dark mists ' (Genesis 389-391). This is suggest ive of the ' windy hall ' of Christ and Satan, noted above. Moors and fens seem never to have been freed from the mys tery and abhorrence with which early tradition invested them. Grendel and his mother held ' moors and fens and fastnesses ' (Beowulf 104), and inhabited ' the dark land, the windy head lands, the perilous fen-paths, where the mountain stream flows down under the shadows of the ness' (357-361). In the Gnomic Verses (Cotton MS.) 42-43, ' the demon shall dwell in the fen, alone in the land ' suggest^that the people who cut fur rows in the sea and rode exultingly on the ' path of the whale ' lost heart before the trackless waste of land. In one of the best figures in the whole body of the poetry Judas, hard pushed by the energetic Elene, likens himself to ' one who in the desert weary and hungry treads the moorland ' (Elene 611-612). Yet because of this very dread of untrodden ways the moors some times served for protection as well, as the first Riddle declares :</page><page sequence="16">454 Hanscom, [Vol. V ' Secure is that island, begirt with fens ' (5). A cause of obnoxiousness less subtle than that of giants and demons is given in the Riddle J^l : 'I am fouler than this dark fen that reeks here with loathsome filth' (31-32). Recalling the con ditions of life in those centuries, one is inclined to reckon the obtuseness of the early English to odors among their chief blessings. For mountains and hills Old English poetry shows absolutely no feeling. To be sure, sundry nouns are used, perhaps to suggest various kinds of elevation, and these nouns are further characterized by such obvious epithets as 'green,' 'high,' 'steep'; but from the reference to hills alone one might almost infer that the authors of these poems were a coast people. There is nothing of the inspiration or the awe that comes to those bred in the uplands, no lifting of the eyes to the hills from which help shall come. In one passage there is even a note of fear : ' No hills nor steep mountains stand there, nor do stony cliffs tower on high, as here with us, nor valleys nor dales nor mountain-caves nor mounds nor rising ground, neither does anything rough rest there' (Phoenix 21-26). This is expanded from the single line of Lactantius : Nee tumulus crescit nee cava vallis hiat. In the entire body of verse no mountains are mentioned by name ; they seem to have been recognized merely as generic elevations. The omission of geographical names is characteristic of the early poetry. Allusion is made to but one English river, the Humber, called in Eadmund ' the broad water-stream ' (5) ; although it is possible that ' the gushing of the white spring ' (Eadmund 4) refers to a river formerly known as the White. In Elene occur two references to the Danube, on whose banks Constantine vanquished the Huns (37, 136). The Jordan is named in Harrowing of Hell (103) and Genesis (1921) ; and the latter poem mentions also the Nile (2208). An interesting proof that the authors of the early poetry were coast people,</page><page sequence="17">No. 4] Nature in Old English Poetry 455 accustomed therefore to tidal rivers, is furnished by the fact that the same words are used for ocean and river, and frequently the meaning is determined only by the context. Such words are brimstream, eastr?am, ?gstrlam, firgenstr?am, and lagu stream. The only word which is applied exclusively to a river is burn(-e)(-a), bubbling or running water ; but that this was not restricted to small streams, as is its modern equivalent, is apparent from the fact that in Harrowing of Hell (132) it refers to the Jordan. In Maldon there are two good lines descriptive of the incoming tide in a river, the first especially suggests the motion of the water : ' In came the flowing flood after the ebb, the streams of water interlocked' (65?66). Aside from this passage the only other attempted description is a dull and prosaic statement in the Gnomic Verses (Cotton MS.) : ' Earth colored water shall flow from a hill ' (30-31). Evidently, whatever appreciation the early English felt for running water was not wasted on rivers ; but that they had such appreciation, great and poetic, is apparent as soon as one begins to study their sea-poetry. This, however, I reserve for separate consideration. From the slight attention paid to the summer and its delights, it might be inferred that the early English were indifferent to the sun, and unmindful of its beneficence ; but not so ; on the contrary, their poetry is rich in beautiful passages descriptive of its majesty, and a wealth of poetic words attest the love im which it was held. Like other northern people, the English made the sun of feminine gender ; but they ascribed to it no. peculiarly feminine attributes ; in fact, there is practically no anthropomorphism in their poetry. By far the most common noun is sunne; but b?acen, 'beacon' ; lloma, 'light/ 'radiance' ; sigel, ' sun ' ; swegel, ' sun ' ; are also used. The verb most commonly coupled with these nouns is sclnan, ' shine ' ; others are bllcan, ' glitter ' ; gUdan, ' glide ' ; and Uxan, ' gleam.'' Alliteration seems a determining factor in the selection. Certain effective adjectives are produced by composition with different nouns as sigeltorht, sigelbeorht, sunbeorht, swegelbeorht, all mean ing ' bright as the sun ' ; sunwlitig, ' beautiful as the sun/ 2</page><page sequence="18">456 Hanscom, [Vol. V Other adjectives, equally effective are used as modifiers of sunne, as goldtorht, 'gold-bright'; swegeltorlvt, 'heaven-bright.' Generally, however, references to the sun are figurative. The most frequent figure is that comparing the sun to a candle. Condel or candel, from candela, was one of the Latin words introduced at the time of the Christianization of England, and long associated with religious observances. The various ways in which the metaphor was applied are indicated by the following expressions : d gcondel, ' candle of day ' ; Godes con del and Godes condel beorht, 'God's bright candle' ; heofoncondel and heofonlic condel, ' candle of heaven ' ; rodores condel, ' candle of the sky' ; swegelcondel, 'candle of heaven' ; wedercondel and weder condel wearm, 'warm candle of the open air'; woruld condel, 'candle of the world'; wyncondel 'candle of delight.' Other terms for the sun are swegles tapur, ' taper of heaven ' ; evidently analogous to the foregoing, swegles l?oht, 'light of heaven ' ; se rSela gl m and se l?ohta gl m, ' the noble, bright splendor' ; l?ohtes liorna, ' radiance of light' ; h?dor heofonl?oma, ' serene radiance of heaven ' ; se s?ftf sta sunnan l?oma, ' the steadfast light of the sun ' ; c??ele sclma, 'excellent brightness' ; heaftodgel sclr, 'shining sun,' where the prefix seems to be suggested by the sun rising from the sea ; b?acn wuldertorht, ' gloriously bright beacon ' ; f gerust l?ohta woruldgesceafta, ' fairest of the shining things of the world ' ; wedert?cen wearm, ' warm token of (fair) weather.' It is noticeable that none of these figures or comparisons refer to the heat of the sun, and the only adjective indicative of tem perature is wearm. It is the light, the clear-shining, the dark dispelling power of the sun that impressed these dwellers under cloudy skies by stormy waters. They loved light as those who sit in darkness, and their eyes were acute in the perception of everything that shone and glinted and gleamed. Of the relation of this to their sense of color I shall treat elsewhere. Chiefly they loved the greatest of lights ; and while they wrote no hymns to the morning, nor sonnets on the sunrise, there are stray bits of verse that breathe the spirit of true poetry of the</page><page sequence="19">No. 4] Nature in Old English Poetry 457 dawn. Beowulf has two brief references to the coming of day, neither of them, however, strong in description or feeling : 'Light came from the east, the bright beacon of God' (569 570) ; and ' The morning light of the next day, the sun clothed with heavenly brightness shines from the south ' (604?606). In Exodus, lines 344?346 describe the coming of the day by the use of a peculiar word, d gw?ma, literally, ' the noise of day/ but evidently signifying the rush of breaking day. The same com pound, with an additional element of color, d gr?dwoma, is found in Andreas ; and the passage contains also the fine figure of the helmet of night gliding apart, which is found paren thetically in Elene 78 : ' The helmet of night glided apart, quickly disappeared ; then came the light, the rush of rosy dawn, (123?125). Andreas has another effective description of coming day : ' Then came the resplendent morning, brightest of beacons, holy from the darkness, to hasten over the sea ; heaven's candle shone over the ocean-floods' (241-244). A more conventional reference, and one especially appropriate to a religious poem, is ' The Lord caused the candle of day to shine ' (Andreas 837 838). An excellent passage, with something of the stateliness of a psalm, is found in the Wonders of Creation: ' Every morning comes this bright light over the misty hills, wondrously prepared to pass over the waves, and with the early dawn hastens from the east, beautiful and pleasant to the lamilies of men ; for all who live it brings forth light, brightest of fires, and every one on earth may enjoy it' (59-66). The tone and movement of this agree well with one of the few poetic stanzas in the Rune Song : ' Day is the messenger of God, dear to men, the glorious light of the Creator, pleasure and confidence to rich and poor, a benefit to all ' (74-77). Illustrative equally of the method of paraphrase and of the feeling for nature is the passage in the Phoenix corre sponding to lines 35-36 of Lactantius' poem : Lutea cum primum surgens Aurora rubescit Cum primum rosea sidera luce fugat. ' He shall behold the journey of the sun and [shall see] the</page><page sequence="20">458 Hanscom, [Vol. V candle of God, the bright gem, come again, shall eagerly watch when the noblest of stars arises to shine over the sea from the east, by its beauty to illumine the ancient work of the Father, the luminous symbol of God. The stars are hid, disappear under the waves in the west, obscure in the morning glow, and the dark night, [grown] wan, departs. . . . The light of heaven rises to glide from the east over the vast sea' (99-103). Of the special words applied to the morning, morgen is the most common and least distinctive. Others are rd g, ' early day'; d gr?d, ' dawn '; and hancr?d, 'cock-crow/ which occurs but once in verse (The Soul to the Body 68) ; but, as befits its meaning, is more common in prose. Sunset is neither so often mentioned nor so effectively de scribed as is the dawn. Its peculiar glory, like all displays of color, seems to have escaped the dull eyes of the early English poets. Occasionally there is a vague, general reference to the beauty of departing day, as : ' Afterward our Lord created the first evening with its bright glow' (Genesis 136-138); 'The brilliant sun, heavenly bright, glides to his setting ' (Andreas 1249?1250) ; 'The wondrous star with all his glory journeys in the west until at evening he treads the floor of ocean ' ( Wonders of Creation 68?71) ; ' The gem of heaven, the candle of delight to men, declined in the west, the heavenly bright sun prepared for his setting' (Andreas 1185-1188). There is but one refer ence to color in any of these passages, and that notes the darkness of coming night : ' The sun glided to his setting under the low headlands, the night, brown and dusky, spread over the high hills, covered them with its helmet' (Andreas 1306-1309). In tone this harmonizes well with ' The noble glory sought his place of setting, the northern sky grew dark and wan under the clouds, covered the earth with mist, overspread it with darkness, the night pressed upon it' (Guthlac 1252?1255). The sun is described as growing 'weary' in Ph nix 141 ; but this is the only reference to sunset, although the poem abounds in allusions to nature. The noun fen appears in three compounds : fengl?m, ' even</page><page sequence="21">No. 4] Nature in Old English Poetry 459 ing-gloom,' 'twilight;' fenleoht, ' evening-light ;' fensclma, ' evening-splendor ; ' but otherwise it is unmodified. As the measure or unit of time night is frequently used. When distinguished as that part of the day given over to dark ness, it is often modified by such epithets as deorc, ' dark ; ' n?pende, ' shadowy ; ' siveart, ' swarthy ' Pystre, ' gloomy ; ' winterceald, 'wintry cold;' won, 'dark.' Significant of the dread inspired by the darkness are the compounds nihtbealu, nihtegesa, meaning the evil and terror that come by night. In Beowulf occur two short references to night, neither possessing descriptive value : ' The evening light is hidden under the cover of the sky' (413-414); and 'The helmet of night darkened black above the warriors' (1789-1799). The compound niht helm, here used, contains an effective figure, and occurs five times in the body of verse. Slight as is the poetic feeling in the passages last quoted, there is still less in the thoroughly prosaic and axiomatic statement o? Solomon and Saturn : ' Night is the darkest of seasons ' (310). Fortunately other poems rise to greater heights in the contemplation of the enveloping dark ness. The creation of night is thus described in Genesis : ' The dark gloom for which the Lord Himself created the name of night, followed fast, pressed on its track,' i. e. that of the first evening (138?140). Later in the same poem this idea of night pursuing day is again introduced : ' The evening glow departed ; then came night on the track of day. The Glory of this life [i. e. God] enwrapped in darkness the stream, seas, and the broad earth ' (2447-2451). Another idea, that of night brood ing over the earth, is suggested in Guthlac: 'The sky grew dark above the children of men, the night advanced, dark above the people' (1069-1071). In Riddle 80, which deals in enigma with the strife of the sun and moon, the end of the combat is thus described : ' Dust rose to heaven, dew fell on the earth, night came forth. After that no man knew the path of this creature,' i. e. the sun (12?15). To the luminary of the night but slight attention was paid. There are thirteen places in which the noun m?na, 'moon,'</page><page sequence="22">460 Hanseom, [Vol. V occurs, but without epithet or description. Riddle SO opens in this fashion : ' A wondrous creature I saw carrying its prey between its horns, the shining vessel of the air cunningly adorned ' (1-3), an obvious allusion to the moon. Similar to this obtuseness to the beauty and influence of the moon is the indifference to the stars. Two nouns are used, tungol, the general word for luminary, applied also to the sun and moon ; and steorra (' star ') which occurs by itself but four times, and is once compounded with heofon, ' star of heaven.' Tungol is twice compounded, once as tungolgim, ' gemlike star/ and once as heofontungol, ' star of heaven.' The adjectives applied to the stars are l?oht, ' light ; ' m re, ' splendid ; ' swegl torht, ' heavenly bright ; ' torht, ' bright ; ' trum, ' steadfast.' These are used but sparingly. In lines 1148-1149 of the Christ the 'shining abode' and the 'pleasant aspect' of the stars are mentioned. In stanza 17 of the Rune Song, the rune ^, Tir, seems to refer to a constellation or a fixed star : ' T?r is one of the signs, always keeps faith with men, is always in his course, beyond the shades of night ; never departs.' Knowl edge of the heavenly bodies, which probably implied the power of divination, is mentioned among the special gifts of God : ' One can tell the course of the stars, the vast creation' (Christ 671-672). In the same poem there is a passage that possibly suggests the music of the spheres, although there is no explicit statement. In the description of the day of doom it is foretold that the angels shall gather from the four corners of the world, shall blow their trumpets and ' glorious and steadfast shall shout in chorus over against the course of the stars' (883-884). The confusion still existing in our language between heaven and the heavens is found to a still greater degree in early Eng lish, and' most of the words applied to the firmament denote also the celestial abode. Thus heofon, rodor, swegel are used in both senses. When denoting the sky they are sometimes com pounded, as heofonhr?f, ' the roof of heaven/ to which corre sponds worulde hrbf ' the roof of the world ; ' heofonhwealf, ' the vault of heaven ' ; heofontimber, ' heavenly structure ; ' up</page><page sequence="23">No. 4] Nature in Old English Poetry 461 rodor, ' the firmament on high.' Lyfthelm, ' the helmet of the air,' is applied to the sky, and embodies the same metaphor as nihthelm, noted above. It will be seen that all these nouns except ?prodor are figurative by implication, and suggest, if they do not express, aesthetic appreciation and poetic feeling. But aside from these germinal words, there are no references to the sky that show either enjoyment or observation of its beauty. Very probably this indifference was due in part to the fact that it was seldom visible in its glory. Like the Parsee who thought the English might worship the sun if they ever saw it, we may infer that their ancestors might have appreciated the firmament if it had been less obscured. At least there is significance in a phrase frequently used, under wolcnum. Repeatedly, where we should expect ' under the sky ' or ' under the heavens,' we find ' under the clouds,' showing the usual aspect of the sky. Beside the numerous references to clouds in the storm-passages already cited, there are a few compounds and phrases that deserve attention : wolcenfaru, ' host of clouds ; ' wolcengehn?ste, ' cloud combat ; ' wederwohen, ' weather-cloud ;&gt; wolcna genipu, ' cloud shadows ; ' wolcna gong, ' passage of the clouds ; ' wolcna href, ' roof of clouds ; ' wolcna sw?g, ' crashing of clouds ; ' wem^mlic wohna sc?r, ' warm shower of clouds.' There is but one de scriptive passage, and that is poor and slight : ' The clouds dark with wind bear rain to the broad earth' (Genesis 212?214). With this quotation, so poor and meagre as to be characteristic of Old English nature poetry at its worst, I close my citations. In the preceding pages I have tried to show which aspects of nature appealed to early English minds, and what intellectual and emotional response they made to that appeal. The material collected seems to me to justify two or three conclusions. Originally this poetry, like that of all early people, was strongly objective. Nature was presented in a series of objects or sensible manifestations ; between these objects and others of the same or different categories the people saw resemblances which they expressed by figures, generally metaphors. These figures consist largely of compound nouns and adjectives in</page><page sequence="24">462 Hanscom, [Vol. V which the component parts are united without causal, possessive, or other expressed relation ; or they are implied in a union of noun and verb that by literal interpretation have no connection. Christianity introduced an entirely new set of facts and con ceptions, and by the addition of this new material the field for comparison was greatly enlarged. The poets' lack of subtlety prevented them from seeing incongruities which to us are absurdly obvious ; and we find pagan metaphor and Christian simile jostling each other almost in the same line. Many of the metaphors are founded on personification, a figure which is found implicitly in a great deal of the poetry ; but is seldom openly expressed. But of that anthropomorphic view of nature now so common in verse, and especially of that sentimental attributing of feeling and emotion, aptly termed ' the pathetic fallacy/ there is practically no trace. Doubtless this is the chief reason that to most modern readers the poetry seems cold and lifeless. The short phrasing of the verse, the result of the analytic method of the mind, by which idea is added to idea until the whole thought is attained, lends itself easily to the sequence of noun and epithet, compound nouns and adjectives, and brief phrases, to the exclusion of prolonged and connected descriptions. Thus emphasis is thrown on the single epithet and phrase, i. e., the obvious details of the picture rather than on its general effect or emotional value. The recurrent phrasing of the verse is connected also with the habit of repetition which is one of the most marked of Old English literary characteristics. Apparently a happy phrase, an appropriate epithet, could not be too frequently used ; with the result that much of the emotional value was lost by con stant attrition, and expressions once full of feeling became merely formal and conventional. Of certain large, and to us significant aspects of nature, the English poets either took no cognizance or regarded them with indifference. But to other forms they paid the homage of the undivided mind, seeing sharply, differentiating keenly, expressing</page><page sequence="25">No. 4] Nature in Old English Poetry 463 forcibly. The passages which best illustrate these qualities are those relating to the sea ; but they demaud a separate treat ment. The extracts given above are sufficient, I trust, to prove that at least the germs of nature-observation and -feeling were present in our literature independently of the Celtic element, and before it came under Norman influence.
