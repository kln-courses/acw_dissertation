<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Marjo Christina Annette Korpel. A Rift in the Clouds: Ugarit and Hebrew Descriptions of the Divine. Ugaritisch-biblische Literatur 8. Miinster: Ugarit-Verlag, 1990. xii, 721 pp. This large book (over 700 pages) deals with the various metaphors which are used to describe divinities in the Hebrew Bible and in the Ugaritic texts. The author has arranged the metaphors semantically under the head- ings of anthropomorphic (metaphors which contain human properties, social relations, life and death, accessories of life, and occupations), therio- morphic (gods in the form of animals), and physiomorphic (gods in the form of inanimate thinglike stones, mountains, trees, and plants) descriptions of the gods. Each section is prefaced by a list of the Ugaritic and Hebrew words to be discussed in that section. Where the Ugaritic and Hebrew words are considered to be parallel, they are highlighted in a table illustrating the par- allels. The volume is supplemented by three helpful indexes: of Ugaritic words; of Hebrew and Aramaic words; and of subjects. In surveying her evidence, Korpel comes to a somewhat predictable con- clusion. Ugarit and Israel share some metaphors but not others, and some metaphors are used differently in Israel. The differences are as illuminating as the parallels. So, for example, every metaphor implying weakness, humil- iation, or desire of the deity is shunned in the Bible. If El of Ugarit is old and weak, El referring to Yahweh is vigorous and strong. In contrast to the gods of Ugarit, Yahweh does not lie or forget, does not crouch, fall, pray, is never defeated, never flees, is never taken captive, etc. Adopting J. de Moor's thesis (most recently expressed in The Rise of Yahwism: The Roots of Israelite Monotheism [Louvain, 1990]), Korpel believes that the religion of Israel was originally not very different from Canaanite religion, but was dif- 279</page><page sequence="2">280 BOOK REVIEWS ferentiated only as a result of a fundamental religious schism. Indeed all dif- ferences between the Ugaritic and Israelite descriptions of the divine can ultimately be traced back to a single cause, the Israelites' early choice of only one God, Yahweh, above all other divine beings. The resulting exclusiveness of Yahwism either made the other gods his subordinates or led to their being absorbed by him. This large assemblage of material arranged semantically should prove helpful as a starting point for other researchers on divine metaphors. However, readers should be alerted to a certain unevenness in the reliability of the Ugaritic material. A number of times, in spot-checking some of the sources, the reviewer found statements which were unsupportable in the cit- ed texts because they were based on hypotheses from reconstructed texts. Space permits only a few examples to be mentioned here. 1. Korpel finds evidence of the levirate marriage in KTU 1.6:1.30 f. (= I AB, 1:30 f.). In one place she asserts that when Baal went to the nether- world, his wife proclaimed herself a nubile widow in the clan of her late hus- band so that her father-in-law and his sons could fulfill their nuptial duty (p. 227). Elsewhere, she has Anat going to the house of her father (not her father-in-law!) for the same purpose (p. 359). All this is derived from a text of two very broken lines which read (in KTU, the text edition she cites): [ ] xhh.tit bm.'*[ ][ ]zrh. y*bm.l ilm. 2. From another broken text, that of KTU 1.5.111.6 [= 1" AB, 111:6], Korpel deduces that Baal has to wear white clothes when he goes down to the netherworld: "his clothes [mdm] have to be white [lbn] like the Moon, and his cloak ['ipd] pure like the stars" (p. 366). But the two words for clothes, mdm and 'ipd (the presumed basis for the citation), are not to be found in the extant text. 3. On the basis of KTU 1.2:111:20 (= III AB, C:20), Korpel states that "the god 'Athtaru complains that he has to get out of his woolen underwear alone, implying that he needs a wife to undress and wash him" (p. 366). But the Ugaritic text, which reads lb*d*m*.ard.bn s*(?)nq.trbyn.k*jrm[, does not support this statement and deduction. The alleged "woolen underwear" (npin) has to be restored in the text, then it has to be equated with Akkadian napds'u "to card wool," from which a putative noun "woolen underwear" (npin) must be derived. Then it has to be assumed that the preceding words lb*d*m.ard. will yield the meaning "getting out [of his underwear] alone." Finally, while it is true that there is a word for "washing" in this line (trhyn), the word for "wife" (aft) does not occur until line 22, making any connec- tion between the two very spurious, and certainly not warranting Korpel's</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 281 repeated assertions that it was the task of women to wash their husbands before they went to bed (pp. 329-330, 489-490). A futher difficulty is that Korpel often advances novel interpretations of texts without alerting the reader that they are not widely accepted: For example, Korpel quotes a passage from KTU 1.4:11:5-6 (= II AB, 11:5-6) which purportedly demonstrates that Athiratu (Asherah) was doing her laundry. But for this interpretation to stand, Korpel has to assume that the Ugaritic word tmt' (a hapax legomenon) in the phrase tmt'.mdh.bym. (line 6) not only must mean something like its Arabic cognate "to carry away" (H. Wehr, Dictionary, p. 890), but has an additional meaning "to carry off for rinsing" (p. 365). Having thus established that a laundry scene is in progress, Korpel observes: "It is surprising to see the highest goddess of the Ugaritic pantheon busy with her own laundry, a task she was apparently not sup- posed to delegate to one of her servants" (p. 489). Furthermore, a paral- lelism for Athiratu rinsing her clothes in the sea is held to be "obvious" in Micah 7:19, where God is said to tread the iniquities of His people in the deep sea. But in Micah, the treading of iniquities, whatever the metaphor may mean (probably "to forgive"; for discussion, see D. Hillers, Micah, pp. 88-89), is not done in the sea. The sea is the place where, into its depths, God is being implored to cast (taslTk) the people's sins, so as to make them disappear. As can be seen from the last example, occasionally Korpel's compari- sons of Hebrew and Ugaritic parallels can be quite tenuous. In short, read- ers are cautioned to treat the Ugaritic material with circumspection, and, should they wish to quote from the book, they are advised to check the auth- or's citations very carefully.
