The religion of ancient Rome had a peculiar and interesting history, which is by no means apparent in classical literature. Liter ature presents us with a Grseco-Roman religion which was the out come of the imposition of Greek anthropomorphic ideas, involving legends and outward representations of personally conceived deities, on a simpler and in some ways more genuinely religious animistic cult. To re-discover this cult we have to a large extent to get behind literature, and to piece together evidence derived in the main from the records of strange festivals, which were conscientiously kept up in Rome long after they had lost any real significance. This work of reconstruction has been carried out in the last half-century and is associated in England with the name of Warde Fowler, whose two great works, Roman Festivals and The Religious Experience of the Roman People, are likely long to remain the standard books on the subject. But they are perhaps too large and too detailed for the average reader, and there was great need of some shorter and more popular exposition of the results achieved. This need has been admirably fulfilled by Professor Halliday, who in eight short lectures, running to 180 thinly printed pages in all, has sketched the character of this genuine old Roman religion, and then shown its development as it came into contact first with other Italian cults, then with the overwhelming influence of Greek religion and philosophy, and finally under Augustus felt the touch of that " Caesar-worship " which was to play so large a part during the Empire. Only those who have tried know how difficult a task this work of summarisation can be. Out of a mass of material the salient features must be selected and so combined as to give a clear picture. Professor Halliday has achieved his end with singular success : his outlines are always clear and he gives his reader just enough detail to whet his appetite for more and send him to the larger works or to the more fascinating task of extracting secrets from the original sources. A peculiarly valuable feature of the work is that it keeps religious develop ment in touch with the general history of Rome, and we see how an ever-widening contact with other civilisations led a people always ready to assimilate new ideas to develop their religious thoughts freely as they did. Professor Halliday does not himself contribute much that is new : "I have tried," he says, "to be orthodox rather than original " ; but some remarks of his on pp. 94 ff. about animal worship, which he has himself studied closely in connection with divination, will certainly help to clear up a very vexed question. Brevity has occasionally led him to dogmatism, and the critical may think, for instance, that he dismisses too summarily the notion that the Lares were the spirits of dead ancestors (p. 27), and hardly goes deep enough into the ultimate conception of the Di Manes. Ritual too might have received fuller treatment and greater stress been</page><page sequence="2">1923] VIE DE CHARLEMAGNE 217 laid in the last lecture on Augustus' obvious intention of concentrating in his own household and person a kind of syncretism of the genuine Roman and the Grseco-Roman religions in the Palatineâ€”Vesta and Apollo were brought within the range of the genius Augusti. But the wonder rather is that Professor Halliday has got together so much in so small a compass and has made a difficult and rather recondite subject so conspicuously attractive. C. Bailey. C.
