University of Texas Press, Austin, Texas. 1996: 268 pp., 16 black-and-white photos, 55 line drawings, 6 tables. $40 (cloth), $19.95 (paper).-Like many of Alexander Skutch's books, this one is a nice blend of personal observations accumulated over six decades and a distillation of the literature about the focal birds. Only two chapters represent modified versions of previously published work. This book deals with two of the largest South and Central American bird families, the antbirds (Formicariidae) and ovenbirds (Fur- nariidae), the former with roughly 250 species, the latter with about 215 (Skutch does not comment on the recent splitting of the antbirds into two families, the typical [Thamnophil- idae] and ground [Formicariidae] antbirds or making the woodcreepers a subfamily of the Furnariidae). Antbirds are treated in the first eleven chapters, ovenbirds in the last ten. The first seven chapters of each section are parallel, dealing with a general description of the family; food and foraging; daily life; voice, displays, and courtship; nests; eggs and incu- bation; and young and their care. The eighth chapter details a single species. The accounts diverge at this point, with chapters nine and ten in the antbird section dealing with nesting success, breeding seasons, and survival, while in the ovenbird section a single chapter deals with enemies, nest success, and survival. Each section concludes with a chapter on the interactions of the family with humans. The pages ring with the names of interesting sound- ing birds-fire-eye, bare-eye, gnateaters, spinetails, thistletails, tuftedcheek, softtails, prick- letails, barbtails, wiretails and brushrunner. In the Foreword, David Snow states that the book is "full of gems of observation and description" and that one of Skutch's attributes has been to describe his observations "in a style full of fluency and grace." I agree. We not only learn about army ant biology and that there are 28 species of antbirds which are considered "professional" (obligate) army ant followers but read vivid descriptions of antbirds foraging with ant columns and swarms, using the ants as beaters. We learn that the Bicolored Antbird's (Gymnopithvs leucaspis) voice is "Pleasantly whimsical rather than musical," that in displays "the same embellish- ments are conspicuous in both agonistic encounters and in courtship-they cannot change their clothes for different occasions." One ovenbird sings as "the shadows of night descend through clouds of foliage." He captures the essence of the birds, e.g., antpittas "are roly- poly birds with legs that seem too long for them and tails too short." Much of the text is descriptive, but there are frequent ecological comparisons such as of antwrens filling the ecological role of warblers of temperate forests, or hypotheses, e.g., that bare skin around the eyes may be advantageous to birds which forage in dense vegetation. Skutch also broach- es broad philosophical questions, many of which have strong anthropomorphic implica- tions-do antbirds feel love or affection for mates, anger, genuine distress, or fear? Skutch concludes that empathy suggests that they do but that science "remains stubbornly silent," and speculates on the importance of the answers to these questions. He states that spinetails and thornbirds (which construct elaborate stick nests) appear to take "pride in their house- keeping, and seem to enjov building and maintaining their nests, which may be the reason why they make them so elaborate." These and other philosophical and metaphysical spec- ulations may irritate some readers but do not detract from the careful and patient natural history observations which form the heart of this book. Skutch's writing is very personal- he takes the reader to the rainforest and makes the birds come alive-my favorite story in this book is about a Bicolored Antbird, "Jimmy," that used Skutch as a beater on many occasions for more than a year, following him and snapping up insects which Skutch dis- turbed. The illustrations by Dana Gardner beautifully complement the text. There are no in-text references, a compromise to readability no doubt, but Skutch always credited other's work by name and a search of the bibliography usually turned up an unambiguous reference</page><page sequence="2">ORNITHOLOGICAL LITERATURE 757 (occasionally there were several papers by the same author and it was not entirely clear which one contained the information mentioned in the text). But this is a minor quibble. The book is informative and delightful natural history reading. I recommend it to anyone who plans to visit the New World tropics or study its birds.-WILLIAM E.
