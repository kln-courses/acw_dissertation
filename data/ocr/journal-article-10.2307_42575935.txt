<plain_text><page sequence="1">INTEGRATIVE LEVELS IN BIOLOGY' ALEX B. NOVIKOFF [Foreword by A. Korzybski: The following paper by Dr. Novi ko ff may be considered as complementary to Jerome Alexander's ' Successive Levels of Material Structure? (ETC. Vol. I, No. 3). The physico-mathematical, colloidal orientations to be found in Alexander also permeate Dr. Novikoff's article. Let me suggest that Dr. Novikoff's use of the terms 'matter,' 'material,' ' substance ,' etc., implies that they are to be taken in the sense of Alexander' s higher orders of complexities of dynamic structure. The reader interested in the difference between static ' old matter* and dynamic ' new mattet should consult Chapter IX on ' Colloidal Behaviour* and Fart X 'On the Structure of "Matter" ', in my Science and Sanity. Dr. Novikoff discusses the methods of evaluation in biology to be found among his modern colleagues. It may be suggested that what work of his colleagues Dr. Novikoff approves may be considered non-aristotelian, and what he disapproves, rather forcibly, may be considered aristotelian. From a general semantics point of view the differences in methods of evaluation among biologists are the best implicit example I know of the contrast between artistotelian and non-aristotelian orientations. He does not analyze directly the influence of aristotelian biology, with its 'philosophical' implications, but the foundation of the present difficulties can be traced back to the aristotelian system. Aristotle was fundamentally a biologist, over two thousand years ago. Obviously he could not know modern electro-colloidal advances, and so his 'Weltanschauung' was naive and over- simplified. His psycho-logical assumptions prevented him from discriminating sharply between animal and human biologies. Aristotle no doubt was an outstanding genius of his day and, un- fortunately for us, he codified his pres cien tifie biological beliefs of those days into a system, which includes 'logic,' 'psychology,' 'philosophy,' metaphysics, physics, history of animals, politics, rhetoric, poeti√ßs, ethics, etc. All through his system there are many psycho-logical commonsense macroscopic observations based on his limited biological orientations, the consequences of which Dr. Novikoff is stressing even today. Aristotle's prescientific assumptions were elaborated and perpetuated by the ' philosophers' and church fathers through the Dark and Middle Ages. The consequences were tragic for Indo- European culture, as there was no escape from identification of animals and humans, resulting in anthropomorphism, general identifications (so common with the maladjusted), teleological fallacies, and other paralyzing evaluations which plague us today. Even the sick and ignorant Hitler and his ilk are the direct progeny of the centuries of elaborations and even distortions of Aristotle's pioneering work. If Aristotle had been treated as any modern scientist and pioneer, his system would have been gradually revised. But in the Dark and Middle Ages it became a dogma, and that dogma produced the harm, particularly because some 'vested interests' found that system useful to them in maintaining power. As I explained on page 97 of Science and Sanity, there is a definite relationship between the aristotelian system and the euclidean and finally newtonian systems which resulted from it. They were found dangerously inadequate today because they were unable to deal with the . electrical character of the world and the electro-colloidal character of life. Revisions yielded non- euclidean, non-newtonian (einsteinian), and finally non-aristotelian systems. The Greek systems were fundamentally static. See ETC., Vol. I, No. 2, ' One Golden Age: Mathematics since 1801' by Eric T. Bell, on the static character of Greek mathematics. See also that controversial book The Road to Serfdom by Friedrich A. Hayek, and the review by Laivrence Frank in The Saturday Review of Literature (May 12, 1943), in which Dr. Frank traces Hayek's thesis to the 203</page><page sequence="2">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS mechanistic theories of Newton and the animalistic theories of Darwin, all products of aristotelian evaluations. Similarly, Stuart Chase in his article ' Back to Grandfather* in Nation (May 19, 1943) clearly and justly shows that the dangers of Hayek's thesis can be traced back to the aristotelian, antiquated, limited, two-valued orientations, disregarding many factors which such methods of evaluation cannot handle adequately. These are the very problems we are dealing with in our non-aristotelian work. The importance of the article by Dr. Novikoff is that he brought some fundamental points to a sharp focus. The history of biology has been a stormy one, and its progress very slow, due exactly to the reasons emphasized by him, and its saturation with primitive and aristotelian formulations involving so much metaphysics. I struggled with the problem of the serious difference between animal and human biologies in my theory of time-binding (see Manhood of Humanity, 1921). My further analysis of human time-binding behavior ultimately led to the building of a non-aristotelian system. In fact, the formulating of such a system would have been impossible without that initial psycho-biological clarification. The cataclysmic tragedies of today, predicted by many men of vision, have shocked us to a painful awakening where we must search for and discover the silent assumptions which made such tragedies inevitable. We are faced with a weighty decision: Will we continue to follow the groping, stultifying, course molded by the dogmas of the Dark and Middle Ages, or shall we investigate structurally new, non-aristotelian systems upon which a firmer and saner society may be built for the future ?] THE organization concept of is integrative a general description levels1 of organization is a general description of the evolution of matter through suc- cessive and higher orders of complexity and integration. It views the develop- ment of matter, from the cosmological changes resulting in the formation of the earth to the social changes in society, as continuous because it is never-ending, and as discontinuous because it passes through a series of different levels of or- ganization - physical, chemical, biological and sociological. In the continual evolution of matter, new levels of complexity are superim- posed on the individual units by the or- ganization and integration of these units into a single system. What were wholes on one level become parts on a higher one. Each level of organization possesses unique properties of structure and be- havior which, though dependent on the properties of the constituent elements, ap- pear only when these elements are com- bined in the new system. Knowledge of the laws of the lower level is necessary for a full understanding of the higher level; yet the unique properties of phe- nomena at the higher level can not be predicted, a priori , from the laws of the lower level. The laws describing the unique properties of each level are quali- tatively distinct, and their discovery re- quires methods of research and analysis appropriate to the particular level. These laws express the new organizing relation- ships, i.e., the reciprocal relationships of elementary units to each other and to the unit system as a whole. The concept of integrative levels recog- nizes as equally essential for the purpose of scientific analysis both the isolation of parts of a whole and their integration into the structure of the whole. It neither reduces phenomena of a higher level to those of a lower one, as in mechanism, nor describes the higher level in vague non- material terms which are but substitutes for understanding, as in vitalism.

Emerson in Science, June 8, 1945. 204</page><page sequence="3">INTEGRATIVE LEVELS IN BIOLOGY leaves the firm ground of material reality. Integration does not imply, as Lillie has recently maintained, 'special vital factors'2 or 'something of the mental or psychic.'3 Both parts and wholes are material en- tities, and integration results from the interaction of the parts, as a consequence of their properties. The concept points the need to study the organizational inter- relationships of parts and whole. This full recognition of both units and whole leads to a more adequate understanding of the whole. The different levels of matter, while distinct, are not completely delimited from each other. No boundary in nature is fixed and no category air-tight. 'Meso- forms' are found at the transition point of one level of organization to the next. Between the highest level of organization of non-living, the crystal, and the lowest level of unicellular organisms are protein paracrystals, the viruses, with some of the internal structure and behavior of living substance. Between the single-cell organ- ism and the multicellular organism are the colonial organisms. Yet the absence of rigid demarcation between two levels does not make the difference between them any less clear or fundamental. Meso- forms, 'the more clearly we understand them, will all the more clearly serve to bring out the essentially new elements of (the) higher order.' 4 There is both continuity and discon- tinuity in the evolution of the universe; and consideration of one to the exclusion of the other acts to retard the develop- ment of biological and sociological sciences. Knowledge- of the general qualities of development common to all levels of organization of matter will aid in the analysis and description of the con- crete attributes of each level. But it can not be a substitute for such analysis or for the determination of the qualitative uniqueness of each level and the char- acteristic laws which govern it. Physico-chemical and Biological Levels The concept of integrative levels does not regard living organisms as machines made of a multitude of discrete parts (physico-chemical units), removable like pistons of an engine and capable of de- scription without regard to the system from which they are removed. Its ap- proach is one which biochemists are adopting more and more : living cells present problems not to be encountered in the test-tube or flask. The structural pattern of the cell plays a decisive role in many of the chemical reactions which constitute metabolism. The ordering, as well as speed, of the chemical reactions in the cell are largely the result of the distribution and activity of colloidal enzymes. Korr5 has indicated that even simple colloidal systems 'represent a much higher level of integration . . . and that, because of the quantitative and qualita- tive modification which interfaces and their molecular groupings impose, there emerge new classes of phenomena for which there are no analogies in homo- geneous systems, and which, therefore, require new sets of rules.' Commoner6 has discussed the increased dependence of enzyme function on structural factors in the living cell. The degree of de- pendence of a particular enzyme system 2 Ralph S.

It has been the great contribution of the 'organicists' that they have demon- strated the error of the mechanistic re- duction of the biological organism to the physico-chemical. It is therefore un- fortunate that organicism' has been marred by non-material concepts. Or- ganicists fail to picture the whole as developing through the integration of individual units of matter into a single system; they omit a discussion of the organizing relationships of the parts. They try to describe the behavior of the organism solely in terms of the higher level, the whole. As a result, the impres- sion is created that no material basis exists for the part-whole relation. Almost all the text-book definitions of physiology reduce phenomena of living matter, a highly complex and integrated system, to the level of free molecules and atoms. Certainly chemical and physical forces are operative in cells, yet defining physiology as 'the physics and chemistry of life processes' overlooks the fact that the cell organization imposes a new and higher order on physico-chemical change, and that tissues, organs, organ-systems and organism impose a higher order on cell activity. Physiology rightly concerns itself also with the activities of the higher orders : cellular organization and function as well as chemistry and physics in the narrow sense; the tissue, organ, organ- system as well as the cell. No matter how complete our knowledge of the chemistry and physics of living systems becomes in the future, living substance must still be recognized as matter on a higher level, with new, unique properties which have emerged on combination of the lower- level units. When molecules become part of a highly integrated system, protoplasm, it is important to know the properties of the molecules, but protoplasmic behavior needs description in terms and laws which have no meaning for molecules, in spe- cifically biological terms and laws. Biological Levels Within the biological level, there are a series of other integrative levels. I. In the multicellular organism there is a hierarchy of levels - cells, tissues, organs, organ-systems and organism. Viewed in terms of integrative levels, Heilbrunn' s assertion that general phy- siology thus becomes cellular physiology' and that 'the ultimate mechanism respon- sible for any form of vital activity lies inherent in the individual cells'7 is one- sided. A full understanding of the or- ganism is not possible without complete knowledge of the activities of its cells. But knowledge of 'the individual cells' does not exhaust the problems of organ- ism physiology; the activity of the indi- dividual cell is greatly influenced by the products of activity of other cells in tis- sue, organ, organ-system and organism. The inadequacy of a cell concept in which the cell is considered an inde- pendent unit of activity is clear from the work of experimental embryologists. The embryo is not a collection of unrelated portions developing independently of each other; on the contrary, the develop- ment of any cell is dependent not only on its own constitution but also on the nature of the surrounding materials out- side the egg or produced in adjacent cells of the embryo. If ectoderm cells which normally form belly skin were removed from a salamander embryo and trans- planted over the mouth organizer of a 7L. V. Heilbrunn, An Outline of General Physiology, pp. 3, 4. Philadelphia, 1943. 206</page><page sequence="5">INTEGRATIVE LEVELS IN BIOLOGY frog embryo, they would develop into salamander structures - of the mouth; they would form teeth and not belly skin. Similarly, in the adult organism, plant or animal, the behavior of a cell is in- fluenced by the activity of other cells of the body. Thus, the hormone, auxin, produced in the apical cells of a plant, will cause the elongation of stem cells, inhibit the growth of cells of lateral buds, influence the course of differenti- ation of root cells and stimulate the growth of cambium cells. Chiefly through such hormones, the cells of the plant body are integrated into an organism. In ani- mals, the activity of cells is under the integrating influence of nerve impulses, hormones and other cell products like carbon dioxide. Activity of cells of the salivary glands is dependent upon stimu- lation by nerve impulses begun elsewhere in the body. The behavior of uterine cells depends not only on its own constitu- tion, but also on hormones produced by cells of pituitary and ovary. Carbon diox- ide produced by muscle cells in the legs will influence the behavior of the respira- tory center cells in the medulla. Just as cells do not exist in isolation in the organism, neither do organs or organ-systems. Thus, the functioning of the heart (the rate and force of its beat) is not unrelated to the pressure of the blood in the aorta and carotid arteries, the diameter of the arterioles or the amount of blood returning through the veins; nor is the circulatory system unaf- fected by or without effects on the nerv- ous, endocrine, muscular or respiratory systems. Coghill,8 using embryos, and Lashley9 and Goldstein,10 studying adult animals and men, have demonstrated the weakness of an atomistic approach to the activity of the nervous system and have emphasized that it functions as an in- tegrated whole. II. Populations constitute a distinct level of integration, higher than that of the individual organism. Schneirla, in his excellent studies on the interrelations be- tween individual behavior of the army-ant and the population unit or colony, stresses this point. 'Any social organization repre- sents a qualitatively new emergent level not equivalent to that which might be at- tained through a mere summation of the properties of its constituent individuals.'11 It is solely the reactions of the individual ant which are responsible for the highly organized mass behavior; yet strictly speaking, the Eciton worker has no be- havior pattern outside the social sphere.'12 Dobzhansky, in his authoritative work on population genetics, similarly de- scribes populations as higher levels of integration. The fate of a newly-arisen genetic variant depends not alone on its effect on the individual organism but also upon the 'dynamic regularities of the physiology of populations.' Thus, it is the effective size of a population which may determine whether a useless or even deleterious mutant will, through chance recombinations, become incorporated into the constitution of the group. The smaller this population size the less effective is selective pressure in evolution. Dobz- hansky emphasizes that evolutionary changes are changes in the genetic con- stitution of groups - of populations. Through natural selection, migration, and isolation, biological groups are produced 8 G. E. Coghill, Science, 78: 131, 1933. 9 K. S.

The laws of population genetics which describe these evolutionary changes are on a higher level than those of the genetics of the indi- vidual. 'The rules governing the genetic structure of a population are, neverthe- less, distinct from those governing the genetics of individuals, just as rules of sociology are distinct from physiological ones, although they are in fact merely integrated forms of the latter.13 Hie concept of integrative levels stresses the need to study living organ- isms at all levels - cells, tissues, organs, organ-systems, organisms and popula- tions. It is not 'organicis≈•; always the reciprocal relationship of elementary units to each other and to the unit sys- tem as a whole must be studied. It is not mechanistic; the detailed methods of study at higher levels will include not only some used at lower levels but new methods peculiar to the higher levels; the laws of one level will be expressed differently from those of the others. Biological and Social Levels According to the concept of integrative levels, man's social relationships repre- sent a new level, higher than that of his biological make-up. Man's behavior differs from that of other animals because of his possession of body structures, notably, the highly developed nervous system, which make thought and speech possible and whose functioning is profoundly affected by social or cultural influences. Man pos- sesses a unique head and hand, and is able to confront nature not only with his body but with tools devised and wielded by him. The crude tools of primitives give way to the more complex technology char- acteristic of modern society. As the tech- nological forces change, the social and economic relations of men change, and, with them, man's behavior. Socio-eco- nomic or cultural forces thus come to dominate biological factors in directing man's actions. In a penetrating analysis of Sigmund Freud's failure to recognize the insepara- bility of the biological and the cultural forces which determine man's behavior, Bartlett writes, The biological organism, by its ex- istence in society, has become a 'new biological species.' . . . The biological organism is transformed; it no longer exists as a biological phenomenon, strictly speaking. Under the influence of society, the biological has become the psychological. New laws of motion have come into being which are neither biological nor sociological, but the subject of study of a different science, psychology.14 The concept of integrative levels, as it stresses the need to study the interrela- tionships between the biological and sociological, emphasizes the fact thatlRe two constitute two distinct levels. Blur- ring this distinction leads to anthropo- morphism and to mystical, often danger- ous, statements about society. Anthropomorphism - endowing ani- mals, and even plants, with human at- tributes, psychical and social - transports the higher level (social) bodily into the lower level (biological) . In doing so, it presents a wholly erroneous picture of the animal. The aspects of behavior com- mon to man and animals are studied in comparative psychology, just as compara- tive cytology studies the uniformity of structure of diverse cells and comparative 13 Theodosius Dobzhansky, Genetics and the Origin of Species, p. 11.

Often, the significance of certain aspects of man's behavior (e.g., instincts) can be illuminated by studies on lower animals where the problem may be analyzed more directly. And in the an- thropoid apes, it is possible to investi- gate the beginning of reflective thought and of social influences on behavior. Yet the study of animal behavior can not be a substitute for the study of man's behavior. As we establish the likenesses in behavior of animals and men, we must simultaneously investigate the funda- mental qualitative differences between them. Except in certain pathological con- ditions, man's behavior is as unique as the organs which he, alone of all animals, possesses; thought, speech, labor are im- possible without a highly developed brain and a hand. It is his unique biological constitution which makes possible the de- velopment of truly social relations among men. Many investigators studying the integrated animal populations, the so- called societies of animals, appear to have overlooked the fact that animal societies never rise above the biological level, that only man's society is truly sociological. Any one who has tried to teach bio- logical change to college students knows the barriers to learning which have been created by the identification of animals with men throughout the student's life- time. Every phenomenon is approached by them in terms of human experience. There is no time scale other than the clock, calendar or century. Yet important biological change can be expressed only in a 'non-human' time scale. For each living organism travels at two enormously different speeds of life.15 The compara- tively rapid one is easy to comprehend because the changes can be observed ; the birth, growth and death of the body, the movement of the plant on the window sill, and even the less obvious chemical changes of cells and organisms. But only the end results of changes over many thousands of centuries can be seen in the diverse plants and animals, each almost perfectly adapted to its environment. A species, in high-speed terms, is constant; but in low-speed terms, it is changing. Thinking in high-speed terms of these low-speed phenomena leads almost in- evitably to teleologica! conceptions, ascrib- ing these phenomena to a divine purpose in nature. The terrestrial mammal has no gills because the air, containing little water, would dry out the exposed soft tissues; the earthworm has no eyes be- cause it has no need for them, buried as it is in the ground. Such teleological rea- soning is carried over even to changes which are directly observable. The heart beats in order to bring food-laden blood to all cells of the organism. The leaf bends to the light in order to intercept more energy for photosynthesis. There is no awareness that ascribing such pur- posive behavior to the heart or the plant imparts the ability to reason and to look into the future, in one case to a small individual part of the organism, and, in the other, to an organism which lacks a nervous system, let alone a brain! The history of biology demonstrates that teleology explains nothing, and, worse still, hampers the search for ex- planations and causes. You do not study the causal development of eyes in worms if you believe their absence in earth- worms is explained by the statement that underground worms need none. Nor do you trouble to analyze the causes of car- diac muscle contraction or the distribu- tion of plant growth hormones if it suf- 18 Henry Collier, An Interpretation of Biol- ogy, Chapter 5. London, 1938. 209</page><page sequence="8">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS fices to say that the heart beats to pump blood and the leaf bends to get light. You do not study the causes of evolution or the explanation of mutual adaptation of organism and environment if you as- sert, as Gerard has recently, that the 'selection or creation of these particular mechanisms' is volitional or purposive." Only when purpose was excluded from descriptions of all biological activity ex- cept rational behavior of human beings, could biological problems be properly formulated and analyzed. Critique of Literature In a recent volume devoted to the con- cept of integrative levels,17 a number of serious errors occur. These errors stem from a tendency to concentrate exclusively on the continuity of development of mat- ter from low to high levels. While the 'organicists' concentrate their attention exclusively on the uniqueness of the biological level ('the organism as a whole') without relating it to the lower levels, this tendency is preoccupied with the general similarity of organizational development in evolution to the exclusion of any consideration of the uniqueness of each level. This overemphasis of the continuity of evolution leads to the con- fusion of biological and sociological levels. A. E. Emerson acknowledges the dis- tinction between biological and social sciences but then says, 'Society is surely a manifestation of fundamental life at- tributes which are shared with other bio- logical systems and the division between the social and non-social is not sharp.'18 Elsewhere, he maintains that 'the evolu- tion of human social and ethical char- acteristics is governed by the same forces which have been directing organismic evolution through the ages.'19 However, the material in Emerson's articles reveals the basic difference between the forces making for change in human society and those producing changes in 'organismic evolution.' There has apparently been no important change in the society of insects in the thirty-five million years since the Oligocene period. Since insects possess neither intelligence nor the ability to transmit the results of experience to others, change is dependent on the slow process of germinal change (mutation) and their society is therefore relatively fixed. On the other hand, in the seven or eight thousand years of recorded his- tory, man's society has continually changed; because of the transmission of experience symbolized by tools, language, printing, photography, etc., there is social- cultural inheritance as well as biological inheritance. It is the plasticity of man's intelligence which brings ethics into be- ing. While man's social relations have un- dergone marked transformation, his biology has remained essentially un- changed. What small biological change has occurred (e.g., increased mean length of life) has been the result and not the cause of social development. The 'forces . . . governing . . . human social and ethical characteristics' have been not biological but social, the relation of man to changing technological and economic relations.

That is why whatever similarities one notes in animal and human societies must be purely formal and therefore mean- ingless. Gerard accepts the old analogy be- tween society and the living organism and, by what Simpson has aptly described as the 'most reckless, unjustified, and nonscientific extrapolation,'20 he draws a great many parallels between aspects of society and organisms. Thus, he equates scientists with receptors,21 the formation of an army by a nation with the fusion of slime molds in the face of emergency conditions,'22 altruism of men with 'serv- ice and mutual helpfulness seen in the interplay of cell nucleus and chloro- plast,'23 and so on. It is unnecessary to enumerate all the parallels. In every one of them, the social activities for which Gerard finds biological counterparts are not of biological origin but are the re- sults of long processes of social develop- ment. We can not overlook the fact that the origin of social integrations of ra- tional men in society is fundamentally dis- tinct from that of biological integration of masses of protoplasm in the living organism. Aside from its refinement in terms of modern biological data, the or- ganism-society analogy of Gerard is the same as that of Herbert Spencer in which, Needham has pointed out, instead of seeking the economic basis of social rela- tions, he 'elaborates to a degree sometimes almost fantastic the analogy between ani- mal and social organisms.'24 Just as the striking but fundamentally misleading analogy between living or- ganisms and non-living engines has stim- ulated both mechanical and vitalistic biology, so this organism-society analogy leads to erroneous and dangerous social conclusions as well as to anthropomor- phism.25 Because he fails to distinguish the social from the biological, Gerard 20 is led to formulate a single principle to govern the entire historical process from the origin of molecules to the develop- ment of human society, the progressive growth of cooperation and altruism. By oversimplifying phenomena and divest- ing each level of organization, among organisms and in society, of its specific characteristic qualities, a metaphysical statement is produced, to the effect that society will inevitably - because it is an organism - progress toward a cooperative state. 'The ultimate future of society, however dark it may look to the con- temporary sociologist or even to the his- torian, appears in the eyes of the biologist, sighting down the long perspective of organic evolution, as bright with hope.' It should be remembered that even in the biological world, evolution is not al- ways in the direction of progress - wit- 20 George G.

We can not afford to take refuge in Gerard's idea of a mysteriously operating 'organizing trend' 27 which will insure the steady march of progress for man's so- ciety. Such evolutionary fatalism is un- sound science, and dangerous social ad- vice for it leads only to inaction. For- tunately, the United Nations are not guided by such fatalism; they are relying not on any 'trend,' but on their armed might, in order to defeat fascism and keep society on the road of progress. Despite occasional backward move- ments and many blind alleys, biological evolution has moved in the direction of progress - towards more and more highly integrated and efficient organisms in which there is an increasing independence of and control over the external environ- ment. This is to be explained on the basis of phenomena such as genetic mutations and natural selection. We may agree that, despite more or less temporary setbacks, society will develop eventually to a high level of cooperation. But it will do so not because of 'organizing trends,' muta- tions or natural selection. Discussion of social evolution in terms of natural selection as it applies in the biological world is no more meaningful than meta- physics, for, as we have indicated, with- out a study of man's socio-economic rela- tions, it is impossible either to explain the past history or to indicate the pros- pects for the future development of so- ciety. Progress in social development is basically different from progress in or- ganic evolution; the latter does not in- volve conscious activity, the former, de- pending on scientific and technological advance, is the result of conscious activity of men and is directed by experience of life and study of history. Progress in organic evolution occurs without a set plan or direction; social progress rests upon planned activity of men. As Huxley says, human progress 'is not inevitable; man . . . must work and plan if he is to achieve further progress for himself and so for life.' 28 Needham 29 has demonstrated that the most dangerous aspect of the reduction of social phenomena to the biological level, at the present historical moment, is the basis it provides for fascist 'phi- losophy.' The central point in this 'phi- losophy' is the thesis that man's biology decides his social behavior, and ruthless oppression of certain groups of people is justified because these groups are for all times fixed as 'inferior' by their biology. Gerard's view gives indirect sup- port to this thesis, by making biological principles the guide for social thought and action. A sharp separation of the two levels - biological and social - must precede a fruitful discussion of how man's society can be kept free and democratic. That discussion must be based on a study, by means appropriate to the level, of the social forces making for change. Only a scientific analysis of these forces will en- able man to speed social progress. It is perhaps not surprising that Gerard's one-sided view of evolution - which ignores the qualitative differences of successive levels of integration and the specific part-whole relationships in each - should lead him to embrace the con- cept of purpose.30 The retarding influ- ence of teleological thinking on the ad- vance of biological science has already 27 Idem, 'A Biological Basis for Ethics, p. 108. 28 Julian Huxley, Evolution, The Modern Synthesis, p. 578.

Here we add our agree- ment with Huxley that any 'apparent pur- pose' in evolution is 'just as much a prod- uct of blind forces as is the falling of a stone to earth or the ebb and flow of the tides. It is we who have read purpose into evolution, as earlier men projected will and emotion into inorganic phe- nomena like storm or earthquake. If we wish to work towards a purpose for the future of man, we must formulate that purpose ourselves. Purposes in life are made, not found.' 31 Conclusion The concept of integrative levels de- scribes the progress of evolution of the inanimate, animate and social worlds. It maintains that such progress is the result of forces which differ in each level and which can properly be described only by laws which are unique for each level. Since higher level phenomena always in- clude phenomena at lower levels, one can not fully understand the higher levels without an understanding of the lower level phenomena as well. But a knowl- edge of the lower levels does not enable us to predict, a priori, what will occur at a higher level. Although some may have validity for the higher level, laws of a lower level are inadequate to de- scribe the higher level. The laws unique to the higher level can be discovered by approaches appropriate to the particular level; to do otherwise is invalid scien- tifically and, in some instances, danger- ous socially. By stressing the material interrelation- ships of parts and whole and the qualita- tive uniqueness of each level of integra- tion, the concept is of genuine help to biologists. Its dialectical approach avoids organicism,' 'fatalism' and mechanical 'atomism,' and helps attain a fuller under- standing of such problems as the inter- relations of cellular structure and metabo- lism, of cell and organism in ontogeny and in adult physiology, of individual and population biologies, of biological and social factors in the development of man's behavior ; and the mechanisms responsible for organic evolution. By avoiding tele- ology, the concept aids the search for causes of biological phenomena. The concept of integrative levels indi- cates to research biologists the crucial aspects of their problems, the solution of which puts the known facts into proper perspective by revealing the decisive ele- ment, the element imparting the unique- ness to the phenomena under study. It emphasizes the importance of studying the 'mesoforms,' matter at the point of transition from one level of organization to the next, so as to deepen our under- standing of the unique qualities of the higher level. For example, it would indi- cate that an intensive study of the tran- sition region between the chemical and biological levels, between protein and protoplasm, will help reveal the organ- izing relations unique to living matter and fundamental to vital activities. As biologists become more familiar with the concept, a greater number will recognize its value both as an aid in the understanding of biological data already accumulated and as a reliable guide for research. Such recognition of its value will, however, be delayed by any presenta- tion which creates the erroneous impres- sion that it is metaphysical, teleologica! or mystical. This article has pointed to shortcomings in the presentation of the concept in some recent biological litera- ture, with the hope that this may help make future references to the concept more reliable. 31 Julian Huxley, op. cit., p. 57 6. 213</page></plain_text>
