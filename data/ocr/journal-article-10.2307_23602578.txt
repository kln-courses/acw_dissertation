<plain_text><page sequence="1">RABBI SAADIA GAON By Robert Gordis I THIS year, 1942, marks the millenary of the death of one of Israel's greatest sons, Saadia ben Joseph, generally called Saadia Gaon. Recalling his life and twork after ten centuries vividly reminds us of the grandeur of Jewish his tory and the sweep of Jewish experience. Saadia is both a product of his times and the creator of an epoch and can be understood only against the background of Jewish history. The cultural history of Israel exhibits a remarkable symmetry of form. It begins with two creative periods lasting roughly some two thousand years, during which the Bible and the Talmud were produced. These remain the greatest monuments of the Jewish genius, the first having become the charter of humanity for one half of mankind, the second, Israel's citadel and way of life to the present day. The Bible and the Talmud are by no means products of Jewish isolation. On the contrary, every page in them testifies to the influence of other cultures, the ideas, lan guages, and institutions of other nations. But whatever was found valuable in these cultures was fused in the crucible of the Jewish genius and finally emerged indubitably Jewish in form and content. Thus the Bible and the Talmud are superb examples of creative assimilation. The success of this process was due, in no slight measure, to the fact that throughout the Biblical and Talmudic periods, Jews lived in a Jewish environment in which theirs was the dominant culture, at least as far as they were concerned. Even when the Jewish state ceased to exist, the Jews of Palestine and Babylonia enjoyed wide cultural autonomy. In other areas, and in later times, this was no longer the</page><page sequence="2">62 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK case. Outside of Palestine and Babylonia, Tews constituted a minority group that found the impact of foreign cultures more powerful, and their influence harder to withstand. As a result, a new type of assimilation, passive and non creative, made itself felt in many circles. This was in reality a form of total surrender, which generally expressed itself in complete dissociation from Jewish life and thought, and often in apostasy. Nonetheless, even here the process of creative assimilation went on. Within both types of com munity, gifted men arose who saw the challenge of the dominant culture and strove to harmonize its best elements with Jewish tradition. They enriched the content of Judaism as they perpetuated it. There have been three such main periods in Jewish history, each associated with a great name, and each introduced by a Bible translation into the vernacular. The first of these, the Hellenistic, began at the opening of the third century B. C.-E. This expansionist Greek civilization looked upon Alexandria as its cultural center. Alexandrian Jewry pro duced the Septuagint, the first translation of the Bible into any language, and its most gifted son, Philo, made the first significant attempt to harmonize Greek philosophy with the Jewish religion. The second of these epochs came more than a thousand years later, in the ninth and tenth centuries, c. e., with the spread of Islamic civilization from Arabia and Iraq across the Near East and northern Africa over to Spain. The adjustment of Judaism to Arabic culture is symbolized by Saadia, himself the author of a magnificent translation of the Bible into Arabic. The third of these periods is the modern era, and may be dated in the eighteenth century with the rise of the Enlight enment and the French Revolution. Its characteristic figure is Moses Mendelssohn, who sought to adjust Judaism and the Jew to the culture of the day and therefore produced his famous translation of the Pentateuch into German. Comparisons are invidious, yet it seems clear that of these three, Philo, Saadia and Mendelssohn, Saadia was the great est, in moral stature, breadth of Jewish knowledge, versatil ity and creative originality.</page><page sequence="3">RABBI SAADIA GAON 63 II It is worth noting that Saadia came to the fore when the vital energies of Judaism seemed spent at last. For almost a thousand years, the Jewish people had been engaged in creating the Talmud, a vast and imposing interpretation of Biblical Judaism to meet the needs of a new day. So great was the prestige of the Babylonian Talmud, that for centuries the Yeshivoth, or academies, of Sura and Pumbeditha, in which it had developed, were regarded by Jewry as its spiritual centers, for the maintenance of which Jews contrib uted the world over. To the heads of these Yeshivoth, called by the title of Gaon, "Excellency," questions on every phase of Jewish law and lore were addressed from every corner of of the world. The replies or Responsa of the Geonim, as well as their other legal works, continued the process of interpre tation by which Judaism kept pace with changing conditions. Side by side with the spiritual authority of the Gaonate was another institution, that of the Exilarchate, which represented the last temporal glory of the Jewish state. The ruling authority, the Sassanide kings and later the Caliphs, recognized the Exilarch, who traced his descent from the house of David, as the official representative of the Jewish community, with the power to impose taxes and super intend the judicial system of Jewry. The chroniclers of the time have left us colorful, and perhaps colored, descriptions of the Exilarch, his court and entourage, his powers and possessions. The relationship between the spiritual and the temporal authorities was not always amicable. A powerful Exilarch would tend to dominate the Geonim, while a commanding personality in the Gaonate would outshine the Exilarch. Clashes between the two institutions were not infrequent for financial reasons as well, for large revenues were at stake. But to the masses of the people, in Baby Ionia and throughout the world, these occasional collisions were unable to dim the luster of recognized and organized Jewish leadership. Rabbinic Judaism possessed ample prestige, but long before the ninth century it seemed to have spent its force. The Geonim were worthy and often talented men, but none seemed to possess the commanding personality and ere ative genius necessary to meet the challenge of a new age.</page><page sequence="4">64 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK For a new, great religion was born in the Semitic world, Islam. Like a whirlwind, it swept across Asia and Africa and threatened to conquer Europe as well. This new religion, which leaned heavily upon Jewish ideas, released new and unsuspected energies among the Arabs. In the space of a few years, Bagdad became the world's most civilized capital. The works of the Greek philosophers and scientists, virtually forgotten in Christian Europe, were carefully translated and studied and their discoveries were carried further by Moham medan savants. Mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, philol ogy, poetry and history were cultivated with notable results. Modern research has revealed that Arabic-speaking Jews played an important part in this significant activity. Exactly as in modern times, however, not a few of these Jews, enthralled by the new horizons that beckoned, abandoned Judaism as outmoded and unnecessary. Some adopted the dominant faith of Islam; others became skeptics, under mining the fundamentals of Judaism with the newly forged weapons of philosophy and logic. These attacks may con veniently, if anachronistically, be described as the challenge from "the left." Nor was this all. The imposing structure of Rabbinic Judaism had been erected not without opposition from some Jews who resented this new and complex development. Stimulated by certain tendencies in Mohammedanism, they demanded a return to the text of the Bible and the abolition of Talmudic law and custom. In the name of a literal adherence to the words of Scripture, or Mikra, Anan and his followers broke away and founded a distinct sect called the Karaites in the second half of the eighth century. As a result of the agitation of these sectaries, Rabbinic Judaism was compelled to return to the text of Scripture and study its original and literal meaning. Thus the foundations were laid for the sciences of Hebrew grammar and lexicography. This by-product aside, however, the Karaites were funda mentally reactionary. What they sought to do was to blot out a thousand years of development. Today this sect numbers only a few thousand souls, its effort to turn back the clock of time having proved a failure. But in the eighth, ninth and tenth centuries, Karaism was a mighty force, its challenge constituting the attack from "the right."</page><page sequence="5">RABBI SAADIA GAON 65 Nor was all at peace within the camp of Rabbinic Judaism. Faced by attacks on both flanks, traditional Jewish leader ship seemed to lack the energy to defend itself. Instead, it was torn into factions, with more than a suspicion of moral corruption in some quarters. Into this breach stepped Saadia. Single-handed, he attacked the enemies on all fronts, brought a new lease of life to traditional Judaism, and immeasurably enriched the content and scope of the Jewish heritage. Ill Saadia ben Joseph was born in Dilaz, a village in Fayyum, Egypt, in 882. His father was of humble origin, but pos sessed a reputation as a scholar. Some documents declare Saadia to be the descendant of proselytes, but since this tradition is repeated of many Jewish worthies, it is not to be accepted at face value. Apparently, it was in Egypt that Saadia later married and raised a family. In his native land, he received a broad education in all phases of Arabic culture. Here, too, he acquired a profound knowledge of Biblical and Talmudic learning, which he later supplemented by years of study in Palestine, whither he went in 915. He was scarcely more than a boy when he began his literary work, which characteristically combined original scholarship with a responsiveness to live issues. His earliest works include the Agron, the first Hebrew dictionary known, intended to help poets with their rhymes, and also a series of polemics against the Karaites, who were very influential in Egypt. His fame had spread beyond his native land, and, when he came to Babylonia, he was given the post of Alluf or Resh Kallah on the staff of the Academy of Sura. Meanwhile a new peril arose. A Palestinian scholar, Aaron ben Meir, sensing the weakness of the Babylonian schools, and ambitious for his native land, tried to reassert the authority of the less important Yeshivoth of Palestine, which he headed. In 921, Ben Meir announced that the accepted calendar which had been promulgated in Babylonia was wrong and that all the Jewish holidays should be cele brated two days earlier. Soon world Jewry was divided into two camps, the advocates and the opponents of the new proposal. In fact, for two years the major festivals were</page><page sequence="6">66 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK celebrated on different days both in Palestine and in Baby Ionia, and doubtless elsewhere, wherever the winds of con troversy had swept. Saadia was quick to see the grave danger of a new schism, even as he was convinced of Ben Meir's error. Drawing upon his extensive store of Jewish learning and his equally wide knowledge of astronomy and chronology, Saadia attacked the innovation so successfully that the entire project collapsed and the peril was averted. The chronology of Saadia's manifold writings is obscure, but somewhere in his busy career he found time not only to continue to hammer away at the Karaites, but to polemize vigorously against the skeptics. Against one such hyper rationalist critic of Scripture, Hivi of Balkh, Saadia wrote a devastating reply in verse. Polemics, then as now, do not make edifying reading, especially after the heat of battle is over, and a kindly oblivion has enveloped all of Saadia's writings of this genre, except for fragments recovered from the Cairo Genizah. Saadia's brilliant services to traditional Judaism, partie ularly in the Ben Meir controversy, had attracted world wide Jewish attention, and when a vacancy occurred in the Gaonate of Sura, Saadia's name naturally suggested itself to the Exilarch, David ben Zakkai, who had the power to make the appointment. He decided to consult an aged, blind scholar of the highest repute, Nissi Nahrawani. The old scholar paid willing tribute to Saadia's attainments, but strongly urged the Exilarch against appointing him Gaon. Saadia's uncompromising integrity and strong sense of self confidence, Nissi felt, were bound sooner or later to bring him into collision with the Exilarch, who was himself a commanding personality. If a reason had to be assigned for passing over Saadia's name in making the appointment, it was at hand in the fact that Saadia was not a Babylonian like all the other Geonim. It is to the lasting credit of David ben Zakkai that he chose to disregard this perspicacious analysis, and did appoint Saadia to the Gaonate of Sura in 928. Under Saadia's guidance, the academy experienced a rebirth of activity. Before long, however, Nissi's fears were realized; Saadia's high moral standards and independence of spirit brought him into conflict with the Exilarch. Two years after Saadia's</page><page sequence="7">RABBI SAADIA GAON 67 installation, the Exilarch had probated a will, according to which he himself was to receive ten per cent of a large estate of some seventy thousand gold pieces. In accordance with the accepted procedure in such cases, the Exilarch sent his son to secure the Gaon's signature to the documents. The Gaon, however, felt unable to give his assent, and, after seeking tactfully to avoid signing without an open breach, finally stated his reason: "Tell your father the Torah com mands us, 'Ye shall not respect.persons in judgment.' " When the young prince angrily raised his hand against Saadia, the Gaon's servants unceremoniously threw him out of the house. Again Saadia found himself embroiled in bitter con troversy. David deposed Saadia and filled his post with a nonentity, Joseph ben Jacob by name, while Saadia declared the Exilarchate vacant, and appointed Josiah Hasan, a younger brother of David, as his successor. Saadia com manded the support of most of the wealthy and scholarly elements, but the Exilarch, abetted by some scholars who were envious of Saadia's distinction, possessed superior power and the capacity to bribe the court. As a result, Saadia was finally forced into retirement, and for four or five years until 937, he lived in Bagdad, supported by the bounty of friends and disciples. These years were difficult for Saadia, but proved a blessing for Judaism. His enforced freedom from teaching and administration gave him the leisure to produce his great philosophic masterpiece, Kitab al-Amanat wal-F tikadat ("Book of Philosophic Doctrines and Religious Beliefs," or, in the formula of today, "On Faith and Reason"). He wrote it in Arabic, for his purpose was to make it possible for educated Jews of the time, who knew no Hebrew, to remain loyal to Judaism by presenting a rational interpretation of the Jewish religion. It seems probable that a secondary aim was to present the tenets of Judaism to the cultured Moham medan world. In its Hebrew translation under the title of EmunotEmunot Ve-Deot ("Faith and Reason"), the work has exerted extraordinary influence upon Jewish thought until the present. It was the first important attempt to synthesize the ideas of Greek and Arabic philosophy with Judaism. Today the problems of medieval philosophy concern us only in slight degree. Yet, scattered through the pages of</page><page sequence="8">68 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK Saadia's masterpiece, are valuable insights into the nature of religion, the meaning of God, the character of man and the universe, as well as the basic doctrines of Judaism, which remain serviceable and stimulating even today. Above all, the entire work is permeated by the profound conviction that Judaism is hospitable to all truth whatever its source, for the seal of the God of Israel is truth. It is likely, too, that during these years of retirement, he was also able to complete his other great masterpiece, his superb translation of the Bible into Arabic, accompanied by an original and brilliant commentary, still consulted with profit today. Through this work and other writings, Saadia became the father of rational Biblical interpretation and laid the foundation of the scientific study of the Bible. The seven-year period of estrangement came to an end in 937, when common friends of Saadia and the Exilarch brought about a reconciliation, and Saadia was restored to his post. Shortly thereafter, the Exilarch died, and his son Judah, who had raised his hand against Saadia, succeeded him. When, seven months later, he too died, Saadia took his orphaned son into his own home and raised him with loving care as his own child, until his own death in 942. Uniquely, the exact day and hour of Saadia's death are known from a memoir written eleven years later by two of his sons. From it we learn that the end came on Sunday night, the twenty-sixth of Iyar, at the close of the second watch, about 2 o'clock. Upon this peaceful and idyllic note closed a life filled with conflict and extraordinary achievement. IV To give even a summary of his works is not possible within the scope of a brief article. His immense literary output is distinguished by a rare combination of qualities, great originality on the one hand and extraordinary variety on the other. He was a pioneer in so many branches of Jewish lore that he eminently deserves the phrase applied to him by Abraham Ibn Ezra, rosh ha-medabberim bekhol makom,makom, "the first of authorities in every field," first not only in time, but also in the excellence and abiding value of his contributions.</page><page sequence="9">RABBI SAADIA GAON 69 Reference has already been made to his vast polemic out put, which comprised defenses against Karaism, skeptical rationalism and his Palestinian antagonist, Ben Meir. His writings included fields as diverse as apologetics, astronomy, Biblical interpretation, history and metaphysics. His works in the field of Rabbinics comprise Responsa, Talmudic commentaries, treatises on specific legal topics and the first known Methodology or Introduction to the Talmud. Every where, his philosophic grasp and capacity for systematic presentation are in evidence. , He also wrote verse for the synagogue, though, it must be confessed, with more ardor than talent. However, a few of his Bakashot or "Petitions," in which he made no effort to use the artificial verse forms of Arabic poetry, possess simple and moving power. He prepared an Order of Service, or Siddur, for the guidance of the scattered Jewish com munities of his day. The mere extent of his work is over whelming. Henry Malter, his most painstaking biographer, lists about one hundred Hebrew and two hundred Arabic titles of known writings by Saadia. Yet all these achievements, which would have taxed the energies of half a dozen men, do not include his two greatest works. The vast edifice of modern Biblical scholarship rests on foundations laid a thousand years ago by Saadia in his great Bible translation and the accompanying commentaries. His version avoided the pitfalls of excessive literalism on the one hand, and homiletic and allegorical vagaries on the other. As a rule, he rendered the Hebrew text literally, utilizing his knowledge of Hebrew, Aramaic and Arabic to excellent advantage. But wherever anthropomorphic terms in the original might have conveyed an inadequate concept of God to his readers, Saadia, like the Aramaic translator Onkelos before him, rendered the sense rather than the letter of Scripture. He laid down the fundamental canon of true interpretation, when he declared: "All works ought to be understood according to the spirit of their author ... for they [the authors] themselves understand their own words and their meaning better than anyone else." His scientific approach led him to preface each Biblical book with an introduction dealing with its contents and</page><page sequence="10">70 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK structure. This practice of the Gaon was unaccountably neglected by nearly all his medieval successors, but it is universal today. Abraham Ibn Ezra informs us that the translation was written in Arabic characters, probably because here, too, he wished to make the treasures of Juda ism accessible to the non-Jewish world. Finally, his work in philosophy, which contains other writings besides his great masterpiece, "Faith and Reason," created a new field of activity for the Jewish intellect. Malter rightly remarks that Saadia did not merely influence the Judaism of the Middle Ages; largely, he created it. From Saadia to Ibn Ezra, Maimonides and Crescas, and from them to Spinoza, the line of descent is clear and unbroken. As for Saadia's influence upon the lesser and more nu merous leaders and teachers in Judaism, it is incalculable. Every subsequent writer, whatever his field of activity, utilized the work of Saadia as a foundation for his own work. V Saadia's significance, however, is by no means purely historical. Our own day can find especial relevance in several aspects of Saadia's thought. Our generation has witnessed the deification of blind instinct as the highest human impulse and the resurgence of a deep-seated hatred and suspicion of human reason. This attitude Saadia would have rejected as unworthy of free men. His firm faith that the human intellect can bring men both truth and happiness is reflected in what is virtually a Hymn to Reason: "With this reason man embraces the past and the future; by it he subdues the animals, that they till the ground and carry in its produce; by it he is able to draw the water out of the depth of the earth to its surface; nay, by it he builds lofty palaces, makes magnificent garments, and prepares dainty dishes; by it he leads armies, equips military camps, and manages the affairs of state; so that men become civilized and orderly; by it he learns the nature of the celes tial spheres, the course of the planets, the size of their bodies, their distances from one another, as well as other astronom ical matters."</page><page sequence="11">RABBI SAADIA GAON 71 For Saadia, divine revelation was a source of truth in dependent of man's intellect, but, significantly, the revealed truth had to square with the truth discovered by man. When these two truths seemed to disagree, the one or the other had been wrongly apprehended. Hence his efforts to interpret the Biblical modes of expression rationally, and his criticism of such scientific ideas as he regarded as false. Saadia had no sympathy for those who cleaved either to "faith" or "reason," for he was profoundly convinced that truth was one. His rational approach to the Bible as a source of religious truth is indicated in his introduction to the Pentateuch. He writes: "The All-Wise purposed in this Book to educate those beings which were gifted with reason and to fashion them for His service. Now there are three kinds of education, of which one is stronger than the others. The first consists in saying to the one to be educated: 'Do this: do not do that,' without making him understand the consequences of the command or the prohibition .... The second kind consists in giving the consequences of the path chosen. The third kind of education adds thereto the history of those people who have obeyed and were rewarded by salvation, and of those people who disobeyed and were punished by misery. . . . And God has revealed, in this book which is dedicated to the education of His servants, the three methods .... He commands piety and prohibits sin; He announces the reward of good actions and the punishment of evil actions; and finally He gives the history of those who lived on earth before us, — the salvation of those who have been virtuous and thé punishment of those who have been wicked." One of Saadia's most fruitful insights is his division of the commandments of Judaism into two classes, those dictated by human reason and those originating in divine revelation. But even the latter category of commandments are not irrational, quite apart from their value as a moral discipline. We may restate his two categories of laws as, a) ethical and hence essentially universal for all men, and, b) ceremonial and therefore historical, rooted in the unique experience of Israel. Saadia's emphasis on the rational and the ethical is characteristically Jewish. Our faith in Moses' message, he</page><page sequence="12">72 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK argues, is based not on the miracles associated with his name, but on the intrinsic ethical value of his teaching. The triumph of justice and the redemption of his people con stituted for Saadia an unassailable proposition, in which he believed with warmth and passion. Finally, for Saadia, as for all the great leaders of Israel, there was no dichotomy between learning and life, between idea and act. His own career exemplified the truth of the Talmudic dictum: "Great is learning, for it leads to action." (Kiddushin 40b). The greatness of Saadia's deed is enhanced by his tran scendent personality. His originality and breadth of learning were set off by an abounding vitality and a deep concern with the problems of the day. He was a fighter, not a re cluse, a flame giving off warmth as well as light. He fought to maintain the unity and the validity of Jewish tradition against dissension within Jewish ranks and the attack of the reactionary Karaites from without. He struggled against the skeptical superficial "modernism" of his day by creating a truly modern, enriched yet reverent interpretation of Judaism for his own age. And he underlined his sincerity by unflinching personal integrity, maintained at the cost of sacrifice in the face of privilege and power. Saadia thus exemplified the highest qualities of leadership, a leadership rooted in learning and crowned by character. The great Maimonides, who in many respects carried forward the work of Saadia, paid him no more than a deserved tribute when he wrote: "Were it not for Saadia, the Torah would almost have disappeared from the midst of Israel; for it was he who made manifest what was obscure therein, made strong what had been weakened, and made it known far and wide by word of mouth and in writing." In his Sefer ha-Galui, Saadia calls attention to the amazing fecundity of Jewish moral and intellectual genius through the ages, which he regards as Providential. He declares: "God does not leave His people at any period without a scholar whom He inspires and enlightens, that he in turn may instruct and teach it, so that thereby its condition may be bettered." The truest evidence for this principle is the life and work of Saadia himself.</page></plain_text>
