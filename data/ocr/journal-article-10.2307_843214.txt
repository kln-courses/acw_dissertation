<plain_text><page sequence="1">Training in Music Theory: The basic premise of this article is that music theory is, and must be, an essentially philosophical activity. According to this premise, it would seem appropriate for the contemporary music theorist to inquire not only about the nature of music but also about the nature of his knowledge, both about music and about himself. This sort of inquiry appears to be justified in view of recent (that is, twentieth-century) attitudes in the field of music theory and of the way in which these attitudes inter- sect with the central problems of philosophy and psychology. In particular, this article investigates certain relationships that can be drawn among (1) the nature of training in theory, (2) the nature of theoretical knowledge, and (3) the distinguish- able and desirable attributes of those who claim such training.</page><page sequence="2">39 Process and Product THOMAS CLIFTON Since opinions regarding the nature of theoretical training are almost as numerous as musicians themselves, I do not presume to detail another hypothetical ideal program of instruction here, but will merely suggest some guidelines of a philosophical sort, treating some topics in detail, others more generally, and none exhaustively. Accordingly, this essay will explore some areas which relate both to self-knowledge and to the acquisition of what Babbitt describes as "verbal and methodological respon- sibility". (Babbitt, CMS, p. 60) This will include a precis of the relevance of theories of perception, behavior, and crea- tivity to training in fundamentals, a comparison of scientific and artistic thinking, and a summary of the kinds of theories useful not only to theorists but to musicians in general. It</page><page sequence="3">40 would indeed be misleading to believe that the above-mentioned guidelines are proposed exclusively for the training of pros- pective theorists. The relation between music theory (philosophically speaking) and so-called "basic" training has always tended to be prob- lematic; it might be argued that the real business of theory can begin only at the graduate level. But this position is not ac- ceptable; for too long it has been perfectly possible (however unethical) for a student to be trained in his undergraduate years without having any meaningful notion of what music theory is all about. Furthermore, who can say when the process of be- coming a music theorist actually is begun? Official records might indicate that it begins when one sets out to acquire a master's or doctor's degree in this field. But when does a person decide to do this? What behavioral set predisposes a six year old child to eventually mature into a music theorist - or anything else? The question should be re-phrased: What causes a child to interrupt his theoretical activity for fifteen years or so, and then attempt to resume it, frequently with great mental anguish and with loss of time and money? "There are children playing in the street who could solve some of my top problems in physics, because they have modes of sensory perception that I lost long ago. * (J. Robert Oppenheimer, in McLuhan, p. 93) The problem of preparation, then, is at least twofold. On the one hand is the development of a creative symbiosis between the mechanical acquisition of necessary skills and information, and the intellectual contemplation of the significance of musical elements, their relations, and their operations. On the other hand is the generally recognized need for bringing the typical theory curriculum up to date. For one thing, the directions of the music composed in the last twenty years, together with the services provided by the already indispensable computer, com- pel a second look at certain cherished practices. That is, the proportion of emphasis given to the development of ideas and skills may need re-examining. A great deal of the art of our time results from the making of an idea into visible or audible shapes, not by the person who entertained the idea, but by fac- tory engineers or at a computation center. This is not to say that skills are completely unessential; the question is, what sort of skills are essential for our time? Is a person any less a theorist (or musician) because he can work with an analog computer but cannot (or has forgotten how to) write 16th- century counterpoint? If any skill needs to be stressed, it is the skill of generating and communicating ideas, and this, to paraphrase</page><page sequence="4">41 Rogers, entails the creation of such external conditions as are conducive to training students to receive conflicting stimuli without forcing closure, to maintain flexibility in the formation of concepts, beliefs, perceptions, and hypotheses, to tolerate ambiguity, to make problematic that which is given, to trans- form improbables into equivalents, and to shape their own hy- potheses without pressures from or fear of external authority. (Cf. Rogers, SBCT, p. 68) If all this sounds rather idealistic, consider that the problem of student apathy and uninventiveness itself might be a product of, among other things, continued ped- agogical sclerosis. *1 In addition, the problem of re-discovering or redefining "universal" values is, as always, an acute problem for the beginner. He will have to live with the ones he finds; the "professional" is all too ready to die by those he found in his youth. Obviously, the use of the term "universal" here denotes something different from either "absolute" or "natural law" principles. Something much less grandiose is intended, whereby "universal" relates to both logical universes (e. g., the universe of all music using specifiably different tones) and psychological universes (e. g., the universe of all music using discriminably different tones). Accordingly, this article cannot enumerate all possible universal values, but it does suggest where to look for them: in the formation of general questions ahd principles. But can these problems suggest more specific (if partial) solu- tions? One thing they do suggest is that the distinction between music and its physical appearance on paper be strictly observed. To paraphrase Korzybski, it can be said that (1) written notes are not the things we are speaking about, and (2) there is no such thing as an object in absolute isolation. (Korzybski, pp. 60-61) As an example of statement (1), consider the difference between the symbol for a long note and the fact that one aurally perceives it as a long note only after the "point" where the sym- bol is placed, that is, after the attack. Consider, too, that the presence of notes (in the form of some typical melodic and harmonic dictations) does not necessarily imply the presence of music, or any relation to it. The implications of these state- ments for any ear-training program are far-reaching. If any techniques and aims of ear-training, nay, of theory-training, are defensible, they must survive the examination of human behavior in a real musical situation. One may imagine a theory class which approaches the spirit of a group psychotherapy session: students' reaction to music is publicly uttered, dis- cussed and defined in an atmosphere of complete honesty guar- anteed by the non-recriminatory use of grades and recommen- dations. By no means does this suggest that theory classes should succumb to mere exchanges of opinion:</page><page sequence="5">42 To define an impression signifies a good deal more than just to utter it. . . . To define an impression is to analyze it, and analysis can proceed only by going beyond the im- pression, by referring it to the grounds on which it rests and the consequences which it entails. (Dewey, p. 305) This approach seems to offer one possible means of re-struc- turing ear-training programs along lines general enough to sur- vive the impact of even electronic music, and of elevating such programs to a respectable level of intellectual activity. It also argues for the parity of self-knowledge and self-analysis with knowledge and analysis of data. All too frequently, however, ear-training textbooks reveal an infatuation with intervaliden- tification and sub-metrical rhythms in what amounts to a labora- tory environment, to the neglect of the larger gestures, mo- tions, and directions found in actual music, regardless of style. The results of such training programs can be observed in stu- dents' general inability (1) to perceive large-scale, non-con- secutive connections, (2) to detect and relate similarities of pattern and shape in varying temporal dimensions, and (3) to transfer whatever listening habits they possess to their own performance or that of others. All too often, classroom drill is devoted to preparing students to pass ear-training tests ("Now I'll stress the soprano. . ."), not to helping them listen responsively and responsibly, either to music or to themselves as they listen to music. In our eagerness to teach only that which we know how to test - the learning of "fundamental" skills - the existence of other kinds of tests, and other modes of teaching, should not be overlooked: we mean those tests which seek to detect and possibly develop perception and creativity. There is, after all, much to be learned from current research on the psychology of perception, cognition, and creativity, and although it is commonly recognized that the acquisition of basic skills and the achievement of musical understanding comprise different learning patterns, (Forte, CMP, p. 38) it may be ar- gued that these patterns need not be incompatible. On the con- trary, one of the main arguments of this paper is for the de- velopment of creativity in the formulation of any program which presumes to train musicians - and particularly theorists. Just as the phrase "a bad lyric soprano is a contradiction in terms, there can be no such thing as an uncreative theorist. The role of the theorist, to elucidate the norms of human musical be- havior and the latest "facts" about the universe of musical raw material, must be creative, whether he himself is generating new theories or developing the tools that another theorist can use. And the act of generating and communicating theories is performed in the interests of affecting human behavior. A the-</page><page sequence="6">43 ory or idea which is promulgated, read, generally approved, but which remains untaught becomes an instance of the frequently observed separation of research from teaching, signifying that existing channels of communication are inadequate. To be specific, the following perceptive abilities can be both tested and exercised: (1) Imagine a solid, many-faceted object as it looks from different directions. (2) Rapidly scan a visual, auditory, or verbal field for perceptual detail. (3) Fuse an in- complete perceptual field into a single object. (4) Conversely, destroy a given Gestalt to discover the requisite detail buried in the more complex design; similarly, keep a configuration in mind in spite of distracting surrounding detail. (5) Classify a random collection of objects, or differentiate between the mem- bers of a highly redundant collection. (6) Discover by induction the rule or principle in any given material or task, or deduce from a rule or principle some ramifications or products of operations. It can be seen that these six representative tasks range them- selves into two modes of thought, commonly described as di- vergent (expansive, elaborative) thinking, and convergent (re- ductive, abstractive, extractive) thinking. (Taylor, SBCT, pp. 169-184) The fact that none of these tasks requires or promotes specifically musical training need not be alarming in view of the recognition that creativity is not restricted to some particu- lar content, (Rogers, SBCT, pp. 63-72) and, in fact, any crea- tive teacher should have no trouble using these general matrices to formulate specifically musical situations. Some of the more well-known perceptive tests are the Welch Figure Preference Test, the Unusual Uses Test, the Drawing Completion Test, Ink Blot Tests, Symbol Equivalence Tests, the Anagram Test, the Remote Association Test (RAT), and the Thematic Apper- ception Tests (TAT). (Barron, SA, p. 3) Neither the testing techniques nor the titles listed above are intended to be ex- haustive. In general, the results of these tests indicate that highly creative persons not only can discern complex relation- ships, but also actively seek them out. All this is well known, and is restated here only to suggest that the probability of turn- ing out creditable musicians is directly proportional to the es- tablishment of conditions suitable to creative thinking. It can be asked if the typical classroom situation, or for that matter the typical theory curriculum, is structured with these condi- tions in mind. To look at it another way: while precise infor- mation on the nature of insight and the creative process is not easily obtainable, the conditions which tend to suppress these processes are only too familiar: rigid departmental require-</page><page sequence="7">44 ments which discourage experimentation and disregard individ- ual differences by standardization; the routinization of assigned, quantity-oriented tasks; failure to provide a meaningful context to which specific duties can be related; and a definite failure to relate music and the theory of music to creative attitudes and to psychological information already acquired by the student as a result of his life outside the music classroom. The explana- tion for this state of affairs probably lies in excessive ego rigidity, no doubt on the parts of both teacher and student, which demands full conscious control. Teachers who are unable to tolerate their own spontaneity or the loosening up of their rigid planning probably cannot tolerate the spontaneous activity of students. On the other hand, good creative teachers can edu- cate the creative powers of students, co-workers or co-per- formers so that they seem to work quite independently. If the analysis in terms of ego rigidity is correct, (Cf. Ehrenzweig, pp. 97-102) it suggests at least a direction in which a more com- prehensive solution to a moss-grown curriculum might lie: in the structuring of an optimally flexible curriculum of a sort which certainly need not compromise standards or invite chaos. I should like to summarize one existing methodology for the teaching and learning of creativity. This method, called syn- ectics (from the Greek, meaning to join together different and apparently irrelevant elements) is concerned with the applica- tion of metaphor in problem- solving and hypothesis-formation. *2 Metaphor obviously means much more than "saying one thing and meaning another". In Max Black's terms, a metaphor is a conceptual archetype, that is, "a systematic repertoire of ideas by means of which a given thinker describes, by analogi- cal extension, some domain to which those ideas do not imme- diately and literally apply. " (Black, p. 241) Again, he writes that "perhaps every science must start with metaphor and end with algebra; and perhaps without the metaphor there would never have been any algebra." (Black, p. 242) William J.J. Gordon writes that in the course of his research on synectics, it became apparent that the most important elements in crea- tive problem-solving processes involved making the familiar strange, and, conversely, making the strange familiar. The former, especially, is concerned with viewing a problem in new, intentionally naive or deliberately Uout-of-focus" contexts, a procedure which can alter our usual way of perceiving and our usual expectations about how we or the world will behave. Synectics research has identified four mechanisms for applying metaphor: Personal Analogy, essentially anthropomorphic, involves an empathetic identification with otherwise inanimate elements of a problem. Thus, Kekule solved the riddle of the</page><page sequence="8">45 molecular structure of benzene only after having dreamed of a snake swallowing its tail. In music, the composition must bear up under a whole lexicon of words that have quite obvious be- havioral connotations: we have direct experience of what it is like to prolong something, to create and dissipate tension, to rise to a climax, to be interrupted, to complete oneself, to feel tight and concentrated, or loose and expansive, to divert, de- lay, surprise, omit, approach from a tangent, etc.. But how does it feel to be a suspension? What operations can be per- formed on you so that your identity is still retained? The mech- anism of Direct Analogy consciously compares parallel or nearly parallel facts, knowledge, or technology. Mitchell, for exam- ple, has provided some useful analogies among the seemingly separate procedures involved in classical 12-tone music, Cub- ism, and LeCorbusier's Modulor. *3 Direct analogy therefore argues persuasively for breadth as well as depth of knowledge. To those who would seek to detect dilettantism in bringing the knowledge of diverse sciences to bear on a single problem, it can be submitted that a man does not know his own field if he knows only it. Symbolic Analogy is a Gestalt response where the physical, neural, and mental patterns of activity are sud- denly integrated into a highly compressed, almost poetic state- ment of the problem, but using objective and impersonal images. Thus Boulez: "There can be no musical creativity without the unforeseen becoming necessity. " Or Sessions: "It seems to me that the essential medium of music, the basis of its ex- pressive powers and the element which gives it its unique quality among the arts, is time, made living for us through its ex- pressive essence, movement. * (Langer, p. 111) Finally, Fantasy Analogy supports Freud's theory that creative work in general is the fulfillment of a wish (although he did not say that it is nothing but a wish). Schoenberg corroborates this beau- tifully: Music is a simultaneous and successive-ness of tones and tone-combinations, which are so organized that its impres- sion on the ear is agreeable, and its impression on the in- tellect is comprehensible, and that these impressions have the power to influence occult parts of our soul and of our sentimental spheres and that this influence makes us live in a dreamland of fulfilled desires, or in a dreamed hell of .... (Stein, p. 186) The role of direct analogy in our own times has been more use- ful than we might at first realize. Terms like "set", "aggre- gate", "vector", "complement", etc., are well-nigh indis- pensible in analytical discourse; and we can only applaud con-</page><page sequence="9">4( tinued efforts to describe musical phenomena in non-musical, hence more global, terms. A current metaphor that is rapidly proving its usefulness is the term "language". It does not take an extraordinary musician to rise to the bait provided by the following quotations: The term "language" can be defined in abstract and general terms as a set (class) of objects constructed out of a set of elements by stringing them together through an operation call called concatenation. ... In actual systems of language this operation may be thought of as specifying an order in time, or an order from left to right, from top to bottom, outward and clockwise, and so on, in various possible writing systems. (Bach, pp. 11-12) A generative grammar is a finite set of rules which enu- merates (or generates) an infinite number of grammatical (or well-formed) sentences of a language and no ungram- matical ones and assigns to each sentence generated its proper structural description. (Koutsoudas, p. 4) A grammar. . . which attempts to characterize in an ex- plicit way the intrinsic association of phonetic form and semantic content in a particular language, might be called a generative grammar to distinguish it from descriptions that have some different goal (for example, pedagogic grammars). In intention, at least, traditional scholarly grammars are generative grammars, although they fall far short of achieving the goal of determining how sentences are formed or interpreted. A good traditional grammar gives a full exposition of exceptions to rules, but it pro- vides only hints and examples to illustrate regular struc- tures. . . . It is tacitly presumed that the intelligent reader will use his "linguistic intuition" - his latent, un- conscious knowledge of universal grammar - to determine the regular structures from the presented examples and remarks. The grammar itself does not express the deep- seated regularities of the language. For the purpose of the study of linguistic structure. . . such grammars are, therefore, of limited value. (Chomsky, in Lenneberg, pp. 407-408) The Schenkerian theory of tonal music, in its structure of nested transformations so strikingly similar to transfor- mational grammars in linguistics, provides rules of trans- formation in proceeding synthetically through the levels of a composition from "kernel" to the foreground of the com-</page><page sequence="10">47 position, or analytically, in reverse. Since many of the transformational rules are level invariant, parallelism of transformation often plays an explanatory role in the con- text of the theory. ... . (Babbitt, CMS, pp. 59-60) Chomsky regards the conception of a "finite state Markov pro- cess" as inapplicable to the problem of sentence generation. That is, in constructing a grammatical sentence we do not base the choice of a word entirely on words previously written down. Similarly, it would be meaningless to compose music (and hence to analyze music) in this fashion. Conceivably, then, music can be regarded, metaphorically at least, as a language, ac- cording to the above definitions of language and grammar - but not a finite state language. We have, after all, become tran- quillized by the familiarity of more traditional metaphors: sounds are characterized as relatively "high" or "low", possi- bly because of the way we visually perceive musical notation, although such adjectives literally have no meaning in acoustic space. Chomsky and other linguistic theorists support, no doubt inadvertently, Kraehenbuehl's own distinction between the theorist and the theory pedagogue. (Kraehenbuehl, JMT, p. 62) Other disturbing questions arise: does the dutiful learning and correct application of the postulates of a pedagogical gram- mar of music provide the student with a complete and accurate description of what music really is like? Does the listing of "exceptions" provide the student with clear knowledge of how they came to be that way, or of the delicate and complex rela- tionships between what is optional and what is obligatory? Or Charles Ives' question: "My God! What has sound got to do with music? ", which is still the best answer one can give to the lazy assertions that "It sounds good to me!" It can be concluded that synectics is applicable as a behavioral system, inasmuch as it requires response of a highly personal sort to an exterior stimulus, and provides for reinforcement (i. e. confidence in the process) and more meaningful rewards. Naturally, these methods require practice, especially by those students who strive for immediate certainty, correct answers and three credit hours. The intention of synectics is to counter- act a prematurely severe attitude toward error (while implying that this attitude is consonant with American value patterns) and to help a student overcome what is felt as a sense of sep- aration from scientific principles and facts. The development of metaphorical and personal modes of thought in students sug- gests that they might become less like secretaries, dutifully copying down the a priori and accepting other traditional cleri- cal roles. If the undergraduate years cannot provide time for</page><page sequence="11">48 a student to learn how to learn, he may not find it difficult to perform the later tasks that his profession demands (thesis- writing, continued research), but he may well find it difficult to care about his own work: difficult, in short, to act crea- tively. It would seem that any discussion of the role of creativity in music quite naturally leads to a consideration and comparison of characteristic artistic and scientific thought processes, for the following reasons: (1) both science and art are ways of be- having; (2) the current relationship between science and art is both complex and close; and (3) scientific method and the methods of music theory cannot be incompatible. Each of these reasons will now be discussed in greater detail below. To say that science is a way of behaving is to say that the cri- teria for being "scientific" consist of something other than the physical accoutrements of white coats, stopwatches, and meters. The walls of the either/or have crumbled, so that, under cer- tain circumstances, it might be rash to come to any conclusions about whether someone is behaving scientifically or artistically. Neither scientific nor artistic behavior is concerned ultimately with "facts"; the nature of things which rational science tries to formulate consists of laws or invariant relations of order of possible phenomena. These possibilities can never all be re- alized in any given increment of time or space. The actual not only contains too little in itself but also too much in the form of irrelevancies. It is thus a part of scientific and artistic en- deavor to discover and contemplate the underlying order which governs the wider realm of possibility, into which, in turn, the actually existing can be absorbed. Michael Wallach, in discussing cognitive processes commonto both science and art, writes: the human being as an artist or composer or writer seems to function very much as does the human being who devises systems of mathematics. . . . In mathematics, science, and art, evidence has been found for two phases of human endeavor - the setting up of conceptual possibilities and the analysis of what these possibilities imply. . . . An examination of the nature of mathematics and science re- veals that the first of these phases involves the constructing, combining, and juxtaposing of concepts in ways which ap- proach the arbitrary and which suggest a considerable em- phasis upon tolerance for conjecture - conjecture as to what may be aesthetically pleasing in mathematics, conjecture</page><page sequence="12">49 as to what may be predictively useful in science. . . . An attitude that betokens the playful entertaining of possibili- ties - the setting of a wide latitude of acceptance limits regarding how the individual will permit himself to think about a subject - may be present in practitioners who are at the cutting edge of each of the above domains of knowl- edge. (Wallach, pp. 36-37) The first of these endeavors - the generation of conceptual possibilities - is responsible for the construction of postulates (premises), and therefore is not - indeed, cannot be - concerned with criteria of truth or falsity. In science, these criteria ap- ply only to the hypotheses derived from postulates. In music, postulates are sometimes referred to as codes, this term being used in both its meanings: as a secret but learnable language, and as an apriori set of rules. The hypothesis is the composi- tion itself, and its "truth value" is determined by the second of these activities, the analysis of implications: what strategies are employed by the composer in manipulating and selecting the rules of the code? One might also think of these activities as speculation and crit- ical reflection, the latter comprising an exercise of judgment as to what must be fitting and what must be rejected, and the former comprising a suspension of this judgment until the last possible moment. "Critical reflection" does not mean that the artist must think in conscious syllogisms. But it does mean that he must reflect on the consequences of doing this or that. It might be remarked here that programmed text books and teaching machines, at their best, tend to develop only the ac- tivity of analysis of implications, that is, the abilityto separate "right" from "wrong". This is, of course, a useful ability, but it leaves another side of the human personality relatively undeveloped: the side that reflects tolerant attitudes toward the possibility of error. The educational message that gets communicated to those [students] who are capable of analyzing implications but poor at producing conceptual possibilities. . . represents in my estimation a serious deception. These [students] are informed that as far as the society is concerned, they are doing fine educationally. Yet they cannot adopt the kind of tolerance toward error that may lie at the root of much significant innovation in mathematics, science, and the arts. (Wallach, p. 51) Is the teacher himself really freed by these devices? Or does</page><page sequence="13">50 he become patronized by the engineers who design the machines and by the administrators who route the students through them? Can a person be expected to behave creatively if his education consists of his being "programmed" to follow sets of instruc- tions designed to produce minimal behavioral differences be- tween one person and another? This is not to be construed as an idle complaint about the dangers of encroaching technology. Technology, like figured bass, is the neutral product of a sup- porting system, not its cause, and exists tobe used or misused. The issue here, to repeat, is that, with or without teaching machines, creative inquiry can be stifled more by the fear of error than by the lack of information. Schoenberg recognized this situation a few years after he came to America, as is evi- dent in a letter written to Krenek in December, 1939: . . American young people's intelligence is certainly re- markable. I am endeavoringto direct this intelligence into the right channels. They are extremely good at getting hold of principles, but then want to apply them too much 'on principle'. And in art that's wrong. . . . Musical logic does not answer to 'if , then __', but enjoys making use of the possibilities excluded by if-then. (Stein, p. 210) Moving on to a brief consideration of the second reason for comparing scientific and artistic thought processes, namely, the close relationship between contemporary science and art: we find it useful for the musician-theorist to be cognizant of this bond, because its cement consists of two ingredients which considerably occupy his attention: language and method. For the last thirty five years or so, philosophical efforts have been largely directed toward language consciousness, that is, sen- sitivity to the logic of language. This is perhaps still the pres- ent and newest way of dealing with philosophy's traditional task of distinguishing between self and not-self, between subjectivism and non-subjectivism. It now seems that the best answer to the question, "Which is right - to be subjective or non-subjec- tive? " lies in the appeal to "complementary" languages. In this sense, the relation between "plain talk" and more special- ized languages, or between different specialized languages, is no doubt a complementary one. Thus one can approach a mu- sical composition with two different purposes in mind: to dis- cover the empirical constructs contained in the composition, and to study its effects on a listener (presumably one who knows or is learning the code). From the former point of view, we could make a complete catalogue of all the items that are "really there", and arrive at publicly acknowledgable results. But even if this approach is exhaustive, it is not exclusive. From</page><page sequence="14">51 the second point of view, a description of human behavior would not fill in the gaps in the previous account but would comprise something that we find when we start all over again, using a complementary language. It appears unlikely that such an ex- haustive catalogue of the empirical data of the music would permit us to predict its effect upon those who hear it, inasmuch as these activities comprise two different universes of dis- course. Yet it is this effect that makes a collection of sounds into a meaningfulmusical experience. *4 It would seem, there- fore, that the problem for meaningful analysis lies in working with complementary languages such that a point of intersection between data and response can be discovered. This relation between data and response will be described in more detail later. Let it be said here that, as teachers and researchers, we (and I stress that pronoun) are usually only too happy to rest our case after having made exhaustive empirical studies. In fact, one can observe a fairly recent trend in the periodical literature whereby authors carefully specify that their articles "do not represent an analysis of the work". At least they are honest in their avoidance of problems of actual perception. *5 We might be guilty of excessive devotion to rigorous methodol- ogies which produce objective results, in the belief that science works this way. Thus C.P. Snow distinguishes between the "literary culture" and the "scientific culture", and believed that the former was of little practical use to the latter. But Douglas Davis writes: now every sign indicates the relationship is a good deal more complicated. To begin with, the history of science is riddled with chance discoveries that link science and art in a common irrationality. (Davis, AA, pp. 29-37) This is not to minimize the importance of rigor and method; I am only making a suggestion, remembering Boulez' notion of creativity, that we should welcome what enters unforeseen into one's work and let it merge with what is controlled. Even the scientist, with all his calculations, must at least provisionally accept the indeterminate. But then, what is scientific method, and how does music theory stand in relation to it? This ques- tion leads to the third reason for comparing scientific and ar- tistic thought processes: that scientific method and the methods of music theory cannot be incompatible. We can follow the lead suggested by Babbitt in considering the nature, scope, and domain of application of scientific method and language: "If it is not extensible to musical theory, then musical theory is not a theory in any sense in which the term</page><page sequence="15">52 ever has been employed. " (Babbitt, CMS, p. 52) We require that a theory be formal, explicit, and as complete and simple as possible. These four criteria provide a basis for recogniz- ing the superiority of some theories to others - either because one theory might serve as an effective conceptual framework for a more comprehensive range of inquiries than does an- other, or because one theory might provide an analytical or representational method that makes possible more precise and detailed inferences than some other theory. A theory is formal if, for example, it presents an algorithm which is independent of particular data, or if it deals with the category of functional relations of some sort, without specifying whatever elements may be subsumed under this category. Thus the statement, "The II chord frequently precedes the dominant chord", is not a formal statement. At most, this statement can be an appen- dage to a theory of tonal music, but it cannot be an integral part of the theory. To qualify as part of a formal theory, the statement would have to be translated into formal terms, which would include, for example, a statement of rules capable of generating a string of non-terminal symbols (terminal symbols are members of the vocabulary of a grammar which never ap- pear to the left of a replacement operation as a symbol to be replaced). Thus the formal rule: X -- Y, interpreted as an instruction to replace X with Y, generates the following (unex- hausted) number of terminal symbols: Diatonic collection interval aggregate functional relation dominant preparation L harmony chord L II, 116, IV, IV6, VI, N6, V/V... Thus, descriptive notions, such as "II chord" or "V chord", are known as non-logical terms, and are specific to discourse about some special subject matter. Far from being members of "basic elements" in tonal theory, their meaning is dependent on, and implicitly defined by, such formal relational structures. Explicitness is necessary in a theory if its descriptions are not to assume the very operations it is trying to explain. Thus the theory itself must provide the definitions of experiential items and state the relationships holding between these items and their logical relations in such sufficient detail as to minimize dependence onthe intuitive and interpretive abilities of the user of the theory. That explicitness in the theory of tonal music</page><page sequence="16">53 does not yet exist is manifested by the various meanings of the term "modulation" still competing for attention. Indeed, the act of identifying a single tonal center in even the most diatonic of contexts requires several steps. For example, the following procedure can be (and has been) successfully applied by non- music students in a class in elementary music theory. It as- sumes a minimum ability to read notes and some understanding of the concept of pitch- and interval-classes: Given: A completely diatonic melody. (See Example 1.) Postulates: There are n2 - n intervals in a collection of 2 n specifiably different pitch-classes. A hier- archy of interval classes exists in many such collections. Procedure: (1) Extract all the specifiably different pitch- classes from the melody. (2) Starting on any pitch, arrange the collection of pitch classes in ascending consecutive order. (3) Hier- archize the intervallic content of this collec- tion. (This results in a tabulation of the num- ber and kind of IC's: 6 of IC5, 5 of IC2, 4 of IC3, 3 of IC4, 2 of IC1, 1 of IC6.) (4) Iden- tify the letter names of the pitch classes that uniquely define IC6. (5) Is it possible to form a semitone (IC1) with one member of IC6 by the operation of addition of any other pitch- class of the collection? (6) Is it possible to form a whole-tone (IC2) with the other mem- ber of IC6 by the operation of any other pitch- class of the collection? (7) If both these steps are possible, the added pitch-class of step 5 can be described as scale degree 1, and the added pitch-class of step 6 can be described as scale degree 5. (8) Re-arrange the col- lection (if necessary) to begin on scale degree 1. Let this scale degree be called the tonic, and let scale degree 5 be called the dominant. (9) Characterize this specific tonic by its let- ter name. (10) If an IC3 can be formed by the addition of 3 semitones to scale degree 1, the mode is described as being minor. (11) If an IC4 can be formed by the addition of 4 semitones to scale degree 1, the mode is de- scribed as being major.</page><page sequence="17">54 Such a procedure is not as cumbersome as it appears to be, since, with practice, the necessary identifications and opera- tions can be made more rapidly. It seems especially helpful for students with relatively little musical experience or for those who are unable, for various reasons, to actually hear the music they are looking at. And while they probably could aurally identify the tonic with ease, they could do so only in- tuitively, basing their response on previous conditioning. An- other (obvious) assumption built into the foregoing procedure is that it is valid only for those relatively few contexts which are completely free of chromatic tones, and which in fact make a complete enumeration of a diatonic scale possible. It is, of course, possible to add a few more "if" statements to account for the various functions of chromaticism, or for tones which are theoretically implied in a given melody. But as it stands, the relatively few steps in the above procedure would be inade- quate for an interpretation of Example 2, in which a chromatic tone is present, and which does not actually present all seven scale degrees. These remarks are, of course, directed to the example itself, not to the context from which it has been ex- tracted. The criteria of completeness and simplicity are more easily explained. A complete theory covers all the facts that it can, for its time, and when two theories seem to cover the same facts, the simpler one is selected because it uses fewer, more general statements. It is worth quoting part of Nagel's views of these two criteria: Since theories are constructed with a view toward explain- ing a wide variety of [musical experiences], it is clear that such an end can in general be achieved only if a theory is so formulated that no reference is made in it to any set of specialized. . . concepts. For otherwise the theory would be limited in its application to situations to which just those concepts are relevant. Indeed, the more com- prehensive the range of possible application of a theory, the more meager is its explicitly formulated content with respect to specialized details of some subject matter . . . This does not mean, however, that. . theories tend in the limit to become empty of all content as their range of ap- plication becomes more inclusive. It does mean that a theory seeks to formulate a highly general structure of relations that is invariant in a wide variety of. . . different situations but that can be specialized by augmenting the fundamental postulates of the theory with more restrictive assumptions, so as to yield systematically a series of</page><page sequence="18">55 EXAMPLE 1 TEMA Andante grazioso 2 Pii andante Horns .P-.-- . . . in C I - 6k 45 in C &lt;</page><page sequence="19">50 diversified subordinate structures. (Nagel, pp. 103-104) Completeness and simplicity enable a theory to suggest sys- tematic connections between general concepts describing qual- itatively disparate musical languages. For example, it should be possible to develop a theory of "harmony" or of "tonality" such that these words can become general concepts without at the same time losing the possibility of precise meaning. We can never be sure if a particular theory is the simplest theory possible, however, and must therefore consider that sooner or later any theory will be superceded or absorbed by another which accounts for additional facts or which synthesizes pre- viously unconnected theories. Thus Goethe writes, "In the sciences, it is greatly rewarding to seek out the inadequate truths already possessed by the ancients and develop them fur- ther. " (Wilkinson and Willoughby, p. 167) A musical theory, like scientific theories, thus provides a description which is as good as it can be within the limitations of time, funds, and the abilities of the theorist. Bearing these limitations in mind, it should be realized that it is not considered necessary to give up a theory or even modify it if its predictions are not always closely confirmed. Ex- pressions such as "strongly suggest", "lead us to expect that", or "make more plausible", are very characteristic of much scientific language, and indicate a judgmental act on the part of the theorist, even though he may be using a more formal language elsewhere in the construction of the theory. If a the- ory is to have any valuable explanatory, predictive, or unifying function, it must contain these linguistic expressions. The questions then arise, is there any such thing as a final and per- fect stage for a theory, and if so, for what type of theory is this stage desirable? Is a theory then still at the cutting edge of a domain of knowledge? What role should be played by rigor in musical theory? The sense in which rigor is an ideal in pure mathematics is not the same as in, say, applied physics - or music: A theorem is a proposition which is a strict logical con- sequence of certain definitions and other properties. The validity of a theorem, then, usually depends on the validity of other theorems. This tracing of antecedents goes on until the rock bottom is reached: assertions which are not proved but simply assumed, and terms which are not de- fined but simply listed. In a mathematical system it is unnecessary (in fact, impossible) either to prove these basic assumptions (the postulates) or to define the basic</page><page sequence="20">57 terms. This is what Bertrand Russell meant when he said that in mathematics we never know what we are talking about, nor whether what we are saying is true. (Rapaport, p. 5) In fields other than mathematics and symbolic logic, therefore, it makes more sense to say "rigorous enough" for the simple reason that we are not dealing with pure axioms but with ex- perience, and it is here, in the confrontation between the theo- retical and the empirical, that the theorist resorts to judgment. And, of course, it is in this confrontation where controversy is more likely to arise, quite regardless of whatever amount of rigor was used in the construction of the theory. To create a less than perfect theory is to reveal an easy relationship with anxiety. These brief comments on rigor seem to be in agree- ment with Chomsky's attitude toward the problem of exceptions in rules of grammar: It must be borne in mind that the general rules of a gram- mar are not invalidated by the existence of exceptions. Thus one does not eliminate the rule for forming the past tense of Verbs from the grammar on the grounds that many Verbs are irregular. . .. [In this case], the generaliza- tion is invalidated. . . only if a more highly valued gram- mar can be constructed that does not contain it. It is for this reason that the discovery of peculiarities and excep- tions (which are rarely lacking, in a system of the com- plexity of a natural language) is generally so unrewarding and, in itself, has so little importance for the study of the grammatical structure of the language in question, unless of course, it leads to the discovery of deeper generaliza- tions. (Chomsky, ATS, p. 218) The foregoing section has attempted to provide an in-depth comparison between music theory in particular and theory con- struction in general. A comparison in-breadth also holds, that is, a comparison of different kinds of theory. Different moti- vations or purposes produce different kinds of theories, all of them useful in their own way. Theory can be broadly divided into .temporary or permanent types, if these adjectives be re- garded as limit cases in the sense that some theories are more temporary or more permanent than others. For example, some scholarly activities might be regarded as having once been mo- tivated by a theory until that activity produced an incontroverti- ble verification, at which moment the theory itself would no longer have any value even though its conclusions might. Illus- trations of such a temporary theory can be found in the hypo-</page><page sequence="21">58 thetical work which precedes the ultimate verification of author- ship, or the codification of a notational system. Here one can- not speak of a perfected stage of a theory: it simply disappears, replaced by what we tend to call "facts". Other kinds of theories seek to be more permanent, in the sense that they serve as means for the acquisition of insight into a more comprehensive range of problems. Here the condition of verification must be re-defined from a more pragmatic point of view. "It is not the business of a theory to be true; it is the business of a theory to be useful." (Poland, JMT, p. 164) If a theory has relatively more permanent value because of its use- fulness, it is likely to be one of two kinds: phenomenological or explanatory. A complete survey and critique of the theory of phenomenalism would be inadvisable in this space, if not impossible. Perhaps the most concise rendering of this the- ory's fundamental, and most familiar, postulate has been made by C. I. Lewis: "Unless something is certain in terms of ex- perience, then nothing of empirical import is even probable. " (Lewis, p. 326) A truly phenomenological theory defines all expressions referring to hypothetical (observationally inacces- sible) objects in terms of the data of immediate sensory ex- perience. Such a theory does not consider questions of cau- sality, and the concept of predictability is, of course, directed to experience rather than to physical events. The validity of inferences and beliefs construed from sense experience is us- ually conceived to depend on premises about the regular asso- ciation of past sense experiences. Further verification is ob- tained, then, when predicted experiences actually occur, the verification being framed in the form of a probability statement. Because experiential knowledge gains in probability by asso- ciation with concensual sense experience and by the validation of predictions, the nature of this type of knowing is sometimes designated as "interpersonal" to distinguish it from either "ob- jective" or "subjective" knowing, although a psychologically mature theorist will use all three modes of knowing in an in- tegrated fashion. (Cf. Rogers, BP, 115 ff. ) This will receive further elaboration later. The two problems that have long been associated withphenom- enalism-the lack of an autonomous language of bare sense data and the near impossibility of bracketing one's implicit assump- tions - are perhaps not insurmountable. About the former, Lewis writes: the impossibility of the accurate expression of direct ap- prehensions of sense would. . . merely constitute a cornm-</page><page sequence="22">59 ment upon the inessential character of language in its re- lation to the cognitive process. . . . (Lewis, p. 290) As to the latter, MacLeod states: There is no identification without bias, but there can be a deliberate attempt to identify bias and temporarily suspend it or at least shift observation systematically from one bias to another. (MacLeod, p. 52) We are again reminded of Babbitt's suggestion about verbal and methodological responsibility, and of the previously discussed goals for theory classes: precise definition, that is, analysis of the experience of music. Phenomenalism looks -at the prob- lem of definition from an empathic point of view, whereby def- inition is regarded as a process of perceptual learning, and learning as the acquisition of discriminatory powers. It is hardly necessary to point out that, in music, description based on phenomenological hypothesis is infrequently encountered. The reasons are not difficult to perceive. In the first place, the resurgence of phenomenalistic psychology is a fairly recent trend; secondly, changing concepts of "objective" :knowledge cannot be ignored by even the most laboratory-minded musician. It can be hoped that music theory has gone through its logical positivism phase the way music has gone through its phase of total serialization. In any case, the most responsible work that can be cited as an example of at least a direction pointing to phenomenalistic description is Kerman's, The Beethoven Quartets. That Kerman is aware of his phenomenalistic ap- proach there can be no doubt, as is evidenced by his statements made at the end of his first chapter and at the conclusion of the book. For example: There has to be a standard of relevance, and a priori stand- ards are open to the gravest difficulties, both theoretical and practical. The right standard is aesthetic, and the critic's role is constantly to return to feeling as a touch- stone for analytical relevance. ... The critic hopes to persuade, of course, and he writes in the assumption that his sensibility is going to make contact with at least some section of the reading musical public. ... . To deal with art is to deal with fact and feeling, and to deal closely is to discover more and more that each is problematic- fact as well as feeling. (Kerman, p. 28) As Kerman admits, such an approach is difficult, messy, and to some, offensive. Indeed, it is much easier to regard most</page><page sequence="23">00 of the important work in music theory as explanatory in nature. As such, its significance for musical understanding cannot be denied - hence the complementary relationship between phe- nomenological and explanatory theories. I would guess that all theories of perception agree that man, among other things, is a pattern-making animal, although there might be disagreement as to whether this is an inherent or an acquired ability. In any case, the central task of explanatory theories seems to be con- trolled inquiry into the nature, significance, and probable cause of patterns and relationships - though this may be an over- simplification. Nagel has specified four types of explanatory theories, all of which are relevant in varying degrees to the sort of inquiry that interests music theorists. (Nagel, pp. 20- 26) The first of these is the deductive explanation, in which the thing to be explained (the explicandum) is a logically nec- essary consequence of the explanatory premises. Certain generative aspects of the theory of serial music come to mind as an example of this type of explanation; Forte's theory of set complexes is another. In general, a deductive explanation may contain premises which are (1) necessary truths (e. g., the re- sults of mathematical operations), (2) statistical generaliza- tions, (3) theoretical statements, or (4) statements based on empirical evidence. The explicandum itself may be (1) a nec- essary truth, (2) an historical fact (musica ficta), or (3) a statistical phenomenon: Why is it that many of the thematic shapes in Beethoven's later music are created by the opposite motion of intervals of 3rds and 4ths? In connection with the deductive type of explanation, it might be pointed out that, for some time now, the scientific community has discarded Aris- totle's requirements that (1) the premises in a deductive ex- planation must be true, (2) that they must be known to be true, and (3) that they must be "better known" than the explicandum. These requirements are now seen to be too strong, since they would judge many useful premises as unsatisfactory. After all, we do not know if many of the premises of science are indeed true. More to the point, there should be no grounds for re- garding them as false. A second type of explanatory theory is probabilistic in nature. Here, the premises do not formally imply their explicanda, al- though they make them probable via an observable statistical regularity. That is, a statement made about the behavior of a singular musical event or relationship is given probable validity when it is seen that that event or relationship is a member of a class about which statistical assumptions have been made. To date, the analysis of "atonal" music has tended toward this type of explanation. Or, statements made about the nature of</page><page sequence="24">01 perception become "probably" true if the premises of state- ments can be validated by testing groups of people. Functional or teleological explanations are made via a consid- eration of one or more functions that a unit performs in main- taining or realizing certain traits of a system to which the unit belongs. Current theories of audition seem to range themselves in this category, as do certain structural aspects of serial theory (as opposed to the generative aspects mentioned above). For example, in Webern's Symphonie, a functional relationship exists among (1) the number of movements, (2) the structure of each movement, (3) the 12-tone set and (4) the source set, even though it could not be said that the symphony as a whole is a logically necessary consequence of its particular set. A final type of explanation is termed genetic: an explanationis offered of the sequence of events through which some earlier system has been transformed into a later one. It should be pointed out that not every event in the career of the system need be mentioned; those that are mentioned are selected on the basis of assumptions about what sort of events are causally relevant to the development of a different system. This activity is not without its dangers: we are all aware of Babbitt's very clear distinction between the tonal system and the 12-tone sys- tem, and of the problems involved in looking for "antecedents". Yet it seems equally clear that an unbroken thread connects, for example, Schoenberg's music, whatever the compositional system: his concern for symmetrical or invariant structures, and his self-conscious manner of unfolding these structures through different time-spans, can be traced to the Gurrelieder and early opus numbers. But a somewhat safer modification of this mode of explanation suggests itself: an organic explan- ation of the transformation of events within a system. This might include the development of theories of (1) invariants as they relate to changing surface designs, (2) interactions between the obligatory and the optional, (3) stylization, idealization, or manneristic treatment of earlier, more primitive genres, or (4) the process of augmenting certain compositional tech- niques (e. g., "Brechung*) to apply over a much larger span of a composition than the original conception of the technique might have intended. The above discussion of the requirements for theory construc- tion, and of the types of theories, is intended as no more than a survey of what could represent, from a purely pedagogical point of view, a possible means of re-aligning the philosophy of the music theory curriculum with the philosophy of science.</page><page sequence="25">62 At the very beginning of this paper it was suggested that the theorist is interested not only in the nature of music but also in the nature of his knowledge about music. In point of fact, it is the nature of this knowledge, rather than the nature of music, about which we can be most certain. It seems reasonable to assume, therefore, that the creator of useful theories must be aware of many of the problems that are the concern of the phi- losophy of science: problems relating to the cognitive status of theories, to the various schools of thought about the applica- bility of terms like "true" or "false" to theoretical statements; or those problems concerned with the nature of premises - their logical, epistemic, and substantive conditions - or, again, problems relating to definition and full awareness of the multi- ple meanings of crucial terms, such as "causality", "chance", and, of course, "explanation". As a conclusion to these matters, some of the ideas presented here are reviewed with more explicitness. First, it should be made clear that an analysis of theory itself does not imply that the theorist- or any creative person- always pursues a straight and rigorous line of thought. Such precise thinking actually need accompany only the final stages of theory construction. The initial stages, however, are every bit as important, and, in fact, it is this stage which seems to be the immediate con- cern of the technique of synectics and metaphor construction. Gordon refutes the notion that non-rational and associative mental play cannot withstand the illumination of self-examina- tion. (Gordon, p. 5) It has been argued here that such tech- niques are valuable not only in stimulating creativity but also for the acquisition of self-knowledge. Secondly, it should also be made clear that theory construction, at whatever stage, is always accompanied by feeling. A survey of well-known state- ments by Kepler, Galileo, Einstein, Russell, Watson (of DNA fame), et. al., repeatedly attests to the high emotional states and non-verbal mental images that accompany the effort of theory-making. The perception of one's own thought-feeling processes enables one, ultimately, to maintain the position of detached observer. Thirdly, the idea of detachment signifies only the mastery of hedonistic tendencies, but decidedly not the false dichotomy of observer and observed. In this respect, Grinker writes: observations in all sciences are made by an individual who has a position relative to his object. He can have only one frame of reference at a time, although several may be put together through a mental operation. Natural events are viewed not in terms of the reality of the matter but through</page><page sequence="26">03 the eyes [and ears] of an observer who is part of a specific communication system. (Grinker. p. 367) This realization seems to make theorizing of some kind prac- tically inescapable, if we wish to relate to the world success- fully. A theory, ultimately, represents a decision to regard objects from a particular point of view. Even though we can never be sure that these objects actually do possess any of the characteristics that the theory imputes to them, there is this advantage to theories, that they enable us to think about these objects, and to work with them. We do not thereby deny the existence of objects; we merely recognize that our judgments and conclusions about them are purely of our own making. Such has been the message of this paper: that theorizing, in the best- and only - sense, is concerned with thinking and making, creatively and philosophically. REFE R E N C E S 1 The research of Jencks and Riesman leads them to conclude that "when under- graduates feel they cannot play a useful or responsible role in the adult work of their campus, this is not necessarily because they lack preparation but often because they lack the self-confidence and encouragement they would need to undertake a serious piece of research. " (Jencks and Riesman, p. 44) 2 Gordon's use of the word "Synectics" is with permission of Synectics, Inc., of Cambridge, Massachusetts. 3 This analogy is supported by LeCorbusier's own Le Modulor, and by the writings of men like Kahnweiler and Apollinaire, who witnessed, and indeed contributed to, the growth of Cubism. (Cf. Mitchell, 63ff) 4 Much of this paragraph paraphrases part of B. F. Skinner's article, "The Machine that is Man', in Psychology Today, April, 1969. 5 Cf. William Thompson's article, "The Problem of Music Analysis and Univer- sals", College Music Symposium, 6(1966): "The music analyst is inconvenienced today because he must operate without any general framework of perception ex- cept that which he can project from an intuitive matrix. As musicians, we have neglected to ask and to seek answers for the very fundamental questions of what happens when tones are put together, and psychologists generally ignore our needs or feel reluctant at present to deal with them. Until inquiry of this kind has established some referential bed for general experience, from which we can extrapolate appropriate guidelines, the music analyst will be stuck with his homemade judgments about the ways in which tones become music.
