Wexler Simon Fraser University ABSTRACT The reaction to sociobiology by social scientists has provided more heat than light. This paper seeks to shed light upon the issue by avoiding the ideological and ethical debate and evaluating the utility of this new theory to the social sciences. The evaluation of utility presented here is accomplished by a) reviewing the sociobiological programme with particular reference to the sociobiological explana tion of human altruism, b) identifying the sociobiologists' perception of the manner in which sociobiological explanation, as exemplified by that of altruism, can help social scientists, and c) clarifying the limita tions and youthful overstatements of this relatively new effort to in culcate the Neo-Darwinian perspective on evolution into the social sciences. The paper concludes with the warning that it is far too early to reject the sociobiological paradigm as irrelevant to social science. INTRODUCTION The biological and social scientific disciplines are natural allies; each at tempts to discern the lawful nature of living entities. This being so the reasonableness of a marriage between the two, since the emergence of the social sciences, has not gone unnoticed (Bock, 1980; Sorokin, 1928). Alfred Espinas, Durkheim's mentor at Bordeaux and the author of the first doctoral disserta tion in sociology, attempted to elucidate just such a marriage in his Des Societes Animates (1877). Then too, Herbert Spencer (1879; 1898) leaning upon Darwin, depicted society as analogous to a biological organism. People were thought of as analogous to cells, groups to organs, nervous systems to communication net works and societies to evolving species (Becker and Barnes, 1961; Martindale, 1960). This reasoning by biological analogy was, as the history of social Dar winism reveals, a very poor basis for a lasting marriage (Bannister, 1979; Hofstadter, 1955). Indeed, the social Darwinian justification of social HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 9 NO. 1 — FALUWINTER 1981-82</page><page sequence="2">33 inequities, the perpetuation of racism, and the sanctioning of an eschatology of progress, proved fatal to a marriage of the biological and social sciences. Despite this, a new marriage proposal, one that solders the social to the biological under the name of sociobiology, is currently being announced in the popular (Barash, 1978b; Bylinsky, 1977; Leo, 1978; Seebohm, 1975) and academic presses (Alexander, 1979; Barash, 1977; 1979; Dawkins, 1976; Eckland, 1976; Wilson, 1975; 1978). The reactions to this portended marriage have been intense. Discussions, now under the polite rubric of the "sociobiology debate" (Barlow and Silverberg, 1980; Caplan, 1978; Montagu, 1980), reveal that some view sociobiology as social Darwinism with a new vocabulary (Allen et al., 1976; Leacock, 1980; Lewontin, 1979) while others celebrate the potential contribution of sociobiology to the social sciences (Blute, 1976; Freedman, 1979; Shapiro, 1978; Van den Berghe, 1978). The intensity of this debate has, in my opinion, produced more heat than light and as a consequence many social scientists, although aware of sociobiology as a "hot" topic, have little information as to the way, shape or form sociobiology may be relevant to their work. In this paper I intend to move towards rectifying this lack of information. To do so I will a) provide an over view of the sociobiological programme, b) focus in upon the sociobiology of altruism as a central example of the form of explanation advocated by sociobiologists, c) present the sociobiologists' perceptions of the strength of their programme to social scientists and d) examine the way in which the sociobiologists in the youthfulness of their theory overstate their strength. Human altruism, rather than sex dominance, homosexuality or communica tion, is selected as the illustration of sociobiological reasoning because in E. O. Wilson's words, it is "the central theoretical problem of sociobiology" (Wilson, 1975:3). The Sociobiological Programme Sociobiologists attempt to provide a theory which explains the social behavior of both Homo sapiens and animals biologically. Unlike the in tellecutal programme of the ethologists (Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1975; Tinbergen, 1951; 1968), with whom they share this goal and from whom they draw much of their data, the sociobiologists emphasize the explanatory power of recent fin dings in the neo-Darwinian marriage of genetics and evolutionary theory (Moody, 1970; Simpson, 1949; Weller, 1969). The sociobiologists aim to HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS — VOL. 9 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1981-82</page><page sequence="3">34 revitalize the "synthetic theory of evolution" (Alexander, 1979; Huxley, 1942). This effort at revitalization is to be accomplished by demonstrating the usefulness of this approach, particularly to those like the social scientist and moral philosopher, who have by and large proceeded to investigate behavior without an evolutionist's perspective (Ghiselin, 1969; 1974). In this spirit E. O. Wilson notes that the purpose of sociobiology "is to develop general laws of evolution and biology of social behavior, which might be extended in a disinterested manner in the study of human beings" (1978:XIV). Descriptively speaking, the sociobiological programme is two tiered. Despite their emphasis upon the essential unity of the laws governing all life forms, the sociobiologists proceed first with animals, then, and more speculatively, with humans. First, particular attention is paid to the adaptive qualities of animal social behavior, their population structures, castes and communications, together with a focus on the physiology underlying these social adaptations (Barash, 1977; Wilson, 1975). The prime mover in this perspective, to use Wilson's Aristotlian phrase, is the gene and its selection over time. Put simply, genes or more clearly gene complexes control or mediate both the animal's phenotype and its behavioral repertoire and as such determine its survival, and hence over time, the changes in the composition of populations (Wilson, 1980). This genotypic rather than the more customary phenotypic and ontogenetic em phasis of the "social" analyst is the factor that has both raised the promise of this field and the ire of its critics. The second tier, one noted by the sociobiologists themselves as "speculative" and "vulnerable" (Barash, 1977; 1979; Wilson, 1975; 1978) is manifest in the sociobiologists' efforts to apply findings from tier one to humans. The em phasis here, as in the animal studies, is upon the selection of genes over time as the mechanism for describing and understanding human behavior. Despite the sociobiologists' recognition of culture and human language as important dif ferences between the evolutionary processes in animals and in humans, theirs is an analysis which proceeds as if this difference can be subsumed by knowledge of genetic selection. Culture, in this perspective, is an enabling device. It, like the sociality of the primates or the alarm calling of prairie dogs, develops as an outcome of the adaptation of genes to selective pressures. As Wilson succinctly puts it, "the genes hold culture on a leash" (1978:167). Seen at this level of generality, sociobiology is a new scientifically motivated effort to detail how evolution at the genotypic level can facilitate the explana tion of both animal and human sociality. To probe further and thus reduce the level of generality and thereby provide what one might call a "fair" and hence HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 9 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1981-82</page><page sequence="4">35 scientifically useful evaluation, it is vital to present the sociobiologists' "work ing assumptions" and their perception of the usefulness of sociobiology to the social sciences. To proceed without these is to evaluate the sociobiological pro gramme without an understanding of its practitioners' perception of the limits, coherence and utility of their theory. Two working assumptions guide the sociobiologists. The first can be con ceived of as their idea of the proper emphasis in explanation; the second, which is a consequence of the first, as their distinction between admissable hence rele vant and irrelevant data. The first working assumption stems from the sociobiologists' emphasis upon "ultimate" rather than "proximate" causation as the basis of sound explanation (Barash, 1977; Wilson, 1975). "Proximate mechanisms" as Barash explains call attention to "explanations of behavior in terms of immediate causation" (1977:37). Thus, the reason I'm sitting here at my desk on a brilliantly sunny, Sunday, May, morning is because I've con vinced myself that I have something relevant to say about the application of sociobiology to the social sciences. The use of a mentalistic explanation, that of convincing myself, is proximate because unlike ultimate causation it does little to trace the origins of the phenomena central to the explanation. "Ultimate mechanisms" as Barash notes, signal an "evolutionary approach" (1977:37). The ultimate, or as I prefer "distal," emphasis seeks to explain by alluding to the development of the phenomena over time. Thus the explanation of my presence at my desk on a sunny Sunday, in sociobiological terms, would detail the evolutionary history of that behavior, by revealing the adaptive significance of it, to those in the past, whose genes I now bear. The sociobiological emphasis upon "ultimate" or "distal" in lieu of "prox imate" explanations is based upon their belief that in employing the former, they subsume the latter. This, as we have seen, is precisely the logic in Wilson's perception of genes (ultimate explanation) holding culture (proximate explana tion) on a leash. The proximate, the mainstay of social scientific explanation, is seen by sociobiologists as too epiphenomenal and unstable to be useful in scien tifically explaining human sociality. The more scientifically relevant "ultimate" explanation is not, as we shall see in more detail, easily manipulated by Homo sapiens and, as such, is much less susceptible to human deception and more im portantly self-deception. The exclusion of such proximate explanations as mind, culture, and the economy is not part of a plot to enrage social scientists. It is, however, clearly part of the sociobiologists' effort to introduce what they perceive as a sounder, more solid notion of science to the social sciences. The social sciences, as HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 9 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1981-82</page><page sequence="5">36 perceived by the sociobiologists, lack scientific maturity. Indeed, Wilson por trays those who write in such social scientific journals as Daedalus and others as exemplars of the social scientific standard when he notes that "their content consists largely of historical anecdotes, diachronic collating of outdated, ver balized theories of human behavior, and judgments of current events according to personal ideology—all enlivened by the pleasant but frustrating techniques of effervescence" (1978:203). The social sciences, to put it simply, are by and large unscientific. Capturing essentially the same tone as Wilson, Barash il lustrates how the social sciences have generated inconsistent and divisive towers of Babel which like "sociology and anthropology are filled with disciples of Durkheim, Levi-Strauss, Spencer, Marx, and numerous other social theorists, whose ideas and approaches are often independent, mutually exclusive and dis quietingly noncomplementary, as well as resistant to verification or refutation" (1978a: 14). In Thomas Kuhn's terminology (1962) the sociobiologists promise to deliver a preparadigmatic science into the elevated status of a paradigmatic science. In this context, preparadigm sciences are characterized by eclecticism, uncertain standards for evaluating the quality of research, a propensity for bottling old wine (theories) in new bottles, and an overall lack of cumulative growth. Paradigmatic science, on the other hand, lacks the self-consciousness of their preparadigm cousins, possessing a unified theoretical program, a lucid means of generating, codifying and assessing inquiry and an incremental and discerni ble pattern of research development. The tacit assumption of sociobiologists is that the irksomeness of preparadigmatic social science, its avowed inefficiency and belaboured conceptual frameworks, are capable of amelioration when and if social scientists embrace the sociobiological paradigm. Wilson is correct in asserting that "one of the chief functions of sociobiology," as he puts it, "is to reformulate the foundations of the social sciences" (1975:4). To capture, then assess this revolutionary impulse it is vital to focus in upon a concrete example of sociobiological reasoning. Sociobiological Altruism The centrality of the problem of altruism, its irksomeness, besets the sociobiologist because altruism violates the individual selection assumption of orthodox evolutionary theory. As Wilson puts it, "how can altruism, which by definition reduces personal fitness, possibly evolve by natural selection" HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 9 NO. 1 — FALL/WINTER 1981-82</page><page sequence="6">37 (1975:3). Thus, if individuals risk their lives (lower their personal fitness) in the act of assisting others (altruism) one would, as an evolutionary biologist, predict that altruism like other non-adaptive behaviors would become extinct. Altruism however, as the sociobiologists note, has clearly persisted. This per sistence requires explanation for it both violates a central assumption of in dividual selectionism and can prove an embarrassment to sociobiologists as they seek to explain cooperative aspects of human social behavior. There has, since Kropotkin (1903) attacked Darwin's emphasis upon com petition, been two distinct explanations for the persistence of altruism. The one emphasized by Kropotkin and more recently by Allee (1931; 1938) and Wynne Edwards (1962), posits altruism as a group-adaptive behavior. It is adaptive because although altruism lowers the personal fitness of the altruist, it can con fer an advantage upon the group. In this perspective, groups that act altruistically, for example by voluntarily limiting the population when resources become scarce, have an advantage over those that don't. The group selec tionists posit the possibility of emergent and cultural factors operative within the genetic context of evolution. The sociobiologists however dispute the merits of the group selection posi tion. It is super-organismic they argue, and moreover the issue the group selec tionists seek to explain can be examined more parsimoniously within the assumptions of the individual selectionist position (Williams, 1966). The sociobiologists' aim is to both preserve the individual selection assumption and explain the persistence of altruism. Their solution is to reformulate the concept of the "individual." The shift, in the sociobiological perspective, is from Dar winian fitness (the individual as reproducer) to genetic or inclusive fitness (the individul as gene holder). The key to comprehending the sociobiologists' maintenance of the criteria of individual selection and their explanation of the persistence of altruism rests in their shifting of the avowedly natural suture lines of evolutionary theory. Dar winian fitness is a measure of the individual's capacity to produce surviving off spring. Inclusive fitness is a measure of the organism's capacity for having copies of its genes enter future generations. Thus an organism can lower its Darwinian fitness, even act altruistically by conferring a benefit upon others, and still increase its inclusive fitness. It can do this by increasing the reproduc tive chances of other organisms with which it shares its genes. Altruism is now approachable as an evolutionary topic. Altruism can persist as long as the altruist in his life risking activity rescues copies of the genes responsible for this altruism. Since the genes survive, the behavior, despite its HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 9 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1981-82</page><page sequence="7">38 apparent risk to the individual persists. The question that remains is, "how is inclusive fitness increased?" Here one finds three sociobiological explana tions—kin selection, reciprocal altruism and parental manipulations. Kin selection, the brainchild of W. D. Hamilton (1964; 1970) and J. Maynard Smith (1964), is based on the genetic relatedness of kin. According to this theory, organisms will engage in altruistic acts when such acts benefit relatives, who presumably share, although to varying degrees, the same genotype as the altruist. In mathematical terms altruism toward kin is worthwhile if the ratio of gain to loss in inclusive fitness (K) exceeds the reciprocal of the average co efficient of the relationship benefiting relatives (r). Thus if K &gt;1- altruistic M behavior will be selected. Moreover, in incidents when the altruist is unaware of relatedness, the formula if K &gt; i- , where r is the average relatedness between the potential altruist and other members of the population is employed. Accordingly, altruism is more likely as K is large and/or i- ( p- ) is small. The former obtains when benefit to the recipient is great and/or cost to the altruist is small; i.e., altruism is more strongly selected as the recipient is in greater need or is more likely to profit from a given altruistic act. The latter ob tains when r or r is large; i.e., altruism is more strongly selected in proportion as the potentially aided organism is more closely related to the would-be altruist (more genes in common). The kinship or nepotistic theory of altruism proceeds without inferring con scious calculations by the altruist. Altruism is spurred by altruistic genes. Genes that have persisted are clearly those that have the propensity for obeying the strictures of the inclusive fitness formula. This kinship form of altruism is, in Wilson's terminology, the purest kind of altruism, since unlike either reciprocal altruism or parental manipulation, it is "a set of responses unaffected by social reward or punishment beyond childhood" (1978:55). The primary requirement of reciprocal altruism to evolve through reciprocity is that the performance of the altruistic behavior must result in a return of altruistic behavior to the original altruist such that the ultimate benefits of in clusive fitness are greater than the cost. This brainchild of R. L. Trivers (1971) is, as Wilson (1978:155) notes, motivated by reward and as such reciprocal altruism is less a clear case of altruism than is kinship. Reciprocal altruism can occur between strangers. It is, as such, the sociobiologists' effort to explain the selfish genes (Dawkins, 1976) underlying what is apparently "good samaritan behavior" (Wilson, 1975:120). Like HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 9 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1981-82</page><page sequence="8">39 Trivers (1971) both Wilson (1975) and Barash (1977) cite the case of the drown ing man to illustrate this point. This case, stated concisely, goes: A man is drowning and a stranger jumps in to save him. Now, suppose that unassisted an individual has a 50% chance of drowning, but that if aided the chance decreases to 5°7o. Suppose in addition that potential rescuers and those rescued always survive or drown together, and moreover that everyone, at some time or other confronts the risk of drowning. Clearly, if all group members lend a helping hand, the drowning risks of a member of a group diminish from 50% to about 10%. In the long run, everybody gains and the genes for reciprocal altruism persist. In an interesting aside, Trivers (1971) speculates that just as natural selection selects reciprocal altruists, it also selects the "subtle cheats" who appear to be reciprocating, but who consistently pay back slightly less than they receive. This speculation by Trivers leads to a fascinating discussion of the evolutionary mechanisms wherein Homo sapiens have evolved social and physiological mechanisms to detect the subtle cheat and thus maintain the cooperative and in dividually beneficial contract underlying reciprocal altruism. The last and least explored of the sociobiological explanations for the evolu tion of altruism is parental manipulation (Alexander, 1974; Wilson, 1975). Essentially the sociobiologists contend that the social scientists' traditional view of socialization and enculturation, wherein offspring are instructed in the details of their parents' culture for the benefit of all, is misplaced. Parents, sociobiologists hold, invest time and effort on their children as a means of max imizing their inclusive fitness. However, parents and offspring, in order to max imize their own particular inclusive fitness, evolve different and conflicting strategies (Trivers, 1974). Children, to maximize inclusive fitness, should re quire more investment of parental time and energy than parents want to give; parents, in maximizing theirs, should have more children, particularly once their existing children seem reasonably assured of survival. The having of more children, of course, requires that less time and energy be given to any one child. This struggle of differently evolving tales of inclusive fitness is usually won by the parents. They, the sociobiologists argue, can usually have more children, but children will have difficulty in getting strangers, or those with whom they share less genes than they do with their parents, to invest energy and time in their maintenance. Thus it is both in the interest and within the powers of parents to manipulate their children into altruistic behaviors. The inclusive fitness of parents is enhanced when as a result of parental manipulation children will both tend to other children and voluntarily forego intense demands upon the parents' time and energy. HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 9 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1981-82</page><page sequence="9">40 Providing For Sociobiology Altruism is, as recent exponents of sociobiology suggest, "that facet of sociobiology that appears to hold special promise for the social sciences" (Greene et al., 1980:194). It is in the sociobiological explanation of human altruism, be it by kinship, reciprocity, or parental manipulation, that sociobiologists examine the specific nature of human sociality. Theirs, however, is an explanation which can be lauded less for its scientific solidity than for its insight into alternate and at times novel and exploratory issues. Evaluation, as I have suggested, must first seek to comprehend sociobiology on its own grounds and terms and then turn to its failings as seen by those external to it. First then, on its own terms, the sociobiological treatment of altruism can claim three areas in which it may sensitize social scientists (Ruse, 1979; Petryszak, 1979; 1981; Wilson, 1978). The first is the sociobiologists' explicit delineation of the nature of human nature as a prolegomenon to theorizing. The second, is the sociobiologists' effort to explain altruism in non-teleological terms; the third, the sociobiologists' sensitivity to and discussion of the prob lems of deception and self-deception as an important facet in the analysis of altruism. Each of these points requires closer scrutiny if it, and the possibilities each holds, are to be relevant to the social scientist. The nature of human nature, often called the "image" or "model" of man, has generated a recurring problem in social scientific theory (Cooley, 1964; Mills, 1960; Waalalefeit, 1974). The problem here is that social scientists have by and large examined human behavior without being explicit as to the nature of the entity being examined. Reliance upon John Locke's depiction of man as a "tabula rasa" or blank slate at birth has facilitated a social scientific image of man as entirely plastic or malleable. While this form of theorizing was compati ble with the liberal ideology and optimism of earlier social scientists, it did little to clear up the problem as to the nature of human nature. This lacuna, or blank slate at the core of social scientific theorizing has generated two problems. The first probes the question as to why all people, despite local differences in environment, culture, and even sub-culture hold cer tain behaviors in common. The second, written about by Dennis Wrong (1961) takes exception to the social scientific depiction of man as an empty vessel into which culture is poured by society. Wrong's exception to this image is that while this explains the congruence between the individual and his society, it does little to illuminate the origins of conflict, social change and disruption. HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 9 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1981-82</page><page sequence="10">41 The sociobiologists may be wrong, they may overstate their case, but in their approach to human altruism we have an explicit model of human nature. Humans, it is consistently argued, are egotistical. The biological propensity (genetically mediated) to maximize our genetic contribution to the future, our desire for prepayment of altruistic acts and our socialization of offspring in manners conducive to our inclusive fitness all address this egoism. Human nature, it is argued, at the level of "ultimate" explanation, is not dependent upon the idiosyncracies of a local environment, culture, or sub-culture (prox imate explanation), but is biologically rooted and inspired by "selfish genes" (Dawkins, 1976). The very explicitness of the sociobiological conception of human nature evokes a strong reaction. As social scientists it may be that we have in avoiding any consideration of "innate" biological limitations relied too heavily upon society, culture and environment to supply these limits. Homo sapiens are no doubt a product of their society; the sociobiologists however caution us that our society is not unrelated to our biological and genetic evolution. The caution is well founded. The difficulty here, however, is that the "assumptive" nature of the sociobiologists' model of human nature is often made to seem a scientific fact rather than a bold speculation. The sociobiologists also suggest that their perspective when married to the social sciences will lessen social scientists' reliance upon teleological explana tions (Barash, 1977; Chorover, 1979; Ghiselin, 1974; Wilson, 1978). Teleological—or goal— explanations are indeed very common in the social sciences (Brown, 1963; Harre and Secord, 1972). To the question, why are you reading this paper? a common reply might be: "in order" to advance my knowledge of the applicability of sociobiology to the social sciences. The goal in the explanation of your behavior is the "getting to" a self-perception of your having advanced your knowing. The problem in this is the "getting-to-a" oc curs later than the behavior it explains. However, a canon of scientific explana tion and one adhered to by the sociobiologists is that the explaining event must not occur after the occurrence of the event to be explained. So given the fact that science shuns final causes, it is clear, at least from this conception of science, that teleological explanations are inadequate. The sociobiologists claim with some, although not total, success that their explanation is non-teleological. In their explanation of altruism, motive, inten tion, and purposiveness are by and large irrelevant. The sociobiologists circum vent all aspects of minded behavior by building them into genetic selection (Searle, 1978). Altruism, explained sociobiologically, is determined or mediated by the persistence and survival of a gene or gene complex predisposing its HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 9 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1981-82</page><page sequence="11">42 bearer towards altruistic behavior. The intellectual ingenuity of this form of in quiry rests upon uncovering the rules governing the likelihood of the survival of this gene (gene complex) and secondarily in detailing the adaptive significance of the surviving behavior. Interestingly enough the adaptive significance, as in the economists' conception of the market place, occurs without being guided by the intentions of Homo sapiens. The benefit of this non-teleological form of explanation is, as we shall see in more detail, also a severe analytical limitation. Indeed using the explanatory paradigm of the sociobiologist one would as an advocate be forced into an nouncing that there really is no higher purpose in the writings of sociobiologists; they like all scientists are merely manifesting their possession of genes which maximize (hopefully) their inclusive fitness. This at some level may be true; at another it may seem both trivial and irrelevant. True to their ingenuity the sociobiologists do not duck the problem of why consciousness, culture and mind are poor cornerstones for the erection of solid science. Their response, put simply, is that a reliance upon mind, consciousness and culture is unreliable. These, it is argued, are susceptible to human decep tion and more importantly self-deception; an emphasis upon genetic selection, however, would circumvent this problem. In this position the sociobiologists can be alikened to psychological behaviorists. The former counsel the avoidance of consciousness and its concomitants as unreliable data and posit genes and their selection as a means of circumventing this avowed unreliability; the latter emphasize the avoidance of introspection and its concomitants and in lieu posit data gathered by the observation of overt behavior. What is of importance in the sociobiologists' case for the reliability of data from genetic selection is the manner in which their emphasis upon the sociobiology of deception and of self-deception can be useful to the social scientist. Deception, it is argued, can help the social scientist in understanding the evolution of the peculiarities of the human mind and culture, while self deception can sensitize social scientists to the problems inherent in phenomenological and self-reported data. Trivers' (1971) discussion of reciprocal altruism can bring us furthest in comprehending deception; Lockard's (1980) in understanding self-deception. The evolution of associations of mutual benefit, as in the case of reciprocal altruism, is easy to imagine if the favours are given and received simultaneous ly. This of course simulates symbiosis which is easily understood. But problems HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 9 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1981-82</page><page sequence="12">43 arise when, as is usually the case in Homo sapiens, there is a delay between the altruistic giving and its repayment. The problem here is one wherein the reci pient of a favour may be tempted to cheat and refuse to pay back. Genes which persist, as we recall, are those most capable of reproducing themselves. Cheater genes, like those for reciprocal altruism, then might be selected, for it is not hard to imagine how cheating, when successful, might increase inclusive fitness. Trivers (1971) suggests precisely this when he speculates how many of both the psychological characteristics and social control mechanisms of Homo sapiens have been shaped by the natural selection for the improved ability to cheat, to detect cheats and to avoid being thought of and treated as a cheat. Trivers speculatively posits a dialectical and developmental tension between the inclusive fitness perpetuated by cheating and that for engaging in cooperative exchange behaviors like reciprocal altruism. The contours of this dialectical process suggest that as genes for cheating are select, they will be reacted to. The momentum in this reaction is propelled by the fact that cheaters make both other cheaters and altruists vulnerable to diminishing inclusive fitness. It is argued that to counter this, Homo sapiens have developed (evolved) both a sensitivity to detect cheaters and mechanisms to prohibit this occurrence. However, as non-cheaters evolve a greater sensitivity to detect cheaters, cheaters through the process of natural selection, become more sub tle. A subtle cheat is one who appears to be reciprocating but who consistently pays back slightly less than he receives. It is even possible, Trivers (1971) sug gests, that man's enlarged brain, the importance he places upon reasoning, and his predisposition toward mathematical reasoning, evolved as mechanisms of ever more devious cheating, and ever more penetrating detection of cheating in others. Lockard (1977; 1980) takes Trivers' (1971) emphasis upon deception and cheating inwards in building upon Alexander's (1974; 1975; 1979) insight that natural selection may have consistently favoured tendencies for humans to be unaware of what they are really doing and why they are doing it. In Alexander's (1974) discussion of altruism borne of parental manipulation, one is made aware of the possibility that for parents' strategies to be successful, it may be important that they are unaware of the maxim of genetic maximization. To be successful in human sociality, as in socializing children, it is important that one be sincere. Moreover, this sincerity to be selected ought to be genuine. It is, Alexander argues, adaptive and thus not unlikely that as a concomitant of this genuineness, genes for self-deception will be selected. It is Alexander's premise that self-deception, mediated by genes, will increase HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 9 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1981-82</page><page sequence="13">44 rather than decrease the bearer's ability to replicate his genes. In sociological terms one might address this as the functions of ignorance or the social benefits of innocence. The sociobiologists go one further by speculating a likely scenario for the biological and genetic justification for these insights. Lockard (1977; 1978) shows how Alexander's speculative sociobiology, if correct, has implications for the practicing social scientist. If there is a natural selection for self-deception, one which cannot easily be unmasked by the analyst's search for clues to sincerity, then the phenomenological and self report data of a great deal of social science is suspect. If the sociobiologists are correct, personal accounts of phenomena may be genetically programmed strategies masking the genetic self interest of the participants. Taking this one step further to the entire gamut of proximate explanations, Lockard (1977; 1978) suggests that the apparent inconsonance of ultimate and proximate ex planations, as say in the (proximate) beneficient "motive" of the altruist and the (ultimate) genetic selfishness of extending help, is an extension of this self deception phenomena. These have evolved in such a manner that proximate ex planations like "being in love with one's spouse" or "caring for one's children" actually may be palliatives adopted to smooth over the conflict, manipulations and deceit mediated by a highly competitive, altering genetic sub-world. Limitations of Sociobiology A great deal of criticism, some of it valid, has been levelled at sociobiology. It may indeed reveal a normative, status quo orientation (Allen et al., 1976; Leacock, 1980; Rosenthal, 1977). It may serve as a justification for egoism in every day social affairs (Simon and Zegura, 1979; Wald, 1978) and may facilitate an emphasis on eugenics or gene control as the surest means of alleviating social, political and economic problems (Gould, 1980; Lewontin, 1979; Sahlins, 1977). These criticisms can not be ignored, but they do not ad dress an analysis of sociobiology on its own terms, that is on the promise its practitioners make to the social sciences. The promise, in a nutshell, is that sociobiology will provide a solidly scientific synthesis to the scientifically minded social scientist. The entire programme insofar as it portends to "sociobiologicize" the social sciences (Wilson, 1975) rests in its practitioners' promise to breathe new scien tific rigor into what they perceive as a rather weakly assembled intellectual HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS — VOL. 9 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1981-82</page><page sequence="14">45 community. The social scientists' weaknesses, it is argued, stem from their neglect of the neo-Darwinian advances in evolutionary theory. It is further argued that this neglect is due either to social scientists' disinterest or worse a social scientific longing for a creationist's perspective with Homo sapiens as the new steward of a lingering theology. Indeed, to the sociobiologists, the social scientists' insistence upon the uniqueness of humans and the placement of this premise at the heart of the social sciences, is evidence of this lingering theology. Within the perspective of the sociobiologist this implicit theology is not light ened by labelling it scientific humanism. In this sense, the sociobiologists perceive themselves as hard nosed scientists coming to harden those of their colleagues specializing in the social aspects of human behavior. The hardening involves two lessons. Social scientists must abandon the belief that the study of Homo sapiens can fruitfully proceed divorced from a comparative analysis of the social life of another species. Se cond, that in accepting lesson one, the social scientist ought to avail himself of the long term certitude possible in examining the gene and its selection over time as the ultimate cause of the much more proximate concerns of the typical social scientist. Lesson one, the need for social scientists to broaden their focus and learn from the social worlds of other species, is one which when stated broadly would meet infrequent opposition by social scientists. Stated broadly, lesson one sug gests that animal studies can sensitize social scientists to issues and ideas which may be difficult to perceive in humans, moreover these ideas can be tested upon humans acting in their social worlds. This "gestalt" emphasis upon all social life rather than only human is already an important theme in comparative psychology, ethology and pigeon dependent behavioral psychology. The fre quency of opposition to this position increases as its proponents suggest that social science can be reduced to some aspect of neurology, bio-chemistry or genetics. The reaction is, I believe, more than territorial. It is based upon the belief that it is highly likely that you can "explain" your reading of this paper by trac ing the particular firing of the neurons governing your reading behavior. This "level" of explanation is not false, indeed under the tenets of experimental replicability it may be more accurate than an explanation which seeks to pro vide your perception of your motive as a function of culture. Moreover, the em phasis upon neurons may serve as an analytic bridge joining animals (as neuron holders) to Homo sapiens. But the explanation of reading behavior as neuro biological (and correct at this level) does little to quell the desire to "make sense" which motivates the social scientist. HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 9 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1981-82</page><page sequence="15">46 The sociobiologists in their movement from lesson one to lesson two counter the same sort of opposition a social scientist would have to the "neuro biologicization" of the social science. The problem here is not dealt with ade quately by labelling it "reductionism" and casting it aside. The problem in lesson two is compounded by the conundrum sociobiologists produce in pro mising scientific solidity and certitude and yet achieving this by speculation and not empirical testing. The chief limitation in sociobiology is that in combining lesson one and two it does not achieve the scientific solidity it promises to the social sciences. It fails on three important points. First, sociobiology is a speculative framework hav ing no empirical support for its root assumption—the relationship between gene and such human behaviors as altruism, homosexuality and dominance. Se cond, the sociobiologists use of the "hypothetical deductive" method is not beyond reproach. Third, the sociobiologists' faith in "ultimate" explanation may mask a theology of its own. A look at each of these limitations in more detail is necessary. Sociobiology, despite its promise of scientific solidity and long-term cer titude, is a speculative framework. Using altruism as an example of sociobiological explanation it is vital to note that the sociobiologists begin by asking the question—what if? ... . The explanation for sociobiological altruism must be understood and read as "let's suppose" that altruistic behavior is mediated by, or is in some manner determined by, genes. If this is so, then what we know about genetic selection within the context of neo Darwinian evolution must apply to the gene for altruism. The sociobiologists then note that since this explanation is more parsimonious and solidly scientific than alternate ones, it makes an important contribution to knowledge. The "let's suppose" origin of sociobiology is soon lost in fascinating discus sions of the scientifically approved theory of neo-Darwinian evolution. The issue here, and I believe it has often been confounded, is not that the neo Darwinian theory of evolution is incorrect but that the sociobiologists attempt to employ it to uncover complex social behavior that far outrun the existing empirical data. There is no proof whatsoever that genes or super genes are related to such complex social behaviors as altruism. Indeed, a clutch of theorists dispute the ease with which the sociobiologists make this assumption (Baldwin and Baldwin, 1980; Bock, 1980; Burian, 1978; Gould, 1980; Kauffman, 1976; Sahlins, 1977). Richard Lewontin, an eminent geneticist, draws upon recent ad vances in genetics when he notes that at this time there is "not a vestige of HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 9 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1981-82</page><page sequence="16">47 evidence that any of the human traits sociobiologists talk about have any genetic basis" (1977:15). Stephan Jay Gould, a biologist and author of Ever Since Darwin: Reflections in Natural History (1977), has unequivocally rejected the existence of any "direct evidence for genetic control of specific human social behavior" (1977:254). Important in this context is that the speculative nature of the sociobiology programme is not denied by its proponents. A close reading of Wilson's book devoted to "human" sociobiology reveals him noting that "it will soon be within our power to identify many of the genes that influence behavior" (1978:46). David Barash also hedges his analysis when turning to humans noting that "this territory is almost entirely unexplored, the approach in this chapter will be frankly speculative, suggesting some direct application of the principles of sociobiology to a new species, ourselves" (Barash, 1977:277). The fact is that there is no clear empirical proof. Wilson's suggestion that we are within a whisker's breadth of confirming and identifying the gene-social behavior relationship is not at all a commonly held view (Baerends, 1980; Barlow, 1980). Moreover, Barash's reasoning that ours is a "new" species, hence studied only speculatively by sociobiologists seems to sidestep his own assertion that sociobiology proceeds with a genotypic rather than phenotypic analysis. Human genes are not new. While a speculative theory which purports to lend scientific solidity to other fields is only slightly paradoxical, it becomes more so when it chooses a method of analysis based on eliminative deduction. The sociobiologists officially espouse the hypothetical deductive method. This method, used quite suc cessfully by Charles Darwin works on the principle of strong inference (Burian, 1978; Ghiselin, 1969; Wilson, 1975). This methodology, intended for applica tion to all sciences, requires one to do one's best from a disintereted position to enumerate all the possible explanations which might account for a given phenomenon; once done, to conduct tests to eliminate those explanations which are proven false. In the best of all possible worlds complete success in us ing this procedure would yield one uneliminated explanation. This remaining explanation can then be provisionally accepted, albeit with the stipulation that if and when a better explanation can successfully challenge the explanatory ef ficacy of the former, it then will legitimately replace it. The sociobiological adherence to this procedure not only falls short of the conditions explicit in the "best of all worlds," but falters even in approx imating this form. This of course does not suggest that the hypothetical deduc tive method is not relevant; it does however suggest that for a theory to claim HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 9 NO. 1 - FALL/WINTER 1981-82</page><page sequence="17">48 this relevance it must adhere to the method. The sociobiologists however, despite stating an observance of this method, depart from it in two distinct ways. First, the sociobiologists unequivocally set out to build a case for the neo Darwinian synthesis and not to examine alternate explanations. Indeed, not only is it difficult to perceive the sociobiologists as disinterested participants in the analysis of alternate explanation, it behooves careful readers to find a sociobiological examination of alternatives. The existence of alternative ex planations in "human" sociobiology, those expressing culture and "proximate" mechanisms are suggested, but by and large set aside by cursorily noting that these can be subsumed once we clearly comprehend the "ultimate" or neo-Darwinian explanation of the phenomena. This avoidance of the serious examination of alternate explanations can clearly be seen in the sociobiological explanation of altruism. The sociobiologists take a term usually used to define the motivations attributed to a helpful and relatively dangerous act, redefine it in terms of genetic conse quences, and then claim to show the fallacy or misplaced emphasis in the nor mal everyday use of altruism. The problem here, of course, is that the sociobiologists don't examine the everyday definition of altruism. Motives for the altruistic act are not examined but are dispensed with. This failure to examine alternate explanations, the rather simple designation of these as "pro ximate" and hence less relevant than sociobiological alternatives will be ex amined more closely in the discussion of the third limitation of sociobiology when applied to the social sciences. The second manner in which the sociobiologists violate the method of strong inference rests in the fashion in which they state their theory. It is, on the whole, nonfalsifiable. This nonfalsifiability renders it impossible to eliminate the sociobiological explanation. The nonfalsifiability stems from two issues. First, the theory is stated in terms which defy easy testing. Second, the inclusive-maximizing genetics underlying sociobiological explanation is so powerful it can account for "all" even contradictory social behavior. This power, at first glance seems to commend the theory; upon second it establishes that the explanations of sociobiologists are irrefutable. The lexicon of the sociobiologists is replete with a highly combustible mixture of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic concepts. The use of metaphor, while sound poetry and adequate exploratory theorizing is poor in generating testable science. This use of metaphor occurs as a consequence of the sociobiologists in sistence on lumping the social behaviors of all species under one rubric. Indeed, HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 8 NO. 2 - SPRING/SUMMER 1981</page><page sequence="18">49 the existence of genes and moreover the speculation that these mediate the social behavior of all species does not necessarily mean that language, even scientific language has "evolved" to that point at which the social behavior of different species can easily be placed under the same label. Either language or science, but most likely both, suffer. Instances of this fallacy of dissimilar aggregation abound in the work of sociobiologists. Altruistic behavior is applied to such distinct "behaviors" as foregoing reproduction in sterile castes of insects, the feeding of the adults of certain wasps by their larvae and the evolution of reduced virulence of myxoma viruses (Barash, 1977; Wilson, 1975). Xenophobic behavior, as mediated by xenophic genes, is seen in behaviors of ants, lions, Canadian geese and Homo sapiens (Wilson, 1975). Moreover, the sociobiologists link it to both "the will to power" and "social inertia" (Wilson, 1975: 287). The problems implied here are of two types. First a myriad of different covert behaviors are identified under one name, making operationalization and verification difficult. Second ly, the behaviors so lumped are often herded together under unstated and unclear rules. As an instance of this use of metaphor without the clear specification of rules one can turn to the classic example, "slavery" in ants. In ants, "slave making" species capture the immature ants of other species and bring them to their nests. When the captured workers hatch, they perform housekeeping tasks with no compulsion as if they were members of the captor species. This metaphor, from Homo sapien "slavery" to ant "slavery," is used frequently but the rules for its usage, especially in scientific analysis, are not at all clear. Why, for instance, if one wanted to preserve this cross-species metaphor, is this behavior in ants called "slave-making" not "domestication"? Human slavery, it can be argued, involves first, members of one's own species, second, continual compulsion and third, the slave as an article of exchange, a commodity in the economic market. As such, slavery is a human economic institution; it has little to do with ants, except by cross-species metaphor. To the sociobiologist, these are much more than weak cross-species metaphors. They are mediated by genes which, according to the sociobiologist, are at some level equatable across species. The problem for a scientist interested in the potential falsifiability of the theory is that these cross-species analogies have no clearly articulated logic. Without this it is not possible to test whether or not Wilson's attribution of barter (1975:551), division of labour (1975:298), culture (1975:559), ritual (1975:560) and esthetics (1975:564) to animals are at all sensible, needed, and most importantly reveal more than they mask. HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS — VOL. 8 NO. 2 — SPRING/SUMMER 1981</page><page sequence="19">50 Further, when one examines the issue of the falsifiability of sociobiology in more depth one may agree with Midgely (1978; 1980:34) that the air of scientific purity about sociobiology is more a function of its insistence upon quantifica tion than upon the rigors of testable conceptual analysis. Midgely and others (Burian, 1978; Gould, 1980; Sahlins, 1977; Searle, 1978) feel that while the sociobiological explanation of sociality as a product of inclusive fitness max imizing may be true and quantifiable, it is also scientifically quite meaningless. The lack of scientific meaning arises because the tenet of genetic maximization like its economic cousin the rule of utility maximization can be used to explain everything. Rules of maximization are exceedingly amenable to quantification but often lacking in conceptual and "predictive" usefulness. The problem is that rules of maximization tend to be enveloped in circular reasoning. The cir cularity in the utility theory of economics arises because within its explanatory scope we choose the alternative which maximizes our utility, and whichever alternative we select has maximum utility. In one sense utility theory explains everything but in another (predictive) sense it explains nothing. The theory of evolution by natural selection which is really a theory of max imizing genetic fitness presents the same problem as the utility theory of economics. The circularity arises because the social behavior to be explained (e.g. altruism) is knowable only in terms of its mediating genes (e.g. altruistic genes) and the mediating genes are knowable only in terms of the social behavior it mediates. The problem here is in verifying the circularity of these premises and in applying them predictively. Thus, the very fact that one perceives the existence and ubiquity of a behavior establishes the fact that it has evolved by the natural selection of its genetic mediators. Those behaviors which have not persisted, hence are unobservable but known to have existed, have not been selected. Put simply, all that is was selected, and all that isn't, wasn't. This of course is difficult to refute, moreover it is hard to imagine this insight, with our present knowledge of genetics, leading to a predictive science. It is precisely this explanatory malleability, this everything but nothing facet of sociobiological explanation which enables it to envelop both the selfish and selfless aspect of human altruism. As Mazur notes, "one can supply a plausible selection mechanism, indeed several mechanisms, for most kinds of behaviour that are observed, as well as for most kinds of behavior that are not observed" (1976:99). This ad hoc explanatory reasoning while conducive to the display of creative story-telling (Gould, 1980) makes it extremely difficult to refute sociobiological explanations. Explanations that can not be proven wrong are, of course, not particularly solid paragons of scientific status. Mazur captures HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 8 NO. 2 - SPRING/SUMMER 1981</page><page sequence="20">51 this difficulty well in his efforts to pin the sociobiological explanation of altruism to the test. He writes Suppose that men, when on long trips, typically invited their brothers to copulate with their wives. We could 'explain' this by saying that the hus band's genetic fitness was being maximized, in effect by the efforts of his brother, who carries most of the same genes. This is precisely the mechanism of 'kin selection' which Wilson invokes to explain the evolu tion of altruism. If men typically pimped for their wives, this too could be explained, since the profits of prostitution would help sustain the pimp, his mate, and his offspring—all maximizing the male's genetic fitness (Mazur, 1976:699). The problem here is not that sociobiology is a poorer theory than many in the social sciences, rather that the sociobiologists' proclamation of scientific solid ity as their contribution to the social sciences is not as apparent as one might ex pect. Undeniably the programme is quantifiable, its claim to scientific solidity must however rest upon firmer ground. The firmer ground that the sociobiologists claim for their programme rests in their assertion that ultimate explanations, those probing the origins and evolu tionary development of phenomena, subsume and hence are superior to prox imate explanations (Alexander, 1979; Barash, 1977; Wilson, 1975; 1978). The sociobiologists have a point; it is however not nearly as sharp or useful as one is led to believe in reading sociobiology. The point is, and it is vital to their case, that in using the sociobiological em phasis upon ultimate explanation it is possible to explain more phenomena within the scope of one explanation than is possible in relying upon proximate explanations. This "more from less" view is often invoked within the scientific tenet of "parsimony." Within the rules of proclaiming your theory as more parsimonious than another it is important to clearly identify the contender and more importantly that both theories explain the same phenomena. Sociobiology falls short here on both counts. It is not clear, at least in my reading of sociobiology, which social scientific theories, if not all of them, the sociobiologists seek to better by moving analysis to ultimate explanation. But perhaps of greater importance, while it is true that all ultimate explanations subsume all proximate explanations, it is far less evi dent that all sociobiological explanations subsume all social scientific explana tions. As an instance of an ultimate explanation, one probing the origins and development of phenomena, one can look to the creationists' explanation in HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 8 NO. 2 — SPRING/SUMMER 1981</page><page sequence="21">52 Genesis. This—in the beginning was consciousness explanation—subsumes an explanation of all social phenomena. It is parsimonious. It lends certitude to those seeking explanation and has never been refuted particularly on its own terms. True, it has a speculative link, that between the Almighty and the social behaviors we seek to explain, but this initial speculation one might argue is not, "at some level," unlike the gene/social behavior speculation asserted by the sociobiologist. But, one might insist, sociobiology is scientific not theological; it uses con temporary investigatory techniques and its practitioners deliberately set out their premises in clearly operational and falsifiable terms. While this is hopeful ly true, it is not relevant to the analogy. What is relevant is that ultimate ex planations, those portending to explain the origins and development of phenomena, are of all types. In itself the fact that an explanation is stated in "ultimate" terms in no way guarantees that it is correct, useful, or even scien tific. Moreover, the particular "ultimate" explanation of the sociobiologists suf fers an added problem; this is that it is not clear that this explanation has been "shown" to subsume proximate explanations of human sociality. This lack of demonstrative proof becomes clearer in looking at the relationship between ultimate and proximate explanations in the sociobiology of altruism. There are two basic questions one can ask in investigating altruism; one prox imate, the other ultimate. Each presents a distinct problem. There is first, the issue of selfishness, or the lack of it, in human life, which is essentially a prob lem of motive. It runs, "Can a conscious agent deliberately choose to do things for others which he or she thinks will be of no personal benefit?" This problem demands an answer which recreates the altruists' understanding of the situation and his or her part in it. It is an answer seeking to recreate the altruists' understanding of what factors accounted for his or her behavior. Second, there is the sociobiological question about the evolution of altruistic behavior, which runs, "Can a species which engages in behaviors for others, at its expense, sur vive and thus preserve that behavior?" This question is one of an external focus calling for the respondent to think in terms of hundreds of thousands of years and in terms of entire species. The sociobiologists argue that their response to their question subsumes the answer to the one they don't pose, nor show any interest in. Thus genetic selec tion of altruistic gene(s), be it by kinship, reciprocity, or parental manipulation, subsumes the answer to the question of human motive. But, in what sense? The answer here is that the sociobiologists subsume the proximate question of HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 8 NO. 2 - SPRING/SUMMER 1981</page><page sequence="22">53 motive building it into the gene. Individuals are "really" unaware of what motivates their altruism. If you ask them, they'll be wrong or at least unaware of the stronger more compelling genetic reason. This of course is the ultimate sociobiological explanation. It subsumes the proximate by noting that if the answer to the ultimate question is as they suggest, the answer to the proximate one, although by and large an uninteresting one, must follow. But does it? Do altruists have selfish motives? The sociobiologist would and should answer that motive is unimportant. If you persisted he would respond as Dawkins (1976) and Ghiselin (1974) that altruism is mediated by selfish genes. If you still per sisted and asked if altruist X possessed selfish genes as those mediating his altruistic act the sociobiologist would and should respond that he cannot answer this. All the sociobiologist can tell you in your continued persistence is that altruism which persists from generation to generation has followed the tenets of inclusive fitness. That altruism which doesn't, and the incidence of altruist X may be of just that sort, will not. The ultimate explanation of the sociobiologist does not neatly subsume the proximate problem. It can sensitize one to issues; it can deal with interesting longitudinal occurrences but cannot easily help us as social scientists to cope with the immediate problem of a gangland slaying, a corporate merger, or a municipality's effort to annex a neighbouring town. Each of these can be linked to the genetic adaptiveness of territorial behavior in our forebearers and this may be correct but it cannot help us as social scientists in our "here and now" efforts to make sense of and ameliorate the series of problems we confront in our daily social life. CONCLUSION Sociobiology is a youthful, perhaps overstated theory, but one potentially useful in sensitizing social scientists to the biological factors which over time have and will continue, to some degree, to shape human sociality. Sociobiology is a speculative framework. It is less clearly scientific than it is quantifiable. It cavalierly subsumes proximate explanations beneath the ultimate genetic um brella of natural selection. Difficulties emerge here because the sociobiologists, who readily admit that they know little of social science (Wilson, 1975), wave away vital human aspects of sociality in their effort to provide a clearer image of social science; one vested with a greater degree of certainty. Clarity and cer uude are usually possible when one is willing to abandon the complex welter of HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 8 NO. 2 - SPRING/SUMMER 1981</page><page sequence="23">54 contradictory information involved in treating Homo sapiens as conscious pur poseful organisms. The analysis of human behavior as "rule guided behavior" is not new. The sociobiologists however have noted that the duty of the social scientist is to discover these rules in the evolution or selection of genes (which mediate behavior) over time. This is new. These insights, methods and speculations, despite their limitations, are in triguing. They, or parts therein, are increasingly being applied within the creative periphery of the social scientific community. In political science one can note a youthful but burgeoning effort at conceptualizing the bio-politics of genetic self-interest (Masters, 1975; Pennock and Chapman, 1977; Somit, 1976). In sociology Van den Berghe (1978) has explored the explanatory powers of sociobiology, probing with particular usefulness into potential contribution to the sociology of the family (Van den Berghe, 1979; 1980; and Barash, 1977). In psychology, Donald Campbell (1975), in his presidential address to the American Psychological Association, reported on sociobiology as one of the possible means of hastening the inculcation of an evolutionary perspective into psychology. While in anthropology, the social science predicted by sociobiologists as potentially the most receptive to sociobiology (Wilson, 1977), contributors like Barkow (1978; 1980) and Chagnon and Irons (1979) have probed the sociobiological insight on kinship and natural selection. The marriage between biology and the social sciences is still in its planning stage. The development of critical tests both empirical and pragmatic are yet to come. When they do, we can move either into an acceptance of the sociobiological paradigm as one way of doing social science or reject this paradigm as another wishful reduction of social life to simpler more predictable but not entirely helpful units of analysis.
