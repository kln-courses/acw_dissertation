<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION on Tertullian is particularly noteworthy, for it corrects the false picture so often entertained of Tertullian as an anti-intellectualist (credo quia impossibile); after presenting in fascinating de- tail Tertullian's conception of natural law, Lovejoy speaks of him as "less an Early Father of the Latin Church than an Early Father of the deism of the I7th-I8th centuries, a pre- cursor of Herbert of Cherbury, Toland, Tindal, and Voltaire." Tertullian is shown also to possess kinship with the modern deists in his inclusion of the right of individual freedom in matters of religion among the dictates of the law of nature. This sort of parallelism in the his- tory of ideas is nowhere more impressively il- lustrated by Lovejoy than in his study of "The Parallel of Deism and Classicism," where he shows that deism is simply the application of the basic presuppositions of classicism (and the Enlightenment) to the sphere of religion. These presuppositions are formulated with remark- able clarity and cogency under nine captions: uniformitarianism, rationalistic individualism, the appeal to the "consensus gentium," cos- mopolitanism, antipathy to "enthusiasm" and originality, intellectual equalitarianism, ration- alistic anti-intellectualism, rationalistic primi- tivism, and a negative philosophy of history. The author's practice may not achieve the scope he desiderates for the complete "historiog- raphy of ideas" in its search for the unit-ideas of cultural history and their more significant com- binations, a study which (he says) ideally should draw upon the disciplines of the history of philosophy, the history of science, folklore and some parts of ethnography, some parts of the history of language (especially semantics), the history of religious beliefs and theological doctrines, literary history, comparative litera- ture, the history of the other arts, economic his- tory and the history of economic theory, the history of education, political and social his- tory, and the sociology of knowledge. Nor does his theory here come to terms explicitly with the similar discipline of "human studies" as conceived by Wilhelm Dilthey and his like. That is to say, Lovejoy's conception calls for an as yet unrealized co-operation among the practitioners of all the disciplines. But Love- joy's accomplishment is exceedingly impressive; and it points the way. JAMES LUTHER ADAMS Meadville Theological School Christianity and History. By HERBERT BUTTER- FIELD. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, I950. I46 pages. $2.75. Profiting by the rigorous limitations of broadcasting time on the B.B.C., Professor Butterfield has with remarkable brevity and clarity set forth what is probably the most valuable contribution of any professional his- torian to the current literature of this topic. He proceeds from the conventional, but to this re- viewer still problematical, distinction between "technical history" and interpretation. The for- mer consists simply in literary detective in- quiry, ever sifting evidence to clarify events and relations which must be valid alike to Jesuit and Marxist, "what we might almost call the mechanism of the historical process." This mechanism only gains meaning when combined with the interpretation based on some religious faith, but such interpretations are not to be made, proved, or disproved by the academic his- torian. The educational role of academic history is thus reduced to that of a technical auxiliary, since, as the author himself inclines to believe, no "part of history has been properly appro- priated . . until it has been knit into one fabric continuous with our inner experience." One reason for the sharpness of this disjunc- tion of "history" and interpretation may be the fact that the author thinks of history primarily in terms of war and international relations. He does concede that "the work of Dante, the genius of Beethoven, the documented spiritual experiences of the saints" belong to the technical historian's world, yet he does not seem to regard the implications of this concession for the method of academic history. His matured re- flections derive from meditation on the long record of politics, in which he notes certain apologetic footholds for the Christian. His study is an apologetic addressed to the academic historian. He observes, for instance, that professional historians are often considered to tend to cyni- cism. They tend, that is, to a view of human nature much less optimistic than that current today and much closer to Christian realism. The historian is more likely to discern that civilization differs from barbarism only in the disciplining of institutions which "make human nature better than it really is" and which can be sloughed off at any time very rapidly. He will be inclined to conceive of an economic order as a means of domesticating ineradicable cupidity. 58</page><page sequence="2">CRITICAL REVIEWS He will be inclined to agree with the classic maxims of diplomacy that a balance of power is the best hope of international order and decency and that "for moral reasons human beings are incapable of permanently establishing a system of human relations on this earth such as can go on indefinitely without resort to violence." The study of the history of human politics, in short, supplies overwhelming evidence for the thesis that all men are sinners. Even the non-Christian historian, again, will be disposed to see that there is a moral factor in history, a kind of nemesis or judgment which brings ruin on the successive states or systems of human life as they prove unable to meet moral demands. If men were good enough, neither the ancient city-state, nor the medieval order of things, nor modern nationalism, nor humanism, nor liberalism, nor democracy would ever face bankruptcy. The systems were good enough, but sooner or later "the gravitational pull in human nature" has brought them to destruction. Nor can we single out particularly evil persons in history. Butterfield considers that we normally underestimate the influence of conditions in determining men's actions in his- tory and that the great crises, like the Reforma- tion or the French Revolution, have followed patterns wholly unexpected and undesired by those most influential in initiating them. Judg- ment falls on the system for a guilt endemic in humanity and diffused beyond tracing. Such a conception is still far less than a Christian view but does afford a point of leverage for Christian apologetic among those influenced by reflection on history. The non-Christian may even accept the notion of vicarious suffering as a means of comprehending the patent inequities of histori- cal success and failure and of actualizing a more inclusive solidarity. Another conviction common to historians which runs counter to popular views is the in- sight that each generation must be viewed in its own right. For technical reasons the historian will reject notions of progress which find the meaning of a past generation in what its suc- cessors have derived from it. As Ranke put it, each generation is equidistant from eternity. Or, from another aspect, the real values are not in the systems which may be transmitted but in the persons who lived within the systems and states. The professional historian is thus often closer to Christian personalism than are those moderns who try to think of history in natural- istic categories, mechanical or biological, and lose persons in the species or the process. Even the secular historian, lastly, finds rea- son to incline to a providential view of the his- torical process. Much of his labors are devoted to tracing out the "history-making which goes on, so to speak, over our heads," the momentous unplanned changes brought about by countless individuals pursuing their own business or in- terests. In the attempt to grasp the nature of this process the historian must use symbols or myths-the cycle, the organism, the mecha- nism, the Marxian dialectic, "renaissances," "challenge and response." It is the necessity of such "myths," incidentally, which makes the present reviewer skeptical of Butterfield's defi- nition of the "technical historian." Of these myths, Butterfield argues, none is sufficiently flexible save a frankly anthropomorphic myth, which sees the process as if presided over by a living mind with a continual capacity to read- just, a composer working out his symphony as it is played. The other "myths" lead to false infer- ences about the fixity of structure and to illu- sions about man's capacity to manipulate the process. There are practical political maxims correla- tive with these general views on the nature of the human drama. Butterfield considers that the last generation or so "gambled very highly on what was an over-optimistic view of the charac- ter of man" and that we are still in danger of succumbing to the "messianic hoax" of just one more war to end all wars, in pursuit of the apoc- alyptic folly of "freedom from fear." "It is es- sential not to have faith in human nature." And the greatest political wisdom and chief virtue to be derived from history is elasticity: "Hold to Christ, and for the rest, be totally uncommit- ted." We of the West are now in danger of fall- ing into the pose of frightened defenders of the status quo like Metternich and of aligning Christianity as such against the cause of Russia and the disinherited. The fundamental issue, he argues, is not ideological but the chronic inter- national situation of "Hobbesian fear," in which we would still be caught if we confronted a "Christian" czarist Russia. The cruelties and degradations of recent history are not to be at- tributed to communism or nationalism so much as to the solvent effect of war itself on all civilization and decency. We should keep the moral element out of war so far as possible and 59</page><page sequence="3">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION seek limited objectives in war rather than rising in righteousness against "aggression." As to religion itself, Butterfield is critical, perhaps too much so, of what he calls the "ec- clesiastical view of history." He expresses grave doubts as to the alleged contribution of Chris- tianity to the ending of ancient slavery, or the rise of modern toleration, democracy, or social justice, or even the modern ideal of personality. He notes that "the world" has often been moral- ly right against ecclesiastical authority. "The most moving spectacle that history presents," on the other hand, is the spiritual work done by humble men for fifteen hundred years inculcat- ing humility, confession, and charity, for the one sin that locks people in all their other sins and renders them wholly inflexible is self- righteousness. In the most fundamental sense Christianity alone attacks this seat of evil and thereby changes the whole texture of human history. JAMES HASTINGS NICHOLS Federated Theological Faculty University of Chicago William Law: A Study in Literary Craftsman- ship. By HENRI TALON. New York: Harper &amp; Bros., I949. io6 pages. $2.00. No writer on William Law fails to note his stylistic excellence. Mr. Talon has compressed into a very small volume a careful study of Law's literary craftsmanship. He has done this in constant consciousness of the interrelation- ship of thought and expression. Thus the book is at once an introduction to the ideas of Law- though no exhaustive description of any book is given-and an analysis of style. And this is as it should be, especially in the case of a man like Law. For, while he was conscious of trying to write well, he was also ever concerned to say something. What Talon brings out with per- suasiveness is that what he said determined how he said it. And, inasmuch as Law was the sort of man he was, with a mental development marked into definite periods, the parallel study of the evolution of thought and of expression is interesting and instructive. Law's early writings show him as "logician and wit." "Brief sentences, packed with short words, follow one another at once briskly and firmly" (p. I5). "The value of his style lies in its accuracy, in its close adherence to his ideas, which is precisely the criterion for good prose" (p. 23). The works of Law's second period, which include the Christian Perfection and the Serious Call, furnish material for "a study in the art of persuasion." Law's reasonableness con- tinues to express itself and to determine his presentation. "Innumerable sentences begin with 'if"' (p. 32). But character-painting presses upon the imagination what reason alone would not. Law's limitations in thought and in literary expression here become evident; his in- terests are circumscribed. Law's final group of writings bear the impress of his study of Jacob Boehme. But he did not take over his master's obscurity of style. He takes over, almost entirely, a myth; he gains a deep feeling for nature. His clarity remains. But his sentences are generally longer than they had been, "his irony is now generally subdued." "But the most striking characteristic of Law's late style is its combined breadth and music" (pp. I9 f.). Mysticism brought him at least to the verge of poetry. GEORGE GORDH Wittenberg und Byzanz: Zur Begegnung und Auseinandersetzung der Reformation und der istlichorthodoxen Kirche. By ERNST BENZ. Marburg: Elwert-Grafe und Unzer Verlag, I949. 288 pages. This work is not concerned with the larger issues of the contact between Lutheranism and orthodoxy but contains eight essays on special topics of varying interest and importance. The first deals with the overtures made by Antonius Eparchos to Melanchthon to induce the latter to ignore religious differences and concentrate upon a united European front against the Turks in the Balkans. Eparchos is not an unknown figure, and his correspondence, including his letter to Melanchthon, has been published. He was born in Corfu in I492, stud- ied in Venice, and through the influence of his distinguished kinsman, Jan Lascaris, became director of the Greek academy at Milan in I520. He later returned to Venice as a teacher and then became a professor at the Greek academy on Corfu. When the Turks attacked the island, Eparchos and his family returned to Venice, where he established a private school. Eparchos was deeply concerned with the Turkish problem. In his student days at Venice, Arsenius Apostolos had attempted to convert him to Roman Catholicism and had convinced 6o</page></plain_text>
