<plain_text><page sequence="1">CERAMIC CLUES: Art History in the Gongola Valley MARLA C. BERNS n the Gongola Valley of northeastern Nigeria a mosaic of ethnic groups pro- duces a wealth of ceramic art - domes- tic, ritual, and sacred. The area is domi- nated by the Gongola River and its main tributary, the Hawal. Primarily a rugged, upland zone, it has long sheltered the historical evolution of decentralized groups and has provided refuge from Sudanic imperialism, including that of the Kanuri and later the Fulani. Even today, the peoples of this area remain less influenced by external factors than are many others in Nigeria. Since the history of the Upper Benue-Gongola Val- ley was regarded as peripheral to major Blu Boka *GomiTb Dingai* Ga'andaTown Gom 'BENA GANADA .

The results of field work over the past twenty years has revealed the richness of the region's terracotta arts, whose scope and variety match its ethnic and linguis- tic diversity.' The main question driving my field investigations was: how can the forms, functions and distribution of ceramic arts in the Gongola Valley con- tribute to a reconstruction of the region's history, about which virtually nothing prior to the colonial period is known? My methodology took into account multiple categories of information in addition to art and material culture - linguistics, geography, ethnography, and oral his- tory. Lacking, unfortunately, was evi- dence from archaeological reconnais- sance or excavations, which would seem to promise much in a region where ceramic arts are predominant and where peoples have migrated to and settled in remote and rugged hillside outposts for at least the past 500-1,000 years (an ap- proximation drawn from the degree of regional language diversification). By virtue of their permanence, terracottas have the potential to shed light on his- tory here as they have elsewhere in West Africa. Probing the relationship between northeastern Nigerian ceramics and the corpus of archaeological terracottas from the Lake Chad Basin about 300 kilomet- ers away is central to unlocking regional history. Excavations at Daima, on the Ni- gerian side of the lake, showed that ter- racotta anthropomorphic figurines be- came prominent after the eleventh cen- tury A.D., with zoomorphic sculpture appearing much earlier (Connah 1976: 339). Despite the importance of this evi- dence, my research priority has been to explore carefully how terracotta arts provide clues about more recent histori- cal developments in the Gongola Valley before tackling continuities or connec- tions that are much more broadly drawn over time and space and that are far more difficult to delimit and defend without hard archaeological data. In light of the absence of archaeologi- cal and written resources, the distribu- tion of languages in the region is re- garded as the most reliable guideline for reconstructing historical relationships.2 Northeastern Nigeria is dominated by Chadic language speakers of the Afro- Asiatic family who at some point in the distant past dispersed from a commo a base near Lake Chad. In the Lower Gon - gola Valley, such Chadic groups coex st with a variety of Adamawa-speak ?rs who belong to the Niger-Congo fair ily. According to principles of lingui;tic geography set forth by J.A. Ballard (1971:295-96), the distribution of these languages suggests that Chadic groups migrating from the east penetrated and interrupted what was probably a con- 48</page><page sequence="2">tinuous and highly differentiated belt of indigenous Adamawa occupation across the Upper Benue Valley: "Where a group is assumed to have migrated in a particu- lar direction [Chadic], we find that there are peoples of another linguistic group scattered on the periphery or otherwise divided by them. In each case these sep- arated or peripheral groups [Adamawa] have a much higher degree of internal linguistic differentiation than the inter- venors, and we can draw a further infer- ence that the divided groups were prior inhabitants of the general area."3 This reading of the language map implies that not only are groups with previously dis- tinct ancestries and cultures now sharing the same territory, but that their arts may be expected to reflect these distinctions as well as provide clues about the nature of historical interaction among them. There is a general consensus, as indi- cated above, that language relationships 2. TULA SHRINE VESSEL (BEJI) USED IN ANNUAL HARVEST FESTIVALS. MARCH 1982. 1.

Instead, the con- crete primary data, or artifacts in situ, must be analyzed within, and not be dis- sociated from, the complex social and cultural framework in which they have functioned over time. The use of fired clay containers to ob- jectify and thereby facilitate contact with spirit forces is pervasive in northeastern provide the most dependable evidence for historical reconstruction in Africa in the absence of written records. However, linguists agree that "it cannot be taken for granted that people who speak the same or related languages have a com- mon historical origin" (Newman 1969/ 70:217). In other words, although lin- guistic evidence may serve as the most reliable guideline for investigating his- tory, it still needs to be cross-checked against similar patterns of relatedness in oral traditions, ethnography, archaeol- ogy, and art production in order to dis- tinguish relationships based on common ancestry or intergroup contact. Thus, a study of ceramic art distributed across a region can reveal information about in- teractions between neighboring groups that may confirm or refute hypotheses based on language alone. Yet, it must be 5. YUNGUR SHRINE WITH POTS (WI/SO) FOR CONTAINING THE SPIRITS OF MALE ELDERS OF THE LOCAL LINEAGE OF CHIEFS WHO DID NOT ATTAIN THE STATUS OF HIGH OFFICE (AMWAPA). MAY 1981. 6.

Nigeria, although anthropomorphiza- tion in such terracotta vessels is most highly developed among Lower Gon- gola peoples (see Figs. 1-6). They are generally used for ancestral or tutelary spirit veneration or for healing. Simply stated, the stylistic variety evident in their distribution mirrors the ethno- linguistic complexity of the region. Both Chadic- and Adamawa-speaking peoples invest anthropomorphized clay vessels with forces of high sacred and ritual importance, to the exclusion of other primary sculptural modes of repre- sentation. This shared trait suggests, as 50</page><page sequence="4">4F4 4 . g ; . . .. . . !! . . .. .- :' . . .. . . . . . .' ... .. W%-,lA ."-. :4 e - ,--" "4 " 7.

NOVEMBER 1980. does their linguistic geography, a high degree of historical interaction. Geo- graphically mapping these vessels points out further that linguistic related- ness is not always an index of ethnic or cultural congruity. In the Lower Gongola area, vessels made by immediate neighbors tend to reveal more stylistic and often functional similarity than do those of their linguistic relatives who may now be separated in space. Those made by Adamawa-speakers are the most sculpturally diverse (Figs. 1-5), evi- dence that supports what can be inferred from principles of linguistic geography - that Adamawa peoples have lived longer in the region. These broad generalizations only suggest the potential of a distributional and synthetic approach to historical re- construction and of the value of ceramic evidence. Gongola Valley groups also engage in brasscasting, iron smithing, architectural ornamentation, gourd dec- oration, and elaborate forms of body scarification, which, taken with ceramics (utilitarian, ritual, and sacred), consti- tute distinctive material culture com- plexes. Although this article singles out sacred terracotta arts, it is my firm belief that a better understanding of historical developments and interactions depends on considering all categories of art pro- duction and the relationships between them (see Berns &amp; Hudson 1986:133-42). The study accomplished to support these claims (Berns 1986) can only be out- lined here in broad strokes. However, a more focused look at the relationship,be- tween two groups living east of the Gon- gola River in an area called the Ga'anda Hills - the Ga'anda and the 'B&amp;na - supports the validity of this methodol- ogy The Ga'anda are one of the several in- trusive Chadic-speaking peoples whose closest linguistic relatives live primarily to the east, along a path that echoes their route of migration from the Mandara Mountains at the Nigeria-Cameroon border. The 'B&amp;na, one of several peoples who speak a language belonging to a single subgroup of Adamawa, live to the west of the Ga'anda.4 On the basis of language differences alone, one would expect their distinct ancestries to be evi- dentin their arts and culture, even today. While this is indeed the case, these neighboring peoples have far more in common with one another than they do with their respective linguistic brethren, an observation that, as indicated above, holds true for the region as a whole. We know very little about the indi- vidual histories of the Ga'anda and the 'B&amp;na, or of their historical interaction. Accounts written by colonial officers, in- cluding C.K. Meek (1931), are largely ahistorical, except for references to how Ga'anda Hill groups withstood Fulani aggression in the early nineteenth cen- tury.5 Oral traditions have been exten- sively collected among groups of Ga'anda elders, with one recorded and written down by a Ga'anda man in the 1970s (Hammandikko 1980).6 All refer to a hill named Mokwar as the first place the Ga'anda stopped in their migration from the "east." This prominent insel- berg is situated just north of Ga'anda town, and within it a large rock shelter survives as the nexus of Ga'anda rain- making and harvest thanksgiving cere- monies (Fig. 7). The most intriguing feature of all the Ga'anda oral accounts is the importance consistently placed on who led the Ga'anda to Mokwar and subsequently validated the dispersal of Ga'anda families to other sites in the surrounding landscape. This culture hero is identified as a spirit-pot named Ngum-Ngumi, which, moving on its own, led the Ga'anda in their migration from a Man- dara Mountains homeland. Figures 6 and 8 show examples of ceramic vessels identified as Ngum-Ngumi. I mapped twenty-two such pots within four cen- ters of Ga'anda population (see Berns 1986:188), three of which (Ga'anda, Ga- bun, and Boka) represent dialect sub- groupings. The fourth, Dingai, appears to have been settled more recently and is discussed in greater detail below. The distribution of Ngum-Ngumi provides 51</page><page sequence="5">some clue to the pattern and direction of Ga'anda population movement, as well as to the importance the spirit and its ceramic representation play in legitimiz- ing and sustaining historical links be- tween communities. The spirit is generally enshrined in ritual precincts along with one or more identical pots conceptualized as "spirit brethren" or intermediaries with whom contact is directly made by shrine custo- dians. At Mokwar, three such pots are enshrined and removed for propitiation at annual harvest ceremonies called Xombata, when guinea corn beer is poured into the vessels and later con- sumed by priests and male elders (Fig. 9). The Mokwar Ngum-Ngumi is never removed and is offered the sacred liba- tion through its spirit intermediaries.7 It is significant that the Ga'anda objec- tify the concept of "founding ancestor" in a ceramic container. In their historical memory, migration to the Ga'anda Hills was directed by a supernatural power made visible and accessible through the medium of fired clay By replicating the spirit in sites where certain Ga'anda groups have dispersed, a historical debt is tangibly acknowledged, as is a reliance on the spirit's continued vigilance. The vessel's basic anthropomorphic form - a round body narrowing to a neck with an open mouth - is an appropriate shape into which a perambulating spirit can be invested, contacted, and even controlled. Other sculptural details fur- ther humanize the spirit - arms, breasts, navel, and often male genitalia, as well as various male tools and weapons. Interestingly, the most diag- nostic stylistic feature of Ngum-Ngumi vessels is the raised and impressed "bib" down the center of its torso, a graphic and textural reference in clay to the per- manent alteration of a woman's body through a complex program of cicatriza- tion. The most elaborately impressed cluster of Ngum-Ngumi pots, from sites around the present-day village of Boka, belong to the Wetu family; here I call them the Wetu subtype (Fig. 8). The gender ambiguity in Ngum-Ngumi ico- nography refers less to sexual identity than to the correlation between Ga'anda norms of male and female social respon- sibility and the spirit's role and authority in Ga'anda life (see Berns 1988: 73-74). By linking the spirit with this positive human activity, the Ga'anda enhance their ability to influence the forces gov- erning their survival and well-being. Ngum-Ngumi may be just what Vansina describes as an icon able to condense "cosmology, theories of social organiza- tion, legitimations of existing order..." (1984:210). Of further relevance to interpreting this mythic vessel, made by men, is its close similarity in profile to a basic Ga'anda water pot, made by women (Fig. 10). Both are instruments of civiliza- tion and survival.9 Barley argues that the technical process of firing clay may be used "to articulate models of [ritual] transformation and development" (1984:98). The change and control im- plicit in the process of making utilitarian pots- taking formless matter, shaping it with human hands, and transforming it through heat into another form and capability - can be extended to the pro- duction of pots for containing and con- tacting spirits. The irreversible trans- formative process of working and then firing clay assists in establishing the spirit-pot linkage, and helps structure the ritual act of spirit propitiation whereby people can mediate their own destinies. The second spirit-pot consistently mentioned in Ga'anda oral accounts is Mbirhlen'nda (Fig. 11). Mbirhlen'nda is the spirit regarded as best able to protect and sustain health and prosperity. In the past, at least one Mbirhlen'nda vessel was enshrined by every Ga'anda family, and others were kept in large collective ritual precincts. In 1980 I documented and mapped fifty-two different exam- ples during field work (Berns 1986: 466- 67). It is the proximity of Mbirhlen'nda that, according to the Ga'anda, helps en- courage the spirit's vigilance. The impor- tance of Mbirhlen'nda is supported by its central placement in the pottery shrines, squarely facing the entrance (Fig. 12). Be- cause many thatched shrine enclosures have been allowed to collapse in recent years, shrines are often unprotected, and some Mbirhlen'nda vessels have been rescued and placed in rock clefts or elevated niches where they can still oversee communities below (Fig. 13). Like Ngum-Ngumi, Mbirhlen'nda has distinctive sculptural features beyond those that serve to anthropomorphize the spirit. The most characteristic are the spirit's tubular projecting "mouth" and the mass of nodes or applique pellets that cover the head and neck, ending usually in a triangular pattern along the vessel's torso (Figs. 13,14). The cantile- vered mouth of Mbirhlen'nda directly confronts those who enter a shrine, and the facial features placed along the top of the mouth contribute to its striking vis- age. The dense application of small clay pellets on Mbirhlen'nda may be sculptural equivalents of the rows of raised "dots" resulting from scarification incisions. However, they may more liter- ally refer to the skin diseases the spirit is said to inflict on those who disobey codes of Ga'anda behavior and moral- ity.10 Like Ngum-Ngumi, Mbirhlen'nda protects Ga'anda civilization and is iden- tified by its meticulously executed sur- face decoration which refers both to male and female social realities (see Berns 1986: 148-55). Through rigorous stan- dards of artistic discipline (and following the transformational paradigm de- scribed above), the Ga'anda strengthen their chances for localizing spirit ener- gies and for mediating their positive in- tervention. Here, though, the masses of 10. GAANDA WATER-CARRYING POT ('BUUTI'YEMA). 65cm. FEBRUARY 1981. 8. GAANDA NGUM-NGUMI VESSELS OF THE "WETU" SUBTYPE. APPROX. 60 cm. JANUARY 1981. 9.

NOVEMBER 1980. applique pellets serve as reminders that the spirit's tutelage is conditional, de- pendent upon adherence to social rules and obligations. The Ga'anda believe their ancestors, in addition to a hierarchy of spirit protec- tors, are capable of influencing their health and prosperity. A special cere- mony is performed to dispatch souls to the afterlife one year after death. " How- ever, there are certain individuals known to have been particularly troublesome during life whose hostile spirits re-enter the world to punish their descendants. If a diviner determines that an illness or misfortune is due to the interference of a recently departed relative, a vessel called a shembera (pl., sambarca) is built to neu- tralize the wayward spirit. Suchsambarca are arranged along the inner perimeter of pottery shrines behind the centrally positioned Mbirhlen'nda (Figs. 12,15). Like other sacred ceramics, sambarca have anatomical features: breasts, navels, arms, and sometimes incisions referring to women's body scarifica- tions. Living in several village clusters west of the Ga'anda are the Adamawa- speaking 'Bna, who trace their ancestry to a hill called Mukan in the vicinity of Jangara (see map). That 'Bna migration is traced to a local hill site rather than to a distant location (as is the case for the Ga'anda) further confirms what the lan- guage map implies - that these 13. GAANDA MBIRHLEN'NDA ENSHRINED IN A ROCK CLEFT. THIS EXAMPLE WORKS SPECIFICALLY TO PROTECT AGAINST THE DEVASTATION OF SHUUTA, THE FORCE ASSOCIATED WITH WHIRLWINDS. Adamawa-speaking groups are likely to have long been autochthonous to the re- gion, preceding Chadic-speaking immi- grants. Contrasting with Ga'anda tutelary ceramic beings, 'Bina sacred vessels con- tain the spirits of important male elders and priests who have died. Well-being and prosperity are sustained through the positive intervention of such ancestors, who are propitiated at annual pre- planting rituals. These ancestral vessels, called wiisa, are kept in community shrines (Figs. 4, 16). As is the case with Ga'anda Ngum- Ngumi, sacred wiisa vessels, made by 'Bina men, can be compared to the domestic wares, made by women (Figs. 18,19). Even more evident than their sim- ilarity of profile is their common surface treatment: all-over impressions resulting from the finger markings left as the pot- ter continuously joins coils of clay Essen- tially, domestic wares are translated into wiisa through the addition of simple, raised decorative motifs, including arms that wrap around the shoulders and sometimes schematic facial features. The second primary vessel-type pro- duced by the 'Bena contains the spirit Ngwarkandangra, appealed to in ritual treatments to heal skin diseases (Fig. 17; see also p. 37). The main attributes of these vessels - a tubular projecting outh and clay spikes or bumps over the head and neck - are similar to those distin- guishing Ga'anda Mbirhlen'nda. The surface decoration of this 'Bena pot re- fers directly to its curative potential - the pattern of high-relief nodes may be a sculptural translation of the visible symptoms of diseases for which a patient is being treated. Although the stylistic parallels between Ga'anda Mbirhlen'nda and 'Bena Ngwarkan- dangra are clear (cf. Figs. 11-14), the 'Bena vessel lacks the consistency and definition in surface detail of Ga'anda spirit-pots. That Mbirhlen'nda's punishment often involves skin afflic- tions suggests a conceptual as well as art- istic relationship to the 'Bena spirit. De- spite such similarities, not enough evi- dence yet exists to prove whether the 'Bena or Ga'anda vessel was the pro- totype. Nevertheless, it can be argued that because 'Bna Ngwarkandangra are a part of the distribution of terracottas made by related Adamawa groups living to the west (cf. Figs. 1-3, 5), which are used extensively for healing diseases and show the same vigorous treatment of surface textures, they were the models for Ga'anda Mbirhlen'nda. The distinctions between Ga'anda Ngum-Ngumi and 'Bena wiisa in style, function, and meaning, as well as the dif- ferences in the profiles and surface deco- ration of their utilitarian wares, seem to 54</page><page sequence="8">reflect the two groups' separate ances- tries. Yet, the parallels between 'BWna Ngwarkandangra and Ga'anda Mbirhlen'nda, in addition to many points of similarity between Ga'anda and 'Bna social organization and mate- rial culture, prove that contact between them has been long, complex, and dynamic. It is not coincidental that the Ga'anda and 'BWna share traditions of full body scarification for girls and an ini- tiation ordeal for boys, held every seven years, as well as techniques for building granaries and houses, making pots, and decorating gourds. The nature of their contact, though, still remains unclear: did intrusive Ga'anda groups absorb weaker 'B&amp;na communities as they estab- lished residence in the Ga'anda Hills, or did the reverse occur? There is evidence to suggest that the Ga'anda have histori- cally dominated their 'B&amp;na neighbors. Elders from both groups still regard the Ga'anda rainmaker as the highest reli- gious authority in the land.12 As indi- cated above, the site where the Ga'anda rainmaker conducts the most important annual activities associated with rainfall and agricultural fertility is the ritual pre- cinct on Mokwar Mountain. The 'B&amp;na, as well as related Adamawa-speaking groups living in the Ga'anda Hills (Yunger, Libbo, Mboi, and Handa), trace their ancestry to the hill site of Mukan, situated "near Kante" (Meek 1931, vol. 2:434), "near Ga'anda" (Chappel 1977:209), or according to my infor- mants, near Jangara. Although the ac- tual location of Mukan has not been pre- cisely determined,13 what may be signif- icant is that the 'Bna word "Mukan" has undergone a sound shift to become "Mokwar" in the Ga'anda language (pers. comm., Russell Schuh, 1984). Therefore, the hill formation identified as the first site of Ga'anda occupation - Mokwar - may have once been Mukan, the sacred homeland of the 'B&amp;na. That the Ga'anda came to control this impor- tant site is a clue toward understanding how an intrusive population was able to exercise ritual and religious authority over the region's indigenous occupants. Even if the "Mukan Hill" remembered in 'Bina oral traditions is situated elsewhere, Ga'anda use of the name Mokwar suggests an attempt to legitimize and consolidate control over a place long considered important for communicating with powerful tutelary forces. Archaeological work on Mokwar, especially within its large rock shelter, might yield more positive answers about who its custodians have been over time. It also is possible that the 'Bina's use of figurated ceramic vessels to maintain contact with influential spirits provided the immigrant Ga'anda with a model for ensuring the beneficent intervention of their own spirit founders and protectors. That other related Chadic-speaking groups living along the Nigeria- Cameroon border use fired clay vessels to contain and propitiate spirits suggests 14. GAANDA MBIRHLEN'NDA (REAR AND FRONT VIEWS). NOTE THE METICULOUS APPLICATION OF SURFACE DETAILS. 49cm. JANUARY 1981. 55</page><page sequence="9">that the investment of such forces in ceramic containers was not a genre new to the Ga'anda. Less typical of known ceramic traditions maintained by Chadic-speakers are the production and use of explicitly anthropomorphic ves- sels (see Berns 1986: 414-17, 442-44; and Wente-Lukas 1977: 37-41). The settle- ment of the Ga'anda in a new environ- ment certainly required a renegotiation of both social and sacred realities, a rec- ord of which may be encoded in their ceramic shrine sculpture. What does this evidence - ceramic and otherwise - tell us about local his- tory? That the Ga'anda and the 'B~na each maintained a distinct language and religious ideology within a geo- graphically circumscribed area suggests that despite the degree of interaction necessary to have resulted in their strik- ing cultural congruence, their autonomy has been sufficient to sustain unique ethnic and linguistic identities. Their ceramic arts reflect this historical dy- namic and indeed help us reconstruct it. The number of close cultural parallels that can be drawn between the Ga'anda and their 'Bna neighbors is further sup- ported by Ga'anda oral accounts. A strik- ing number of tales collected among dif- ferent groups of Ga'anda patrilineal el- ders describes how contact was made be- tween two or more families previously unknown to each other. Their stories generally follow the pattern recounted by two patrilineages - the Tumbar and the Kli - who claim to have been well established in the Ga'anda area when, through the smoke of a cooking fire, they discovered the presence of the Gudban living at Mokwar Mountain. Repre- sentatives of the Tumbar and Keli made contact with the Gudban and convinced them to leave Mokwar so that the three could live together and benefit from each other's specialized ritual knowledge. The KMli, for example, claim to have in- troduced boys' initiation to the Gudban and even today maintain exclusive rights over its enactment every seven years. Tales repeating this same pattern of in- teraction and exchange offer an interest- ing narrative rationale for the way histor- ically unrelated populations may have coalesced in this region. That the Gud- ban were sighted at Mokwar is also of significance. Supporting such speculations about the indeterminate past is evidence con- cerning the contemporary dynamics of interaction and change along the shifting frontier of Ga'anda-'Bena occupation. There has been a gradual assimilation of 16. 'BENA WlISA SHRINE. 44-48cm. JANUARY 1981.

FOR RELIEVING FRUSTRATION OR ANGER F SAMBARCA ANCESTOR VESSELS Ga'anda sculptural forms by the 'Bena, a phenomenon that must be understood in the light of present-day Ga'anda so- cial, political, and economic preroga- tives.14 The process of Ga'andaization is strik- ingly evident at the hill site of Hatta, re- garded by the Roba subgroup of the 'Bana as their sacred homeland and point of dispersal after migration from Mukan. The wiisa shrine at this site, which commemorates Roba priestly an- cestors, consists of one large, centrally positioned vessel covered with a large sherd surrounded by over twenty-five other wiisa vessels (Fig. 20). What is strik- ing about this group of vessels is the con- trast between the central pot built to conventional wiisa standards (conform- ing to the shape and size of a large stor- age vessel with its characteristic all-over "coil" impressions) and the others around it. Four are anthropomorphic "portrait" pots, rather unusual in their generally smooth surface treatment and in the modeling of facial features (Figs. 21, 22). Each representation of an ances- tor has not only a face, but arms, a navel, and sometimes breasts and genitalia. On Figure 21 the torso decoration is domi- nated by raised lines, particularly double X's, a distinguishing feature of both 'Bina men's and women's scarifications. Other vessels in this wiisa shrine are identical to various Ga'anda sacred, ceremonial and domestic wares. Espe- cially distinguishable are the Wetu "Ngum-Ngumi" vessels with their con- trolled and meticulously worked surface decoration (Fig. 23). Their strong styliza- tion and strict adherence to a set of icon- ographic details contrast sharply with the freer, more expressionistic approach 56</page><page sequence="10">taken in modeling the other "portrait" wiisa enshrined at Hatta (Figs. 21, 22). These and other Ga'anda water and ritual beer pots were identified by infor- mants simply as wiisa, synonymous with other 'Bena vessels built to contain an- cestral spirits. They were not, therefore, acknowledged as being Ga'anda. Not to be overlooked, however, is the one cen- trally placed, conventional wiisa pot con- taining the spirit of the first Roba priest, which seems to legitimize the shrine's 'Bena ethnicity and historicity. The most complex pattern of 'Bena- Ga'anda occupation occurs around the town of Dingai. Out of eleven discrete hamlets, six claimed 'Bena and five Ga'anda ancestry The arts and practices of the Ga'anda groups generally con- form to patterns documented among mainstream Ga'anda communities. While the Ga'anda claim not to under- stand the 'Bena language, the 'Bena liv- ing in Dingai (and elsewhere) speak Ga'anda, a bilingualism that may be a useful indicator of the recent directional flow of forms and ideas between the two groups (and present-day political pre- rogatives). Although the Dingai-'Bena generally follow the same ethnographic patterns as their other 'Bena relatives, there are enough differences to support the proposition that they represent the cutting edge of Ga'anda acculturation. In this area, the intrusion of Ga'anda ideas is evident in the conceptualization as well as the style of ceramic spirit con- tainers. Dingai-'Bena groups told me they were led in their migration to this location by a pot, called Komalamne, identical to its Ga'anda Ngum-Ngumi counterpart. Interestingly, the Dingai- Ga-anda have given this spirit a third name, Yinifarihi or Yinifartafa. Regard- 17. 'BENA NGWARKANDANGRA FOR HEALING SKIN DISEASES. JANUARY 1981. less of nomenclature, all of the Yinifarihi and all of the Komalamne are stylistically the same as the elaborately sculpted Wetu Ngum-Ngumi. In the Dingai-'Bena shrine kept by the local chief-priests, the Tontomra, a very large Komalamne (approx. 90 cm tall) is surrounded by as many as fifteen of the spirit's "sons" (Fig. 24). This coterie of Komalamne serves as spirit protectors for the entire Dingai area. In fact, this shrine has by far the largest agglomera- tion of Wetu-like vessels documented in the region. In this instance not only are the vessels worked with the same degree of technical control and proficiency as those made by the Ga'anda, but they have been given a Ga'anda function and meaning as well. Whereas the use of multiple spirit protectors, concep- tualized as a founding father with "sons" or "brothers," is also found among the Ga'anda (Fig. 8), the unusual number of vessels in this shrine may be a way of providing the same increased protection afforded by the accumulation of succes- sive generations of ancestral containers in other wiisa shrines, including the one at Hatta (Fig. 20). In addition to Komalamne, other ves- sels in the Tontomra's shrine are identi- cal to those made by the Ga'anda. A number of "sambarca" are situated among the smaller Komalamne and are called by the 'Bena name wiisa, appropriate to their identification as repositories for an- cestral spirits. It is curious, however, that informants explained these wziisa as a means of neutralizing the ancestors' negative aspects, the purpose ofsambarca used by the Ga'anda. Another large ves- sel at the Tontomra's shrine, placed prominently in front of the central Komalamne and explained as having a tutelary function, is easily recognizable as Mbirhlen'nda, though it is called by 19.

While this "Mbirhlen'nda" shares many of the characteristics associated with Ga'anda examples, the typical nodes covering the head and neck (which also are the signature elements of 'Bena Ngwarkandangra) are lacking. In- stead, the carefully impressed ridges of Komalamne seem to have been grafted onto a "Mbirhlen'nda" armature, suggesting that this pot probably came from the same workshop as the others. Few visual or functional associations re- main between this enshrined guardian vessel and the roughly modeled healing vessels that are its namesake, Ngwar- kandangra. The inclusion and disposi- tion of Komalamne (Ngum-Ngumi), Ngwarkandangra (Mbirhlen'nda), and wiisa (sambarca) in the sacred shrine kept by the Tontomra closely follow Ga'anda patterns (Fig. 15). The likelihood that these Komalamne and Ngwarkandangra in the Tontomra's shrine were not made by the 'Bena is supported by their inclusion in other Dingai shrines alongside conventional 'Bena vessels with their characteristic surface impressions. For example, in the hamlet shrine of Kokoroko, a central, 20. 'BENA WlISA SHRINE AT HATTA HILL.

JANUARY 1981. dominating vessel, called Ngwarkan- dangra, is easily recognizable as "Mbirhlen'nda" (Fig. 25). It is sur- rounded by a number of pots modeled in the wiisa mode with external "coil" im- pressions or with all-over punch-marks. Even the placement of these vessels cor- responds to the way Ga'anda sambarca are positioned around Mbirhlen'nda. The sacred ceramic vessels enshrined by Dingai communities indicate that Ga'anda forms and ideas have been in- troduced into this transitional area. The number of pots resembling Wetu Ngum-Ngumi is considerable, and a comparison of examples from Boka (Fig. 8), Hatta (Fig. 23) and Dingai (Fig. 24) re- veals a remarkable standardization, from painstaking "waffle" panels to smoothly modeled anatomical details. However, on close examination, the spatial dis- tribution and combination of icono- graphic motifs vary from example to example, an observation that may say as much about opportunities for artistic freedom and innovation as it does about the absence of a rigid iconographic for- mula for Ngum-Ngumi or its counter- parts. The dissemination of these ves- sels, extending as far west as Hatta, poses interesting questions about provenance, circumstances of produc- tion, and distribution. Their concentra- tion in various Wetu (Boka) sites suggests that their evolution and sub- sequent manufacture may have been centered in this area, diffusing westward into Dingai. Yet, despite an inability to confirm the vessel's origin and point of dissemination, it cannot be disputed that Ngum-Ngumi's profile, as well as the crisp, precise modeling of its surface and 22.

On the other hand, technical and stylistic parallels to other 'Bena arts are less evi- dent. The value of describing a group's wider universe of artistic production is especially apparent when individual monuments or categories of objects, like Ngum-Ngumi, are expressions of a gen- eral approach to design, composition, and technique. The less technically ac- complished Ngum-Ngumi of this type enshrined at Mokwar (Fig. 9) may be concrete evidence that its elaboration coincided with its westward distribu- tion. Such ceramic evidence supports that the history of Ga'anda-'Bena interaction in this region has been complex and dynamic. The number of other social and cultural correspondence between these two groups provides a framework for analyzing the more recent process of Ga'andaization. Yet, despite what can be deduced from contemporary patterns, considerations of the arts of the Ga'anda and their 'Bena neighbors demonstrate that the evolution of artistic traditions often involves an amalgamation of ideas and forms drawn from multiple sources over time. The ceramic evidence also supports, with particularistic data, Bravmann's important premises in Open Frontiers (1973), recently expanded and explored in a special issue of this magazine (August 1987). And this Gon- gola Valley study reveals how art re- sponds to historical change and inter- change, while simultaneously contribut- ing to the very processes and contexts of that change. An analysis of the stylistic transformations and diffusions of sacred ceramics in this region, alongside an ex- ploration of the institutions and ideologies they support, demonstrates how primary field data can contribute to historical reconstruction. Whereas lan- guage distributions reveal patterns and directions of intergroup contact, the vis- ual arts, especially ceramic sculpture, help in better understanding the impact and meaning of that interaction. A de- tailed look at Ga'anda Hill ceramic sculp- ture, especially as it crosses ethnic and linguistic boundaries, further shows that stylistic categories are indeed dynamic.15 That similar and in some cases identical vessels take on different meanings when used by neighboring groups shows that to restrict study to one style and one people denies to art a historical dimen- sion and sharply compromises even its contextual interpretation. A history of art in Africa can be advanced by a syn- thetic and distributional approach- one that takes into account multiple categories of data and the various groups who share a fluid geographical region.

JANUARY 1981 59</page><page sequence="13">BERNS, "Ceramic Clues": Notes, from page 59 The field work on which this article is based was conducted in northeastern Nigeria from September 1980 to June 1981, and September 1981 to June 1982. I am grateful to the Fulbright- Hays Doctoral Doctoral Dissertation Research Abroad program and the International Doctoral Research Fellowship Program of the Social Science Research Council for their support. There are many institutions and individuals to whom thanksareowed for their contribution to the success of my research in Nigeria and the work that has resulted from it. The Nigerians who generously shared details of their lives, their arts, their beliefs, and their history have my sincere appreciation. I thank Doran Ross for commenting on an earlier draft of this paper. I also would like to acknowledge Arnold Rubin, whose impact on my life and work has been immeasurable. He introduced me to the beauty of northeastern Nigeria, and shared with me his pro- found respect for and knowledge of its peoples and their arts. His tragic death has deeply touched us all. This article is dedicated to Arnold's wisdom and friendship, which are in- extricably bound in its words and images. Specific references to locations of ceramic shrines or vessels have been intentionally omitted in the captions. Anyone desiring particulars about a photograph should contact me.

Leith-Ross' 1970 survey of Nigerian pottery included examples of work by several groups from the "North-East" and from the "Niger-Gongola Valley." Her collection, much of which is still on display in the courtyard of the Jos Museum, focuses on domestic wares and only secondarily on ceremonial vessels. It wasn't until Arnold Rubin did field reconnaissance in the Gongola Valley from 1970 to 1971, as a part of his larger survey of the Benue River Valley, that the variety and extent of sacred ceramic vessels became evident. Rubin's field notes confirmed some of Meek's (1931) descriptions of isolated tradi- tions. Other articles appeared in the 1970's-80's dealing with the work of single ethnic groups (Chappel 1973; Slye 1977; Teilhet 1977-78) or single vessel types (Hare 1983; Pearlstone 1973). It was not until I completed two and one-half years of field research in the Gongola Valley (1980-82) that I was able to draw a more comprehensive picture of the region's ceramic arts. This article is based on this larger study and Ph.D. dissertation, "Art and History in the Lower Gongola Valley, Northeastern Nigeria" (1986). 2. Arguments supporting this claim are included in David (1976), Ehret and Posnansky (1982), Greenberg (1966), Sutton(1979), and Wescott (1%7). 3. Ballard's model (1971:295-96), proposed with regard to the Nigerian Middle Belt, is applicable to other comparably com- plex areas like the Gongola Valley. 4. Hansford, Bendor-Samuel, and Stanford classify the'Bena within the Yungur group of Adamawa languages (1976:182). There they are called the Lala, a name that has long been recognized as imprecise and confusing (e.g., Meek 1931, vol. 2:369). 'Bena is the name preferred by the peoples referred to elsewhere as the Lala, Roba, and Yungur. I have used the in- correct spelling Gbinna in the past and am grateful to Roger Blench for his correction. To clarify the differences (linguistic and ethnic) between the northern 'Bena (Lala and Roba) and the southern 'Bena (Yungur), I am using the name 'Bena here to refer only to the northern groups; Yungur is used to distinguish the southern groups. 5. Meek wrote that the various 'Bena sections were subjected to"constant attacks by the Fulani governors of Adamawa.. Neither he [Lawal] nor his successors made any real conquest of the tribe, though the Fulani of Song used to raid the Yungur on their farms" (1931, vol. 2:437). Oral histories I collected in the field in 1980-81 consistently celebrated both Ga'anda and 'Bena resistance to the Fulani. A Ga'anda version of this story is recorded in Hammandikko (1980:4-6). 6. In order to validate the Ga'anda oral history recorded by Hammandikko (1980) principally about the Gudban lineage and verify its applicability to other Ga'anda communities, I collected the testimonies of over ten different patrilineal groups representing the three dialect subsections of Ga'anda (Ga'an- da, Boka, Gabun). Whilel respect the limited usefulness of oral lore in reconstructing history, I still find that the accounts collected reveal valuable information about Ga'anda origins and about social, political, and ritual processes. Their strength as evidence seems to lie in the remarkable consistency between them. It is hoped that my extensive Ga'anda archive of taped histories can be transcribed and translated from the Hausa to become more widely available. 7. Because so many pottery shrines in the Ga'anda district have fallen into disrepair or entirely lack their grass enclosures, it was difficult to ask questions about whether Ngum-Ngumi vessels were 'removed' onritual occasions. At one Wetu shrine, several of the spirit's brethren were visible, but Ngum-Ngumiitself was said to be buried under a large boulder adjacent to the shrine. Informants at Mokwar and Wetu indicated the Ngum-Ngumi did not like sunlight and thus was always kept so protected. The 102</page><page sequence="14">fact that the Ga'anda creator god's name, Farta, also can be translated as "sun" (and that the god's power is characteriz- ed as watfarta, or"fire of the sun") suggests that by protecting Ngum-Ngumifrom the sun (farta), the spirit is being shielded from exposure to this Ga'anda high god. 8. This program of women's scarification and the likely transposition of its motifs and meanings onto other domestic and sacred arts are explained in Berns 1988. 9. Pots made to contain ancestral spirits, however, are made by postmenopausal women. 10. The Ga'anda claimed on several occasions that visible changes to the skin meant that a person had been "touched" by Mbirhlen'nda. One woman who had lost part of her nose, probably owing to the effects of leprosy, was said to have been punished by the spirit. There are other common diseases with damaging effects to the skin, including those that leave raised blisters, ring-shaped discolored patches (ringworm or psoriasis), or raised lesions (filariasis). 11. It should be noted that Ga'anda pots (hlefenda) made to contain the spirits of the deceased are intentionally smashed to sever the links between the living and the dead (see Berns 1988:71-73). McLeod has observed a similar ritual breaking of pots among the Asante (1984:367). The potency of the "pot- person link" is associated, according to McLeod, with the fact that "the pot is seen as the end of a complex and irreversible process of transformation and its deliberate smashing is, therefore, a jumbling or unscrambling of that process..." 12. Early colonial reports filed on the "Lala District" indicate that the Ga'anda chief priest or custodian of the "Great Juju" was universally acknowledged (NAK J.18; 1912-1928). Additional information supporting this claim is included in oral traditions collected in Gabun by Meek (1931, vol.2:370). 13. I was taken to a hill site that Roba 'Bena informants iden- tified as Mukan in 1981. Although there was evidence of former occupation (e.g., stone house foundations, discarded querns, sherd fragments), nothing I was shown convinced me of the hill's identity as Mukan. Based on the topographic distinction of other sites of religious importance in the present-day Ga'an- da or 'B6na region, the place to which I was taken seemed unlikely to be the collective 'B6na ancestral homeland. 14. The Ga'anda Hills lie within the Gombi Local Government Area of Gongola State. During the six months I worked there I observed that local government officials, who were primari- ly Fulani, viewed the "Lala" ('Bena) as particularly backward, essentially because of their remote locations and resistance to national incorporation. The Ga'anda are stronger participants in local and state government as well as in national Nigerian politics; their primary town, called Ga'anda, is at the terminus of the newly graded but unpaved road to Gombi. Ga'anda Town is also where the largest Friday mosque and LCCN (Lutheran Church of Christ, Nigeria) church are located. 15. This point has been well developed in Frank 1987.
