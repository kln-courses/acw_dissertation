London: Allen and Unwin, 1940. 184 pp. Price, 7s. 6d. In expanding into a separate book the four lectures dealing with image-worship which Dr. Edwyn Bevan omitted from his volume of (ifford Lectures at Edin- burgh in 1933 on Symbolism and Belief, a quantity of material of considerable interest to anthropologists has been brought together, and discussed with the knowledge and understanding characteristic of the author. In the opening pages a rapid survey is made of 'aniconic fetishism and a cult of iconic objects,' which he believes existed side by side from Palaeolithic times. In due course, he thinks, " the worship of unwrought "stones may have led in many cases to the worship "of graven images." Since the sacredness of a particular stone was often derived from an accidental resemblance to a living form, it only required a slight adaptation to transform it into an anthropomorphic or theriomorphic image, till at length the perfect likeness was produced as artistic appreciation and skill developed. The repudiation of idolatry by certain of the higher religions-notably Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Islam and some forms of Christianity and Hinduism-has arisen from the conclusion that the object bears no real re- semblance to the divinity portrayed rather than from any refusal to associate the divine with the material. Thus, the prophetic movement in Israel, while speaking in disparaging terms of idols as ' the work of men's hands ' with mouths that speak not, eyes that see not, and ears that hear not, rested its condemnation of the cult on the sacrilege of attempting to make a similitude of God. In the second lecture the two grounds on which the denunciation-in the Old Testament is based are examined in detail. The Second Commandment in the Decalogue is shown to be ambiguous since it is not clear whether it is the making or the worshipping of images that is forbidden. Representation of the human form was regarded as contrary to the Jewish law, but Rabbinic opinion was divided, whether images might be made of any other living creatures, provided they were not identified with Yahweh. In the Talmud a distinction occurs, as in the Eastern Orthodox Church, between a picture in the flat and an image in the round. The archaeological evidence from Jewish catacombs in Rome reveals numerous animal designs, and similar examples of decorative painting recur in Tunisia, Palestine, and the famous synagogue at Dura (Europqs) on the Euphrates (A.D. 245), where the human form was freely portrayed. Therefore, it is clear that at the beginning of the Christian era the Jews were not averse to the depicting of figures of men and animals provided they were not made to be worshipped. -In the next two lectures, the complex situation that developed in the Christian Church is discussed with acumen, and a complete freedom from bias in a highly controversial subject. The evidence is stated and evalu- ated with scrupulous fairness and accuracy, and anthrop- ologists who may not be particularly interested in the precise question at issue, will find the skilful marshalling of the facts, and the sifting of the findings of the leading authorities on both sides of the iconic dispute, a stimu- lating piece of reasoning. The shallowness of may of the arguments for and against the use of images in Christian worship is revealed, and while this is not the place to enter into a discussion of the technical questions involved, iconoclasm has a very considerable significance for the student of social anthropology. This volume, by a distinguished historian and Hellenist, is a mine of valuable informationt excavated with supreme skill and precision. E. 0. JAMES.</page></plain_text>
