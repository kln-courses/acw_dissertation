Viewed in this way, ‘raw data’ and ‘closure’ are merely useful fic- tions. Most likely, the Kamoro information stored at present in my brain is not  identical with information stored at the time of my observation in the 1950s  and 1960s. The information has been extended since then, by new informa- tion (in particular from Zegwaard and Coenen) not readily available to me at  the time, and also as a result of rethinking issues, theoretical concepts, meth- ods and conclusions. No doubt there are incongruities and contradictions  between the earlier and the later stores of information. Last but not least, the  present book, as it now stands, could not have been written in the 1950s and  1960s.  These considerations call for a spelling out of the terms of cross-cultural  analysis in use today. Any comparison is a construction or reconstruction,  and any construction is meant to serve a particular purpose. So, what are my  terms of comparison and what purpose do they serve? I tackle these issues  by drawing on Knauft’s comparison of South Coast New Guinea cultures,  and on descriptions of these cultures by several other ethnographers in well- documented, conventional monographs and accounts during a period of  moderate colonization lasting till about the 1960s (Knauft 1993). Though the  title of this chapter reflects current anthropological themes, and also since  ethnography reflects the ethnographer’s concern, ethnographic differences are  not simply Western projections (Knauft 1993:10). One should not mistake the  map for the territory.1 The territory of seven South Coast New Guinea culture  areas, extending over some 2,500 kilometres, may justifiably be viewed as an  ethnographic region, because the cultures share a number of salient features.  1 Bateson 1972:455, as paraphrased by Knauft 1993:217. </page> <page sequence="4"> 98 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua Map 4.

Knauft notes that headhunting and ritual-ceremonial heterosexuality or  homosexuality were absent among the Elema. Ritual-ceremonial homo- sexuality is absent among the Kamoro as well; the Kamoro ritual-ceremonial  heterosexuality lacks the virulent intensity reported for the Asmat and the  Marind. Unlike the Marind, Kiwai and Kolopom, the Kamoro and Asmat  did not collect and apply male and female coital fluids. Admittedly, sever- ing heads from bodies does occur in a well-known Kamoro myth of Kamora  River groups, eliciting laughter among its listeners. An eloping couple chased  by their relatives curse them to sink into the mud save for their heads, which  are then severed by the elopers. They promptly feel regret and stick the heads  back onto the torsos with resin.2 However, this narrative is a far cry from the  elaborate ritual practice of headhunting, ascribed in a Kamoro myth exclu- sively to the Asmat.3 In various reliable reports about Kamoro pre-colonial  warfare, there is no evidence whatsoever of headhunting or cannibalism  (Pouwer 1953a:42-6; Harple 2000:105-7).  It seems that the features of Knauft’s ethnographic region fade out towards  its eastern and western borders. In East Elema, socio-political organization  and patterns of social exchange approximate highland New Guinea ones; they  were originally an inland population (Knauft 1993:204, 215). In West Kamoro,  the mythical emergence of social groups as a result of dividing up a slain mon- ster shows striking similarities to southeastern Bird’s Head highland and low- land stories; only the manifestations of the monster differ (Pouwer 1999:480-8).  Does this similarity point to age-old migrations, or to diffusion from west to  east over hundreds of miles? The Kamoro narratives do mention pockets of  small, scattered communities in West Mimika prior to the great migration  from east to west. One wonders if the participants’ explicit association of the  myth of the slain monster with Ema Kame is not a historical afterthought.  This could account for the remarkable absence of dramatization of this myth  in Ema Kame rituals; the myth is, however, told in songs. Myths change more  easily than rituals and ceremonial songs.  2 For the full text, see Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:26. 3 For details, see Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:195-7.  </page> <page sequence="6"> 100 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua Meanwhile, in spite of the similarities, the differences between the seven  culture areas are so rich and of such a magnitude that Knauft is reluctant to  force them into a comparative straitjacket by listing them. Doing so would  also easily overlook the developmental configurations that are crucial for  understanding intra- and cross-cultural divergence (Knauft 1993:209). But  then, how are we to avoid academic, empiricist ‘butterfly collecting’? Knauft  attempts to overcome this Malinowskian dilemma by taking recourse to early  Marxist concepts of social formation, social being, and social consciousness.  He uses the term ‘socio-cultural formation’, which not only unites ‘society’  and ‘culture’ but, I would say, also ‘process’ and ‘steady state’. ‘Formation’,  as opposed to ‘format’, stresses ongoing activity. The Concise Oxford diction- ary (2008) defines ‘formation’ as ‘the action of forming or the process of being  formed; a thing that has been formed; a structure or arrangement; a formal  arrangement of aircraft in flight or troops’; indeed, a most fruitful collection of  meanings. Further, to account for the process and dynamics of (socio-cultural)  formation, Knauft re-casts the crucial Marxist concepts of ‘social being’ and  ‘social consciousness’ into, respectively, the existential ‘hard world’ dimension  and the symbolic dimension, or cultural impetus, of a social formation.4 Now, the strategic advantage of using this trio of concepts is that it enables  us to grasp the reality of (social) formation as a truly dialectical process. As  Knauft (1993:15) puts it, ‘a core dialectic is constituted by the recursive quali- tative impact that symbolic and existential dimensions of social action exert  on each other over time. Along with internal cultural dynamics, this dialectic  drives the endogenous development of socio-cultural formations.’ On the  other hand, ‘the challenges, dissonances and refractoriness of culture’s own  existential manifestation provide tensions that drive development in the sym- bolic formation itself’. Knauft (1993:208) continues: ‘Because the local interface  between culture and practice [including history] is both recursive and genera- tive, it produces remarkable differences among culture areas that nonetheless  retain striking similarities.’ This reconceptualization of the Marxist trio produces in my view a rela- tional dialectic, which rejects any final determination by either ‘hard world’  infrastructure or symbolic superstructure (see also Knauft 1993:14). As the  neo-Marxist Althusser puts it, ‘the last instance never comes’. What matters  is neither ‘matter’, nor ‘Geist’, but the dialectical interface between the two in  a given dynamic socio-cultural configuration. Put in a semiotic perspective,  what matters is the events conceived as articulations, as relata, because the  human (and animal) brain and the mind, having no immediate, direct access  to reality, always articulate it. For instance, the hard-world phenomenon of  4 For these redefinitions, see Knauft 1993:14-5, 208. </page> <page sequence="7"> VI  The theory of comparison and the context of the rituals 101 sago stands in traditional South Coast New Guinea societies is articulated  both as a physical-economic resource and as a physical-spiritual source of  life; sago stands are not resources by themselves. Sago as articulated in this  manner presents the people with both restraints and a boundless scope for  signification, symbolization and creativity. A physical, social and spiritual  articulation of sago in a modern, industrial society would be, and in fact is,  radically different. Knauft’s neo-Marxist ‘core dialectic’ may in actual analysis be usefully  combined with Lévi-Strauss’s core notion of structure, more especially with  structural history, a term he coined in 1960 in his inaugural address (Lévi- Strauss 1960, 1977:16). I cover ground similar to Knauft’s and Lévi-Strauss’s in  my ‘Structural history; A New Guinea case study’, a semiological analysis of a  Kamoro myth (Pouwer 1975:80-102). Structure in a Lévi-Straussian sense is a  construct, an arrangement of complements rather than an empirical-statistical  correlation of elements (Pouwer 1975:81). Hence it is accessible to reasoning,  namely the logics of articulation, of signification by the mind, which has no  direct access to reality: it is an analytical windfall that enables us to apply  the logics of reasoning to the muddle of data and the flow of events. To  Lévi-Strauss an arrangement is structured if it meets two conditions: 1. it is  regulated by internal cohesion; and 2. this cohesion is not readily accessible  to observation in an isolated system, but reveals itself in the study of trans- formations through which similar properties are recognized in apparently  different systems (Lévi-Strauss 1977:18). These systems may be part of given  configurations of a culture, such as the sub-systems of kinship and marriage,  of politics, economy, ritual and myth. But they may also be part of a succes- sion in time from one configuration to another. I define structural history as  the study of the history of the succession of varying configurations in their  dialectical interaction with the stream of events as articulated and signified.  In terms of signification, the distinction between the order of events and the  order of structure is merely an analytic one (Pouwer 1974:253, 1975:80-102). In  other words, history ‘happens’ on the borderline between chance events and  non-chance, non-contingent structure (Pouwer 1975:81). It is on this borderline that Knauft’s ‘core dialectic’ may be fruitfully situ- ated. It has proven to be of great analytic value:  As cultural orientations were actualized in socio-material life, they were confront- ed with the often unintended existential effects of their own legacy. Repercussions  of this nature were highly important in the development of each language-culture  area. They are exemplified in the compromised fertility of the Marind; the rela- tive defenselessness of the Trans-Fly people to ethnic encroachment; the relent- less self-killing of the Asmat; the oscillating repulsion and spread of the Kiwai;  the complete atomization of the Kolopom; the autonomous separation of Purari  villages; and the great duration and economic scale of the Elema’s hevehe. These  </page> <page sequence="8"> 102 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua outcomes reflect the recursive effects of divergent symbolic orientations as they  became actualized in specific demographic, material, and biological conditions.  (Knauft 1993:207.) I would add that these conditions as articulated act upon the divergent sym- bolic orientations as articulated. From this development of each language- culture area to the succession of the next configuration in time is but one step.  In this connection one is reminded of a profound remark by Durkheim, pub- lished in 1900: ‘Structure itself occurs in the process of development. [...] It is  ceaselessly forming and breaking down; it is life which has reached a certain  degree of consolidation; and to distinguish it from the life whence it derives  or from the life it determines amounts to dissociating inseparable things.’5 Since Knauft deals only in passing with the Kamoro, which he saw as  merely a small part of the Asmat language-culture area,6 I will attempt, in the  following sections, to illustrate Knauft’s dialectic by comparing the Kamoro  with the Asmat socio-cultural formation. For the Asmat I rely mainly on  Zegwaard’s typed or cyclostyled reports and scattered notes, now available  in the Zegwaard Archives of the Catholic Documentation Centre (KDC) at  the University of Nijmegen.7 In addition, I refer to Knauft’s observations in  his main text and in an Appendix (1993:228-37), drawing on Zegwaard, Eyde,  Schneebaum, Trenkenschuh and Sowada. I will proceed as follows: from a  scrutiny, blow by blow, of the broad similarities, as listed above, will emerge  a number of significant differences between Kamoro and Asmat. Can we  account for them in a dialectical fashion? Languages The Kamoro language is spoken in a number of dialects, which cover the  coastal and more inland areas from Etna Bay in the west to Koperapoka and  the Mukumuga River in the east. The closely related Sempan language has  speakers in the upper reaches of the rivers east of the Mukumuga. The neigh- bouring and little-known Nafuaripi presumably speak a Sempan dialect.  They live upstream in a wide arc from Otakwa River to the upper reaches of  5 Durkheim 1953:190, as quoted in Lévi-Strauss 1977:17-8. Durkheim 1960 is an English trans- lation of Durkheim 1900. 6 See Knauft 1993: Map 1, facing p. xii. See also mMap 3 and Map 4 in this volume.  7 Specific page-by-page acknowledgment of Zegwaard’s information would be cumbersome  and is not always possible for his scattered typed notes. Therefore, I refer simply to the Zegwaard  Archives as ‘KDC, File number’; the number as a rule refers to one item but may also include  various items filed under one cover. </page> <page sequence="9"> VI  The theory of comparison and the context of the rituals 103 the rivers around Flamingo Bay. The Asmat language area, beginning at the  Momac (Le Cocq d’Armandville) River, includes a considerable number of  dialects. They can be subdivided into a central coastal group of slightly differ- ing dialects, with around it on the periphery upstream a number of dialects  differing sharply from it, and the dialect of the Casuarinen Coast.8 The three languages are related yet different. They are classified as the  Asmat Language Family, since speakers of the Asmat language dominate  numerically: 40,000 to 60,000, compared to Kamoro’s 15,000 and Sempan’s  1,500, the Nafuaripi not included (Kamoro baseline study 1998:15). Despite con- siderable variation in dialects, there are no bars to comprehension within each  language. The very differentiation into dialects and into three languages is  evidence of longstanding migrations, and socio-political and cultural develop- ments over hundreds of years. Sago stands, riverine, marine and horticultural resources The Kamoro, Sempan and Asmat share a vast, flat, marshy coastal plain and  adjacent hinterland, densely covered with mangrove trees, tidal forests and  rain forests, intersected by numerous rivers, creeks, and connecting shallow  waterways. Yet there is significant ecological variation, which affects the size  of the settlements. Since the central mountain range descends towards the  coast in the far northwest and gradually recedes from the coast towards the  southeast by several hundred kilometres, there is a difference in landscape  and carrying capacity between the area west and the area east of Kaokonao  (Central Mimika). In the former there is a clear, though continually shifting,  borderline between a shallow sea and the land, marked by beaches and sand  spits, enlivened by casuarina trees, and utilized for living and some horticul- ture. The rivers, creeks and connecting waterways west of Uta are fewer in  number and shorter. Consequently, sago groves are not so abundant, there  is more semi-cultivated sago (Amota pareta), and communications are more  dependent on seagoing canoes originating from areas west of Etna Bay,  which have almost supplanted the river-going canoes west of Kaokonao. In  the east the shallow sea blends almost imperceptibly into the mudbanks and  slush (rather than solid soil) of the coastal plain and into the aerial roots of  the mangroves. An unusual extent of ocean incursion, as far inland as 125  kilometres at high tide, has created vast salty and brackish swamps. In these  swamps extensive sago stands occur, at high tide extending to the middle and  upper reaches of streams. Where the incursions of the tides cease, a different  8 Voorhoeve 1965:1-2; for Kamoro and Sempan minus Nafuaripi dialect, see Drabbe 1953. </page> <page sequence="10"> 104 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua When the Arafura Sea is stormy, the only hope for a heavily loaded canoe is to pole  it tediously along the boat channel inside the breakers near the shore.

Here there is an opportunity for gar- dening, especially on the upper reaches of the Wania and Mukumuga Rivers.  This ecological situation is amenable to a higher carrying capacity. Whereas  in West Mimika the size of settlements rarely exceeds 200 persons, in Central  and East Mimika 200 or more is the rule rather than the exception. In coastal  Central Asmat the upper limit is even 2,000. Inland settlements tend to be  smaller (100 to 300 people) throughout the coastal plain. Another universal  feature is a high degree of mobility, thanks to highly efficient dugout canoes  well adapted to rivers, shallow creeks and waterways.  The ecological differentiation outlined above may be taken to constitute  the existential dimension of the socio-cultural formations concerned. It is its  dialectical interaction with the socio-symbolic dimension, as articulated, of the  formations which determines their distinguishing features. </page> <page sequence="11"> VI  The theory of comparison and the context of the rituals 105 Types of kinship and descent Kinship and descent in Mimika and Asmat are roughly similar in that  they combine a flexible, ‘horizontal’, strongly classificatory generation-type  (‘Hawaiian’) of categorization of kin with a marked ‘residential override’, a  term coined by Peter van Arsdale.9 Such a combination renders participants’  thorough knowledge and recognition of actual and putative genealogical  relationships, of descent lines and founding ancestors, superfluous and  rather dysfunctional. Being a member of a domiciled core of kin is sufficient  proof of being a relative. The paired terms of reference cemen/cen (Asmat) and  kamare/wa (Kamoro), meaning penis/vagina and penis/anus respectively, are  used, if need be, to designate the patrifiliation or matrifiliation of a particular  person. A Kamoro man identifies his anus with his sister’s vagina; he has two  types of offspring: on the front side and on the back side, namely his own and  his (classificatory) brothers’ children versus his own and his (classificatory)  sisters’ children, his kamarima and his fatako. An Asmat man may even refer  to his sisters’ children by slapping his behind.10 Both the Kamoro and the Asmat strongly emphasize bonds between sib- lings as the core of kinship. The Kamoro refer to these in a generalized and  metaphorical sense, irrespective of gender, by the term naoka-bikipa, literally  ‘younger/older brothers’ (Pouwer 1955a:74). According to David Eyde the  ‘brothers’, ofew, are the most important people for an adult Asmat male. This  group includes not only younger and older (blood) brothers but also male par- allel cousins and cross-cousins. It makes up the base of what Eyde has called  a core conical kindred (Eyde 1967:210-303). These core kinsmen live next door  to each other in a longhouse. In a metaphorical sense, ofew stands for kin in  general. The dualistic layout of Asmat and Kamoro local aggregates in a settle- ment, and the dual organization of performed ceremonies and rituals, enable  persons of various kin and non-kin categories, including persons or groups  originating from elsewhere, to assimilate easily without genealogical knowl- edge or connections. Last but not least, the particular combination of generation-type kin clas- sification, spatially expressed dualism, and residential override, allows for  a flexible system of cumulative filiation or descent, attuned to locality of  marriage, with some room for flexibility. There is a difference, though. The  Kamoro and Sempan favour cumulative matrifiliation and matrilineal descent,  the Asmat favour patrifiliation and patrilineal descent, corresponding to their  9 For details, see Pouwer 1955a:55-85; Van Arsdale 1975:12, mainly based on Eyde 1967:210- 303; Van Arsdale and Van Arsdale 1991:20. For the theory, see Pouwer 1966. 10 Zegwaard, personal communication, 1952. See also Pouwer 1955a:75. </page> <page sequence="12"> 106 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua predilection for respectively matri-uxorilocal and patri-virilocal marriage. The  Kamoro combine cumulative matrifiliation with ‘horizontal’, generational  emphasis, by referring to male and female persons of ego’s generation who  have a mother’s mother in common as ‘my peraeko’. These peraeko often work  together in sago production and fishing parties. Usually they live in the same  settlement or the same part of a settlement. As a group and in a wider sense,  they are referred to by the name of the focal grandmother. The group includes  three generations and is exogamous. In the fourth descending generation the  focal term of reference shifts to the name of another woman.11 The matrilin- eal peraeko of the Kamoro may be considered the counterpart of Asmat afayis  cokom, literally ‘grandfather one’, those who have a father’s father in common  (Zegwaard and Boelaars 1955:286); this group is exogamous and patrilateral.  The Kamoro and the Asmat share a low importance of lineal descent reckon- ing and an absence of named lineages exceeding three generations. The reason for the (statistical) difference between matri-oriented Kamoro  and patri-oriented Asmat could, and in my opinion should, be sought in a  different style of political affiliation (see below). Adding to this difference is  the fact that the Kamoro recognize and practise a clear distinction between  superior bride-givers and inferior bride-receivers, combined with a preference  for matrilocal marriage. In my description of Kamoro rituals, the special posi- tion of bride-receivers stands out. They are obliged to render a wide variety of  services for their bride-givers, for which they are explicitly rewarded. Matri- uxorilocal residence comes in very handy in such a situation. The special  position of Asmat bride-receivers seems to be overruled by the strong and  structurally fundamental emphasis on brothers. Though less conspicuous,  among the Asmat the bride-receivers still occupy a rather special position. For  instance, Asmat bride-receivers are required to assist in weaving masks for the  benefit of their bride-givers. It is their duty to unveil a carved bow commis- sioned by their bride-givers to honour and avenge the death of a relative. Last  but not least, bride-receivers are called upon to assist their bride-givers in acts  of revenge during battles (Zegwaard 1959:1031).  Residential aggregates and political affiliations Kamoro, Sempan and Asmat settlements consist of a varying number of  localized descent groups in various combinations.12 The residential override  of these aggregates is apparent from the literal meanings of their generic  11 For a striking persistence, compare Pouwer 1955a:76-80 and Harple 2000:234-6. 12 For more detailed descriptions, see Pouwer 1955a:85-107; Zegwaard and Boelaars 1955:244- 99, 1970:13-31; Van Arsdale 1975:10-2. </page> <page sequence="13"> VI  The theory of comparison and the context of the rituals 107 names: taparu (Kamoro), yahe se (Sempan), yew se (Asmat). Taparu derives  from tapare, meaning ‘ground, territory’; ‘taparu tapare enokoa’ means ‘taparu  and tapare are one’. The linguistically closely related Sempan and Asmat  terms literally mean ‘longhouse mud’. ‘Mud’ refers to the mud-slab fireplace  that prevents the fire from eating into the floor of the men’s house. Each  of the many doors in the longhouse corresponds to a fireplace (Zegwaard  and Boelaars 1970:17). Yew se and yahe se stand for the men’s longhouse, for  the men’s group, and by extension for the family dwellings around it and  the associated kin group. The Kamoro have no separate men’s longhouse,  although there is some evidence for the pre-colonial existence of a special  house (ate) for unmarried males (Van der Schoot 1969:36). In pre-colonial  times they did have semi-permanent longhouses, situated upstream from the  settlement and divided into (extended) family apartments, each with its own  fireplace. In addition, there were and are temporary sites of simple, easily  movable, matted family shelters near sago and fishing grounds. Quite frequently, names of taparu are identical with or derive from the  names of the territories they live on or once lived on; some of these names  refer to features of the landscape. Other names refer to human beings, animals,  birds, plants or natural phenomena featuring in narratives. These, however,  are not considered ancestors, but may be associated with particular taparu or  sets of taparu in terms of mythical power or ritual functions ascribed to mem- bers of the taparu. There is no evidence of totemism. In a survey and a census including all Kamoro and Sempan settlements, I  noted 160 taparu encompassing 8,500 people, which implies that the average  size of a taparu is small (Pouwer 1955a:88). Although some names were identi- cal or similar, a genealogical connection between two similarly named taparu  was usually unknown or denied. Segmentation is conspicuously absent, in  spite of frequent dispersion of persons and groups. Fragmentation is the rule.  Residential override is so strong that interlocal genealogical ties easily lapse.  One consequence of this is that, with the exception of cases of regular interlo- cal intermarriage, men or women originating from one village who settle in  another village, for marriage or other reasons, may consider each other peraeko  or close kin, irrespective of known or unknown genealogical or taparu con- nections, solely on the grounds that they have their settlement of origin in  common.13 In keeping with the trend of increasing size of settlements going from north- west to southeast, the size of taparu east of Kaokonao and of the Sempan yahe  se tends to be larger. Everywhere, taparu of limited size tend to be exogamous.  They have a core of peraeko sets, which consider themselves closely related,  13 For a detailed case, see Pouwer 1955a:86. </page> <page sequence="14"> 108 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua even though genealogical interconnections are hardly known. In larger taparu,  such as in the Wania region and in Sempan villages, the number of constitu- ent peraeko sets is bigger and their genealogical relationships further removed.  These units tend to be non-exogamous. Everywhere, marriage within the settle- ment, or within the river-bound association of settlements, is preferred. The Asmat conforms with these trends in its own special way. A yew has at  least 150 members, usually more (Zegwaard 1955:241). A men’s house may be  as long as 50 to 90 metres and may have ten or more doors and corresponding  fireplaces, owned by ‘brothers’. Their related families live around it in ten or  more compartments of longhouses. Though the typical community includes  several men’s houses, each yew is a potential village (Eyde 1967:109). In a  similar vein, some of my Kamoro informants in East Mimika labelled taparu  as kampung (Indonesian: village). Van Amelsvoort (1964:39) reports that an  Asmat man strongly identifies with his yew, but feels little loyalty to the  community or village. Though less conspicuous, among the Asmat the bride- receivers still occupy a rather special position. A yew differs from a taparu in  that it consists of named moieties, aypim (literally ‘halves’). Each moiety has  and builds its own half of the men’s house and its adjoining row of (lower)  family longhouses. One moiety relates to the other as the root of a sago palm  to its shoots (Eyde 1967:98-100; Voorhoeve 1965:31). Their relative position  is one of superior downstream to inferior upstream, even if the factual geo- graphical position is the reverse of this because of fission of moieties or yew.  Marriage is ideally aypim-exogamous and yew-endogamous. An actual analy- sis of Shuru by Zegwaard and Boelaars in 1953 (Zegwaard and Boelaars 1955,  1970) shows that more than half of the marriages are within the yew. Exchange  of women may be and often is delayed in time and generation within a yew,  but is usually not delayed outside a yew.  Coastal, downstream and midstream Asmat settlements, with 400 to 1,400  inhabitants, have three to five yew, whereas settlements situated further  inland, often considerably smaller in size, have even more yew, sometimes up  to fourteen (Van Amelsvoort 1964:39, 190-1). In West Mimika we also noticed  that smaller settlements tend to have relatively more taparu.14 In my opinion  the reason for this remarkable paradox is that smaller settlements and smaller  yew/taparu go together with a larger dispersion of smaller wild sago stands  and more numerous semi-cultivated sago groves. A larger concentration of  largely wild sago stands favours larger settlements, and a smaller number  but bigger size of yew/taparu. In a valuable comparative analysis of Kamoro  and Asmat settlement patterns and demographic data based on missionaries’  and government information and his own and my research, Eyde concludes  14 See for details Pouwer 1955a:284-6. </page> <page sequence="15"> VI  The theory of comparison and the context of the rituals 109 that ‘[t]he maximum stable units of Kawenak and Keenakap life [surround- ings and western hinterland of Central Asmat Flamingo Bay, respectively] are  twice as large as those of the Keenok [northwest inland Asmat], and twice as  large as those of the Kamoro’ (Eyde 1967:148). He continues: It is everywhere [in Asmat] the case that the largest villages on a river are located  in its middle course. The villages towards the coast are somewhat smaller; those  inland are usually very much smaller. This middle zone represents, in general, the  optimum balance between tidal swamp and fresh water swamp. It can, therefore,  support a relatively larger population than areas downstream or upstream. (Eyde  1976:155.) In my view this observation also applies to East Mimika and to Sempan. This ecological interaction has important implications: the more manpower  per yew and (association of) taparu, the stronger their political/military poten- tial. Whether and to what extent and for what purpose this potential is real- ized is another matter. It is in these areas where the rivers are wide and long that  competition for sago and fishing areas between unrelated groups residing up and  downstream from one another has resulted in the development of a state of inten- sive warfare, which is not duplicated in the western Kamoro and Casuarine Coast,  where the rivers are short and groups possess territories comprising both tidal  swamp [fish] and fresh water swamp [sago]. Increased solidarity of males result- ing from cooperation in intensive warfare has led to the development of men’s  houses or bachelors’ houses [Yeenok]. [...] These are absent among the Kamoro  and on the southern Casuarine Coast. (Eyde 1967:304.) Wars were not absent in Mimika, but lacked the intensity and virulence of  Asmat warfare. Unlike Asmat wars, Mimika wars were not a regular feature  or obsession of daily life. This takes us to the territorial and political affiliations between self-con- tained local aggregates. Although Kamoro taparu are not divided internally  into moieties, they do tend to operate in dualistic, river-bound groups, which  in my PhD thesis (1955a) I named ‘tribes’. The taparu of an association used  to live together in a semi-permanent settlement (later reconstituted and some- times reshuffled in government-styled villages). Such a settlement is either  divided into wards per taparu or into named parishes, each comprising a  varying number of taparu. In the course of my fieldwork I counted 50 asso- ciations, each constituting a security circle. Three of them no longer exist; 21  consist of two taparu; the remainder are parishes, which, like the Asmat yew  halves, relate as downstream to upstream. Some of these parishes are even  subdivided into spatially marked sub-halves. These associations are usually  not named. </page> <page sequence="16"> 110 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua In their turn many adjacent settlements are federated in pairs. Some federa- tions include more than two settlements. There are 15 paired settlements, and  four associations that include more than two settlements. The latter, plus two  paired ones, each have a name of their own. These six affiliations, with consid- erable numerical strength and guided by one or more powerful ‘big men’ (we  ayku), pulled their weight in warfare.15 The Asmat federations are similar to the Kamoro ones, but there is a dif- ference in scale due to the larger size of the components. A systematic sur- vey of affiliated settlements is sadly lacking but some are at least known by  name, such as – going from northwest to southeast – Emo-Espeno, Ac-Nakay,  Yamas-Yeni, Yaun-Yufri, Saowa-Erma, Per-Owus, Aman-Namkai. Fortunately  Zegwaard provides a unique, fairly detailed description of the oral history of  affiliations of the Bismam group at Flamingo Bay, in particular those of Shuru,  where he lived in 1953.16 For locations, see maps 2 and 3. When the grandfathers of the present (in 1953) grandfathers were young,  the inhabitants of the paired yew Ewer-Shuru lived downstream and the  Uwus-Per upstream in one settlement on the upper reaches of the Bow River,  above present-day Owus. The culture hero Beworipic and his wife Tewerawoc  are said to have founded this settlement (Van Arsdale 1975). Headhunting and  its associated ritual are ascribed to him and his brother Desopic.17 The Bayit,  now forming a yew within Shuru, then lived elsewhere on the Bow River. At  that time the paired settlements of the Yepem and Kaye yew were located  respectively near and on the upper reaches of the Mani River (upstream of  the present Per, Van Arsdale 1975). The Yepem now lived at the mouth of the  Yomat; they had migrated there from the Citak region. Then the upper Bow group began to split up. A man from Shuru killed a  man from Amborep. This triggered a brawl about the dead body, a trophy  for ritual headhunting festivities. The Owus snatched the body but the Shuru  took it back. A Shuru man was wounded and, by way of retaliation, an Owus  man was beaten up. The Owus then spread the rumour – a common political  strategy – that this man had died. After a fight the frightened Shuru-Ewer took  to their heels and fled to the mouth of the Bow River, later to the Ba River near  Shuru’s present location. Owus realigned with the yew of Seper at about the present location of  Owus, whereas Per moved to the upper Mani and associated with Kaye. Some  time later, warfare broke out between the former allies: Owus-Seper against  15 For more detailed information about associations, see Pouwer 1955a:90-1.

Kaye’s warleader died, causing dissolution of Kaye and the mix- ing of its people with other Bismam settlements, particularly Shuru-Ewer. A  present-day remainder of Kaye’s influence in Shuru is the moiety of Bayen of  the Shuru yew Awor (Van Arsdale 1975). Then Ewer-Shuru split apart after a Shuru man raped an Ewer woman. In  the ensuing retaliation by Ewer, the woman’s father was wounded and died.  Eco pok, signs of revenge, were erected. The two parties, anticipating killing  and counter-killing, then agreed to pull out. They moved to their present loca- tions. In 1904, when the ship ‘Flamingo’ sailed along the coast of Central Asmat,  the Shuru stayed on their own at the present location of the Faramap River,  whereas the Ewer lived at the mouth of the adjacent Ba River (Van Kessel 1962).  Ewer associated with two other yew, which at a later stage dissolved and were  incorporated into yet another yew, a new one (Van Arsdale 1975). At the time of the Ewer-Shuru split, the settlement of Shuru consisted of the  Ndendew yew (Nano yew in Zegwaard and Boelaars 1970:15) with its moie- ties Ndendew and Onom. In the course of time a number of fissions occurred,  which I present in a diagram (Figure 4) for the sake of clarity: (a) a newly  founded yew, Setmut, splitting up into Setmut-Ar; (b) Awor splitting up into  Awor-Bayen; (b1) and (b2) temporary dual splits of Awor and Bayen respec- tively, which did not last; (c1) and (c2) temporary dual splits of first Onom and  then Ndendew, which did not last either, for lack of numerical strength; then  Ndendew and Onom reunited; (d) Ar splitting up into Ar-Baser; (e) Setmut  splitting up into Setmut-Yismak. All these fissions resulted from conflicts of  one kind or another. So in 1953 the settlement of Shuru consisted of the mother yew Ndendew  (-Onom) and five daughter yew deriving directly or indirectly from her. The  moieties placed left in the compartments of the diagram give their name to the  yew concerned. They relate to their partner moieties as downstream-superior  to upstream-inferior. Ndendew-Onom and its Awor-Bayen branch (b) lived  together downstream and related as superior to upstream Sotomot-Ar in their  original settlement on the river. Bayit-Wauco originated from the Momac River and joined Shuru after a  number of moves. Along with a few people of the Awor moiety (Bayen), Bayit- Wauco are the only ones not deriving from Ndendew.  We may conclude from the data that residential override and modalities  of spatially expressed dual division – also operating clearly in ritual – domi- nate and permeate not only the social pattern but also the dynamics of the  three societies concerned. Their constituents, kinship, (cumulative) filiation –  descent, if you like – genealogical knowledge and genealogical relations, and  marriage patterns (though all of these are social phenomena and forces in their  own right) are clearly conditioned by residential override and dual division.  The latter provide an anchor for the instability brought about by endemic con- </page> <page sequence="18"> 112 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua SETMUT            YISMAK AR                        BASER   ↑  e   ↑  d         a SETMUT           AR      →              b AWOR               BAYEN  NDENDEW       ONOM    →   b ⊥1                      b2 ⊥         c NDENDEW       ONOM     →    c ⊥1                      c ⊥2   f from BAYIT               WAUTSJO  else-  where    Map 4. Fission and fusion of yew in the Asmat settlement of Shuru flicts, warfare, and subsequent shifts in domicile and affiliation. The carrying capacity – an ecological interaction of individuals and com- munities with their physical environment as defined, articulated and signified  in a dialectical process – tends to condition the differential manpower and  associated political power of the communities, gradually gaining strength  from northwest (Etna Bay) to southeast (Casuarinen Coast), particularly in the  coastal and downstream regions. However, these two types of conditioning, socio-political and existential,  do not determine the total configuration of the socio-cultural formations con- cerned. First of all, each type of conditioning is in itself an open, never-ending  dialectical process between people being conditioned and at the same time  acting as conditioners through their articulating and signifying social practice.  More especially, their symbolizing capacity, the complement and counterpart  of carrying capacity, provides the social formation with its central impetus.  It is this impetus which turns the (semi-)autonomous components of a social  formation into a totality: it literally con-figurates them in a never-ending,  </page> <page sequence="19"> VI  The theory of comparison and the context of the rituals 113 never-closed, dialectical process. Its very ‘totalizing’ nature provides this cen- tral institution with multiple faces. Therefore, if it is observed that a particular  social institution has multiple functions, this may indicate that the institution  operates as what Marcel Mauss called a ‘total social fact’, taken here to mean  a totalizer that functions as a cultural focus. In modern Western societies the multiple faces and functions of the econ- omy mark it as a totalizer. It seems to me that the Asmat social formation  differs from the Kamoro one in that endemic political rivalry and warfare –  spearheaded by headhunting – act as a totalizing force. The evidence for my  suggestion is provided by Zegwaard (1959). He concludes from his descrip- tion of headhunting that it should be evaluated in the light of a complicated  set of factors, which he spells out (Zegwaard 1959:1041). In other words,  headhunting has many faces; these will be discussed in a separate section  in Chapter XI. Cannibalism is merely a secondary part of this (Zegwaard  1959:1020). Meanwhile, it should be noted that the virulent, violent nature of  rivalry and warfare and headhunting can easily turn this totalizer into its very  opposite: a fragmentizer, even a self-killer. The dog bites her own tail in deadly  dialectics. The Shuru case, and other Asmat ethnographic and historical evi- dence, supplies us with ample examples. Knauft concludes from a worldwide  ethnographic tabulation that the Asmat killing rate is among the highest in  the world (Knauft 1993:194). Numerous settlements have been wiped out  or dispersed, or have seen their remnants absorbed into other communities.  Zegwaard knows of 20 yew, or communities of yew, which have been wiped  out or dispersed. The settlement of Kaimes, which had about 400 inhabit- ants at the time of the Military Exploration (1910-1913), no longer existed in  the 1940s. Only 20 persons who trace their descent to it survive, having been  assimilated by Ewer. From personal experience during his first stay in Shuru  (1945-1947), Zegwaard reports 61 confirmed casualties, 56 of them having  been eaten by Shuru’s enemies: 16 men, 18 women, 22 children out of a total  population of 675. At that time Shuru was a favourite target because it had  lost physical strength as a result of the Japanese killing of 21 married men and  one bachelor. During his second stay, in 1953, Zegwaard had personal knowl- edge of 83 casualties in one year, due to headhunting between settlements in a  50-kilometre semi-circle around Flamingo Bay. He estimated that about 2 per  cent of the population per year was killed by war and headhunting (Zegwaard  1977:22-5). A striking example of the relation between differential carrying capacity on  the one hand, and differential symbolizing capacity on the other, is provided  by the difference (alongside the similarity) in impact of the consumption of  sago shoots or sago hearts (known in Western countries as palmite or million- aire’s cabbage), and of sago grubs. Throughout the region these forest products  are highly valued as delicacies. Since they are an important source of protein,  </page> <page sequence="20"> 114 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua they add considerably to the carrying capacity of the physical environment.  Sago grubs are even ‘cultivated’, by felling sago trees, cutting the trunk into  chunks, and opening these up to the pith inside, in order to better enable the  capricorn beetles to lay their eggs. Maturing takes four to six weeks. There is more to these delicacies: they function throughout the region as  a social good (biens sociaux). In the entire Kamoro-Asmat region a lover may  express his – or more particularly her – feelings towards the object of affection  by secretly offering a serving of fresh or fried sago grubs. Furthermore, almost  any distribution of food during ceremonies and rituals, including the remu- neration of services offered (especially the services of bride-receivers), involves  giving or exchanging sago shoots and sago grubs. The Asmat, however, unlike  the Kamoro and Sempan, tend towards a seemingly excessive consumption of  the two. Zegwaard reports that hundreds of sago palms, presumably the more  highly valued young ones, were felled in Shuru in 1953 for the acquisition of  sago shoots and the cultivation of sago grubs, on the occasion of the ceremo- nial inauguration of a new men’s house. At that time Shuru had about 650  inhabitants.18 Father Alphonse Sowada, attending a similar ceremony in Ac,  with a population of over 1,300 in late 1969, counted somewhere between 700  and 900 sago shoots.19 In the course of another, related ceremony, Tow Mbu,  a huge funnel-shaped tube about three metres long with a diameter of at least  one metre at its top, is filled with hundreds of sago grubs. During the Kaware  celebration of the Kamoro, both similar to and different from Tow Mbu, sago  grubs also feature in a ceremony, but not in this way, nor in such huge quanti- ties. In the 1950s Sempan villagers in East Mimika complained about Asmat  invaders ruining their sago groves while searching for sago shoots. According  to the oral history of the Bismam group of Asmat, and the Kamoro narrative  of the great migration as discussed earlier, a scarcity of sago stands and fam- ine are important reasons for temporary or permanent migrations, hostilities  and wars.20 In the light of the excessive consumption of these social goods,  one wonders whether this scarcity is due not only to poor quality sago (Van  Arsdale 1975), but also to human causes, namely excessive felling and overex- ploitation for the sake of sago shoots and sago grubs. Why this excessive Asmat consumption of social goods? The answer may  be found in their connection with rivalry and warfare as a totalizer of the  Asmat socio-cultural formation. In addition to having an emotional and social  function, these delicacies also have a crucial symbolic meaning. Zegwaard  describes the symbolic meaning for the Asmat – and probably also for the  Kamoro – of sago grubs in particular, as spiritual power-food: it provides the  18 Zegwaard 1988b, in a – critical – comment on Schneebaum 1985:105. 19 Sowada 1970:37; for the ceremony, Firao Wu, see Chapter XI. 20 For Bismam, see Van Arsdale 1975:55. </page> <page sequence="21"> VI  The theory of comparison and the context of the rituals 115 many minor spirits (Asmat: nam yipi, Kamoro: ipu), located in particular in the  joints which keep the body moving, with strength and vigour. Sago shoots  and sago grubs are consumed in large quantities by Asmat prior to and after  an attack. A related function of the sago grub for the Asmat is that its smell,  together with the strong odour of a smoking stick rubbed with the fat of a  cassowary, is believed to attract the souls (nam yipi) of the leaders of a hostile  village. Their bodies will follow their souls, so that they will be an easy prey  for the men with the ‘smoking guns’.21 Every Asmat moiety and yew has a key figure. The extent of his influence  is based, in addition to kinship, on his personality and his abilities (or lack  thereof) as political spokesman, as primus inter pares. His political power and  the protection he offers may affect the residential pattern in that followers, irre- spective of kinship status, may wish to settle near him. Outstanding ‘big men’  (tesmaypic) almost literally embody the totalizing impetus of rivalry and war- fare. The famous ‘big man’, warleader, and successful headhunter Warsekomen  of Shuru, a key informant for Zegwaard in 1953 and still an important man in  1970 in spite of his age, is a prime example.22 His power was determined by the  following factors: 1. leadership of his yew Ar and the closely associated yew  Setmot, which together constituted almost half (45%) of Shuru’s inhabitants; 2.  his marriage to seven wives from other yew; 3. his being a partner in a ritual  wife swapping (papish, see Chapter XI) by six men; 4. his relations with brothers  and sisters and their offspring; 5. his ties with relatives in four other settlements;  6. the shamanistic abilities (namer ow) of his wives (see below); 7. his abilities as  an organizer and leader of ritual; 8. his strong personality and intelligence; and  9. his thorough knowledge of narratives and history. All these factors enabled  him to mobilize a maximum of material resources and manpower for warfare  and headhunting. His many marriages gave him extra access to sago groves  and fishing grounds. He acquired and boasted of a considerable number of  captured heads in battles with various settlements. Admittedly, Kamoro and Sempan also had their warleaders of repute.  Like Asmat history, Kamoro and Sempan oral history after the great trek is  marked by skirmishes and battles between settlements (or federations of set- tlements) and subsequent resettling. Yet there is a difference in frequency,  scale, ferocity, and number of casualties. Most importantly, headhunting was  not part of Kamoro and Sempan history. Similar to Asmat, Kamoro rivalries  could also erupt within a settlement; likewise, casualties within a settlement  were low and were preferably avoided. In Tipuka (Wania River, East Mimika)  I recorded a vivid story, apparently also meant as entertainment, describing  21 See Zegwaard’s 1988b comments on Schneebaum in Konrad, Konrad and Schneebaum  1981:109, 179; for more details, see description of Firao Wu and Tow Mbu ritual. 22 See a comment by Trenkenschuh in Zegwaard and Boelaars 1970:18. </page> <page sequence="22"> 116 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua Star-shaped stone head of a club collected by Kal  Muller in Ipiri, November 2006. Photograph by  Kal Muller. how an indecent love affair by a young couple, engaged in public banter- ing and mutual scratching, deteriorated into a full-scale, full-day brawl into  which everybody was gradually drawn (Pouwer 1953a, Appendix XXV). The  combatants were initially hitting out with any piece of wood at hand, but soon  replaced these with professional clubs (mapipu) consisting of a shaft inserted  into the round hole of a heavy, star-shaped stone. Everybody sustained cuts  and bruises, though there were no casualties. Nobody could walk properly  any more, but still the clubbing went on, even while sitting and lying down.  Nevertheless, the story has it that at the end, the lover boy was carried around  the settlement on the shoulders of the fighters, and the sticks and clubs were  thrown onto a heap, signalling the end of the brawl. People of a nearby settle- ment treated the wounds with leaves and provided the exhausted combatants  with pork and sago grubs. The very same Tipuka, however, was attacked and decimated in a full-scale  battle in about 1900, which is well remembered throughout Mimika. At that  time, together with downstream Atuka, it was the most powerful community  of the Wania region. Its people were at odds with its host neighbours on the  Wania River and with nearby communities on the Koperapoka River east of  them. Initially they had lived there – after migrating from an area east of the  Mimika region – but they pulled out after they had killed a man of the Buka  parish during a joint celebration of Kaware. They overpowered their host  neighbours during numerous conflicts, involving among other things the  exploitation of sago groves they were not entitled to. So there was plenty of  willingness in surrounding communities, even communities on the Kamora  River, to teach the Tipukans a lesson and break their power. When the Tipuka  </page> <page sequence="23"> VI  The theory of comparison and the context of the rituals 117 New seagoing canoe fabricated by Poraoko people (far western Mimika) in exchange  for permission to gather sago.

Photograph by Jan Pouwer.  men, in the final stages of their celebration of Kaware, left their settlement  at the beach to go on a pig hunt, a war party of allied neighbours took this  opportunity to attack the village. This war party killed the older women and  imprisoned the younger ones and children. Tipuka men were also killed or  caught; they fled in all directions. The aftermath of the battle saw Tipukans  scatter throughout the area; many are known to have been traded as far as  Arguni Bay west of Mimika. Descendants of the imprisoned men and women  can still be found in the Koperapoka, Wania and Kamora settlements. In my  1952 census of Tipuka only 130 inhabitants were registered.23 Significantly, my informants throughout Mimika attributed the joint, mas- sive action against Tipuka not to political threats or violations of claims to  23 On the Tipuka war, see Pouwer 1953b:46; Coenen 1963:5; Harple 2000:106-7. </page> <page sequence="24"> 118 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua sago groves but to anger at Tipuka men for having been careless in keep- ing Kaware secrets hidden. Because of the men’s carelessness, these secrets  came to the attention of female guests attending the Kaware ceremony. Even  if this argument was used merely as a pretext, it does point to the supreme  value attached to safeguarding sacred ritual. It is firmly believed by men and  women alike that violation of ritual taboos endangers the society (and the  status of males). In my discussion of Ema Kame I mentioned that fears for  people’s health were expressed because of the inclusion of a ceremonial play  in a programme celebrating the Queen’s Anniversary. And when the wives of  my houseboys accidentally noticed the pointed bottom of a used spirit pole  stored behind my house in Kaokonao, before I dispatched it to the National  Museum of Ethnology at Leiden, their husbands were terrified and concerned  about their wives’ health. A specialist ritually cleansed these women by means  of a spell. Finally, my informants in Ipiri and Yaraya criticized the performers  of the spirit platform ritual in Kaokonao in 1954 (see Chapter V), for not suf- ficiently safeguarding secrets from women’s curiosity. For me as an observer, the reason stated for the massive attack on Tipuka  around 1900 and the fears described to me in 1954 are just a few of many  indications of the viability of the ritual cycle’s function as the focus and as a  totalizer of Kamoro society and culture. Returning now to the carrying capacity of the physical environment, this  forms a condition for a given group’s manpower and political power. Going  from northwest to southeast, the groups gain in strength. Even so, precisely  in the far western part of Mimika where, due to a receding hinterland, wild  and semi-cultivated sago stands are scarce, a politically powerful federation  of settlements operated under the collective name of Tarya We around 1900.  It included the fairly small settlements of Poraoka, Kipia, Maparpe, Wumuka  and also Umar and Ayndua. They operated together in acquiring access to  the sago stands of settlements east of them, down to Ipiri and Yaraya, often in  exchange for seagoing canoes and with a show of power. Their ‘big man’ and  ruthless, legendary warleader, considered the terror of Mimika, was Naowa,  well known and feared, from Etna Bay to as far as Central Mimika. This situ- ation seems to contradict the correlation between abundance of sago stands  and power. So where did Naowa’s power come from? The lack of natural resources and the scarcity of manpower were compen- sated for by the fact that the Tarya We occupied a key position in the Etna Bay  area in the acquisition of Western commodities in high demand, such as iron  tools, cloth, and body ornaments. Manpower was supplemented by firepower  through the acquisition of guns. A beach near Yaraya, west of Kaokonao,  was named Minaki Tiri (‘gun beach’, Pouwer 1955a:222) in commemoration  of an attack by a war party of Noawa, which killed locals with shotguns.  </page> <page sequence="25"> VI  The theory of comparison and the context of the rituals 119 By 1800 there was an Islamizing trade-centred network linking the western  part of Mimika with the Onin Peninsula on the southern side of the Bird’s  Head. There were even direct links between the West Mimika coast and the  Moluccan islands, interpreted by narratives in a Kamoro-centric way.24 Naowa  was appointed raja by the Islamic merchant-raja of Namatote, who had rela- tions with Seramese traders and officials, and in his turn empowered his  cronies at various settlements in West Mimika by granting them a plethora of  Moluccan titles. Kipia became a central location for Kamoro’s increasing appe- tite for ironware, tobacco and clothing. Tipuka, Atuka, and the Koperapoka  settlements in the far eastern part of Mimika traded women and children as  prisoners of war (manuku) to Naowa and to Etna Bay traders. Kaimana had  a Kamoro colony in the 1950s, originating from Kamoro slaves imported  there. Naowa and his allies attacked parties from Central and East Mimika,  travelling to the far western part of Mimika to acquire Western commodities.  He took quite a few Kamoro people captive, even stealing their captives and  freshly acquired ironware. Communities between Uta and Kaokonao fled  temporarily to the eastern Wania region, when Naowa treacherously attacked  them after a ceremony of reconciliation (Pouwer 1955a:222-3). Islamic com- mercial expansion, via the emergent Tarya We’s political affiliation, came to an  end with the gradual establishment of colonial rule and the arrival of Chinese  traders and the Roman Catholic Mission in its footsteps. Even so, in the 1950s  I noticed some survivals of Moluccan-Islamic influence in West and Central  Mimika. Village elders still claimed Moluccan titles such as raja, mayor and  hakim. They had a predilection for wearing a topi by way of turban, and had  at least the stated intention not to eat pork (Pouwer 1955a:255). One may conclude from this comparative analysis of political affiliations  that three cultural configurations – Central Asmat, Central and East Kamoro,  and far-west Kamoro – have many traits in common, yet differ significantly in  dominant orientation: they are similar yet different. It is obvious that natural  resources and history (wars, migrations and trading) played their part in the  emergence and differentiation of these orientations in a dialectics of the exis- tential with the symbolic dimension of the social formation. Pervasiveness of dual organization Most of the multiple modalities of dual organization were discussed in the  previous chapter. Bipartition also underlies the organization of Kamoro,  Sempan and Asmat rituals, including the organization of the guild of drum- 24 See Harple 2000:102-5, citing Drabbe 1947-50:258. </page> <page sequence="26"> 120 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua mers and singers. Rituals and drumming are used first in performances of  the ‘right’ (Kamoro: mbaowooko) party or person, followed by performances  of the counterpart (Kamoro: aopao), the ‘left’ (Kamoro: pakare) party. ‘Right’  usually relates to ‘left’ as root/bottom to branch/surface, on the analogy of a  tree. ‘Bottom’ stands for origin or prior entitlement, ‘surface’ for derived or  secondary entitlement. This also holds for Sempan and Asmat. The relation- ship between the two parties, though asymmetric and characterized by com- petition, is basically one of repetition and of complementarity. The Kamoro  even conceive of the human body as a complementary duality; significantly,  the right part is associated with the mother, the left part with the father.  Although the division by gender seems commonplace and universal, it  must, just like sexuality, ‘be analyzed as part of a whole, contextual, social  tradition’.25 This is strikingly apparent from the Kamoro division of rituals  into ‘female’ and ‘male’ ones, as discussed in Chapters II and III. Gender func- tions as a pervasive ritual totalizer. Among the Asmat such a division is not  as explicit, but is nevertheless present. The location of all rituals, except Emak  Cem, the counterpart of Kamoro ‘female’ Ema Kame, is the men’s house. Emak  Cem is the only ritual with a ceremonial house (cem) of its own. Its origin, as  well as the origin of the wuramun or uramun, the spirit canoe, on top of which  the Emak Cem initiation of male adolescents takes place, are attributed to  the two crucial culture-hero brothers (or cousins) Kurap and Sarawap. They  built the first-ever ceremonial house according to the instructions of their two  mothers, who relate as sisters and are represented as snake women (ancestral  mothers). In the upstream Kapi version these women even build the house  themselves. Furthermore, two female dignitaries unveil the spirit canoe when  the ritual is performed; they, not the men, also lift it up at the start of the ini- tiation.26 Yet ‘male’ rituals dominate among the Asmat, whereas ‘female’ ones  are preponderant among the Kamoro and Sempan. Asmat ‘male’ stands for  virility, Kamoro ‘female’ for production, reproduction, and fertility. Male and female status, though obviously a component of the broader  socio-cultural division by gender, deserves a separate discussion. In this  discussion I follow Knauft (1993:86-116), Herdt (1984:66), Feil (1987:170) and  Sanday (1981), considering female status as reflected in: 1. women’s sexual  and marital choices; 2. female acquisition of and control over culturally valued  property; 3. female participation in public affairs and ritual celebrations; 4.  incidence of female pollution and images of women; and 5. incidence of wife- beating and domestic violence. Unmarried Kamoro women are very active in arranging secret meetings  25 Herdt 1984 on sexuality, cited by Knauft 1993:9. 26 For a more detailed description of the Asmat Emak Cem ritual, see Chapter VII. </page> <page sequence="27"> VI  The theory of comparison and the context of the rituals 121 with men in the sago areas using verbal and body language, directly and often  indirectly. To what extent these secret meetings lead to betrothal and mar- riage is, however, decided by the relatives of the romantic couple. The young  man and young woman do have a say in the decision though. Nevertheless,  since marriage is a social event requiring sister exchange, preferred as the  ideally ‘right’ marriage to a ‘left’ marriage by brideprice, individual sexual or  marital choice is overshadowed by considerations emanating from the rela- tion between bride-giver and bride-taker. Romantic choice and marital choice  may sometimes correspond, but often clash. There are three socially condoned  traditional ways out. First, marriage by elopement; this is not common since,  after the act, it requires a good deal of bargaining and personal strength.  Second, conceding to an arranged marriage, but combining it with a mara- koma relation; lovers’ relations are very common and are often a public secret.  Marriage by brideprice without sister exchange is a third option. Since access  to commodities greatly improved, first by early trading in West Mimika and  then by migrant labour, ‘left’ indirect exchange by brideprice (which allows  for more individual choice) has gained in frequency, according to my census  data. However, the superior position of the bride-giving party, irrespective of  ‘right’ or ‘left’ marriage, implies that a married man, especially if young, is  at a disadvantage vis-à-vis his bride-givers. This also reflects on his relation- ship with his wife, the more so since there is no end to a man’s obligations to  render labour, services and gifts to his bride-givers (though to some extent the  bride-givers return the favours). If a married man performs well in fulfilling  his obligations, the wife’s relatives are reluctant to interfere in domestic argu- ments, violence, and wife-beating, which do occur. Fairly often, though, inter- ference and beating are a matter of public theatrical performance, rather than  reality. I have also observed that wives use the options of withholding their  domestic and sexual services, extinguishing the domestic fireplace as a sign of  protest, or taking refuge with relatives. Older women are often strong-willed  and make a lot of fuss, causing roars of laughter. Asmat attitudes towards marriage are roughly similar. Asmat women, how- ever, are under the authority of their brothers; brothers are the most important  people for any adult person (Eyde 1967:211-303). An unmarried woman could  be beaten by her father or her brothers for promiscuity (Eyde 1967:22). The  fairly high number of marriages by elopement (worowos) in Zegwaard’s 1953  case study of Shuru – 48 out of 102 marriages (Zegwaard and Boelaars 1970:21)  – can be interpreted as a way to escape from severe constraints. Marriage by  elopement is surely not so common in Mimika, where a woman’s choice carries  more weight. It is interesting to note that one of the Asmat myths about the  mbish, the spirit statues, ascribes its origin to a culture-hero-in-love who carves  in wood his beloved wife in order to commemorate her during her absence  </page> <page sequence="28"> 122 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua or after her death.27 Women are drawn to aggressive men renowned for their  fierceness and their success in headhunting. Although a man may marry with- out having successfully participated in a man-hunt, he may be scolded by his  wife as a ‘bit of meat’ (nas minu), a man without spirit or courage, whenever she  gets fed up with him (Zegwaard 1959:1040). It is small wonder then, that, given  the preference for male aggression, wife-beating is quite common, without  intervention of her brothers (Eyde 1967:192). Marriage by bride-stealing (okore,  ‘stealing’) against her will is reported in Zegwaard’s 1952 sample (8 out of  102 marriages, Zegwaard and Boelaars 1970:21). This results in a terrible fight  between the two families. Abduction of wives without repayment is described  as rampant (Sowada 1961:87). I suspect that bride-stealing was occasionally  practised by the Kamoro, but evidence is meagre, and such practices rarely  occur in narratives. Marrying women captured in warfare did occur. An Asmat man is prone to extend his relational network by simultane- ous polygyny. This gives him access to women’s labour, and to their sago  groves, for the benefit of the logistics of warfare and mass food distribution.  In Zegwaard’s Shuru case study, there were 17 polygynous marriages com- pared to 59 monogamous ones. The number of wives ranged from two to six.  Zegwaard even knows of a ‘big man’ in Amborep who had 17 wives (Zegwaard  and Boelaars 1970:18-9). Second wives ‘may be little more than drudges’ (Eyde  1967:194). They have no direct access to their husband and are controlled by  his first and main wife. So there is some ironic dialectics in women being  drawn to aggressive men and polygynous leaders. Polygyny in Mimika is far  less frequent and usually restricted to two wives, since the Kamoro female  workforce is not connected with endemic warfare and headhunting. On the  other hand, at least in one universally known myth, dramatized in Ema Kame  ritual, women act as warriors, though dressed up and armed as male combat- ants – an ambivalent reversal of roles.28 The superior ‘women of the beginning’  rebel against the men who enjoy themselves for ages in the ceremonial nose- piercing house, secretly keeping the delicious food, such as fruits and pieces of  fatty meat, for themselves, fobbing the women off with inferior food and hav- ing them collect sago and shellfish in a dreary routine. The outraged women  wage war, kill a lot of men, abandon them, and depart for the far western part  of Mimika, passing over the foothills. They are said to be the ancestresses of  white foreigners. The abandoned men initially have to make do with boys and  shoots of bamboo impersonating wives, but are then united with anthropo- morphic female animals of the forest, the ancestresses of the present race. The  superior ‘women of the beginning’ are lost forever. 27 See Chapter X below; for the myth, see Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:245-9. 28 See Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:137-48, and the present volume (Chapter II) respectively. </page> <page sequence="29"> VI  The theory of comparison and the context of the rituals 123 One narrative (see Chapter I) is acted out in a ritual performed to ward off  the dreaded danger of men being turned into women and burdened with the  care of toddlers, as punishment for not properly looking after a wife who dies  in labour. In this ritual, still practised in the 1950s after the death of a woman  in labour, male actors, dressed up as the deceased mother and her female  assistant, attack a man acting as the careless husband, and his companions.29  These two narratives and associated rituals have not been reported for the  Asmat. However, Asmat men do consider women who die in labour to be  a real threat. Their spirits are known as dambir ow, with frightening looks, a  sharp nose, sharp teeth, long nails, and eyes as red as their hair. They take  revenge on men by carrying them to the underworld, where they torture them  to death with thorns (Sowada 1995a:70). Extension of Asmat men’s relational network by means of papish, that is,  establishing bonds between men by institutionalized wife swapping, is dis- cussed in Chapter XI. It does not occur among the Kamoro. As for acquisition of and control over valued property, Kamoro women  clearly have a powerful position. Wild sago groves, in as far as they are col- lectively owned, belong to specified peraeko, represented in public affairs by an  older brother and his real or putative younger brother. However, the female  members of the group must be consulted and they have an important say in  the exploitation of the groves and in allowing non-members access to these.  At home the female head of the household controls the sago bag or sago con- tainer: her children must seek her permission and her husband must notify her  when they wish to draw on the sago supply. Although a man officially owns  the canoe, his wife controls its actual use. Men explain the woman’s power  over the canoe by pointing out that it is she who uses the canoe to transport  the children and mats for roofing, sitting, and sleeping in the temporary huts  near fishing and sago grounds. It is mainly a woman’s job to pound sago, col- lect shellfish, and prepare food, but this applies equally to the Asmat. The gear  for pounding sago, though partly made by men, is the property of women.  Although men own axes and machetes, women have an important say in their  use, for they collect and carry wood to burn in the fireplace. A man carrying  wood on his back would make a fool of himself. Pandanus trees for matting  and other uses are owned by women. They also have control of the many  named tidal creeks (enata) fenced off by them, an important source of fish.30  Even exclusively male property, such as drums, cannot or at least should not  be disposed of without consulting older females. Information about Asmat female property rights is sketchy. Central Asmat  29 For details of the narrative and the ritual, see Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:148-50, and  Pouwer 1987:36-8. 30 For detailed information about property, see Pouwer 1955a:146-51. </page> <page sequence="30"> 124 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua call the husbands, not the wives, the owners (ar arat ow) of sago or fishing  areas to which they have gained rights by marriage. Just as a sister is given to  her husband, so are her sago paths and fishing areas.31 The ceremonial names  given to women usually do not derive from their own, but from their husband’s  kin group. Women could, however, inherit rights to important song cycles.32 As for female participation in public affairs and ritual celebrations, Asmat  women’s part in rituals is not as complementary and integral as among the  Kamoro. Among both Kamoro and Asmat, older women can sit in on male  public discussions and raise objections. As for the incidence of female pollution, both Kamoro and Asmat men  steer free of menstruating women and women in childbirth, considering these  to be women’s secrets,33 but fear of pollution does not seem to be explicit.  Asmat men attribute sorcery exclusively to women (Knauft 1993:101) and  ‘generally assume that women are hostile to them’ (Eyde 1967:147). Kamoro  men do not. In both societies, antagonism between the sexes is playfully but  aggressively acted out in horseplay (Kamoro: akapa; Asmat: akap, ‘laughing,  joking’). However, one should distinguish between the horseplay and jok- ing practised by bride-givers and bride-receivers on the one hand, and that  between groups of males and females on the other. The latter is named imu by  Kamoro as well as Asmat. Both kinds of joking, often going together, are part  and parcel of rituals.34 Cosmology The Kamoro and the Asmat share a dualistic representation of the universe  that distinguishes between the complementary opposites of upper world and  underworld (Asmat: safan). Its conceptualization is anthropomorphic though  not anthropocentric. Humans share life with their natural environment in an  intricate system of classifications, differentiated and united by the principle  of ipu enakoa, as described by Coenen (1963:22-59, in particular pp. 32-3, 36-9,  43-8). This principle enables its believers to pull the strings of the universe,  to manipulate the system of connections between phenomena to their own  advantage. They do so in everyday life, for instance in their healing practices,  but in particular by means of rituals, as described for the Kamoro in Part  One. There is a difference, though, between Kamoro and Asmat: the Kamoro  manipulate the system with special emphasis on livelihood, fertility and  31 Eyde 1967:255, as quoted by Knauft 1993:101. 32 Van Arsdale n.y.:14; Van Arsdale and Van Arsdale 1991:20, as quoted by Knauft 1993:101. 33 Pouwer 1955a:174; Eyde 1967:89, 147, as quoted by Knauft 1993:101. 34 For joking relations among the Kamoro, see Pouwer 1958, 1964. </page> <page sequence="31"> VI  The theory of comparison and the context of the rituals 125 health, whereas the Asmat do so specifically for the sake of warfare and self- defence. This difference corresponds with a difference in cultural orientation,  as pointed out in this chapter. Man-in-his-natural-environment is encircled and encapsulated by the com- plementary opposites of upper world and underworld. The landscape of the  underworld is viewed as similar to the world where humans live, except that  the underworld has paradisal abundance and marvellous beaches. The dead  are in the underworld, in locations similar to settlements of living humans in  the world-in-between. When humans die, their souls travel upstream, follow  the foot of the mountains, and descend to the underworld along the pathway  of the sun. The upper world beyond the mountains and the clouds is primarily the  seat of the aloof and respectable hero of the sun, Kumurupi (Kamoro) or  Anemar Ipic (Zegwaard n.y.c, n.y.d), and addressed – at least by the Kamoro  – by the kinship term noopa (grandfather), expressing both respect and famili- arity. His bride-receivers, that is, his daughters’ and sisters’ husbands, the  mythical sun people (yao we), live on the borders of the upper world in the  far eastern and far western parts of Mimika, on the other side of a wide river  and the sea, where the sun sets. The culture hero, carrying the sun as a torch,  ascends to and descends from the firmament on the shoulders of his bride- receivers. These move the sun from east to west with ropes (rays), and assist  the culture hero when he travels by canoe (or motor car, in a modern version)  through the underworld from west to east in order to rise again in the morn- ing. The hero of the sun takes pride of place in Kamoro and Asmat cosmology.  In Mimika the sun dance and sun ritual at sunrise mark a sacred moment.  The sun dignitary directs wild pigs to the bait. The fish dignitary invokes  the sun, addressing him as The Old Man. The sago dignitary asks the sun to  shine on sago palms in order to promote growth. In the ‘banner’ (or ‘wing’) of  the Kamoro and Asmat spirit pole, a round, open hole represents the ‘house  of the father’, the seat of the sun. The hero of the sun is invoked as a solemn  witness when lifting food taboos. The sun is said to be the war leader, accord- ing to Coenen. After the taboo on drinking water is lifted, young initiates  pour out water for the sun. Coenen rightly considers the hero of the sun to  be a primus inter pares, rather than a supreme being or high god. A sun cult  does not exist (Coenen 1963:83-4; Pouwer 2002:33-4). The hero of the moon,  Paotaru (Kamoro) or Manma-tiw-nakap (literally ‘the orphan boy’, Asmat),  also resides in the upper world. In addition to these beneficial beings, there also live frightful characters in  the upper world, such as the two initially terrestrial daughters of the culture  hero of the sun, who suspected him of killing their mother and withheld  food from him. Heavy wind, rain and thunder are ascribed to these women,  as aopao for the exploits of their father (Kamoro version). In the song of the  </page> <page sequence="32"> 126 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua clouds (Onam So), performed shortly before Asmat men depart for an attack,  a large number of deformed, malevolent and aggressive anthropomorphic  or zoomorphic beings are enumerated. They embitter men’s life (Zegwaard  1959:1034). Good and bad, like the upper world and the underworld, are com- plementary opposites. The abode of man-in-nature is an ambivalent betwixt- and-between, a corridor, a passageway between the upper and lower worlds.  Its heroes have a dual status with respect to the heroes of the universe. Witness  the recurrent feature of mythical, terrestrially oriented culture heroes who, as  namesakes of upperworld characters, provide the human world with the rota- tion of the sun and the moon, with rivers, sago, fire, hunting dogs, Western  commodities, and iron tools, all associated with the sun and acquired, often by  deceit or by accident, from an oblivious upper world or spirits associated with  it.35 Witness also the tricky acquisition from the underworld of a ceremonial  house, yew mopan (Asmat) or kaware (Kamoro), with its astonishing set of para- phernalia, adornments, and garden produce.36 In these respects, earthbound  heroes and tricksters are clearly superior to their ignorant namesakes in both  the upper and the lower worlds. The rotation of the sun is an invention of the  terrestrial trickster, not of its upperworld owner. Likewise, the rotation of the  moon is ascribed in Kamoro and Asmat versions of the moon myth to a ter- restrial orphan boy who, neglected and distrusted by his relatives, discovers  the moon in a basket while stealing food (Kamoro), or creates the moon him- self (Asmat), and then takes it to the firmament.37 Another Kamoro version  ascribes the discovery of the moon to illicit terrestrial behaviour of a sister’s  son towards his mother’s brother (Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:78-80). The  underworld proprietor of the ceremonial house and its attributes behaves in  the Asmat version as a dummy; he rates as an inferior, unfinished male. The  Asmat tend to ascribe the ‘furnishing’ of the human world to mere imitation  of superior examples furnished by upperworld heroes.38 The in-between situ- ation of the human abode in a spatial sense is graphically expressed by a strik- ing metaphor which David Eyde came across by chance and communicated to  the linguist Voorhoeve: the territory they inhabit, the Asmat capinmi, is enclosed within, and lies at the bot- tom of, a gigantic coconut: their world is not convex but concave. The boundaries  of their world correspond roughly to those of their language area: between the  Casuarinen Coast and the Mimika Coast. And one can do the ‘journey round the  world’ by setting out from the Casuarinen Coast, landing there, and then return- ing [overland] to the Casuarinen Coast. Through the middle of this world flows  35 See narratives in Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:65-93. 36 See Chapter III, and see the narratives in Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:98-108. 37 Pouwer 2002:34-6; Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:76-8. 38 For an example, see Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:108-11. </page> <page sequence="33"> VI  The theory of comparison and the context of the rituals 127 the great River Sirec, rising far away, somewhere at the top of the coconut, close  to the holy entrance to the upper world. From this opening, in prehistoric times  the heavenly beings descended to earth, in order to populate the world with their  descendants. (Voorhoeve 1965:3.)  Such a ‘heavenly being’ is Baitshepsimit (literally the big Baitshep), an enor- mous androgynous pig, the size of a cow, reared by Manifuk, a supernatural  being who lives in the upper world above the clouds on top of the mountains.  There is a striking parallel with the primeval pig of the Yali people, a Dani  exonym of their highland neighbours east of the Grand (Baliem) Valley. In  versions of a central myth, specified rivers, sacred men’s houses, and men  themselves divided into clans, emerged from a partition of the huge pig at her  own request by her son, or were shot by another male culture hero (Zöllner  1988:19, 173-4). The central Asmat mythical pig has many children: Naneu and Kamkai  born from the uterus, Kayir, Kaimes, Yepem, Owus, Sunu and Yaun born  from her side or thigh; Ewer, her future son-in-law, is also born from her side  or thigh. These are the founders of the yew of Island River and Flamingo Bay,  named after them, the Bismam people. One day Ewer, the son-in-law, mis- takes his father-in-law for a wild pig, shoots at him in vain, and runs him (or  her) down, a capital though unwitting offence. Baitshep removes taro plants  and liana and creeps into the hole beneath. He crashes down and down and  arrives on the earth near the source of the Island River (Sirec). The noise of the  ‘earthquake’ frightens a number of named, dismal, deformed, inferior men  who thereafter stay behind in the upper world. [Compare this to the dismal  daughters of the hero of the sun in the Kamoro version and the malevolent  anti-human beings in the Asmat ritual song of the clouds.] Below, Baitshep  meets Kaimes and Yepem, two of his sons. His other sons, in the upper world,  follow his trail, remove the taro and liana put back by him, enter the hole, and  are united with their father. Since the huge androgynous pig is far too heavy  to climb back to the upper world, the party decide to move on downstream.  They settle there. Baitshep teaches them how to attack their enemies, the  people already living there: he bares his teeth and growls, and this has been  imitated by his descendants during attacks ever since. He teaches his sons to  beat the water with their paddles, creating big waves shaped like Baitshep’s  tusks so that the enemies’ canoes will capsize. Baitshep ever since has accom- panied them, hanging upside down from the stern of the canoe, his head and  tusks facing forwards, thus adding to the size of the waves.39 The details of  this story are characteristic of the aggressive, headhunting stance of the Asmat  39 For the full story, see Offenberg and Pouwer 2002:211-8. </page> <page sequence="34"> 128 Gender, ritual and social formation in West Papua invaders, whose ancestors – in view of the pig parallel – seem to originate from  the highlands. The Sirec River connects the upper world with the sea. The sea is some- times represented as a mere tributary of the Sirec, so that one can travel full  circle through the human world, and return to its headwaters. It seems significant that narratives about the origin of named ancestors of  localized descent groups are lacking among the Kamoro. Their great trek from  southwest to northeast, begun by the warlords and culture heroes Aoweyao  and Mbiminareyao, was made by localized descent groups and descent  groups not named after ancestors. All Kamoro and Asmat narratives have one outstanding feature in com- mon: the route of the human (or superhuman) creative beings to and from  the upper world and underworld is not paved by good intentions but by  anti-social behaviour, such as adultery, incest, theft, suspicion of murder, lack  of respect, destruction or loss of property, excessive requests, or failing badly  in reciprocity. It is this anti-social behaviour, committed either by them or by  their fellow men, which drives them out and forces them to discover other  spheres and cultural valuables crucial to human life. Again, in Asmat and  Kamoro cosmology, good and evil are complementary. </page> </plain_text>
