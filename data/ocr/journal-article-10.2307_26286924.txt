<plain_text><page sequence="1">ABSTRACTION, COMEDY, AND TOWARD A PITILESS FICTION: MODERNIST ANTIHUMANISM Ella Zohar Ophir The flattening of dimensions is a well-recognized component of modernist aesthetics, but it predominates in painting, issuing from the impulse to abandon the illusion of depth and attend instead to the defining conditions of the medium. The elimination of psycho logical dimensions in fiction is a phenomenon less recognized; it was also a qualitatively different experiment. The representation of inte riority, or psychological depth, is one of the defining traits of mod ernist fiction in English. Modernism knocked the false bottom out of the nineteenth-century character, exposing the tumult of memory, sensation, and desire below. The disorder of consciousness often seems a near-dissolution; the boundaries of character, however, re main a portal of entry for the reader and, no less, a point of interest: the welter is still perceptibly a subject, a human figure on the ground of a recognizable world. Even in Ulysses, characters develop and cohere, surviving both their own internal flux and the rapidly morphing linguistic terrain. Thus Michael Levenson proposes that in many in stances the "self-conscious assault on a notion of character" simul taneously "continue[d] to cherish nineteenth-century ideals of the autonomous ego, free and integral" and that "one way to understand this moment of transition in the history of the novel is in terms of nineteenth-century characters seeking to find a place in twentieth century forms" (Modernism xiii, xii).

TOWARD A PITILESS FICTION! ABSTRACTION, COMEDY, AND MODERNIST ANTIHUMANISM Ella Zohar Ophir</page><page sequence="2">Ophir 93 Modernist departures from nineteenth-century conventions of representation form a rather more interesting area of inquiry than their degrees of adherence, and have generated proportionately more commentary. But the extent to which modernist fiction did remain anchored in a realism of character and world was remarked upon during those decades of fervent experimentation. As early as 1914 Ford Madox Ford observed that while "all the literary . . . manifesta tions of [modernism] are representational ... all the plastic-aes thetic products are becoming more and more geometric" (qtd. in Levenson, Genealogy 129). And for some, this was a source of con sternation. Twenty years later, Wyndham Lewis reflected that The literary art is not only on the whole less experimental than pictorial and plastic art, but it is also .. . possessed of different canons—canons that are inherent both in the na ture of the material, and in the fact that the literary art is far more directly involved in life than pictorial art. I do not myself believe that anything in the literary field can be done that will correspond with what has been called "ab stract design." {Men Without Art 95) Lewis does not at this point sound particularly vexed, but fiction's refractory devotion to the explicitly human was one of his most abid ing concerns. He drew this conclusion in 1934, only after having devoted years to precisely the task of creating a fiction that would "correspond with" abstract design.1 Lewis finds fiction bound to convention by its direct involve ment in life. For Henry James, E. M. Forster, D. H. Lawrence, Virginia Woolf, and others the problem was, on the contrary, that convention had been keeping fiction's involvement rather too stiffly reserved. The question was not how to separate fiction from life but how to make it yield and follow. Forster complains that the rigid patterning of James's novels "shuts the doors on life" (209), but James in his own way was seeking it. "Life" is the refrain of his essay "The Art of Fiction": the representation of life "is the only reason for the exist ence of a novel"; in the name of life James demands that the novelist must "be perfectly free" (188, 191). Life, Woolf judges, is what es capes Arnold Bennett, "and perhaps without life nothing else is worth while" (105).2 "Nothing is important but life," urges Lawrence, and the unconstrained novel "is the one bright book" of it (205-06). Though its substance was indefinite and its whereabouts disputed, the capture of this quantity, life, was for most the object and triumph of the novelist's art. "When it relinquishes this attempt, the same attempt that we see on the canvas of the painter," concludes James, "it will have arrived at a very strange pass" (188). But in 1884 a</page><page sequence="3">94 Abstraction, Comedy, and Modernist AntiHumanism number of canvases were already approaching that strange pass, and fiction was not so long to follow. If we accept Clement Greenberg's thesis that abstraction in painting is a manifestation of that art's "enterprise of self-criticism" (5), modernist foregrounding of language and, eventually, the bare-all self-exposures of metafiction would seem to be suitable candidates for the correspondence that Lewis sought. Lewis's understanding of abstraction, however, bears little resem blance to Greenberg's. In Frederic Jameson's trenchant summary, Lewis was both "the exemplary practitioner of one of the most powerful modernistic styles and an aggressive ideological critic and adversary of modernism it self in all its forms" (3). Laura Riding, another modernist party of one, is aligned with Lewis in this respect. Like Lewis she interrogated the ideological premises of her contemporaries and took exception particularly to what she saw as modernist fiction's devotion to lived experience. Lewis's and Riding's arguments were not with the artifi ciality of the realist illusion; they were provoked, rather, by a pro found dissatisfaction with human life itself, and by a particular un derstanding of the psychological effects of fictional representations of that regrettable state of affairs. Theirs is not social criticism, but what can perhaps be called human criticism—a critical appraisal of the human condition coupled with a requisition for a specific course of action: in Lewis's case for control, in Riding's for transformation. At the advent of photography, Charles Baudelaire lamented that his "squalid society rushed, Narcissus to a man, to gaze at its trivial image on a scrap of metal" (229). That gaze, Lewis and Riding might have rejoined,, had merely been shifted from the pages of novels, which had long held people thus transfixed. Attention is a form of recognition, and the novelist's keen observation and replication of ordinary life, they seemed to think, amounts to a validation of it stupidity, frailty, disorder, and all. And modernist fiction, drawing the reader ever deeper into interior experience, is even more likely to eliminate critical distance from the human scene. As a phenomenology of reading this position is incomplete rather than wholly fallacious. The idea persists that fiction (at least the good or serious sort) develops the empathetic imagination and fos ters tolerant understanding of the breadth, variety, and complexity of human life: its fallibility and ignominy as well as its dignity; the subtle shadings along the moral spectrum; the sometimes untrace able networks of act and consequence, compulsion and agency, vul nerability and responsibility. Fiction's ability to dramatize complexity and ambiguity is often pronounced to be its great virtue and the basis of its pedagogical and social utility. The fact that such argu ments for fiction's moral beneficence are routinely subject to criti</page><page sequence="4">Ophir 95 cism only confirms their durability.3 Fiction does still bear this (not wholly unmerited) mantle of compassionate humanism, but it is not for lack of twentieth-century attempts to cast it off. Among the most vigorous efforts to do so are the interwar story collections of Lewis and Riding. The elimination of psychological depth in Lewis's The Wild Body and Riding's Progress of Stories can be seen as approxi mations of the flattened human forms of postimpressionist painting, but the authors were not primarily seeking to expose or reject the mechanics of fiction's reality effect. Their experiments in the direc tion of fictional abstraction aimed more precisely at correcting what they saw as exaggerated human self-valuation. Empathy and the Politics of Abstraction The life-likeness, or full realization of characters is almost in variably a major criterion of a work of fiction's success, as a cursory scan of contemporary fiction reviews will reveal. Character-talk, how ever, tends to chafe professors of literature; we try to take students beyond relating to fiction in terms of the interest or likeability of characters. In this disposition we have an assortment of company. In "The Dehumanization of Art," for example, the Spanish critic José Ortega y Gasset complained that "To the majority of people aes thetic pleasure means a state of mind which is essentially indistin guishable from their ordinary behavior. .. . the object towards which their attention ... is directed is the same as in daily life: people and passions. By art they understand a means through which they are brought in contact with interesting human affairs" (9). At roughly the same time, Bertolt Brecht was proffering a similar critique. He found the "human interest" so beloved of film critics "vulgar" and sought to devise a theater that would not take the human being for granted, but make it "the object of the enquiry" (49, 37). But the point of Brecht's critique was to forge an art that would prompt audi ences, all of them, out of passive consumption into critical engage ment. Ortega was involved in a different conversation. By the late nineteenth century "crowd psychology" had become the subject of some scrutiny and much hype in Europe and in En gland, and had spawned what Michael Tratner calls "a whole sub genre of sociological-political treatises purporting to analyze the mass mind" (1). Most of these works were indebted to The Crowd, a study by the doctor and some-time anthropologist Gustave LeBon, which was published in France in 1895 and reached England in translation two years later. A crowd, LeBon contended, is no mere aggregate of individuals; it forms a unified over-mind with a distinct psychology: emotional, suggestible, and volatile. Following LeBon, a rash of studies</page><page sequence="5">96 Abstraction, Comedy, and Modernist AntiHumanism identified "empathy" as the specific psychological function by which individuals, once massed together, relinquish their psychological au tonomy and merge into one. Empathy is construed as self-forget ting, a move from rational self-control to a state of emotional ma nipulability. LeBon himself was resigned to the political power of masses in modern democracies and offered to teach politicians how to exploit them. Other writers, however, seized on the pseudoscientific conclusions about masses as grounds for their political suppression.4 The idea that empathy entailed a hazardous loss of control readily found its way into the politically charged aesthetics of the era. The cultural anxiety underlying English modernism is ubiquitously articu lated in the language of aesthetic control—in polemical promotions of hardness, clarity, and precision, and correlative denigrations of vagueness, "emotional slither" (Pound 12) and often, of musicality or lyricism. As Vincent Sherry demonstrates at length, both Lewis and Ezra Pound absorbed from French antiromanticism the idea that of all art forms music was most culpable of promoting empathetic self-forgetting and "join[ing] all members of the audience in a spuri ous but formidable unity" (Sherry 4). The discourse of aesthetic con trol had difficulty finding a serviceable name for itself—"classical," for instance, along with its subordinated antithesis "romantic," was soon qualified out of existence.5 But by the mid-teens Lewis, at least, had followed T. E. Hulme in adopting "abstraction" as aesthetic laxity's opposite term. Hulme discovered Wilhelm Wörringer's Abstraction and Empathy in 1912 or 1913 and about two years later propagated the German art historian's "Contribution to the Psychology of Style" in a series of articles for The New Age.5 Empathy and abstraction, Wörringer proposed, are the polarities of aesthetic experience. Empathetic pleasure is the "psychic presupposition" of all European art, which, with its sensual naturalistic forms, invites the beholder "to enjoy the unclouded happiness of his purely organic being" (33). In the art of "Oriental" societies (the Egyptian stands representative), on the other hand, the "depth relations" of the organic world are "transformed, as far as possible, into plane relations" (40); its flow ing forms are rendered "with the elements of the purest abstraction, namely geometric-crystalline regularity" (42). This abstraction an swers to the psychological need for transcendence. The beholder enjoys not vitality but respite from it: the "regular abstract forms" offer "rest in the face of the vast confusion of the world picture" (19).7 Lewis embraced this scheme, pleased to find the flattened and geometrical forms of modernist art—not least his own painting and graphic design—expressive of singular detachment from the general confusion. His interest in the possibility of literary abstraction was not a desire to expose or disable the mechanisms of linguistic signi</page><page sequence="6">Ophir 97 fication. To Gertrude Stein's experiments in that direction, for in stance, he responded with a kind of gleeful derision.8 Rather, he sought to produce what he understood to be the particular psycho logical effect of visual abstraction: the detachment from life, the preclusion of empathetic immersion. For Wörringer and Hulme, ab stract, antiempathetic art is also antirationalist. Wörringer finds the "anthropomorphic pantheism" of Western naturalism "naïve" and Western philosophy correspondingly dwarfed by "the wisdom of the East," which is "unceasingly conscious of the paltriness of rationalis tic-sensuous cognition" (46). Lewis's critique of empathy, on the other hand, is advanced in the name of reason, and in this respect he is much closer to Ortega (whose work he seems not to have known) than to Wörringer or Hulme.9 Like many critics of the era, Ortega found the representational and dramatic content of a work of art an occlusion of its specifically aesthetic qualities. "Preoccupation with the human content of the work is in principle incompatible with aesthetic enjoyment proper," he objected; "A work of art vanishes from sight for a beholder who seeks in it nothing but the moving fate of John and Mary or Tristan and Isolde and adjusts his vision to this" (10). But his primary objec tion is that empathy is a subrational function, and art that elicits it is therefore underhanded and exploitative as well as aesthetically com promised: it takes advantage of a noble weakness inherent in man which exposes him to infection from his neighbor's joys and sorrows. Such an infection is no mental phenomenon; it works like a reflex in the same way as the grating of a knife upon glass sets the teeth on edge. It is an automatic effect, nothing else. ... Art must not proceed by psychic contagion, for psychic contagion is an unconscious phe nomenon, and art ought to be full clarity, high noon of the intellect.10 (26-27) The distinctive trait of the startling new art he is trying to account for is that it is antiempathetic, characterized by a quasi-scientific or philo sophical detachment. Countering "the human point of view," "in which we 'live' situations, people, things" (18), the new art promotes the "inhuman" view, which is marked by "a maximum of distance and minimum of feeling intervention" (17).11 Lewis's polemics were in variably launched in the name of rational cognition—"the truth of the intellect," "the external approach"—which, like Ortega, he thought of as a "non-human outlook" {Men 99, 103, 100). In distinction again from Wörringer and Hulme, Ortega's and Lewis's ideals of rationalist art were also, simultaneously, offensive</page><page sequence="7">98 Abstraction, Comedy, and Modernist AntiHumanism moves against "the masses." The brave new art that disallows "sen timental intervention" (17), Ortega writes, is "not only unpopular, but anti-popular" (5). By alienating those who do not understand it, it has the welcome effect of acting "like a social agent which segre gates from the shapeless mass of the many two different castes of men," "the illustrious and the vulgar" (5, 7).12 In a truly felicitous literary history Ortega would have had to hand a copy of The Wild Body, for Lewis's narrator opens with a declaration of intent to ac complish just that by eliminating libidinal appeal. In the adventures to follow, Ker-Orr warns, "there is no sex interest at all," and that absence, he expects, will sort the readerly wheat from the chaff: "I boldly pit my major interests against the sex-appeal, which will re strict me to a masculine audience, but I shall not complain" (Com plete Wild Body 18). This is misogyny, to be sure, but not exactly masculine chauvinism: "masculine" and "feminine" in Lewis's thought are the rubrics for, respectively, stringency and laxity in philosophy and aesthetics. He does not assume the sexless rationality of men, but casts as feminine all men (assumed to be the majority) whose minds are addled with desire. When it came to fiction, however, Ortega was ultimately unable to hold his "dehumanized" ground. "The Dehumanization of Art" was bound and sold with a second essay, "Notes on the Novel," which begins by proposing to align the modernist novel with the geometri cal ("inhuman") tendency in the visual arts by virtue of its attenua tion of plot. But Ortega's dehumanization thesis steadily unravels as he goes on to present the superseding of "the art of adventures" (74) not as a repudiation of "human content" but as a shift of em phasis from action to character. "Notes on the Novel" lauds psycho logical depth as the greatest virtue of modernist fiction. Plot is a childish thing; "We want the novelist to linger and to grant us good long looks at his personages, their being, and their environment till we . . . feel that they are close friends whom we know thoroughly in all the wealth of their lives" (66). The truly "great novelist," he con tinues, "contemptuous of the surface features of his personages, dives down into their souls and returns, clutching in his hand the deep sea pearl" (98). How "we" are qualitatively different in this case from the vulgarian who delights in paintings "of men or women whom it would be interesting to meet" (9) is not quite clear. There is no such backsliding in Lewis. He did not just hold the ground he shared with Ortega, he forged on further. In the mid twenties, revising The Wild Body and writing The Art of Being Ruled, he maintained the idea that the fictional counterpart of abstraction would distinguish the illustrious from the vulgar. His embellishment on the theme, which we do not find in Ortega, was to further protest</page><page sequence="8">Ophir 99 the very project of imagining other subjectivities. Psychological fic tion, he maintained, predicates depths that simply are not there, and therefore propagates a serious misconception of human nature. Lewis harbored throughout his life a rather typical intellectual pessi mism regarding the average intelligence level of the populace. But in the twenties he had embraced behaviorist psychology as an adequate account of the majority of human beings and was combining it with realpolitik. Not "mind," but a set of conditioned responses to stimuli, governed most human functioning. Since "by far the greater part of people ask nothing better than to be 'performing mice'" he calls for the establishment of a political order that would respect this fact by differentiating "mankind into two rigorously separated worlds" (Art 127). Here and there he makes the case that this proposal is a hu manitarian one, on the grounds that only such a division could avert another convulsion of violence and bloodshed and allow the mass of humanity to be "left alone and allowed to lead a peaceful, industri ous, and pleasant life" {Art 367). But such moments, for what they are worth, are overshadowed by his refusal throughout most of The Art of Being Ruled to imagine the uniqueness and integrity of other subjectivities. He had convinced himself, or was trying very hard to do so, that most human beings just did not have the interior lives that his contemporaries were so intent on rendering.13 The Wild Body became his attempt to convey this vision in fiction. The fiction that would "correspond with" abstract design, then, would not be antirepresentational but antiempathetic. It would represent what Ortega called "human forms and fates" (9) but preclude "sentimen tal intervention," both in the name of a rationalistic art and on the grounds that with respect to the mass of humanity, mind, volition, and emotion are illusions to be dismissed. Comedy and Human Automatism: The Wild Body The predictable and manipulate nature of human behavior was the subject of intense study in early-twentieth-century psychology and Lewis followed developments in the field with some distress. In both The Art of Being Ruled and Time and Western Man he details and denounces behaviorist claims; the latter work includes a sus tained attack on J. B. Watson and the authors of other behaviorist treatises dating from 1907 to the 1920s. According to the behavior ist, Lewis writes, Everything about a human being is directly and peripher ally observable: and all the facts about the human ma chine can be stated in terms of "stimulus and response,"</page><page sequence="9">100 Abstraction, Comedy, and Modernist AntiHumanism or "habit-formation." . . . The human personality is a "re action-mass". . .. Somewhere in the circuit—in no "myste rious within," but at a quite unimportant point in the mate rial circuit traversed—a thing may or may not occur which we call "thinking" or "consciousness." (Time 324) Lewis is obviously affronted by these studies, but he is not able to deny their potential utility with any confidence. On the contrary, he is alarmed that the results of such investigations were being turned over to the "captains of industry," "the educationalist department of health, . . . the employer of labour, and, generally speaking, anyone who may be interested to learn how to train human beings, and transform them into tractable machines" ( Time 323, 322). (It would have been no surprise to Lewis that Watson went into advertising after leaving his position at Johns Hopkins in 1920.)14 This acute anxiety about the limited scope of rational self-con trol is the generative force of Lewis's voluminous writings and, more often than not, its manifest content as well. His books advance one proposal after another for defending the embattled throne of reason, and in the 1930s he developed a conception of "non-moral satire" (95) in the service of this cause. Non-moral satire would deal "with man, and not with manners" (101); its object would not be vice, folly, or the vagaries of social behavior, but the permanent and fun damental human condition—our tenuous transcendence of the beasts. Although our "very moderate altitude of relative independence" gives us "the illusion of being autonomous and 'free,'" Lewis submits, we are "undoubtedly to a greater or less extent, machines." Freedom is nonetheless "certainly our human goal . . . and it is a dictate of nature that we should laugh, and laugh loudly, at those who have fallen into slavery, and still more, those who batten on it" {Men 95). This, if you will, is the Good Lewis; his language is scrupulously in clusive: "we" share the illusion of autonomy and the goal of free dom; any one of "us" may lapse into automatism. "In a sense, ev eryone should be laughed at or else no one should be," he offers generously (MenQ9). But the satirical ideal defined in Men Without Art is a later de velopment of the principles of The Wild Body, in which the line be tween freedom and automatism runs between, not within, people. It separates the autonomous few from the automatic many, forming the basis for the "rigorously separated worlds" of his political vision. The Lewis of The Wild Body, it appears, was quite seriously enter taining the idea that the mass of humanity was rather less than human and that all pretenses to its freedom ought to be abandoned. To downplay this element of the collection, as many critics have done, is to soften its virulence, but also its experimental edge.</page><page sequence="10">Ophir 101 What began innocently enough as a set of prewar travel sketches became an experiment in using fiction to demonstrate to readers the inappropriateness of empathy for the mass of their fellow human beings—effecting thereby a detachment comparable to that repre sented by geometrical abstraction. The single controlling perspec tive of the narrator, Ker-Orr, is designed to secure the strictly "exter nal" view Lewis would later idenitfy as the essence of satire {Men 95); the organic and vital human scene is to be rendered geometric and static by his application of behaviorist principles, which expose the fixed patterns beneath the appearance of volition and flux. To the untutored eye, Ker-Orr explains, "the complexity of the rhythmic scene is so great that it passes as open and untrammeled life"; he proposes to show that in fact "we have in most lives the spectacle of a pattern as circumscribed and complete as a theorem of Euclid" (149).15 But readerly habits die hard, and Lewis would have guessed that it would take more than narrative detachment to shut the valve of empathy. For that task, comedy is the wrench. Ker-Orr is not presented as a Behaviorist, after all, but as "A Soldier of Humour" (the title of the first story), and his opening remarks, as well as the two short essays appended to the collection, have provoked much critical discussion of Lewis's unacknowledged but obvious Bergsonian borrowings. Comedy, for Bergson, erupts from a sudden revelation of the thinghood of a person, from the undercutting of vital mind by intractable matter: the man slipping on the banana peel is paradig matic. Laughter "rebukes the automaton, and purges the nonper son, the thing, from proper society"; it is "redemptive" and reflects "a profoundly humanist norm ... for it measures and celebrates human superiority to the lower, animal-mechanical character" (Sherry, "Anatomy" 123). The Wild Body is sometimes read as an "inverted" or "black" version of Bergsonian Cartesianism—as a vision of hu manity as essentially vegetable matter, with comedy erupting from its fitful and awkward leaps toward mind. These arguments are gen erally based on the statement in the second essay, "The Meaning of the Wild Body," that "The root of the Comic is to be sought in the sensation resulting from the observations of a thing behaving like a person" (that is, rather than a person behaving as a thing) and that all men are thus comic, "for they are all things, or physical bodies, behaving as persons"{Complete 158).16 But the apparently inverted Cartesianism of Lewis's definition of the "root of the comic" is belied by the anecdote he uses to illustrate it. A fat man is laboring across the platform toward a departing subway train and, in spite of his bulk, manages to "deftly project himself between the sliding doors":</page><page sequence="11">102 Abstraction, Comedy, and Modernist AntiHumanism His eye I decided was the key to the absurdity of the ef fect. It was its detachment that was responsible for this. It seemed to say, as he propelled his sack of potatoes—that is himself—along the platform, and as he successfully landed the sack in the carriage:—"I've not much 'power,' I may just manage it: —yes, just? Then in response to our gaz ing eyes, "Yes, that's me! . . . When you run a line of potatoes like ME, you get the knack of them: but they take a bit of moving."(159-60) The comedy arises from the intelligence within the flesh but tran scending it: "it was his detachment that was responsible" for the effect; "the man's body was not him" (159; emphasis added). Even so, the detachment of mind from the awkwardness of matter is in fact a red herring with respect to the substance of the stories them selves. In his preamble, Ker-Orr tells the reader much about his flesh, which is to his mind somewhat repellent. Apart from his ungainly body, he explains, there is "another hostile me, that does not like the \sic] smell of mine, probably finds my large teeth, height and so forth abominable. . . . This forked, strange-scented, blond-skinned gut-bag, with its two bright rolling marbles with which it sees ... is my stalking horse. I hang somewhere in its midst operating it with detachment" (18). If the stories were elaborations on the principle of "The Meaning of the Wild Body" the disjunction between Ker-Orr's massive "visi-gothic" (17) body and the intelligence suspended at the controls would be the source of much hilarity—but it never is. And the people Ker-Orr encounters are not represented as possess ing the requisite intelligence to render their physical encumbrance comic. These figures, rather, provide Lewis with the opportunity to rival Jonathan Swift in virtuosic depictions of the bodily grotesque. The often-quoted description of the innkeeper Bestre is one of a legion of examples: "His tongue stuck out, his lips eructated with the incredible indecorum that appears to be the monopoly of liquids, his brown arms were for the moment genitals, snakes in one massive twist beneath his mamillary slabs, gently riding on a pancreatic swell, each hair on his oil bearing skin contributing its message of porcine affront" (78-79). Unlike that of the comparably corpulent man run ning for the train, Bestre's "eye" can produce no comic effect be cause nothing peers out from it. His "very large eyeballs" merely encase "the tiny spot through which light entered the obese wilder ness of his body" (78). There is no operative mind here; the anima tion is that of vegetation and gases. The distinction between Lewis's comic (produced by the anomaly of mind in matter) and his gro</page><page sequence="12">Ophir 103 tesque (the human body as animate but mindless) is overridden by the use of the terms "comical grotesque" (Materer 40) and "comic grotesque" (Duncan 71). The grotesque body signifies the absence of conscious intelligence, distinguishing it from the body that, by virtue of the mind within it, is at worst only comic. In fact, there is no physical comedy in the stories at all. On the contrary, Ker-Orr explicitly denigrates it. The laughter of the "the peasant" is usually prompted by "pure physical action" (exemplified by the "herd-bellow at the circus"), while his own superior sort is attuned to "the human character" (102). Lewis's non-moral satire, as detailed in Men Without Art, is heavily indebted to Bergson's prin ciple of physical comedy. The stories of The Wild Body seem to rely on other aspects of Laughter. The first is its theory of the comedy of character, which extends from the theory of physical comedy. Bergson argues that the spectacle of "the mind crystallizing itself in certain grooves" is analogous to that of "the body losing its elasticity" (97): vice and folly are risible because they are forms of fixity in the mind, which should be adaptive and responsive, agile and fluid. Second, Bergson stipulates that "the comic appeals to the intelligence pure and simple." And third, he maintains that laughter "is incompatible with emotion" and coincides with an "anaesthesia of the heart" (150). The Wild Body opens with an illustration of a mind that has certainly "crystallized itself in certain grooves." In "A Solider of Humour," Ker-Orr, at a hotel in Bayonne, encounters Monsieur de Valmore, a Frenchman who stakes his identity on the pretense that he is American, oblivious to the fact that his American-style suits are obviously cut by a Gascon tailor and that his French accent renders his English incomprehensible. When the affectation becomes insuf ferable, Kerr-Orr hurls a wrench in the works: "The south of France! the South of France! The bloody Midi, your home-land, you poor bum!" (28). The result? "I had laid him out quite flat. The situation was totally outside his compass"; "The original and more imposing man had disappeared. I had slain him" (29, 30). Howling with laugh ter, Ker-Orr casts the man aside like a broken toy and moves on. What makes The Wild Body a singular comic offering, however, is that the stories do not form a catalogue of such fools or comic types. Subsequent encounters are with characters whose most promi nent characteristic is their wretchedness: we get a sequence of blighted and frustrated lives, and the spectacles presented as au tomatism are also ones of violence or suffering.17 Mademoiselle Péronnette is emotionally tormented and routinely, viciously beaten by her lover Carl, who cheats her out of her money, forcing her to lose her guesthouse, which he then buys cheaply at an auction. The cornac, leader of a rag-tag traveling circus act, is aging, ill, and physi</page><page sequence="13">104 Abstraction, Comedy, and Modernist AntiHumanism cally decrepit; his performances torture him. He is accompanied by his "dirty, breathless wife, of whose ugly misery it was required that a daily mournful exhibition should be made of her shrivelled legs, in pantomime hose" (91).18 Ludo is a beggar; he is imperious, but blind, destitute, and dependent on a child. François, another beggar, is homeless, hungry, and demented. Julie is dependent on a husband who has squandered her money and beats her. Onto the Behaviorist principle of conditioning, Lewis grafts Bergson's theory of the com edy of character: that where there is fixity, the intellect will find comedy, and where there is comedy there can be no empathy. Only this reasoning can explain some of the scenarios of these stories. For example: I entered the kitchen of the Pension, but noticing that Carl was holding Mademoiselle Péronnette by the throat, and was banging her head on the kitchen table, I withdrew. As I closed the door I heard Mademoiselle Péronnette, as I supposed, crash upon the kitchen floor. Dull sounds that were probably kicks followed, and I could hear Carl roar ing, "Gourte! Zale gourte!" ... It was, I think, a corruption of the french word gourde, which means calabash. (54) The premise is that these two lives are governed by their clockwork antagonism; the implication is that it is funny; the expectation, pre sumably, is that empathetic response is thereby promptly arrested. Is The Wild Body the literary counterpart of abstract design? It is a sequence of relatively static scenarios, and it is psychologically depthless. Ker-Orr observes behavior and deduces within not sub jectivity but simple, repeating patterns of perception and reaction. And Ker-Orr himself, as Lewis declares in his foreword, is a "show man" (xiii)—not a blooded character but a controlling perspective. But Lewis's own conception of abstraction was, crucially, not just a matter of flattened or geometrical forms; it was correlated with the specific psychological effect of detached intellectual perception. When applied to the human scene such perception would reveal the mecha nistic fixity under the appearance of vitality, and affect would be evacuated by "a burgundian gust of laughter" (153). Lewis can per haps be credited for the boldness with which he subjects his vision of psychological automatism to the most demanding test, that of hu man suffering. Evidence of pain, after all, caused even Descartes to pause over his theory of animal automatism.19 Lewis tries to present the reader with essentially realistic human scenes and make con vincing the idea that, contrary to appearances, the average mind is essentially mechanistic, that most individual lives are not unique in any profound or interesting sense, and that, by implication, the</page><page sequence="14">Ophir 105 premise of individual sanctity and autonomy that underwrites egali tarian politics overrides the hard facts of the matter. But as most critics have observed, and as Lewis himself seems to have realized by the early thirties, his vision fails the test.20 The narrator's callous ness toward human suffering registers more forcefully than the in tellectual penetration it is intended to exhibit. This venture toward fictional abstraction does not succeed on its own terms, as it pro duces not an arrest of empathy, but a distinctly different effect: a dramatization of pitilessness. Comedy and Human Irrelevance: Progress of Stories Laura Riding never made recourse to visual or spatial meta phors in conceptualizing her work; in fact she appeared to have had little interest in the visual arts. But her depthless stories issue from a critique of empathy that she articulates in antidemotic terms com parable to those of Lewis and Ortega. Her works are infused with anxiety about the suggestibility of masses, and she too singles out music as a particularly specious art, in effect a nonverbal form of demagoguery: "Music is an instrument for arousing emotions. ... It is directed toward the greatest number of persons musically con ceivable. It is a mass-marshaling of the senses by means of sound. . . . Music appeals to the intellectual disorganization and weakness of people in numbers and begets, by flattering this weakness (which is sentimentality), gratifying after-effects of destructive sociality" (/!/? archism 34-35). Much poetry, she finds, is little better, as poets ca ter to readers who desire "to be inspired with emotions which differ from their ordinary emotions only in being more exaggerated" and readers therefore "become mere instruments on whom the poet plays his fine tunes" {Poems 411). And like Lewis, Riding identifies mod ernist fiction as an offender not just for encouraging empathetic im mersion but also for thereby exaggerating the significance of the ordinary human life. Progress of Stories is her counteroffensive. In her preface, Riding takes care, as Lewis did, to indicate that the material to follow will not supply the usual satisfactions. The first group of stories in the volume, she declares, deals "with unequivo cally unimportant material. They are about lives as such; and all lives, as such, are unimportant" (xi). On this ground she distinguishes herself from "a quaint cult of story-writing which practices what is called 'the short story'"—characterizing that still nascent and in some respects quintessential^ modernist form as "pompous little fragments in whose very triviality, obscurity, and shabbiness some significant principle of being is meant to be read" (xvi). With the "material" of these "Stories of Lives," she says, "I have been very fair. I have done</page><page sequence="15">106 Abstraction, Comedy, and Modernist AntiHumanism a certain amount of work on it, but no more than was enough to establish it decently in its unimportance" (xii). An example of this judicious allocation of authorial attention is as follows: Then, one day, Emile was put in prison. He had run down and killed a young unemployed shop-girl in the Bois de Boulogne. He had been reading and driving at the same time. The young girl did not seem to have a family or friends, but, all the same, Emile was put in prison. He was not put in prison for long, because he was undoubtedly a respect able person. . . . The papers had first referred to him as "The Reading Motorist". . . . The jury found him guilty of "abstracted" driving, and the judge sentenced him in very flattering language. "Here is a distinguished gentleman of leisure," the judge said, "whose enthusiasm for culture has made him the unfortunate instrument of the death of a young girl who could not, in any case, have loved life too well." (43-44) In Lewis's The Wild Body, the narrator witnesses a brutal beating and responds with an etymological surmise. Here the narrating voice offers a placid account of a community's response to manslaughter with the observation of certain legal formalities but with neither af fect nor moral judgment. Unlike Lewis, Riding makes no claim to comedy, but the effect of her meticulous detachment is darkly comic, even—perhaps especially—when her scenarios, like Lewis's, erupt into violence. In one story, for instance, a small-time crook gets murdered by one of the men he is setting up for a con-job: "Mean while Bob had found a sharp knife at the cake-counter. 'Don't be silly, eh?' he shrieked, plunging it into Athens, this time effectively. The waitress ran into the street screaming. . . . Athens retained in death his expression of forced amusement. His partners gave him a decent burial" (37). In "The Incurable Virtue" the abstracted driver Emile, once a popular salon host, is gradually deserted by his circle. With nothing ahead but "nothingness," he opts not to travel, deciding that "It was still more exciting to let nothingness come and fetch him. He hanged himself with a fresh white neck-scarf (in the last stage of his life he has dressed even more fastidiously than before), taking off from a pipe that ran along the wall and enabled him very conve niently to reach the coat-peg as well as to miss the floor by a mere stretch of his toes" (51). "Laughter has no greater foe than emotion," says Bergson, which is why comic works almost always take measures to disable it. This is particularly true of the long if not venerable tradition of violent comedy that runs back through slapstick to the commedia dell'arte.</page><page sequence="16">Ophir 107 Generic markers almost always clearly delimit the comic world from the real, establishing "a morally comfortable distance from real life" (Carpenter 10). Indeed, most theorists maintain that it is only by means of generic signals that violence can be made comic at all.21 Riding succeeds in rendering moral squalor and violence comic where Lewis does not because she does not share the intellectualist confi dence that led him to dispense with such markers. She intersperses among her characters, for instance, names obtrusively comic enough to disturb the surface of realist illusion without breaking it—"Veni son," "Archibald Root," "Emile St. Blague." Realism requires expla nations of oddity; Riding dutifully offers one for Venison's name, but it compounds the comedy rather than rationalizing it: "This was her real name, given her by her mother because when she was born she had a freakish, gamey look, and her father had said, 'She'd have an odd taste, not like ordinary meat'" (52). Riding maintains a tenuous realism but lets the comic ripple break every so often into fantasy and farce. In one story a medium at a séance literally "etherealizes": "She dissolved into a mist at the ceiling and slowly drifted down to the floor again, like a mass of inert silk" (34). In another a man's infatuation with his friends' servant girl ends when he accidentally creates a furor during which she is toppled into the fire "with the spirit can a-pour" and is, with the three household dogs, "blown to death" (15). Even more than Lewis's, Riding's stories are of blighted lives: they are spectacles of self-estrangement, failure, isolation, psychopathy, suicide, and murder. But her casual indifference to the moral conditions and miserable fates of her characters is not disturb ing or offensive in the way Lewis's is, as it appears in the context of a general refusal to treat any aspect of reality with sober respect. And yet, in Riding's stories, as in Lewis's, the anesthesia of the heart appears to be the specifically desired end of comedy, rather than its coincident effect. The stories are engineered to wrest read ers out of their inveterate preoccupation with "people and passions" because Riding thinks that psychological fiction seeks human signifi cance in the wrong place. Unlike Lewis, Riding never dallied with fascism.22 But her comparable anxiety about mass democracy is ap parent in disdainful references that pervade her essays and polemics of the 1920s, and is vented in a piece titled "The Crowd," published in 1930. "My dear crowd," she begins, de haut en bas, "be per suaded that whatever your services in the past nothing more is wanted of you now. . . . Hitherto you have had little bread though much privilege. Now that the strain is over you may have bread; but... do not pretend to lead" ( Though Gently 8-9).23 The most sustained manifestation of her anxiety, however, is her overarching vision of human progress toward a condition of truth, which evolved over the course of her career, and in which Progress of Stories takes a part.</page><page sequence="17">108 Abstraction, Comedy, and Modernist AntiHumanism In Riding's vision of history, the concerted effort of individual minds pulls humanity forward to its imminent and ultimate destiny in which all stubborn egos—mere selves, "numbered lone identities of the hour"—are transcended, and we arrive at a condition of har monious unity with each other and with Being (The Telling 54). In Progress of Stories, that process appears as an imperative that over rides compassionate dwelling on human particulars. The comic "Sto ries of Lives" are followed by a sequence of quasi-allegorical stories that feature agents of a sort, but no trace of the modernist "charac ter." Riding abandons "lives as such" for what she calls the "really important things" (86)—that is, the progress toward truth, which involves, it emerges, a certain number of casualties. The allegorical stories that succeed the "Stories of Lives" re peat the basic pattern of Lewis's politics: the subordination of the many for the preservation of the few. "A Last Lesson in Geography" features a set of unassembled body parts. Led forward by "Tooth" (our protagonistic entity), the parts slowly knit themselves together in the spirit of truth. The story is playful, full of whimsical ratiocina tions and odd and surprising wit, but it is grounded on a Nietzschean divide. The parts of the body are "strong people," distinguished from the extraneous "weak people." The weak excuse their weakness by humbling themselves before an idea of an absolute strength, which they call God. But, Riding explains, "By 'God' they meant the strong people," even though "they refused to recognize any difference be tween the strong people and themselves" (241). The strong have built a bridge between the nowhere of the past and the somewhere of the future, and Tooth sees that his work is to "destroy the bridge and yet save all the other strong people" (244). The self-abasing weak who worship the strong in the image of God simply disappear: "The weak people, though they called themselves poor confused crea tures, had no object. They no sooner came into being than out they went. It was all a joke" (246). Perhaps it was, but we have left the realm of comedy. "In the End" constructs a similar division, linking a pure human few with a "true world" (297) signified by moon and earth, and op posing these to a mass of "mixed nature" who are linked with a "false world" (298) of sky and sun. As in "A Last Lesson," which proposes that "there was an infinite number of weak people, but the strong people were numbered" (243), so here those of mixed nature are of an "uncountable number" (298) while those who tell only the truth are but thirty-two. The false world begins to end when those of mixed nature "began to let themselves fall into the emptiness" of the sky, toward the sun, which is "the vanity of the earth." In a great apocalyptic immolation, "the sky and the further degrees of empty</page><page sequence="18">Ophir 109 outerness destroyed the sun and were destroyed by the sun. The vain were destroyed by their vanity." A better fate awaits those few who "could not fly," who "could tell only the truth": they become the inhabitants of the "true world, the new world which came after an old world that had never truly been" (298-99). These stories have a fancifulness and charm, as well as a tone of profundity to which readers with a taste for the enigmatic re sponded with pleasure. "She is witty, she is a delightful storyteller," Edwin Muir wrote, reviewing the volume for the Listener—though he surmised that it originated in "mystical experience" and confessed that he could not "pretend to have understood it fully" (64). Rebecca West, for the Sunday Times, wrote that "One has to suspect these modern fairy tales of being perhaps quite a lot wiser than the ordi nary realistic novel." Other reviewers found the stories simply in comprehensible. No one, it seems, registered the import of Riding's prefatory contention that "all lives, as such, are unimportant" (xi). In this stage of its development, Riding's truthful human future be longs to the long line of Utopian visions that are content to pay their way with human lives. Her vagueness about the fate of all those beings identified as weak, vain, or mendacious ultimately makes her vision seem at least as menacing as Lewis's proposal for peace by mass stupefaction. For however fantastic, incorporeal and whimsical the fables of people who, in the course of the realization of truth, mysteriously cease to exist, or fly off the face of the earth into the sun, they are not without resonance of other fantastic twentieth century stories of disappearance, of gulags, and of ovens. Lewis and Riding both viewed psychological fiction with deep suspicion, and assumed that modernism's explorations of interiority marked a new depth, so to speak, in the Western tradition of empathetic aesthetics. Encouraging participation in the strivings, joys, and sorrows of others, Lewis objected, such fiction weakened the boundaries of the self, swelling the threat of "demotic gigantism" (Sherry, Radical Modernism 16) and mob rule. Furthermore, it pos ited individual agency and integrity as more or less universal, and was therefore likely to abet the humanitarian laxity of those few readers of requisite intellect who might otherwise be enlisted in the cause of rigorous social control. Riding objected that the indefati gable production and consumption of stories of lives entrenched an understanding of humanity as universally and by nature riven, striv ing, and suffering, rather than united in its common origin and in eluctable progress toward a condition of truth and unity. Lewis's thought was politically oriented; Riding saw the rectification of hu man life as possible only through the transformation of individual consciousnesses. Though opposed in this respect, their visions are,</page><page sequence="19">110 Abstraction, Comedy, and Modernist AntiHumanism equally, ways of refusing to make imaginative space for the vast scene of human particulars, the micro-histories of innumerable selves and circumstances, and the conflicting, sometimes irreconcilable desires and schemes of value that demand responsive accommoda tion from the political order and in everyday life. Reviewers in 1927 were generally unfazed by the callousness of The Wild Body. One even commends Lewis for not "making the mistake of ascribing to primitive people living primitive lives the com plex, introversive sensitiveness of more sophisticated natures" (Robinson 268). But the decline of The Wild Body's critical estima tion is a sign of the later century's heightened awareness of what the erosion of human respect can lead to. Progress of Stories is much subtler than The Wild Body, and retains the power to perplex, amuse, charm, and elicit admiration that seems not to recognize its ominous absolutism at all. The task of "setting out with the butterfly net of language in pursuit of the truth requires mastery," wrote Harry Matthews in a review of the 1982 edition, and "this sparkling freshet of a book seems to me the work of such a master" (40, 41). But Progress of Stories represents an inability to deal with the subjectiv ity of others as intransigent as that of The Wild Body. Bergson's famous essay on comedy, it is often forgotten, concludes on a som ber note, with a caution that seems well made at least with respect to the genre's more violent forms. Comedy, he observes, is like "foam left on a sandy beach": "It, also, is froth with a saline base. Like froth, it sparkles. It is gaiety itself. But the philosopher who gathers a handful to taste may find that the substance is scanty, and the aftertaste bitter" (189, 190). Modernist Antihumanism andAntipsychological Fiction Lewis and Riding took the art form most extensively developed for the imagination of human particularity and multiplicity and made it an explicit and dramatic exercise in refusing to do so. Their resis tance likely issued in part from a degree of impatience with a prac tice of fiction that seemed devoted almost exclusively to replicating "the vast confusion of the world picture"—an undertaking with an uncertain rationale no logical limit. In "Notes on the Novel" Ortega (sporting his humanist hat) wrote that "human vitality is so exuber ant that in the sorriest desert it still finds a pretext for glowing and trembling" and that it is "in reporting the wonders of the simple, unhaloed hour . . . that the novel displays its specific graces" (89, 88). James urged novelists to push fiction yet further into still "ne glected" "sources of interest"—"whole categories of manners, whole corpuscular classes and provinces, museums of character and condi</page><page sequence="20">Ophir 111 tion" (343). In A Room of One's Own Woolf enjoined her hypothetical novelist Mary Carmichael to attend to "all the infinitely obscure lives that remain to be recorded," proposing that the novel should re spond to "the pressure of dumbness, the accumulation of unrecorded life" (85). On one level Lewis's and Riding's stories register a recog nition that although the material of ordinary life is not exhaustible, interest in it may well be—in Riding's words, that the "infinite diver sity" of human particularity is from another perspective an "ultimate monotony" ( Telling 153). Lewis dramatizes just such a sense in his late novel Self-Condemned when he puts Middlemarch in the hands of his protagonist René Harding, who is making the long Atlantic crossing to Canada. Not far into George Eliot's capacious "Study of Provincial Life," Harding stops to review the temperaments, circum stances, and likely fates of the panoply of human creatures. Dourly he concludes, "The historic illusion, the scenes depicted .. . could be preserved in some suitable archive; but should not be handed down as living document. It is a part of history' and "swinging his arm back [he] hurled the heavy book out to sea" (156). It is worth noting that Woolf herself, who was maligned by both Lewis and Riding, ex pressed a certain fatigue in the face of the boundless human scene. Because Russian novels are so "comprehensive and compassionate," she writes in "Modern Fiction," they are also inevitably "inconclu sive," producing a "sense that there is no answer, that if honestly examined life presents question after question which must be left to sound on and on after the story is over in hopeless interrogation." And this, she confesses, "fills us with a deep, and finally it may be, with a resentful despair" (109). In the cases of Lewis and Riding, however, what could perhaps be called compassion-fatigue, or comprehension-fatigue, with re spect to humanity's pressing billions is a relatively minor current. Their respective desires to dispense with psychological fiction issued primarily from rather stark estimations of the significance of ordi nary human lives. Lewis took a bold stand against "humanism," de claring it, as Hulme did, both misguided and moribund, and it is on the antihumanism of his fiction that he stakes his claim to genuinely revolutionary status, over against the superficial novelties of other modernist writers. Modernist representations of interiority, he finds, are essentially continuous with Romanticism, itself but a latter stage of Hellenic humanism: "Joyce or James are highly representative. Their art (consisting in 'telling from the inside' as it is described) has for its backgrounds the naturalism (the flowing lines, the absence of linear organization, and also the inveterate humanism) of the Hel lenic pictorial culture" {Men 104). Against this superannuated tradi tion he pits "the non-human outlook" of his non-moral satire, which, he claims, registers the "[ijmmense and critical revalutions [that]</page><page sequence="21">112 Abstraction, Comedy, and Modernist AntiHumanism are taking place," the "Umvertung aller Werte" (revaluation of all values) (Men 99, 102). But his polemical antihumanism is belied by his practice. Lewis had an infallible eye for the feeble and the ridicu lous (not to mention the grotesque) and his strictures on "our soft conceit" (Men 99) have a tinge of Puritan severity. But he excised the theology from Hulme's apocalyptic interpretation of modern art. He is no ascetic, and never brandished the doctrine of original sin at the hubris of modernity. Lewis, like Ortega, enjoyed the polemical volt age of appearing to repudiate the human, but for both men geomet ric art stood for intellectual detachment and distinction, not spiritual transcendence. The blasts of Lewis's satirical novels, like his nonac tion writings, and like the comic sketches of The Wild Body invariably issue from his resolutely held and distinctly humanist ideal of intel lectually emancipated self-determination. His work is not antihumanist; it is humanism at a hysterical pitch, holding rational autonomy so sacrosanct that it becomes a qualification not just for humanity but, almost, for sentience. Riding never characterized herself as antihumanist; on the con trary she assigns herself to the defense of human exceptionalism against the "hell of human self-weariness" {Telling 77) that is twen tieth-century thought. The invidious divisions of Progress of Stories do not persist into her later work, but the narrative of progression toward unity is elaborated and amplified. To the end of her life she insisted that we are "in archetype more angel of a universal mystery than risen animal playing a drama of social evolution," that "We, human, are life, an enthusiasm, being's own love-of-being outlasting Failure—an interminable faith in itself of the One-And-AII" (20, 27). Riding rejected comparisons of her thought with Buddha's on the grounds that "he prophesied a perfection of human nature that was but the loss of it" (34). But it is difficult to see how she does not do just that, as the love of humanity she writes of, often very movingly, always turns out to be premised on her particular vision of it—not an infinitude of individual strivings but a confusion that will resolve it self in convergence, as each of us undergoes "a final, irrevocable, ridding of the self of all with which it is substanced as a center of social identity" in order to become "a representative of that One, a speaker of the whole truth, truth rescued from the unintegratable, diverse narratives of being sounding within each human locale" (104 05). Riding ultimately subordinates creative and intellectual distinc tion, and individuality itself, to a greater whole of unified being. As a sequence of intimations of that vision, Progress of Stories has better claim than The Wild Body to be a venture in antihumanist fiction. Lewis's and Riding's experiments in eliminating, rather than illuminating, psychological depth do reveal ugly seams in the intel lectual history of the period. But, importantly, they also manifest a</page><page sequence="22">Ophir 113 significant tension in the history of narrative fiction. By the turn of the century, Northrop Frye observed, realism in fiction had been de veloped to a point at which "interest in ideas and theoretical state ments" had become "alien to the genius of the novel proper" and the central "technical problem [was] to dissolve all theory into personal relationships" (308). On the other hand, there persisted alongside and even within the novel the older modes of allegory and parable, with their flattened agents and motley forms, all of which began to proliferate anew in the twentieth century. The fiction of psyche and society remains dominant enough that the recent study Fictional Minds (2004) can take as its premise that "narrative fiction is, in essence, the presentation of fictional mental functioning," "almost as if the text is simply the scaffolding on which you build the vivid psychological processes that stay with you for so long afterward" (Palmer 5, 3). Similarly, with uncharacter istic disciplinary deference, the philosopher of mind Galen Strawson warmly received the argument of David Lodge's Consciousness and the Novel(2002) that the novel has a "plausible claim to be the most powerful tool we have for the recording and examination of con sciousness" (Strawson). Such fiction also retains a particular ethical sanction, as conferred, for instance, by Wayne Booth and Martha Nussbaum. But the very eminence of character-centered, psycho logical fiction ensures that it will remain a provocation and a target, perennially subject to parody, critique, and resistance from a multi plicity of bases that have diverse motivations and no necessary con nection to the devaluation of the individual life that marks the works of Lewis and Riding. Volleys have been regularly launched from the avant-garde (from Joyce himself, Samuel Beckett, and Alain Robbe Grillet, through to Angela Carter and Kathy Acker); from the theo logical (the singular case of Flannery O'Connor); and, not least, from "below." Ortega, Lewis, and Riding assumed that minimizing the op portunity for emotional exercise in fiction would shake off the "vul gar," the "mechanical," the "democratic mass." None of their respec tive characterizations of the social dross and its tastes distinguished between what may be roughly termed bourgeois and popular tradi tions in art and entertainment. The opposition to psychological real ism was more nearly a reaction against the former; it did not recog nize the contemporary flourishing of decidedly antipsychological popular forms such as slapstick and burlesque. Ortega concludes that modern artists achieve their effects not by abandoning "human matter" altogether, but by displaying their triumph over it through aggressive disfiguration: they "drive home the victory by presenting in each case the strangled victim" (23). But large numbers of read ers, in his time as in ours, are more likely to be alienated by expan sive and subtle novels of lives than by one-dimensional human fig</page><page sequence="23">114 Abstraction, Comedy, and Modernist AntiHumanism ures treated with comic dispatch. In attempting to arrest empathy Lewis's and Riding's stories in fact drew closer, in style if not exactly in spirit, to those ludic forms. The hybridized popular genres of fan tasy, action, and often brutal satire that now pervade film and televi sion, with their flattened figures and casual violence, are among these contrarian modernist fictions' nearest contemporary kin. Notes 1. As I outline below, Lewis identified abstraction with fixity and spatial organization, as opposed to flux and temporality. Readers may there fore be surprised by Lewis's concession of defeat here, given Joseph Frank's influential argument that modernist literature is character ized precisely by "spatial form." But Lewis did not detect spatial qualities in any modernist fiction save his own, and would likely have been unconvinced by Frank's thesis. Ulysses, one of Frank's exem plars, was Lewis's bête noir. He grudgingly admired it, but his decid edly puissant misreading finds it the "highly romantic" result of a method that "imposes a softness, flabbiness and vagueness every where in its bergsonian [sic] fluidity" {Time and Western Man 101). (His route to this verdict is convoluted but not simplistic: see the subsection "Analysis of the Mind of James Joyce" in Time and West ern Man.) 2. The comment appears in "Modern Fiction," which was written in 1919. Woolf returned repeatedly to the subject of fiction and life, and in later essays she is inclined to argue that the English novel could do with a little less unadulterated "life" and quite a lot more "art." See for instance "Life and the Novelist," "The Art of Fiction" (which de fends James against Forster's charge that his patterns evacuate life), and "Phases of Fiction." For a lucid discussion of the balance be tween the values of interiority and of comic detachment in Woolf's fiction and criticism, see McWhittier. 3. The most prominent arguments for fiction's role in individual moral development are those of Booth and Nussbaum {Love's Knowledge and Poetic Justice). Richard Posner has opposed their arguments at length ("Against Ethical Criticism" and Law and Literature). For con cise statements on the issue by each, see the Symposium in Philoso phy and Literature 22.2 (1998): 343-412. 4. The term "crowd" undergoes a distinct slippage. Conclusions about the behavior of crowds in the sense of large numbers of people physi cally massed together are applied to crowds in the disdainful sense of people-in-general or masses. The original premise of crowd psy chology is that all individuals are subject to psychological alteration when part of a physical crowd. But writers on the subject tended both to hold themselves exempt and to apply their arguments "to divergent and largely normative social phenomena" of mass societ</page><page sequence="24">Ophir 115 ies, including electoral populations, fashion crazes, religious move ments, and newspaper readerships (Esteve 4). 5. The association of literary "classicism" with antidemocratic politics was clear, but what it could mean with respect to contemporary aes thetic practice was much less so. Lewis was reluctant to part with the potent dualism, but in 1934 declared the terms "romanticism" and "classicism" "strictly unusable." Citing Hulme's claim that "After a hundred years, we are in for a classical revival" he says, "Well, I suppose we have had it, or are having it. . . . By the word of its critical and apologetic utterances we know it is 'classical,1 certainly, but not by what it does by way of illustration" (Men 164-165). 6. "A Notebook" appeared as a series of seven pieces in The New Age between December 1915 and February 1916. In The Collected Writ ings of T. E Hu/me [1994), Karen Csengeri reprints them under that title. Herbert Read had put an abridged version of the series in the collection Speculations (1924), under the title "Humanism and the Religious Attitude." 7. Wörringer's study makes no reference to modern art. From the van tage of 1948 he explained that there had been "a conjunction, quite unsuspected by myself, of my personal disposition for certain prob lems with the fact that a whole period was disposed for a radical reorientation of its standards of aesthetic value." Thus his theories, "which were concerned only with historical interpretation, were trans posed so as to apply to contemporary movements in the artistic conflict." "The compass of my instinct," he concludes, "had pointed in a direction inexorably preordained by the dictate of the spirit of the age" (vii-viii). 8. Lewis was unwilling or unable to recognize in Gertrude Stein's work anything more than willful childishness; "exploitation of the processes of the demented" {Time 102); or experimentation in the direction of music, which he finds unsatisfactory: "it is only doing what the mu sician has been doing for centuries, but doing it poorly, because the instrument of speech on the one hand, and the verbal symbolism on the other, will not, in the case of words, yield such a purity of effect" ( Time 111). 9. The Dehumanization of Art was not published in English until 1948, but Ortega's The Revolt of the Masses, which Lewis would have found congenial, was translated and published in England in 1932. 10. The capacity to empathize is characterized one moment as "noble" (even if weak), and the next as merely mechanistic, "an automatic effect," but this inconsistency is not simply carelessness. "The De humanization of Art" is frequently and incorrectly treated as an un equivocal endorsement of the new aesthetics. While Ortega embraces the apparently antipopulist quality of modernism, the essay displays ambivalence about what he calls its inhumanity. 11. Ortega's essay is stronger in theory than practical demonstration. The list of proper names is short: Debussy and Stravinsky in music;</page><page sequence="25">116 Abstraction, Comedy, and Modernist AntiHumanism Mallarmé in poetry; Pirandello in drama. He names no painters, only the movements of Expressionism and Cubism. Among novelists he points out Proust and Joyce, on the grounds that they exhibit "con tempt for the old monumental forms of the soul and an unhuman attention to the micro-structure of sentiments, social relations, char acters" (36). "Unhuman" seems a particularly inappropriate descrip tor in this case, and as I argue below, his subsequent "Notes on the Novel" changes tack. 12. Ortega was a liberal reformer under the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera (1923-30), but he was no democrat. "Behind all contem porary life," he writes, "lurks the provoking and profound injustice of the assumption that men are actually equal" (7). His treatise The Revolt of the Masses distinguishes the "select minority," who should lead, from "mass-man," who should be led (7). 13. Hugh Kenner concludes that up to the mid-thirties "the world [Lewis] was observing . . . always seemed to him little more real than a Punch and Judy show," and that just as the anti-Semitism he had equanimously observed in Munich in 1906 "impressed him ... as a relatively harmless knockabout farce engaged in by people who on both sides had cheerfully turned themselves into racial stereotypes," so "people susceptible to worry, pain, and frustration didn't exist in the universe to which he was attuned" (83). David Trotter has re cently offered an exposition of Lewis's life and work in terms of "anti pathos," which he wavers between calling "strategic" and "mildly psychotic." Biographies of Lewis document both shockingly callous behavior in his personal relationships as well as testimonials to his general amiability. 14. For a recent discussion of Lewis and Behaviorism, see Stanfield, who suggests that "Behaviourism for Lewis was no ordinary antagonist. Like a tar-baby, it is one from which he cannot extricate himself" (242). 15. For a detailed account of the composition and arrangement of the sketches that eventually came to be The Wild Body, see Bernard Lafourcade. He argues that Lewis's postwar revisions effect a shift from a lingering vitalism to a protoexistentialist vision of the absurd. Vincent Sherry, Ian Duncan, and David Corbett have each argued that the major shift is toward interpretive mastery. 16. Lafourcade, for instance, argues that Lewis's substitution of "thing behaving like a person" for Bergson's "du méchanique plaqué sur du vivant" "perfectly illustrates the advent of absurdism" (79). 17. The exception is the story of the innkeeper Bestre, whose life re volves around the quarrels he picks with a succession of towns people and tourists. He pits himself against a visiting painter's wife in this story, and finally quits his opponent by exposing himself. Few critics have failed to point out the extraordinary triviality of subject in "Bestre" and "A Solider of Humour." However, the flimsiness of Valmore's delusion and the pointlessness of Bestre's battles can be</page><page sequence="26">Ophir 117 seen as reinforcing the narrative premise—the essential vacuity of these existences. 18. Lafourcade notes that "cornac," meaning "guide" "is French and com monly used, whereas the English 'carnac' is rare" (Lewis, Complete 104, n.l) 19. Geoffrey Wagner writes that "there are hints in the Discours de ia méthode that a machine in the shape of an animal was no different, in Descartes' eyes, from the animal itself . . . What worried him, and other mechanists . . . was that beasts evidently felt pain." He adds that "Descartes met this difficulty by proposing that dogs felt a pain that was different in kind from human pain, being merely corporeal and therefore still mechanistic" (227-28). Some such rationale ap pears to lie behind Lewis's depictions of human suffering in The Wild Body. 20. In Men Without Art lews takes The Apes of God as a prime example of non-moral satire; he does not mention The Wild Body, even though it is the most nearly fitting of the four works of fiction he had pub lished up to that point. The Apes of God (1930) is the most straight forwardly satirical of the lot, but given its exclusive concentration on Bloomsbury it hardly eschews mere "period" concerns as non-moral satire is supposed to do (102). Snooty Baronet (1932) too has a distinctly topical focus that is ostensibly Behaviourism. (The point of view of the Behaviourist is adopted so seamlessly that the satirical angle is virtually indiscernible.) The ChUdermass (1928) is probably better classified as a drama of ideas (Jameson offers "theological science-fiction" [6]). 21. See for example Peter Kramer. Ian Carpenter provides a valuable synthesis of theoretical discussions of comic violence, as well as a wealth of close analyses. 22. Riding did take a stand against communism in The Left Heresy in Literature and Life (1939), co-written with Harry Kemp, but she and Kemp do not suggest fascism as a reasonable alternative. After Riding and her circle were driven out of Spain by the civil war she briefly led an effort of sorts for intervention in national affairs, forming a "Council of the Inside People" whose concerted moral will was to avert the impending world war. The council's charter, titled Covenant of Literal Morality, declared the inception of "a plenary action of judgment against evil" (111). Because the instrument of power is the will of the signatories, the Covenant s not, practically speaking, a menac ing document. However, it displays the paranoid absolutism typical of the totalitarian regimes it aimed to disable: With the instigators of evil politics must be counted all whom they excite to partisanship in action and thought. . . . The instruments of wrong-doing cannot be judged innocent. There is now such a clear demarcation to be made between good and evil activity that we cannot afford to compromise our val ues by counting on the side of good those who offend by help</page><page sequence="27">118 Abstraction, Comedy, arid Modernist AntiHumanism lessness rather than evil will. . . . The task that devolves upon us in this extreme moral climax of life is too solemn a one to permit of lenient niceties. (9) The enterprise was at least short-lived, dissolving by 1940. 23. The passage closely echoes Ortega's assessment of the historical role of the masses. "Fora century and a half the masses have claimed to be the whole of society. Stravinski's music or Pirandello's drama have the sociological effect of compelling the people to recognize itself for what it is: a component among others of the social struc ture, inert matter of the historical process, a secondary factor in the cosmos of spiritual life" (7).
