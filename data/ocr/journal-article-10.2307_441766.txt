<plain_text><page sequence="1">Edith Wharton at War: Civilized Space in Troubled Times ANNETTE LARSON BENERT In a crucial scene in A Son at the Front (1922), Edith Wharton's only full- length novel about World War I, the artist protagonist, as news of the horrors escalates, comes to see man as a defenceless animal suddenly torn from his shell, stripped of all the interwoven tendrils of association, habit, back- ground, . . . flung out of the human habitable world into naked ether, where nothing breathes or lives. (183-84) The passage vividly portrays widespread feelings of vulnerability before the terrifying new techniques and technologies of the Great War, which many Americans identified with Germany. The delayed entrance of the United States into the war led Wharton's impatient friend and fellow expatriate, Henry James, in his last year, to become a British citizen, an "apostasy" that at first shocked even other long-time fellow emigres like painter John Singer Sargent' but that carried in its wake even their- maybe especially their-bitter understanding. Wharton shared James's perspective, though not his choice, believing that Americans should "make every sacrifice to atone for the cowardice of their government."2 She implored Robert Grant, a Boston jurist and fellow novelist, to "proclaim everywhere ... what it will mean to all that we Americans cherish if England &amp; France go under, &amp; Prussianism becomes the law of life,"3 and assuring him that "all the wild rumours of 'atrocities' are true, &amp; are understated."4 In A Son at the Front, sympathetically portrayed characters exclaim that "this isn't war-it's simple murder!" and that "Germany was conducting it on methods that civilization had made men forget"; one of them even calls "Germans not fit to live with white people" (90, 92, 133). All of this is 322</page><page sequence="2">EDITH WHARTON from a woman who was "nourished in infancy on a German Bible,"5 who took "refuge" in Goethe and Schopenhauer "when everything else bec[ame] meaningless,"6 and who in 1913 found Berlin "the model modern town" in its "cleanliness, order, &amp; general perfection."7 Yet in 1932 she confided to a friend that she couldn't "get used" to the Germans "even now and even in homeopathic doses."8 Wharton's writings about the war, however, are rarely so overtly racist, or so focused on personal atrocities. Instead, they portray, rather literally, "man as a defenceless animal" thrust not simply out of neces- sary shelter but out of the buildings and grounds that make human life and relationships possible. The waging of World War I displaced people, destroyed farms and villages, made rubble of institutions, made the earth itself less habitable. In particular, the historic architecture of France, valued both as evidence of high civilization and as civilizing in its effects, became suddenly, frighteningly vulnerable. When news spread of cathedrals, town halls, towns themselves flattened in minutes, and of men trapped in filthy trenches and murdered or mutilated outside them by weapons of terrible force and accuracy, many other- wise sane Anglo-Americans retreated into the most primitive kind of racism. However, Wharton's most substantial contribution to the litera- ture of World War I-in fiction, essays, journalism, and letters-is not this chauvinist lapse of an otherwise formidable intellect but the way she concretized her concerns, the realism with which she portrayed French civilization in the actual physical structures that the Germans threatened and destroyed. Wharton's lifelong engagement in architectural issues surfaced in two early books, The Decoration of Houses (1897), written with architect Ogden Codman, and Italian Villas and Their Gardens (1904), in exten- sive reference in her fiction and travel writing, and in her building of The Mount in 1904 and her reconstruction of a house in Newport and two villas in France. Furthermore, like James, she had already lamented American architectural inadequacies, observing sardonically how American wealth and energy tended to create uninhabitable places,9 and she supported fully the impetus toward "City Beautiful" that had overtaken American civic sensibilities by the turn of the century. Born into the old New York elite, she knew many of the architects-literal and figurative-of "Progressive America" and had at least overt sympathy with the whole project. For example, in 1900, the American Academy at Rome, which provided opportunity for young architects to study in Rome, met at Wharton's Park Avenue home and asked her to write a publicity piece on the organization.'l From the 1880s to World 323</page><page sequence="3">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE War I, American cities took shape and substance in the most important period of public building this country has ever seen. The Progressive impetus for institutional reform, for the incorporation of all aspects of public life, and for accommodation to the stresses of industrial capi- talism achieved its most palpable reality in the mushrooming metropolis. The new science of sociology generated a widespread awareness of how the built environment affected those who lived and worked and played in it. Designed in part to educate and assimilate the poor and foreign born into mainstream culture, the new structures and spaces were also expected to reify an America at last come of age, to reinforce traditional elitist values, and to reproduce social class struc- ture and relationship in a volatile and unpredictable urban environment." The Progressive aesthetic counted on neoclassical forms to civilize raw American cities, even as Progressive ideology saw city planning and institutions of high culture as agents of social control. Though leaving behind a faith in bricks and mortar that continues to skew our institutional priorities, the aesthetic arm of the Progressive movement also raised important issues of building and landscape design and of stewardship of both the natural and built environments. For people of Wharton's social class, France in particular repre- sented the standard in landscapes, public places, and domestic spaces. Most of America's prominent nineteenth-century architects had studied in Paris at the Ecole des Beaux Arts, returning with neoclassical principles of function, construction, and decoration that informed most American public structures built before World War I. The first academic architecture programs hired Ecole-trained design instructors to ensure "sound compositional theory and classical design instruction" (Roth 179-80). Wharton intended her most explicitly Francophilic work, French Ways and Their Meaning, which appeared serially in Century magazine in 1918 and in book form in 1919, to chastise her compatriots for their "egregious" lack of French cultural attributes,'2 often described in spatial or structural terms. As examples of French taste, the "beautiful stone quays along the great rivers," with their "noble monuments of architecture, and gardens and terraces," contrast appallingly to "the wasteful degradation of the unrivaled twin river- fronts of New York" (41-44). And we have still much to learn from French garden practice, in that "the deeper civilisation of a country may to a great extent be measured by the care she gives to her flower- garden" (38). However, America does show something of French "reverence," a tender "respect for all fine human effort," in "her eager- ness to beautify her towns, and to preserve her few pre-revolutionary 324</page><page sequence="4">EDITH WHARTON buildings-that small fragment of her mighty European heritage" (37). A discussion of "continuity" takes Western art back 30,000 years to Stone Age caves, which illustrate that "French culture is the most homo- geneous and uninterrupted culture the world has known" (80). In this context, then, with the heavy freight attached to the built environment of France, the bombing of old French cities was felt with agonizing vividness by the American elite. Scribner's Magazine, in which Wharton published most of her early work, chronicled more than any other "quality monthly" the evolution of American public building and city planning, an emphasis that ended abruptly after the war began. Gothic revival architect Ralph Adams Crams's bitter December 1914 account of the bombing of French cathedrals, destroyed by "a new thing in the world built on all [they] denied" (814), provided a benediction not simply to ruined buildings but also to serious architectural discussion in the magazine. For Wharton, as for others of the old moneyed classes, the attach- ment to France had its origins in childhood-in a classical education, in neoclassical tastes, and in early experiences of the older forms of "civilized" life particularly evident in the post-Hausmann Paris that Walter Benjamin called "the capital of the nineteenth century."'3 Wharton's 1932 autobiographical fragment, "Life and I," highlights her tendency to see "the visible world as a series of pictures, more or less harmoniously composed" (1). Her earliest memories of Europe, at around age six, are "impressions of scenery, &amp; more sharply drawn visions of rooms," a "visual sensibility ... as intense then as it is now" (2-3). She recalls, too, when returning to New York, the bitter disappointment produced by the first impressions of my native country. I was only ten years old, but I had been fed on beauty since my babyhood, &amp; my first thought was: 'How ugly it is!' I have never since thought otherwise or felt otherwise than as an exile in America. (19) The works of John Ruskin eventually "gave me back the image of the beautiful Europe I had lost, &amp; woke in me the habit of precise visual observation" (28). At age 17, she joyfully returned to Europe "without a backward glance!" because she "was going to see pictures &amp; beautiful things again." She recalls "standing in the Salon Carre, soon after our arrival in Paris," feeling "as if all the great waves of the sea of Beauty were breaking over me at once" (46-47). Several letters to Sara Norton convey similar feelings as an adult; every time she came back to the United States, she felt herself among "the wretched exotics produced in a European glass-house," hating "the wild, disheveled backwoods look 325</page><page sequence="5">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE of everything." In 1904 she wrote of the "horror" of "a whole nation to be developing without the sense of beauty," and in 1906 she wrote that what "ails 'our country"' aesthetically is that "the American landscape has no foreground, &amp; the American mind no background."'4 For her, this country lacked the physical structures and cultural longevity neces- sary to civilized life. The first of her war novels, The Marne (1918), captures much of Wharton's youthful enthusiasm.'5 The young, emblematically named Troy Belknap acquires deep impressions of thatched villages with square-towered churches in hollows of the deep green country, or grey shining towns above rivers on which cathedrals seemed to be moored like ships; . . . and little embroidered stone manors reflected in reed-grown moats under ancient trees. (3) France for him (as for young Edith Jones) became "his holiday world, the world of his fancy and imagination, a great traceried window opening on the universe" (9). His tutor, M. Gantier, enjoins him to "open as many windows on the universe as you can." For Troy, France had been "the biggest of those windows" (39), and his most enduring memory that of the Gantiers's "box-garden with the hornbeam arbour where they had gone to drink coffee" (12). The war reveals that "every stone that France had carved, every song she had sung, every new idea she had struck out, every beauty she had created in her thousand fruitful years, was a tie between her and her children" (40). To these young eyes, architecture became the emblem of French civilization, the means by which it was seen and valued, a window onto what was highest and best in Western civilization. However, the stones of France played a more complex role for the adult Edith Wharton. Her mature experience is most apparent in the 1908 A Motor-Flight through France, which chronicles a spring tour, shared in part with Henry James, chiefly through the description of landscapes, town sites, and buildings.'6 On the heels of that tour, she described to old friends her near "suffocation" at a France "so rich, so varied, so packed with old 'etats d'ame' &amp; their visible expressions!" and "the immense richness &amp; variety of appeal to the eye &amp; the imagi- nation in every corner of the 'terres franpaise.'"7 The book valorizes in the French landscape the "long familiar intercourse between the earth and its inhabitants" (5) and the Gothic cathedral as a symbol of mankind's "long invincible struggle for 'more light"' (9). As for others of her class and background-one thinks particularly of Henry Adams'8-this history and sensibility, coupled with the Progressive 326</page><page sequence="6">EDITH WHARTON aesthetic with its heavy moral and social agenda, continued to color her view of France. But Motor-Flight also recognizes how buildings inscribe the social order, including the means of their production. Wharton constantly "reads" the history of towns in their buildings, those "mighty records of medieval life" that inspire "reverence for the persistent slow-moving, far-reaching forces that brought them forth," including those of cost and class. In fact, she foregrounds this "more complex point of view," from which perspective "a great Gothic cathedral sums up so much of history, it has cost so much in faith and toil, in blood and folly and saintly abnegation . . . that it is like some mysteriously preserved ancestor" (10). This firm sense of material life reappears in the "colossal stone oxen" in the tower arches of Laon that "commemorate the services of the patient beasts" and represent "the moral and mate- rial cost at which Christianity reared its monuments." In fact, those "triumphing oxen," standing "for so vast a sum of dull, unrewarded, unintelligible toil, have on the whole done more for civilisation than the angels of Saint Pere sous Vezelay." Thus, oxen and angels together represent the "visionary passion" that generated the great cathedrals and "the painful expenditure of human and animal labour that made the vision a reality" (193-94). Grounded thus in the socioeconomic order, buildings also repli- cate and reinforce it. Dijon manifests a "continuity of life" and the coherence of "a vascular system, binding the place together in its network of warm veins" (146, 155). In this symbiotic relationship to human society, buildings also have significant relationships to each other. In archaic Coucy, "the contrast between the humble yet stout old stone houses ranged, as it were, below the salt, and the Castle throned on its dais of rock at one of the enclosures seems to sum up the whole social system of the Middle Ages" (182). The cathedral at Nevers has "in the old ducal palace across the square a rival more than capable of meeting its challenge," while the chateaux at "Ramouillet and Maintenon are characteristically French in their way of keeping company with their villages" (69, 75). The country house at Nohant is "the image of those grave ideals to which George Sand gradually conformed the passionate experiment of her life," its "weight of association and habit" helping to effect that conformation (47). In modern Angouleme, the cathedral, avenues, terraces, squares, and public gardens demonstrate not only the prosperity of its paper industry but also "the invincible French passion for form and fitness" (97). 327</page><page sequence="7">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE The contemporary social cost of all this form and fitness is more apparent in her fictional portrayal of ancestral houses. Most of her fiction set in France, like her 1908 novel The Reef, focuses on the American emigre experience, with French people and structures serving, often ironically, as backdrop. Of the two stories with significant French characters, "Kerfol" ' is a framed historical piece that, like "The Duchess at Prayer" (1900) and "The House of the Dead Hand" (1904), both set in Italy, feature ancient structures used to control, even imprison, women; we can see this pattern also in "The Hermit and the Wild Woman" (1906) set in Renaissance Italy and in the 1919 travel book, In Morocco. The only short fiction with significant French charac- ters is "Madame de Treymes" (1907), an intensely contemporary tale of Americans confronting the old French aristocracy. Protagonist John Durham is continually impressed by the vast and consummately ordered spectacle of Paris: by its look of having been boldly and deliberately planned as a back- ground for the enjoyment of life, instead of being forced into grudging concessions to the festive instincts, or barricading itself against them in unenlightened ugliness, like his own lamentable New York. (165) At the ancestral home of his beloved Madame de Malrive, an American miserably married to a French nobleman, he is conscious of "the wigged and cuirassed portraits frowning high on the walls, the majestic attitude of the furniture, the rigidity of great gilt consoles drawn up like lords-in-waiting against the tarnished panels" (186). Like structures in James's The American, the H6tel Malrive takes on "inscrutable shades," eventually becoming "the incorruptible custodian of old prejudices and strange social survivals" (198, 212). The walls themselves reflect the Malrive alliance against their American in-law as the family proposes an exchange of Madame de Malrive's young son for her divorce. Wharton is at her anthropological, and imaginative, best in portraying the shadows, the inexorable and unscrupulous morality, behind the elegance and formality of old French buildings. However, oxen and angels, light and shadows, all disappeared during the Great War. The stresses of that event appear to have over- powered both her intellectual complexity and her cultural sophistication. French structures that evolved from icons of high ideals to emblems of a complex, morally ambiguous culture became, more simply, the pious remnants and replications of France as an abstract ideal. In French Ways and Their Meaning, France is "a house on fire," in which 328</page><page sequence="8">EDITH WHARTON all the lodgers are on the stairs, in dishabille. Their doors are swinging wide, and one gets glimpses of their furniture, revela- tions of their habits, and whiffs of their cooking, that a life-time of ordinary intercourse would not offer. (v) What she sees in that endangered house are distinguishing French characteristics that the war threatened in their most concrete manifes- tations. However, because "American propaganda" has failed to help servicemen "understand the French character &amp; all that France means to civilization,"20 she undertook to correct American perceptions. During the war, Wharton portrayed its effects, the actual ruin that the Germans inflicted, less often in medical than in architectural terms. Her only real war short story is "Coming Home" (1916)21 which is set in France and narrated at secondhand by a member of the American Relief Corps, which supported French troops before the United States formally entered the war. ProtagonistJean de Rechamp is a young cavalry officer of ancient lineage facing German invasion of his home territory in the Vosges. "Coming home" means hearing of "murder, outrage, torture," the German General Scharlach's "compre- hensive program," and, more important, seeing first a ruined mill "like an abandoned stoneyard," in which "a fortified gate gaped on empti- ness," "a mill wheel hung in the stream" (241), and then "the wreck, apparently, of a great chateau and its dependencies" (243)--the sense- less wasting of the cultural work of France. Rechamp finds his own ancient house preserved like "a cinema scene: fine old drawing room with family portraits, shaded lamp, domestic group about the fire," a "fine secure old room, in which nothing seemed altered or disturbed" (244-45). We learn that the "coolness and courage" of Rechamp's fiancee, who, having smuggled away the father and a younger son and served the invading Germans iced coffee with whipped cream and strawberries, had apparently also convinced the sadistic but supercivi- lized Scharlach to spare villa and village alike. The story ends with Rechamp's having hastened the wounded Scharlach's death, revenge for the horrors of which only the mill and the chateau provide concrete evidence. Even more than "Coming Home," the titles of both war novels, The Marne (1918) and A Son at the Front (1922), emphasize the importance of the Great War as a place, a locus of systematic physical destruction and their protagonists' appalled response to it. As the young hero of The Marne observes refugees and ruined villages, he realizes that war "emptied towns of their inhabitants as it emptied veins of their blood; it killed houses and lands as well as men," who "must have the same 329</page><page sequence="9">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE unnatural look as these wan ruins, these gutted houses and sterile fields" (24-25). All that remains of his tutor's village is "the wall of the terraced garden, with the horn-beam arbour putting forth its early green. Everything else was in ruins" (64). Fields, houses, churches alike show the decivilizing effects of German bombardment, as well as a mythic quality in their destruction.22 Wharton provided the fullest accounts of the war in a series of arti- cles for Scribner's Magazine, begun from her Parisian home base and concluding in the frontline trenches; they were collected, with two other essays, in FightingFrance (1915).2s In the first piece, "The Look of Paris," which opened the May 1915 Scribner's, the war felt "like a monstrous landslide, . . . burying under a heap of senseless ruin the patiently and painfully wrought machinery of civilization" (9). As mobilization became general, "every great architectural opening framed an emptiness; all the endless avenues stretched away to desert distances" (13). Yet the city "scorned all show of war, and fed the patri- otism of her children on the mere sight of her beauty" (25). The war emptied civilized structures but left them, inspirationally, intact. This anthropomorphic language becomes more graphic in a later piece, "In the North." First there was Ypres, "bombarded to death," "a disemboweled corpse," with blasted houses in whose "exposed inte- riors the poor little household gods shiver and blink like owls surprised in a hollow tree" (152-53).24 Then Poperinghe "in its tidy desolation" looked "like a town on which a wicked enchanter has laid a spell," its buildings "like a mind from which memory has gone." For Wharton, "that orderly arrest of life seemed sadder than a scene of desperate disarray. It symbolized the senseless paralysis of a whole nation's activities," showing that "wherever the shadow of Germany falls, all things should wither at the root" (155-57). Dunkerque provided her first glimpse of "the raw wounds of bombardment." There, the squalid sight of caved-in floors, smashed wardrobes, dangling bed-steads, heaped-up blankets, topsy-turvy chairs and stoves and wash-stands was somehow far more painful than the sight of the wounded church. St. Eloi was draped in the indestructible dignity of martyrdom, but the poor little house reminded one of some shy humdrum person suddenly exposed in the glare of a great misfortune. (173-74) Wharton's language viscerally emphasizes the equivalent waste of private and public property, of personal and collective capital, giving an even hand to her Jeremiad and lending credence to her insistence 330</page><page sequence="10">EDITH WHARTON that "only Biblical lamentation can convey a vision of the life-drained land" (158). French fortitude and resilience became increasingly clear as Wharton ventured into the battle zone, in the piece that opened the June Scribner's. "In Argonne" vividly portrays "another world" of fallow fields and empty doorways, of ragged and ruined eclopis staggering back from the front (46, 49). The "pleasant villages of the Aisne" are now "a mere waste of rubble and cinders"; of "all the thousand and one bits of the past that give meaning and continuity to the present . . . nothing was left but a brick-heap and some twisted stove-pipes!" Yet "at every cross-road or railway bridge a warm sentry-box of mud and straw and plaited pine-branches was plastered against a bank or tucked like a swallow's nest into a sheltered corner" (56-58). A physician near the front had somehow cobbled together an emergency shelter that included "sterilizing and disinfecting appliances, a bandage-room, a pharmacy, a well-filled wood-shed, and a clean kitchen in which 'tisanes' were brewing over a cheerful fire" (67). In land yet more desolate, she came upon a grange turned into a field hospital, and a canal boat complete "with hot douches" and "gay curtain [s] of red-flowered chintz" (78). The dogged replications of domestic harmony and tranquillity poignantly articulate not simply French resilience but also the fine web of civilized life that the French military seemed naturally to spin. Wharton opens "In Lorraine and the Vosges" with a bouquet picked from a garden in Gerbeviller, the better to emphasize that through streets and streets of such murdered houses, through town after town spread out in its last writhings, . . we have seen flowers and vegetables springing up in freshly raked and watered gardens. My pink peonies were not introduced to point the stale allegory of unconscious Nature veiling Man's havoc [but] as a symbol of conscious human energy coming back to replant and rebuild the wilderness. (93-94) In one ruined hamlet, the life of humankind was maintained by Catholic nuns in a makeshift hospital and by the local cure in a care- fully plotted and planted graveyard (112-15). In another "black village," reservists had created "a forest colony" whose "elaborate archi- tecture" sheltered "a long table decked with lilacs and tulips was spread for tea" and "neat rows of bunks, mess-tables, sizzling sauce-pans over kitchen-fires" (126). At the front itself, a ravine divided "the men [i.e., the Germans] who had made the war" from the Frenchmen "who had been made by it" (135)-the "making" in both cases portrayed primarily in architectural and horticultural terms.25 331</page><page sequence="11">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE For "In Alsace," Wharton entered "the first-line trenches," after traveling by mule through the mud and crawling through the actual entrenchments: Half underground, walled with logs, and deeply roofed by sods tufted with ferns and moss, the cabins were scattered under the trees and connected with each other by paths bordered with white stones. Before the Colonel's cabin the soldiers had made a banked-up flower-bed sown with annuals; and farther up the slope stood a log chapel, a mere gable with a wooden altar under it, all tapestried with ivy and holly. (210-11) This elaborate "sylvan retreat" provides a climactic illustration of French cultural fortitude. She claims, then, that her vision of the front was formed by her actually traversing the territory and descending into the trenches them- selves, a fact of which she was openly proud.26 Wharton wrote to James in February that an officer had pronounced her "la premiere femme qui soit venue d Verdun."27 She told her contact at Scribner's that she was "given opportunities no one else has had of seeing things at the front," and that others had returned "having failed to get into the first line trenches."28 What stands out for the reader of FightingFrance is how her sense of what those trenches were for was shaped by the structures of civilization that she saw destroyed by the Germans and, even more, by those the French erected in the center of "the damnable insanity of war" (200)29 Everywhere, Wharton showed Frenchmen of all classes engaged in structural creation and maintenance, making homes, hospitals, and houses of worship out of the sticks and stones around them. Her account of the war's destructive toll squares with other records, then and now. But there is nothing of the real life in the trenches, nothing of soldiers "helplessly entrenched" between "a deadly bureaucracy ... and a deadly technocracy," as Sandra Gilbert puts it, and defined as "No Man,... a citizen of the unpromising new land into which this war of wars had led him" (197-98). One combatant recalled "the prevailing opinion in the trenches . . . that anything might be true, except what was printed."3? Perhaps Wharton saw what she wanted to see, and of course she went to the front only in the early days, and under the escort of the French high command. In any case, France and the French, quite simply, continued to be the carriers of high culture. In closing FightingFrance, "The Tone of France" cites only the "white glow of dedi- cation" (220), the "exaltation, energy, the hot resolve to dominate the disaster" (225), and concludes that "the only death that Frenchmen 332</page><page sequence="12">EDITH WHARTON fear is not death in the trenches but death by the extinction of their national ideal" (238). After it was all over, by the time Wharton wrote her war fiction, chintz and showers and chapels alike have disappeared, and she makes no attempt to convey life at the front. The protagonists of The Marne and "Coming Home" are not combatants but ambulance drivers, and A Son at the Front describes only a dark chaotic line of "lorries, field- kitchens, artillery wagons, companies of haggard infantry" (273) and the "fierce din" of guns (285).3' John Campton's "defenceless animal" becomes trapped by the actual battlefield, an "out there" of "fathomless mud, rat-haunted trenches, freezing nights under the sleety sky, men dying in the barbed wire between the lines" (192). Meanwhile, Paris is filled with frivolous and cynical Americans resolutely "forgetting the war" (234), "dancing and flirting and money-making on the great red mounds of dead" (334). Most of the novel is set far from the front, in the offices and studios, the cafes and hotels, of Paris, the rented or borrowed apart- ments of emigre Americans, often satirically described in ways reminiscent of The Decoration of Houses. In this way Wharton stretches whatJoan Scott calls "History," in reference to women writers who "illu- minated the historical importance of the areas of human experience beyond the narrow political arena, such as workplace, household, and family" (22).32 The novel opens with Campton's looking out the window of "his bare studio in Montmartre . . . over his untidy scrap of garden" (3). His attempts at cleaning the "grimy and disordered" room that serves as both living and working space "always resulted in worse confu- sion" (57); incapable of simple maintenance tasks, he needs to be reminded to buy new shirts, and he takes his meals "alone at the soiled table of a frowsy wine-shop" (60). He justifies these frugalities as saving for his son George's return, imagining how pleasant it would be to "hunt out a little apartment in an old house in the Faubourg St. Germain, put some good furniture in it and oppose the discreeter charm of such an interior to the heavy splendours" of his ex-wife's household (178). Campton also conjectures that his ex-wife's reaction against "his ways probably explained the lifeless neatness of the Anderson Brant drawing-room" (57), over which she "thron[es] year after year in an awful emptiness of wealth and luxury and respectability" (89). Even worse is the patchwork apartment of Madge Talkett, the young married woman to whom George is nominally engaged. Her interior chaos is mirrored by a parlor in which "Louis-Philippe mahogany had 333</page><page sequence="13">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE entrenched itself against the aggression of art nouveau hangings, and the frail grace of eighteenth-century armchairs shed derision on lumpy modern furniture painted like hobby-horses at a fair" (228). Worst of all is the "large room hung in shrimp-pink brocade, which opened on a vista of turquoise tiling and porcelain tub" (138) of Harvey Mayhew, who "meant to devote himself to Atrocities" (141), a devotion for which he extorts goodly donations for tales told in "oratorical accents, accom- panied by faint chords on the piano" (202). The focus of satire is not simply bad taste but also the rootlessness, insensitivity, and exploitive- ness of the American expatriate community. Yet, even for Campton, France has become an abstraction. Near the end of the novel, he questions a Frenchman, who seems to be his closest friend: "What's France, with no men left?" Paul Dastrey replies, "Well-I suppose, an Idea" (366). Campton agrees: An Idea: that was what France, ever since she had existed, had always been in the story of civilization; a luminous point about which striving visions and purposes could rally.... What George had felt [was that] if France went, western civilization went with her; and then all they had believed in and been guided by would perish. (366) Furthermore, Campton's emotional life, and many of the characters' relationships, center on competition for George's attention and affec- tion. The eponymous son is cast aloofly, almost mystically, with the blond-haired boy-saints that Paul Fussell has demonstrated were identi- fied with the sacrificial soldier of the Great War.33 He mentally wanders off into some mystical "far country, a country guarded by a winged sentry" (312), characterized by a look "inaccessible to reason, beyond reason, belonging to other spaces, other weights and measures, over the edge, somehow of the tangible calculable world" (359). His haloed image highlights the way the war gave priority to the heroic male sacri- fice over all other activity. For all these rootless bored Americans, George is all that gives their lives validity. Born on French soil, dying in its defense, he becomes, like his saintly English namesake, an icon of patriotism. George, too, has become an abstraction. However, for the reader, the real measure of French civilization comes by way of contrast to these American failures and fantasies. Mme. Lebel, a servant woman who has lost all her sons and grandsons to the war, creates the only cleanliness and order Campton's life may be said to possess.34 Paul Dastrey provides a "substitute for the background of domestic sympathy which, as a rule, would have simply bored or exas- perated him" (9), and he admires Dastrey's "pleasant little entresol full 334</page><page sequence="14">EDITH WHARTON of Chinese lacquer and Venetian furniture" (186). Campton's clearest vision of what the war or France is about is the supper table of a physi- cian to whom he has gone for assistance in keeping George out of the war. Expecting "a lofty room with Chinese hangings, Renaissance choir- stalls, organ, grand piano, and post-impressionist paintings," he is shown instead into a small dining-room with the traditional Henri II sideboard of waxed walnut, a hanging table-lamp under a beaded shade, an India-rubber plant on a plush pedestal, and napkins that were just being restored to their bone rings by the four persons seated about the red-and-white checkered table-cloth. (66-67) This scene of a deeply domesticated civilization, like the box-garden in The Marne, adds credibility to the war as a cultural and moral necessity. The novel thus also underscores John Campton's own failure to make a home, to create the kind of human space in the midst of wartime Paris that even ordinary Frenchmen seemed to be able to maintain and, in Wharton's 1915 journalistic pieces, to create even at the front. Yet this failure is also a mark of his vulnerability, not the phys- ical maiming or shell shock that became hallmarks of that war but an emotional weakness, emptiness, futility that echoes what Elaine Showalter describes as the "emotionally incapacitated men" who provided "a shocking contrast to the heroic visions and masculinist fantasies that had preceded it" (63). Though he feels the debt of Americans who "had, in larger numbers than any other foreigners, sought artistic training in France" (131), his own art has degenerated to painting portraits (often the object of Wharton's derision), to "nurs[ing] my celebrity till I'd got half the fools in Europe lining up to be painted" (251). Further, he paints primarily to make enough money to "free" his son from his wealthy (but also wise and kindly) stepfather, and in so doing give more weight to his own influence. George has also provided the subject of the only good work Campton has done in recent years, and the marble statue that Brant commissions at the end seems to be its coda.35 Campton's fierce attachment to France, his fierce love for his son, and his fierce dislike of the trivialities of his compa- triots are in part a measure of his rootlessness, his homeless estate in a deeply domesticated society. His last work, however splendid, will lodge in a cemetery, and Campton will presumably remain among his paint rags and dirty dishes. Campton's unsettled, uncommitted, and unproductive condition is the more graphic when we examine Wharton's response to the war. Having been all her life, as a counterpoint to her adventures, "rather a 335</page><page sequence="15">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE housekeeperish person,"36 Wharton moved almost immediately to provide appropriate shelter for those most displaced by the war. As in her earlier work on behalf of animals, Wharton strove "to make the work for their protection take a practical rather than a sentimental form" ("Life and I" 23). She was part of a great international effort, largely funded by Americans, to deal in a concerted way with the wartime needs of civilians and soldiers alike. Spinning out of the Progressive movement and paving the way for suffrage, the war provided new arenas for employment and public activity for American women both at home and abroad.37 However, the most immediate and substantial opportunities were for volunteers, for leisure-class women with the skills and resources to organize relief efforts for a wide variety of human needs. Wharton's refugee work also provided the only occa- sion in which she entered full time into a public cause, though she had often supported animal welfare and historic preservation efforts and organizations. Her letters, like her fiction, satirize the self-serving hysteria of inconvenienced tourists, the cynical pleasure seeking of longtime emigres, the ambulance chasers who dwell endlessly on "atrocities," and the sentimentalists who want "sentimental notes" or "pathetic stories" or "photographs of wretched refugees" before giving money to war charities.38 Both war novels also valorize the medical corps, as in Troy Belknap's ambulance, in the care that the wounded George Campton receives, and the moral transformation that nursing effects in otherwise trivial women. But only her letters show the fundraising and adminis- tration in which Wharton herself engaged. In that correspondence, reminiscent of her pride at being allowed "in the very front line," she makes emphatic claims both to American organizational skills and civic sense, and to French cultural values and sensitivities. For five years, she threw herself energetically and passion- ately into sheltering the homeless and helpless, and into encouraging others to support those efforts. Specifically, she devoted herself to organizing, funding, and maintaining shelters-garment workshops (complete with childcare) for refugee women, residences for orphans and other stranded family members, and hospitals for those without access to the healthcare system, chiefly the tuberculous soldiers and civilians whose contagion made other hospitals reluctant to receive them. By August 1917, she had helped to organize and maintain five institutions sheltering some 5,000 to 6,000 refugees.39 To support these institutions, her most famous fundraising effort was The Book of the Homeless in 1915, for which she solicited work from well-known writers, 336</page><page sequence="16">EDITH WHARTON artists, and musicians on both sides of the Atlantic. Her letters often refer to generous responses of people everywhere to her refugee work, including wealthy New Yorkers commissioning clothing from her ouvroirs. However, when the United States entered the war in 1917, the Red Cross came too, as a coordinating agent, and brought much of her work to an end. The war spawned the first great effort of the American Red Cross, previously headed by Mabel Boardman, a woman of Wharton's class and status,40 and newly reorganized under Henry P. Davison, "the youngest bank president in the United States," who as chairman of its "War Council" organized "the largest charity fund- raising drive the world had ever seen" (Price 125). He vividly describes the refugees streaming into Paris, the evolution of his organization to cope with them, and the participation of leisure-class women-in almost redemptive language-in that effort.4' Early on, Wharton had decried "the incompetence &amp; callousness of the French charitable orga- nizations," the "'gros bonnets,' social &amp; political, who are so hide-bound, timid &amp; unpractical that they spend most of their time inventing ways how not to give."42 Now, having spent so much time inventing ways to give, and to convince others to do likewise, she was distressed that Red Cross fundraising efforts were draining off support for her charities43 and undermining their institutional integrity. Red Cross workers' ignorance of "French ideas and social conditions,"44 their lack of "regard for the feelings of the French physicians" and nurses, and diminished patient care and education seemed irremedi- able in view of the presumption that "this is American money, and the people who give the money have the right to decide how it should be used."45 But hers were not simply the feelings of her class. As Alan Price points out, other American women also felt disillusioned when all their carefully created and nurtured "organizations were unceremoniously swallowed up in the centralizing wave of the American Red Cross," and "charity increasingly took on the look of a corporate organization dominated by large scale efficiencies" (121, 123). The issue was not just shelter or medical care but how they were provided-with her own combination of American promptness and French courtesy. Like the women forced further from the industrial workplace and public respon- sibility after the war, Wharton too was thrown back into private life.46 Edith Wharton's war work, then, both literary and institutional, grew out of her strong identification with French material culture. Seeing.entire villages destroyed made graphic the real nature of war and gave priority to providing homes for those left without them. 337</page><page sequence="17">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE Afterwards, she retained a trust fund for individuals suffering from rising costs and overcrowded institutions.47 Noting the care French soldiers gave to their improvised field quarters reinforced for her that human life requires not just shelter but also the rudiments of form and fitness that make civilized human interaction possible. For herself, she bought two estates, one outside Paris and the other on the Riviera, which soon bloomed with her efforts, welcomed her friends, and shel- tered, once again, her own "real work." Through the early stages of the war, the high value Wharton placed on French constructive abilities is counterbalanced by her impa- tience with French bureaucratic inertia. But the atrocities she witnessed and heard about, and her own commitment to what she called French ways and their meaning, seem to have catapulted her judgment into the binary thinking, the all-or-nothing attitude, that this war etched onto the Western mind. As Paul Fussell observes, "if truth is the main casu- alty in war, ambiguity is another" (79).48 Wharton always thought of herself as "hopelessly unpolitical,"49 and indeed she never faced directly the contradictions in the complex scene before her. She never inquired whether the civilized order she so valued might inevitably carry with it not only the physical and moral costs of construction but also the brutal shadow of enforcement. She never seemed to wonder whether the comfort and security of some is not usually purchased with the control and suffering of others. Furthermore, one sees no attempt to understand the larger causes of the war, or whom it benefited, or what the alternatives to wholesale violence might have been. These are not failures peculiar to Wharton, though they may very well be to Americans. Yet her lifelong concern for the homeless, her clear vision of the kinds of spaces, the built environment, necessary to make human life productive or even possible, and her admiration of the human capacity in the most dire of circumstances to provide them, all have a contemporary ring, and a wisdom that is as much a part of our heritage as the horrors to which they were a response.

Shari Benstock emphasizes Goethe's influence on her work (31) and notes that Wharton's first publications were translations of German poems in her early teens (35-36). Richard H. Lawson has most fully developed her strong emotional ties to German literature, especially during her earlier years and in contrast to her general discomfort with German people (14). R. W. B.

In a letter to Barrett Wendell, 19 July 1919, Wharton Archives, Beinecke Library, Yale University, she describes the book as "disjointed little articles" written "in the brief &amp; agitated intervals between refugee committee meetings, air-raids &amp; bombardments." For several reasons, then, it too is a kind of war literature. '3 Walter Benjamin, 146-62. Benjamin's emphasis, of course, is more analytic than Wharton's, observing that even in early nineteenth-century Paris we can see "in the convulsions of the commodity economy ... the monuments of the bourgeoisie as ruins even before they have crumbled," and that the true purpose of Hausmann's work was to secure the city against civil war." What she saw as stability, as eternal verities, he saw as capitalist showplace and crowd control. 14 Letters to Sara Norton, 5 June 1903, 19 Aug. 1904, 19 July 1906, Wharton Archives, Beinecke Library, Yale University.

'9According to a letter to Gaillard Lapsley, 21 Dec. 1916, Wharton Archives, Beinecke Library, Yale University, the story though published in 1916 was written before the war. 20 Letter to Kate Brousseau, 7 Aug. 1919, Wharton Archives, Beinecke Library, Yale University. 21 "Writing a War Story" (1919) and "The Refugees" (1930) are satirical pieces having less to do with war than with writing (on the basis of no experi- ence and no "subject") and with refugees treated simply as the latest fad of an enervated and exploitative British aristocracy. 22As Paul Fussell observes, 231, "Since war takes place outdoors and always within nature, its symbolic status is that of the ultimate anti-pastoral." 23Janet Goodwyn, 47, attributes the effectiveness of Fighting France to Wharton's emphasis "upon the complete loss of continuity in French life: the war has dislocated people and things to such an extent that identity has been entirely erased." 24 Paul Fussell, 40, notes that the destruction and dissolution of the Cloth Hall "were witnessed by hundreds of thousands, who never forgot this eloquent emblem of what happens when war collides with art." 25 Paul Fussell, 45, notes, in contradiction at least to the tone of Wharton's observations, that there were "national styles" in trenches as in other things. The French trenches were nasty, cynical, efficient, and temporary. Kipling remembered the smell of delicious cooking emanating from some in Alsace. The English were amateur, vague, ad hoc, and temporary. The German were effi- cient, clean, pedantic, and permanent. Their occupants proposed to stay where they were. 26As Sandra Gilbert, 200, 214, observes, chiefly in regard to ambulance drivers, "To women who managed to get to the front, moreover, the war did frequently offer the delight of (female) mobilization rather than the despair of (male) immobilization," an element in male perceptions of the increased power of "formerly subservient creatures [who] began to loom malevolently larger." 27 Letter to Henry James, 28 Feb. 1915, in Henry James and Edith Wharton Letters: 1900-1915, 325. In another letter to James, 14 May 1915, ibid., 339, she declared that "I don't dare write you except when I'm scaling heights or exploring trenches." 28 Letter to Robert Bridges, 27 May 1915, Scribner Archives, Firestone Library, Princeton University. 29That there is planting as well as building parallels the observation of Paul Fussell, 234-35, on the English, for whom the "idea of domesticity was insepa- 340</page><page sequence="20">EDITH WHARTON rable from the image of a well-kept gardening allotment," because "recourse to the pastoral is an English mode of both fully gauging the calamities of the Great War and imaginatively protecting oneself against them." 0 As quoted in Paul Fussell, 40. He also cites a Times Literary Supplement reviewer baffled by Wilfred Owens's implication that "a nation is divided into two parts, one of which talks of war and ordains it, while the other acts and suffers." Wharton's literary efforts would not have fared well with the infantry. 3SJane Marcus, 137, identifies this "violation of the eardrums" with women's response. 32Joan Scott claims that this rewriting of history involves "a need to rede- fine the terms of traditional historical analysis," so as to bring women's history and women's lives into the larger historical discourse. 3 Paul Fussell, 275-76, observes that "during the war those who found beauty even in German corpses tended to find it in blond ones," and "the equa- tion of blondness with special beauty and value helps explain the frantic popularity of Rupert Brooke." Wharton dedicated both war novels, The Marne (1918) and A Son at the Front (1922), to the memory of Ronald Simmons, a young Yale graduate who came to Paris to study art, became secretary to Wharton's committee to aid tubercular soldiers, enlisted when America entered the war, and died of pneumonia soon after. To some extent, he functioned as her own "son at the front." 4 She echoes Wharton's recognition of women, in Fighting France, 224, "for whom a single grave" has "turned the whole conflict into an idiot's tale." 35It is far too simple to claim, with Sandra Gilbert, 222, that in this novel "Edith Wharton offers an encoded description of a similar transformation of a dead man into an enlivening muse." 6 Percy Lubbock, 28. S7 In France itself, the war provided new employment opportunities for women, particularly in munitions industries, but Michelle Perrot, 52, 56, observes that "the changes affected essentially the urban middle class." And, as Steven Hause, 105-6, points out, "in 1914-15, the chief effect of the war was to drive women out of work," and women's share of the industrial workforce was less after the war than it was before, declining from 34.4 percent in 1906 to 31.7 percent in 1921. 8 Letters to Mary Cadwalader Jones, 22 May 1916, 20 Dec. 1916, 21 Nov. 1917, Wharton Archives, Beinecke Library, Yale University. 9 In a letter to Mr. Ledyard, 20 Aug. 1917, Wharton Archives, Beinecke Library, Yale University, Wharton lists (her emphasis): 1. The "Oeuvre des Enfants des Flandres" which "cares for 720 children and 210 adult refugees (old men and women, and Belgian nuns in charge of the colonies)" 2. The "American Hostels for Refugees," providing permanent care for "3,000 and 4,000 refugees, chiefly women and children, old men, and persons unable to work" 3. The "Maisons de Convalescence Americaines," with "185 beds for refugee women and children, at Groslay and Aromanches (tuberculosis, anaemia and general fatigue)" 341</page><page sequence="21">TWENTIETH CENTURY LITERATURE 4. The "Tuberculous War-Victims Committee," which will "have about 500 beds" 5.

It was in their role as mothers that women obtained new rights" that is, the right of "guardianship," as Steven Hause, 107, claims. Jane Marcus, 129, points out that "all wars destroy women's culture, returning women to the restricted roles of childbearing and nursing and only the work that helps the war effort." 47Letter to E. H. Bartol, 27 Aug. 1919, Wharton Archives, Beinecke Library, Yale University. See, for example, the reference to "an old refugee woman who is dying of cancer, and for whom no room can be found in a hospital," in the letter to M. O[tto] Lichtenberg, 11 July 1919, Wharton Archives, Beinecke Library, Yale University. 48Fussell also claims (77-79) "binary deadlock" as another legacy of this war. 49 Letter to Sara Norton, 25 Jan. 1910, Wharton Archives, Beinecke Library, Yale University.
