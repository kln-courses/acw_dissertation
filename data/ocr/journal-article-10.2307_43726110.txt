<plain_text><page sequence="1">Different Perspectives on Divine Pathos: An Examination of Hermeneutics in Biblical Theology MATTHEW R. SCHLIMM Duke University Durham, NC 27708 Abraham Heschel's book The Prophets is one of the most significant bib- lical works of the twentieth century. It bears primary responsibility for the impor- tance that divine pathos has received in biblical and theological studies.1 Disrupting conventional notions of divine impassibility and immutability, in this book Heschel destabilizes theological concepts that are more derivative of Plato and Aristotle than Jeremiah and Hosea. He demonstrates that the God of the Bible is deeply enmeshed in relationship with God's people and profoundly moved by their actions. Now, over forty years after The Prophets was first published,2 there is need for an analysis of how Heschel's work is carried forward by current scholars. In what ways have those influenced by him continued his work? Where have they diverged from his thinking? Two excellent candidates for comparison with Heschel are Terence E. Fretheim and Walter Brueggemann.3 They are among the most prominent OT 1 Richard Bauckham ("'Only the Suffering God Can Help': Divine Passibility in Modern The- ology," Themelios 9 [April 1984] 6-12, esp. 6 n. 4) catalogues many of the earlier theological works that have popularized the concept of divine suffering. As he points out (p. 10) and as John Jaeger ("Abraham Heschel and the Theology of Jürgen Moltmann," Perspectives in Religious Studies 24 [1997] 167-79) explains in greater depth, Heschel has influenced not only biblical studies but also theological studies, for example, the works of Jürgen Moltmann. 2 The Prophets was first published in English in 1962, though its German predecessor Die Prophétie was published in 1936. 3 Terence E.

Both scholars follow Heschel's example of approaching the Hebrew Bible with a theological concern that appreciates the motif of divine pathos in the prophetic writings. Although Heschel's influence on Fretheim and Brueggemann is hard to miss, these two diverge from their prede- cessor in significant ways. A comparative analysis shows that they approach anthropomorphic metaphors about God with different hermeneutical paradigms and arrive at characterizations of God that sharply contrast with one another. I. Basic Commonalities Continuity among Heschel, Fretheim, and Brueggemann is most noticeable with respect to how they all challenge traditional metaphysical understandings of God. They do not describe a timeless God, detached from the affairs of humanity, who remains unchanged, untouched, and unaffected regardless of what happens on earth.4 They instead draw attention to divine pathos, that is, God's emotional involvement with creation in a way that can include suffering.5 Concepts like the Moral Formation, Community, and Biblical Interpretation [ed. William P. Brown; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2002] 21 1-30, esp. 213 n. 6) states the need for comparison among these three. This arti- cle is the fruit of study with Dr. Fretheim, and I am indebted to his direction and guidance. I would also like to thank Walter Brueggemann, James Crenshaw, and Ellen Davis for reading drafts and offering their insights. An earlier version of this paper, entitled "Divergent Accounts of Divine Affec- tivity in Recent Old Testament Scholarship," was presented in the Israelite Prophetic Literature Sec- tion at the Society of Biblical Literature annual meeting, San Antonio, Texas, November 20, 2004. 4 In their own ways, each of them also challenges absolute conceptions of divine freedom. Heschel {The Prophets [2 vols.; New York: HarperCollins, 1962; repr., Peabody, MA: Prince, 1999] 2. 15) writes, "Not self-sufficiency, but concern and involvement characterize [God's] relation to the world." Fretheim {Jeremiah [Smyth and Helwys Bible Commentary; Macon, GA: Smyth and Helwys, 2002] 231) argues, "It is important to stress that God's freedom cannot be maintained in an unqualified way." Brueggemann {Theology of the Old Testament: Testimony, Dispute, Advocacy [Minneapolis: Fortress, 1997] 410) contends, " Yahweh is committed to Yahweh's partners in free- dom and in passion " (emphasis his), and for Brueggemann passion involves solidarity with others. For each of these scholars, God's relatedness entails limits on divine freedom. 5 Their definitions of divine pathos are not identical, especially with respect to rationality (see below). Nevertheless, there is broad agreement. For Heschel {Prophets, 2. 11), divine pathos signi- fies "God as involved in history, as intimately affected by events in history, as living care." Fretheim does not use the term "pathos" as frequently as Heschel and Brueggemann, but his writings contain similar concepts. For example, Fretheim {The Suffering of God: An Old Testament Perspective [OBT; Philadelphia: Fortress, 1984] 39) writes, "God is affected in many ways by what happens on earth." Brueggemann {To Pluck Up, To Tear Down: A Commentary on the Book of Jeremiah 1-25 [ITC; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1988] 5) essentially equates God's pathos with "God's inexplica- ble yearning" and inclination toward Judah and Israel. As these brief quotations begin to illustrate, these authors concentrate on God's intimate involvement with the world by which God is affected in ways that can include suffering.</page><page sequence="3">DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON DIVINE PATHOS 675 Stoic doctrine of divine apatheia and the Aristotelian understanding of God as actus purus stand in sharp contrast to their thought. In his oft-quoted remark con- trasting Aristotle's description of God with Heschel's, Fritz A. Rothschild says that Heschel describes "not the Unmoved Mover but the Most Moved Mover. "6 The same could be said of Fretheim and Brueggemann. Many Greek philosophical characterizations of God are consistently undermined throughout their writings.7 In the first of Heschel's works on divine pathos to be published in English, the introduction contains these words: "God does not simply command and expect obedience; he is also moved and affected by what happens in the world and he reacts accordingly. Events and human actions arouse in Him joy or sorrow, pleas- ure or wrath."8 These remarks are not only fundamental to all that Heschel writes about divine pathos, but they are characteristic of what Fretheim and Bruegge- mann write as well. All three consistently affirm that God is deeply affected by humanity in ways that involve suffering. The three also agree on the specific reasons that God experiences pathos. Fretheim, in his book The Suffering of God , argues that God suffers (a) " because of the people's rejection of God as Lord," (b) " with the people who are suffering," and (c) ' for the people."9 In a statement that sounds strikingly similar to Fretheim's writings, Brueggemann talks of God's "propensity to suffer with and suffer for, to be in solidarity with Israel in its suffering."10 In Heschel's writings, one finds anal- ogous statements as he speaks of God's suffering because of rejection (e.g., "[God] is pained by the misdeeds, the thanklessness of those whom He has redeemed"), God's suffering with those who suffer (e.g., "Israel's suffering is God's grief'), and God's suffering for the people (e.g., "Man has become a burden and a sorrow for God").11 6 Fritz A. Rothschild, introduction to Between God and Man: An Interpretation of Judaism from the Writings of Abraham J. Heschel (New York: Free Press, 1959) 7-32, esp. 25; emphasis his. 7 Not surprisingly, the openness-of-God movement has been influenced in important ways by these three. Heschel, Fretheim, and Brueggemann dominate, for example, the footnotes of Clark H. Pinnock, Most Moved Mover: A Theology of God's Openness (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2001) 32-62. 8 Abraham Heschel, "The Divine Pathos: The Basic Category of Prophetic Theology," Judaism 2 (1953) 61-67, esp. 61; emphasis his. 9 Fretheim, Suffering of God, 108; emphasis his. 10 Brueggemann, Theology of the Old Testament, 299. Although this quotation does not make reference to God's suffering because of rejection, such references are not hard to find in Bruegge- mann's writings. Commenting on the beginning of the flood narrative, for example, Brueggemann {Genesis [IBC; Atlanta: John Knox, 1982] 77) argues that in this text one finds "a troubled parent who grieves over the alienation." 11 The quotations are from Heschel, Prophets, 1. 32, 151,81, respectively.

They consistently affirm that God is so involved in creation that God is profoundly moved. They not only agree that God suffers, but they also offer similar reasons for why God suffers. But beyond these commonal- ities, they diverge from one another in important ways. Their interpretative para- digms vary significantly, which causes them to arrive at contrasting theological understandings. II. Pathos and Passion A key point of difference lies in how these authors understand the relation between pathos and passion. Heschel is careful to differentiate the two. He sees passion as "drunkenness of the mind, an agitation of the soul devoid of reasoned purpose, operating blindly."12 Passion, understood as irrational emotion, is not characteristic of Heschel's God. Rather, the central concept in Heschel's under- standing of how God interacts with the world is pathos, which he characterizes as "an act formed with intention, depending on free will, the result of decision and determination."13 For Heschel, the pathos of God is reasonable, intentional, rational, and willful. He argues, "Pathos implied no inner bondage, no enslave- ment to impulse, no subjugation by passion."14 According to Heschel's under- standing, God's affectivity never precludes God's rationality. There is no dichotomy between emotion and reason in the divine self. Both Fretheim and Brueggemann are more comfortable than Heschel using the word "passion" to describe God. Yet their understandings of divine passion are so different that, in the end, Fretheim comes close to Heschel's affirmations while Brueggemann moves far beyond what Heschel contends. Fretheim is comfortable talking about divine passion, saying, for example, "God is a God of great pas- sions."15 His passionate God, however, is neither impulsive nor irrational.16 Fretheim joins Heschel in arguing that emotions do not cause God to become inca- pacitated or out of control. Notice the parenthetical comment that Fretheim includes in the following statement: "Continued divine restraint in the face of continued rejection must have meant for a greater and greater intensification of suffering, a build-up of internal forces in God, which finally (though not uncon- 12 Heschel, Prophets, 2. 4. 13 Ibid. 14 Ibid., 2.38. 15 Fretheim, Jeremiah, 33. 16Fretheim's affirmation of God's rationality is seen in what he writes about divine anger. Fretheim ("Theological Reflections on the Wrath of God in the Old Testament," HBT 24 [Decem- ber 2002] 1-26, esp. 15 n. 39) argues that divine wrath, far from being irrational, is a reasonable response to injustice and idolatry.</page><page sequence="5">DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON DIVINE PATHOS 677 trollably) burst forth in judgment."17 In this statement, which might otherwise lend itself to portraying God as working in an irrational way motivated by sheer emo- tion, the inclusion of this parenthetical comment illustrates the author's desire to show that God is not dominated by emotions. He writes, "God's grief does not entail being emotionally overwhelmed or embittered by the barrage of rejection."18 Although Fretheim may use the word "passion" to describe God, his doing so does not represent a significant departure from Heschel's thought. The same cannot be said for Brueggemann. His definition of passion con- tains two parts: "powerful and strong feelings" and "the capacity and readiness to suffer."19 At first glance, passion thus defined does not appear to differ drastically from Heschel's understanding of pathos. Further examination of Brueggemann 's thought, however, reveals that the "powerful and strong feelings" that he ascribes to God are far beyond anything consistent with Heschel's emphasis on divine emo- tion being controlled, rational, and intentional. Brueggemann speaks of "some- thing potentially wild, unruly, and dangerous in Yahweh's life," "Yahweh's delight in rage," and "Yahweh's passionate, perhaps out-of-control self-regard."20 His characterization of God is significantly different from that of Heschel and Fretheim. Whereas Heschel asserts that pathos is "far from being intrinsically irra- tional," Brueggemann contends, "There is a profound irrationality about Yahweh, which Yahweh enacts peculiarly against Israel."21 Heschel stresses that God is never overcome by passion, but Brueggemann describes God as "one who goes wholly overboard in passion, to Israel's great gain and then to Israel's greatest loss."22 Brueggemann diverges considerably from Heschel and Fretheim. Yet this divergence is not complete; continuities persist. Brueggemann argues that at the core of God's life, there is "a profound disjunction," an unresolved ten- sion between God's sovereign self-regard and covenantal solidarity.23 Although 17 Fretheim, Suffering of God, 142. 18 Ibid., 111. 19 Brueggemann, Theology of the Old Testament, 41 1 . He admits that this definition of passion bears the influence of Jürgen Moltmann. A significant amount of Moltmann's thought on the theme of divine affectivity is derived from Abraham Heschel (Jaeger, "Abraham Heschel and the Theol- ogy of Jürgen Moltmann," 167-79). 20 Quotations are from Brueggemann, Theology of the Old Testament, 271, 276, 309, respec- tively. 21 Heschel, Prophets, 2. 7; Brueggemann, Theology of the Old Testament, 383. 22 Brueggemann, Theology of the Old Testament, 384. 23 Ibid., 268-76. In two of Brueggemann's earlier essays, this disjunction is characterized from a theological standpoint (that relates to unsettled tension in God's life) as structure legitimation (i.e., contractual or common theology) and the embrace of pain ("A Shape for Old Testament Theology, I, Structure Legitimation," in Old Testament Theology: Essays on Structure, Theme, and Text [ed. Patrick D. Miller; Minneapolis: Fortress, 1992] 1-21; "A Shape for Old Testament Theology, II,</page><page sequence="6">678 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 69,2007 Brueggemann can characterize God as threatening and out-of-control (especially with respect to divine self-regard), he tends to balance these characterizations with an emphasis on God's solidarity, which entails compassion, relatedness, and fidelity. Though Brueggemann argues that God's affectivity means that God can be moved to act in ways that are uncontrolled, irrational, and unintentional, he does not insist that God always or even usually acts in such ways.24 God's regard for Israel is of great importance, and when he writes about God's solidarity with Israel, he nears Heschel's conceptualizations. Brueggemann 's conception bears marks of Heschel's influence, while departing from him by ascribing irrationality to God. III. Metaphorical Continuity The contrast between Brueggemann 's emphasis on divine passion and Heschel's and Fretheim's emphases on divine self-control is symptomatic of a broader contrast among these three, namely, the extent to which they understand anthropomorphic metaphors in the Bible to characterize God. In their own ways, each of these authors acknowledges that metaphorical language for God, like all metaphorical language, has both a yes (continuity between the vehicle and tenor) and a no (discontinuity between the same).25 In spite of this common acknowl- Embrace of Pain," in ibid., 22-44; these essays first appeared in CBQ 47 [1985] 28-46, 395-415, respectively). This tension is also explored with respect to divine continuity and discontinuity in Walter Brueggemann, "A Shattered Transcendence? Exile and Restoration," in Old Testament Theology, 183-203. 24 Even some of Brueggemann's most negative characterizations of God are balanced with positive remarks. Though Brueggemann ( Theology of the Old Testament, 274) mentions "Yahweh's potential for unmitigated rage," he places this characterization in tension with "a sovereign reason- ableness in Yahweh's attitude." Similarly, the startling description of God's potential delight "in anticipation of an orgy of death, blood, and violence" is counteracted at least in part by the acknowl- edgment that God's actions may be "a just response" (ibid., 275). 25 Heschel, Prophets, 2. 48-58; Fretheim, Suffering of God, 6-8; idem, "Some Reflections on Brueggemann's God," in God in the Fray: A Tribute to Walter Brueggemann (cd.

David Noel Freedman; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2000) 510-14, esp. 5 1 1 ; Brueggemann, Theology of the Old Testament, 70-7 1 . For a brief survey of how Philo, Augustine, Jerome, and Calvin handle the issue of metaphorical continuity with respect to the issues of divine suffering and immutability, see Lester J. Kuyper, "The Suffering and Repen- tance of God," SJT22 (1969) 257-77, esp. 257-58, 262-68. This article employs the terms "vehicle" and "tenor" to refer to the metaphorical referents. Such language was introduced by I. A. Richards, The Philosophy of Rhetoric (New York: Oxford University Press, 1936) 96-97. Others use different terminology. Max Black ( Models and Metaphors: Studies in Language and Philosophy [Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1962] 27- 28), for example, uses the terms "focus" and "frame." Monroe Beardsley ("Metaphor," in The Ency- clopedia of Philosophy [ed. Paul Edwards; 8 vols.; New York: Macmillan and Free Press, 1967] 5. 284-89, esp. 285), prefers the terms "modifier" and "subject."</page><page sequence="7">DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON DIVINE PATHOS 679 edgment, when these authors interpret biblical texts, they take diverse hermeneu- tical approaches, emphasizing differently the extent to which vehicles in such anthropomorphic metaphors characterize and do not characterize God. Heschel places greater stress on metaphorical discontinuity; Fretheim makes an intentional effort to find middle ground; and Brueggemann places primary emphasis on metaphorical continuity. A key concern of Heschel, found throughout his writings, is to differentiate the divine from the human. This concern means that he frequently emphasizes dis- continuity when he encounters anthropomorphic language for God. Heschel talks about "anthropopathy as a moral problem," and he argues that anthropomorphiz- ing God (defined here as projecting human qualities onto God) is blasphemous, a disparagement of God.26 Homer and Hesiod, he contends, went this route, speak- ing about gods who steal, deceive, and commit adultery. The prophets, on the other hand, presupposed that God is wholly different from humanity. When they used anthropomorphic metaphors, Heschel contends, they were simply conveying their experience of God in terms that others could understand: "The prophets had to use anthropomorphic language in order to convey [God's] nonanthropomorphic Being."27 In Heschel's mind, anthropomorphic metaphors illustrate how God relates to the world, but they do not characterize God's essence. Consequently, when Heschel interprets biblical texts that use anthropomor- phic metaphors to describe God, he frequently spends significant effort explaining how God differs from humanity. Divine pathos, the central concept in The Proph- ets, is carefully differentiated from human pathos. In a key statement, Heschel writes, "What Isaiah (55:8f.) said concerning the thoughts of God may equally apply to His pathos: For My pathos is not your pathos, neither are your ways My ways, says the Lord."28 In Heschel's mind, the difference between the divine and the human is absolute, and this difference must not be minimized. Fretheim and Brueggemann do not place the same degree of emphasis on dif- ferences between God and humanity. When Fretheim encounters anthropomorphic 26 Heschel, Prophets, 2. 48-49. In Man Is Not Alone: A Philosophy of Religion (New York: Farrar, Straus &amp; Young, 1 95 1 ) 97-98, Heschel discusses "the peril of speech" more generally when he writes: There is hardly a symbol which, when used, would not impair or even undo the grasp or remembrance of the incomparable. Opinions confuse and stand in the way of intu- itions; surveys, definitions take the name of God in vain. We have neither an image nor a definition of God. We have only His name. And the name is ineffable. . . . . . . God begins where words end. In Heschel's mind, words can be descriptive of one's experience of God, but words stop short of ever defining who God is. 27 Heschel, Prophets, 2. 56. Some of Heschel's critics contend that despite his best efforts to avoid anthropomorphizing God, he often ends up doing precisely that (see Jaeger, "Abraham Heschel and the Theology of Jürgen Moltmann," 173). 28 Heschel, Prophets, 2. 56.</page><page sequence="8">680 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 69,2007 metaphors, he strives to take a balanced approach, characterized by a sustained effort to steer between what he calls the Scylla of "positing no real or essential relationship between the metaphor and God" and the Charybdis of "suggesting that a literal correspondence exists between the metaphor and reality in every respect."29 Fretheim diverges from Heschel not by ignoring discontinuity but by placing greater emphasis on continuity. He acknowledges with Heschel the poten- tial danger of reducing God to human qualities,30 but this danger does not prevent him from affirming the ways that the vehicles in these metaphors have continuity with their tenors. He believes that in the OT "there are no anti-anthropomorphic tendencies to be discerned,"31 and consequently he does not find it necessary to highlight as brightly as Heschel the differences between the metaphorical referents. He contends that "the images used for God really do say something about God; they are not merely illustrative or decorative."32 Seeking to follow "the natural implication of the metaphor," Fretheim strives to pinpoint both what anthropo- morphic metaphors say about God and what they do not.33 Brueggemann does not exactly crash into what Fretheim calls "Charybdis," but he remains close to its coast. Only on rare occasions does Brueggemann dis- cuss discontinuities inherent in anthropomorphic metaphors for God.34 He instead 29 Fretheim, Suffering of God, 7. Not everyone agrees that Fretheim implements a balanced approach. Some of his critics have argued that he takes a less balanced approach when he interprets theophanies as "God in human form," failing, in their opinion, to articulate adequately the way that God remains different from humanity in the midst of such appearances (ibid., 79-106; for criticism, see John B. White, review of Terence E. Fretheim, The Suffering of God, J AAR 54 [1986] 578-79, esp. 579). Other critics have claimed that he similarly fails to differentiate the divine from the human when he closely associates God with prophets (Fretheim, Suffering of God, 149-66; for criticism, see James M. Ward, review of Terence E. Fretheim, The Suffering of God, JBL 105 [1986] 516-18, esp. 5 1 8). Some have argued that with respect to interpreting anthropomorphic metaphors, he emphasizes continuity "to the point of identification of the [metaphoric] referents" (Elizabeth Bellefontaine, review of Terence E. Fretheim, The Suffering of God, Horizons 13 [1986] 151-53, esp. 152). This last criticism in particular lacks merit. Although one may note an occasional exception, Fretheim clearly aims to find middle ground, emphasizing both continuity and discontinuity. When Fretheim {Suffering of God, 1 24) summarizes his thoughts on God's suffering because of rejection, for exam- ple, he spends a substantial part of that summary differentiating divine and human suffering. When compared with Heschel and Brueggemann, moreover, it becomes particularly evident that Fretheim gives attention to both continuity and discontinuity. 30 Fretheim, Suffering of God, 6, 168 n. 7. 31 Ibid., 7. 32 Ibid., 16. Fretheim {Suffering of God, 167-68 n. 4; see "J. Martin") expresses appreciation for Janet Martin Soskice, whose theory of metaphor lends itself to an interpretive approach that emphasizes both metaphorical continuity and discontinuity. Soskice {Metaphor and Religious Lan- guage [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1985] 118-41) argues that religious language does not "directly describe" God (discontinuity) but is "reality depicting" (continuity). 33 Fretheim, Suffering of God, 8. 34 One of these rare exceptions is found in Brueggemann's commentary on Jer 30:23-24 {To Build, To Plant: A Commentary on Jeremiah 26-52 [ITC; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1991] 57),</page><page sequence="9">DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON DIVINE PATHOS 68 1 posits a very close correspondence between vehicle and tenor. As a result, he can come close to taking the Bible's descriptions of God at face value without paus- ing to explore the limits of each description.35 Though Brueggemann may not assign a strict one-to-one correspondence between metaphorical referents, he makes a much closer connection between them than Heschel and Fretheim. This increased level of association is a primary reason why Brueggemann speaks of divine "negativity."36 When Brueggemann encounters negative images in the text, he tends to expound on the negativity, rather than minimizing or balancing it by pointing to the discontinuity between the metaphorical referents. Divine pathos is clearly evident in Jer 3 1 :20, in which the text uses the image of Rachel, filled with grief, to describe God. How Heschel, Fretheim, and Bruegge- mann interpret this passage illustrates their divergent ways of understanding the extent to which anthropomorphic images are descriptive of God. Heschel com- ments on this verse only once in The Prophets, and his commentary is as follows: The divine pathos, whether mercy or anger, was never thought of as an impulsive act, arising automatically within the divine Being as the reaction to man's behavior and as something due to peculiarity of temperament or propensity. It is neither irrational nor irresistible. Pathos results from a decision, from an act of will. It comes about in the light of moral judgment rather than in the darkness of passion.37 Heschel says virtually nothing about the continuities between God and Rachel. Nearly everything he writes stresses discontinuity. Though the text suggests that God is deeply moved to the point of grief, Heschel chooses to stress that God is not affected in ways one normally associates with grief (e.g., grief as an automatic reaction to behavior). Heschel places great emphasis on metaphorical disconti- nuity. Fretheim bears marks of Heschel's influence, while also moving in his own direction. In his interpretation of Jer 3 1 :20, he emphasizes both continuity and dis- continuity: God takes up the role of mother in place of Rachel. As Rachel remembers her children, so now God remembers. As Rachel weeps for her children, so now God weeps. Yet, a difference is seen in that, while Rachel seems to be incapacitated by her mourning (v. 15), it is different with God. God will turn their mourning into joy, and give them gladness for sorrow (vv. 13, 2 1-22). 38 where he comments that God's wrath is neither capricious nor ultimate. This comment stands in tension with some of Brueggemann 's later characterizations of God's wrath. 35 Fretheim ("Some Reflections," 35-36) criticizes Brueggemann on this point. 36 "Negativity" is a term that Brueggemann himself uses to describe God's failure to adhere to covenant, God's capacity for violence, and God's irrationality. See his chapter "Yahweh and Neg- ativity" in Theology of the Old Testament, 373-99. 37 Heschel, Prophets, 2. 78. 38 Fretheim, Suffering of God, 1 35.</page><page sequence="10">682 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 69,2007 Fretheim joins Heschel in recognizing the limits of the metaphor, but first he shows the points of connection between God and Rachel. Rather than focusing primarily on discontinuity, he contends that biblical metaphors convey important but limited information about God's character. When Brueggemann interprets Jer 3 1 :20, he says virtually nothing about metaphorical discontinuity, stressing instead the close correspondence between Rachel and God: "As Mother Rachel has had unrequited pathos, so the God of Israel is moved by deep pathos."39 Whereas Fretheim warns that the danger of reading too close a correspondence between the metaphor and God "is to reduce God to human frailty,"40 Brueggemann links Rachel and God so closely that he says, "God is reduced to trembling yearning."41 While Heschel claims that divine pathos is as far from human pathos as the heavens are higher than the earth, Brueggemann makes little effort to differentiate the two. Brueggemann's writings give significantly less attention to metaphorical discontinuity than those of Heschel and Fretheim. IV. Wrath How these three scholars understand divine wrath is reflective of their diver- gent ways of handling metaphorical continuity. Heschel goes to great lengths to portray divine wrath as drastically different from human rage: "Just as God is absolutely different from man, so is divine anger different from human anger."42 The primary means by which Heschel differentiates God's anger from human anger is by stressing that divine wrath is always fully justified, an aspect of God's pathos and not a passion. Arguing that divine anger is rational wrath, he maintains his emphasis on reasonableness and intentionality. He stresses repeatedly that the ira dei is a function of God's concern for justice: "The destructiveness of God's power is not due to God's hostility to man, but to His concern for righteousness, to His intolerance of injustice. . . . God's anger is fierce because man's cruelty is infer- nal."43 When Heschel comments on Jer 23:19-20, in which God's wrath is com- pared to a storm, he attacks those who interpret these verses to mean that "[God's] anger is 'like a hidden force of nature, incalculable and arbitrary,' which strikes without measure or reason." Such an interpretation, Heschel claims, "is a com- plete distortion of prophetic thinking. God's anger is never regarded by the 39 Brueggemann, To Build, To Plant, 65. 40 Fretheim, Suffering of God, 8. 41 Brueggemann, To Build, To Plant, 65. 42 Heschel, Prophets, 2. 74. 43 Ibid., 1 . 80. One wonders if Heschel here uses the word "infernal" to allude to the Holocaust because it can connote both "hellish" and "intense heat." This work was dedicated "to the martyrs of 1940^15" (ibid., 1. v).</page><page sequence="11">DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON DIVINE PATHOS 683 prophets as either inscrutable or unaccountable."44 Metaphorical discontinuity per- vades much of Heschel's discussion of divine anger. Heschel goes to such lengths to emphasize the difference between divine and human wrath that Eliezer Berkovits, perhaps Heschel's harshest critic, claims that God's anger has been qualified in so many ways in Heschel's writings that anger is stripped of its meaning: "What [Heschel] says concerning anger is that it is inconceivable that God should be angry."45 Berkovits overstates his case some- what. Despite his many qualifications, Heschel does not deny the reality of divine wrath. He differentiates himself from Philo, who sees wrath as merely a rhetorical device aimed at admonishment that has virtually no basis in divine reality.46 Heschel admits, "Divine anger points to a stark reality, to the power behind the facts, not to a figure of speech."47 Heschel thus believes that divine wrath is real and not "mere metaphor." Nevertheless, he thoroughly and consistently qualifies divine wrath so that it is seen as drastically different from human rage. When Fretheim deals with wrath, he again strives to take a more balanced approach, emphasizing that both similarities and dissimilarities exist between human and divine anger: "That the same terms are used for both human and divine anger shows that God's anger is considered analogous to that of human beings. In any assessment of such an 'anthropomorphic metaphor' for God, it is important to claim both a 'yes' and a 'no' with respect to the human analogue."48 Fretheim claims a yes by stressing, for example, that for God and humans alike, anger arises from being in close relationship with others. But Fretheim also stresses disconti- nuity in a way similar to Heschel. When Fretheim interprets Jer 23: 19-20, he, like Heschel, qualifies any comparisons between God's anger and an incalculable force of nature, stressing that God's wrath is not unaccountable but rather "entirely con- tingent upon, responsive to human wickedness."49 Fretheim contends that, unlike human ire, God's wrath is always in the service of life, for the ultimate good of oth- ers, and an aspect of God's concern for justice.50 He quotes Heschel in writing, "God's wrath is 'voluntary and purposeful, motivated by a concern for right and wrong.'"51 For both Heschel and Fretheim, God's wrath is different from human anger in that the former cannot be characterized as irrational, unreasonable, or unjust. Brueggemann diverges drastically from Heschel and Fretheim. He is far more 44 Ibid., 2. 68. 45 Eliezer Berkovits, "Dr. A. J.

He con- tends that little differs between the two. In Brueggemann's conceptualization, God is not only concerned with Israel; God is also concerned with God's own self. This divine self-regard causes God to act in ways filled with wrath and rage. Fretheim, critical of Brueggemann on this point, lists the disconcerting descriptors that he uses for God, many of which are employed when describing God's wrath: "savage, odd, abusive, mean-spirited, wild, self-indulgent, unreliable, unstable, capricious, irascible, irrational, sulky, and more."52 In sharp contrast to Heschel's emphasis on God's rational wrath, Brueggemann talks of anger as motivating God to act in hap- hazard and frightening ways. As he puts it, "One never knows whether Yahweh will turn out to be a loose cannon, or whether Yahweh's commitment to Israel will make a difference. . . . What one does know is that Yahweh's self-regard is mas- sive in its claim, strident in its expectation, and ominous in its potential."53 Brueggemann's God is unsettling and anxiety provoking. The careful differentiation between the ways of God and the ways of human- ity is largely missing from Brueggemann's descriptions of God's wrath. Whereas Heschel and Fretheim argue that God's wrath is a form of God's concern for cre- ation, Brueggemann contends that God's real concern here is for God's self. Heschel maintains that divine pathos (which he believes entails wrath) is transitive and concerned with others, rather than reflexive and concerned with self.54 For Brueggemann, God's wrath is predominantly reflexive. Heschel emphasizes God's "attentiveness to the nonself" (i.e., that which is not God),55 whereas Bruegge- mann places significant emphasis on God's attentiveness to God's own self. Heschel speaks of God's "living care" for others, while Brueggemann talks of "Yahweh's uncompromising self-regard."56 With regard to this trait, therefore, Brueggemann characterizes God in a way that is significantly different from Heschel and Fretheim. 52 Fretheim, "Some Reflections," 33. 53 Brueggemann, Theology of the Old Testament, 296; cf. 282. 54 Heschel, Prophets, 2. 5. One could argue, however, that just below the surface of Heschel's writings, God is portrayed in self-regarding ways. Heschel ( Prophets , 1. 108-9) writes, for exam- ple, of God's "inner oscillation" between God's desire not to let judgment come and God's being offended to the point that judgment must come. This tension sounds quite similar to Brueggemann's conception of a tension between God's Israel-regard and God's self-regard. Although Heschel alludes to this tension, the thrust of his argument is that divine self-concern is characteristic of the gods of mythology, not the God of the Bible: "The gods of mythology are self- centered, egotistic. Their passions - erotic love, jealousy, envy - are determined by considerations of self. Pathos, on the other hand, is not a self-centered and self-contained state; it is always, in prophetic thinking, directed outward; it expresses a relation to man" (Heschel, "Divine Pathos," 62; emphasis his). 55 Heschel, Prophets, 2. 266. 56 Ibid., 2.11; Brueggemann, Theology of the Old Testament, 298.</page><page sequence="13">DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON DIVINE PATHOS 685 V. Fidelity The way these three scholars understand the function of divine wrath affects their characterizations of divine fidelity. Because Heschel sees God's wrath as an aspect of pathos rather than passion, God's wrath does not represent a major chal- lenge to God's faithfulness. God's experience of pathos does not mean that God is subjected to "an emotional convulsion which makes it impossible to exercise a free consideration of principles."57 Rather, God is able to move with intentional- ly in a way that is consistent with God's loving care and faithfulness. Thus, Heschel insists that "even in moments of indignation, [God's] love remains alive."58 Arguing that there is compassion in God's anger, Heschel contends, "[God's] anger passes, His faithfulness goes on forever."59 For Heschel, God's anger is not a threat to God's love and fidelity but an expression thereof. In dealing with divine fidelity, Fretheim again comes close to Heschel. He maintains that in the midst of divine anger, God is faithful. As he puts it, "Pre- cisely in order to be faithful, God must judge. Fidelity calls for a harsh sovereignty in some situations."60 In Fretheim's discussion of divine will, he argues that God has chosen never to go back on the promises made to Noah, Abraham, and Israel. God is bound to these parties, having decided "once-for-all" to remain faithful, come what may. Fretheim challenges those who suggest that "God had an option not to be a God of, say, steadfast love and faithfulness."61 God's fidelity is not jeopardized in the midst of judgment, wrath, and anger. Brueggemann makes different claims. Unlike Fretheim, who argues that God decided "once-for-all" to bind the divine self to the world, Abraham, and Israel through various covenants, Brueggemann speaks of "Yahweh s failure to adhere to covenant ,"62 He believes that "God is not captive of old resolves."63 He acknowl- edges God's promises, but argues that unanticipated circumstances can issue in God's breaking earlier vows: "Indeed, in 2 Sam. 7:14-15 Yahweh has made an oath never to remove hesed. But Yahweh could not have foreseen the unthinkable situation of infidelity that caused all old promises to be under review. . . . Yahweh finally retracts this initial, gracious commitment [meaning that] there is complete absence of fidelity on God's part."64 This comment is not an isolated statement. Elsewhere, Brueggemann 's interpretative remarks argue that God is unfaithful. He 57 Heschel, Prophets, 2. 4. 58 Ibid, 2. 77. 59 Ibid., 1. 101. 60 Fretheim, "Some Reflections," 3 1 ; emphasis his. 61 Ibid., 33. Fretheim is here challenging Brueggemann. 62 Brueggemann, Theology of the Old Testament, 373; emphasis his. 63 Brueggemann, Genesis, 78. 64 Brueggemann, To Pluck Up, To Tear Down, 145.</page><page sequence="14">686 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 69,2007 points to instances where the OT presents, in his interpretation, God as "abusive," which he defines as abandoning fidelity.65 On a number of occasions, Bruegge- mann argues that God stops being faithful. At the same time, Brueggemann does not believe that God tends toward infi- delity. He believes that the divine life is fraught with tension and that no one char- acteristic always prevails, including any that entail fidelity or its loss. Discussing this tension, Brueggemann writes, "Yahweh 's sovereignty does not everywhere and always converge with fidelity, even though fidelity is finally powerfully affirmed."66 So Brueggemann is able to join Heschel and Fretheim in talking about God's "enduring faithfulness,"67 though he nevertheless diverges considerably by arguing that God's faithfulness stands in unsettled conflict with other factors in God's life. The following comment summarizes well Brueggemann's thoughts about divine fidelity: "In the end, Yahweh is faithful, if not all the way through."68 God tends toward faithfulness, but God is not confined by it. How these three authors understand God's fidelity to be affected is illustrated in their divergent approaches to Jer 12:7-13, wherein God's wrath comes to full expression as the passage uses the first person to address God's abandoning, for- saking, and hating Judah. Heschel interprets this passage by speaking of God's immense pain, talking about "the affliction of God, His displacement, His home- lessness in the land, in the world."69 Though the passage talks about the land's mourning because of God's desertion, he instead talks about God's mourning because of "Israel's desertion."70 Heschel emphasizes not God's withdrawal from Israel but Israel's abandonment of God. He seeks to explain and find justification for God's behavior rather than expound on what abandonment entails for God's people. When Fretheim interprets Jer 12:7-13, he acknowledges God's abandonment and hate, but he qualifies such metaphors by differentiating God's actions from human ones normally associated with such words. He writes, "Divine hate does not mean the end of divine love; it means that God must move against Israel - treat Israel as an enemy - for the sake of a possible future to this relationship."71 When Fretheim deals with the theme of divine abandonment in these verses, he does more than Heschel to acknowledge the realness of God's forsaking, but like 65 Brueggemann ( Theology of the Old Testament, 359; emphasis his) understands "abusive" to mean " acting in ways not congruent with the claim of the core testimony that Yahweh is 'stead- fast and faithful 66 Ibid., 311. 67 Ibid., 296. 68 Walter Brueggemann, Isaiah (2 vols.; Westminster Bible Companion; Louisville: West- minster John Knox, 1998) 2. 154. 69 Heschel, Prophets, 1. 112. 70 Ibid. 71 Fretheim, Jeremiah, 196.</page><page sequence="15">DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON DIVINE PATHOS 687 Heschel, he interprets these verses as a divine lament and stresses that the people have first abandoned God. He maintains that God's goodness and faithfulness are not threatened: "Judgment may be the only way which God can be faithful to prom- ises made in this particular situation."72 Divine fidelity stays intact. When Brueggemann comments on Jer 12:7-13, he argues that God has been so deeply and painfully affected by humanity that God's abandonment entails a loss of faithfulness: "Yahweh can stand the affront, the pain, and the grief no longer. . . . Yahweh has withdrawn fidelity. When Yahweh withdraws, Judah is helpless and hopeless."73 Though the text does not make any explicit reference to God's faithfulness, Brueggemann interprets these verses to mean precisely that God has chosen to remove fidelity. Like Heschel and Fretheim, Brueggemann explains why God reacts harshly to Judah, stressing God's grief and Israel's prior abandonment of God - but he alone claims that God has stopped being faithful. VI. Mutability As the preceding discussion suggests, Heschel, Fretheim, and Brueggemann challenge rigid notions of divine immutability in different ways. Heschel claims the least about God's changeability. For him, divine pathos, though real, is an aspect of God's relationship with humanity rather than of God's essence. He believes that God's being and self are hidden, unrevealed to humanity. What is known of God in Scripture is knowledge of God's interaction with humanity: "Revelation means, not that God makes Himself known, but that He makes His will known; not God's disclosure of His Being, His self-manifestation, but a disclosure of the divine will and pathos, of the ways in which He relates Himself to man."74 Critics have argued that despite his best efforts, Heschel frequently ends up describing God's being.75 On the one hand, this charge has validity; there are statements Heschel makes that seem either to describe God's essence or at least to have immediate implications for God's being. One wonders, for example, how the Hebrew prophets could dwell "upon God's inner motives" without revealing something of God's self.76 On the other hand, one must take seriously Heschel's desire to limit the extent to which 72 Ibid., 200. 73 Brueggemann, To Pluck Up, To Tear Down, 115. 74 Heschel, Prophets, 2. 265; see also 2. 54-55; idem, Man Is Not Alone, 97-109. 75 Jaeger, "Abraham Heschel and the Theology of Jürgen Moltmann," 173; Maurice Fried- man, review of Abraham Heschel, The Prophets, Judaism 13 (1964) 115-21, esp. 119; John L. McKenzie, review of Abraham Heschel, The Prophets, TS 24 (1963) 470-71 , esp. 471 . 76 Heschel, Prophets, 1. 24. Heschel (ibid., 2. 264, 266) also makes explicit though qualified claims about God's being when he writes, "Only one aspect of [God's] Being, His directedness to man, is known to man," and "It is in this limited sense that we speak of God as a personal Being: He has concern for the nondivine being."</page><page sequence="16">688 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 69, 2007 pathos can be said to characterize the divine self, meaning that when one speaks of the extent to which Heschel thinks divine mutability characterizes God's self, there are also important limits. Gary A. Herion interprets Heschel's arguments to say that divine emotion such as wrath is characteristic of God's office, not God's personality.77 Although God may change with respect to how God relates to the world, such changes are not made with respect to God's being. Herion 's interpretation is not far off. Heschel himself writes the following: The prophets never identify God's pathos with his essence, because for them the pathos is not something absolute, but a form of relation. ... If the structure of the pathos were immutable and remained unchanged even after the people had "turned," prophecy would lose its function, which is precisely so to influence man as to bring about a change in the divine pathos of rejection and affliction.78 As this comment implies, Heschel affirms a relational mutability, but not a muta- bility of personality or being. God's way of relating to the world changes, but God's essence does not. Fretheim thinks differently. He does not stress as strongly as Heschel that God's self is hidden. For Fretheim, divine affectivity extends to God's self and not just the way God relates to the world. He considers Herion's distinction between personality and office in terms of the personal and political (respectively), assert- ing that the latter should not be affirmed to the exclusion of the former: "The per- sonal and political senses of wrath must remain linked, but not collapsed."79 In Fretheim's writings, creation affects not only God's way of relating to the world but also God's own self. God is more mutable in his thinking than in Heschel's. Yet divine mutability is by no means absolute. God's primary traits are, for Fretheim, unchangeable: "God's core character is changeless, as is the divine pur- pose . . . and God will be steadfast in love."80 Throughout many of Fretheim's works, he stresses that God's faithfulness and steadfast love never change.81 He sees God's salvific will as immutable and part of God's ultimate will. It is distinct from God's circumstantial will, which varies and changes with respect to the cir- 77 Gary A. Herion, "Wrath of God (OT)," ABD, 6. 989-96, esp. 99 1 . For the most part, Herion is correct, though one should add that Heschel believes that much of God's personality remains hid- den. In Heschel's mind, what one knows about the God of the Bible is predominantly how God acts in God's office. 78 Heschel, Prophets, 2. 6. 79 Fretheim, "Theological Reflections," 9. 80 Fretheim, "God," 513. 81 Fretheim, Suffering of God, 31, 43, 66, 68, 77, 1 1 1, 120, 124, 143; idem, "Suffering God and Sovereign God in Exodus: A Collision of I mages, "//5 T 1 1 (1989) 31-56, esp. 46; idem, "The Repen- tance of God: A Key to Evaluating Old Testament God-Talk," HBT 10 (1988) 47-70, esp. 63; idem, Jeremiah, 41, 421 ; idem, "The God Who Acts: An Old Testament Perspective," Theology Today 54 (1997)6-18, esp. 10.</page><page sequence="17">DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON DIVINE PATHOS 689 cumstances God faces in creation. The following excerpt from Fretheim's writ- ings summarizes well his thoughts on this topic: On the one hand, God will be steadfast in love, constant in saving will for the world, and faithful to promises made. On the other hand, God will move with the world, interacting in view of developments in the relationship and changing times and places, disciplining and judging, responding to prayers of lament, and (not) repenting of spe- cific directions taken in view of that interaction. In traditional language, God is both mutable and immutable; which term one uses depends on the topic under discussion.82 Fretheim both affirms and qualifies divine mutability. God is moved by the world, and not just in a political way pertaining to God's role or office. On a personal level, God actually experiences a range of emotions. Such changeability does not, however, entail any sort of ethical mutability. God's core character remains unchanged. For Brueggemann, few limits exist on God's mutability. He contends that God's self is fraught with tension between self-regard, which can cause God to become irrational and out of control, and covenantal solidarity, which entails God's compassion, relatedness, and fidelity. As God encounters new experiences in cre- ation, these tensions exert themselves in untested ways, giving rise to newness in God's being. Brueggemann talks of this newness in many of his works, referring to "a profound break in the character of God," "a change in God," and "forcing God to recharacterization."83 For Brueggemann, God does not merely experience a range of emotions - God's being changes. He writes, "Yahweh becomes, by the reality of Israel's insistence, as Yahweh had not yet been."84 Divine constancy is in jeopardy in Brueggemann's writings: "Yahweh redecides, in the midst of a cri- sis, how to be Yahweh and who to be as Yahweh."85 For Brueggemann, Yhwh becomes what I AM was not. The transformation within God's self leaves little, if anything, immutable. As discussed earlier, Brueggemann contends that God's faithfulness (an unchange- able characteristic of God in Fretheim's theology) is not changeless; it can cease. The same can be said of many of the other so-called "enduring characteristics of God." Brueggemann writes, for example, "Pushed to the edge, the compassionate One has no more compassion."86 For Brueggemann, God is unsettled and unset- tling.87 One cannot pinpoint a characteristic of God that is always at work. One cannot predict God's actions. A divine dynamism dominates. A mutability of core 82 Fretheim, "Some Reflections," 33. 83 Quotations come from Brueggemann, "Shattered Transcendence?" 192; To Build, To Plant, 54; "Embrace of Pain," 29; respectively. 84 Brueggemann, Theology of the Old Testament, 279. 85 Ibid., 302. 86 Ibid., 281. 87 Fretheim ("Some Reflections," 25) uses this language to describe Brueggemann's God.</page><page sequence="18">690 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 69,2007 character is affirmed. God will never cease existing or stop being God, but the divine being is in flux. No single characteristic of God is always at work. The ten- sions within the divine self between sovereign self-regard and covenantal solidar- ity never find resolution, but they do give rise to new and fresh ways for God to exist in the world. God tends toward fidelity and compassion, but God is not lim- ited by them. Far beyond Heschel's contention that God's self is too hidden to be depicted as mutable, and well beyond Fretheim's thesis that God's circumstantial but not ultimate will is mutable, Brueggemann makes the daring claim that God's being is mutable. VII. Critical Reflection These differences among Heschel, Fretheim, and Brueggemann suggest, first of all, that interpreters and theologians who speak of divine pathos need to clarify what they mean by such a term and not assume that such meaning is self-evident. The most skilled exegetes of our time have conceived of divine affectivity differ- ently. One should not make exegetical or theological claims about divine suffer- ing without explaining what type of suffering is under discussion.88 Furthermore, the differences among Heschel, Fretheim, and Brueggemann suggest that biblical theologians need to be more transparent about not only their presuppositions but also their interpretive paradigms. How these scholars approach metaphors about God decisively influences how they characterize God. Hermeneu- tics determine theology. Biblical theologians should, therefore, both outline their interpretive paradigms and justify their approaches to the text. When considering one's interpretive approach to metaphors, it is useful to draw on the work of Michael A. Osborn and Douglas Ehninger, rhetorical critics who describe the factors that determine which areas of continuity and discontinu- ity interpreters draw between the vehicle and tenor of a particular metaphor. First, there are private qualifiers, the personal and subjective experiences and under- standings of the vehicle and tenor that the reader-listener brings to a given metaphor. Second, there are communal qualifiers, the cultural associations that influence how the vehicle and tenor are understood. Third, there are archetypal qualifiers, which transcend the confines of individuals and cultures.89 Finally, there are contextual qualifiers, which arise from the linguistic, textual, and situational 88 David Bentley Hart ("No Shadow of Turning: On Divine Impassibility," Pro Ecclesia 1 1 [2002] 1 84-206, esp. 1 86-95) describes how the terms "impassibility" and " apatheia " can be defined in a variety of ways. The same is true of divine pathos. 89 Although some metaphors are bound to particular cultures, many have a more universal appeal. For example, the metaphor "I am the light of the world" employs the vehicle "light," which has some properties that are not limited to individual and cultural experiences.)</page><page sequence="19">DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON DIVINE PATHOS 69 1 context in which a metaphor occurs. The text itself points to ways in which metaphors should and should not be understood.90 Communal qualifiers play an especially prominent role in how Heschel, Fretheim, and Brueggemann approach anthropomorphic metaphors about God in the Bible. Differences in faith traditions, in particular, appear to bear direct respon- sibility for why Fretheim and Brueggemann emphasize metaphorical continuity more than Heschel. Fretheim and Brueggemann belong to faith communities that embrace christological claims and allow them to be more comfortable speaking of God in human terms. Both Fretheim and Brueggemann even link God's suffer- ing in the OT with the suffering of Jesus in the NT.91 Heschel's Jewish beliefs, on the other hand, entail a sensitivity to the Second Commandment, which he inter- prets as prohibiting forming divine images (including mental ones) in the likeness of humanity. This sensitivity is a key factor behind Heschel's emphasis on metaphorical discontinuity. In his understanding, attributing human characteris- tics to God borders on idolatry.92 His faith community, like the faith communities of Fretheim and Brueggemann, determines how connections are drawn between metaphorical referents. Although Brueggemann appears to be influenced by his faith community, he has reservations about how much the church should influence interpretation. He believes that the OT stands in opposition to many church teachings, and he seeks to give unobstructed voice to the former. He writes, " Old Testament theological articulation does not conform to established church faith, either in its official dec- laration or in its more popular propensities. There is much that is wild and untamed about the theological witness of the Old Testament that church theology does not face."93 Brueggemann seeks to avoid the imposition of the church's interpretive tra- dition on the text, and consequently he has fewer reasons to differentiate tenor from vehicle in metaphorical language about God. When he encounters a metaphor that may stand in opposition to traditional theology, he expounds on that metaphor, 90 Michael A. Osborn and Douglas Ehninger, "The Metaphor in Public Address," Speech Monographs 29 (1962) 223-34, esp. 228-30. Though this publication is dated and focuses on metaphor in public address, its findings continue to be useful for biblical studies. Osborn and Ehninger 's theory of metaphor bears certain points of continuity with those of Richards, Black, and Beardslcy. Richards ( Philosophy of Rhetoric, 96-97), for example, uses the language of "vehicle" and "tenor," as do Osborn and Ehninger, though they ("Metaphor in Public Address," 227-28, esp. n. 2 1 ) do not use it in precisely the same way. Osborn and Ehninger's description of "contextual qual- ifiers" (pp. 228-29) has some similarities with Black's description of the metaphorical "frame" {Models and Metaphors, 27-28). Furthermore, Beardslcy ("Metaphor," 5. 286), like Osborn and Ehninger (p. 226), emphasizes the opposition between the literal meanings of the metaphorical ref- erents. 91 Fretheim, Suffering of God, 6-7, 166; Brueggemann, Theology of the Old Testament, 302. 92 Heschel, Prophets, 2. 52-54; see also 2. 48-49; idem, Man Is Not Alone, 97-98. 93 Brueggemann, Theology of the Old Testament, 107; emphasis his.</page><page sequence="20">692 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 69,2007 rather than qualifying how it is understood. Heschel and Fretheim, on the other hand, do not see the same level of opposition between traditional religious affir- mations about God and the Hebrew Bible's claims about God. They do not always agree with their respective traditions, but they are more likely than Brueggemann to do so. Their critical appreciation for their faith traditions qualifies which areas of continuity they find among metaphorical referents about God. It plays a role, for example, in their emphasizing divine faithfulness and love when interpreting texts dealing with divine wrath. Communal qualifiers are not, however, the only factor that leads to Heschel's and Fretheim's emphases on metaphorical discontinuity. Contextual qualifiers also play a decisive role. The text itself often limits which lines of association should be drawn between metaphorical referents. For example, Hos 11:8 portrays God as deeply grieved, using language similar to Lam 1 :20. Into this pathos-charged con- text, the very next verse reads, "For I am God and not human." The differentiation between the divine and human could hardly be more explicit. Many other passages that portray God in anthropomorphic terms also qualify such portrayals, at least on implicit levels. For example, divine suffering rarely, if ever, is portrayed as inca- pacitating God. Even in Isa 42:14, where God is portrayed as suffering like a woman in labor, the next verse portrays God as capable of devastating mountains and causing cataclysmic droughts. Similarly, in Gen 6:6-7, God suffers, but this suffering, far from debilitating God, leads to worldwide destruction. Likewise, in Jer 3 1 :20, God is portrayed as Rachel, deeply grieved. But whereas Rachel is inconsolable (31:15), God is able to act with hopeful compassion (3 1:20). 94 Heschel's and Fretheim's stress on metaphorical discontinuity often stems from a careful and nuanced reading of the text itself. Brueggemann's work could be enhanced by greater attention to context. It could be enhanced also by greater attention to how modern assumptions about emotions differ from biblical assumptions about emotions. Though many argue that emotions such as anger and grief are universal, there is widespread agreement that cultures vary greatly in how they value, articulate, and appropriate such emotions.95 Anthropologists talk of the "emotional styles" of different cul- tures, that is, the societal expectations that govern the expression and interpreta- 94 These examples begin to illustrate the evidence in biblical texts that emotional portrayals of God are metaphorical and have limitations. Further research into the metaphorical nature of divine suffering is provided in Matthew R. Schlimm, "Does God Suffer as Humanity Suffers?" manuscript in progress (paper presented in the Poster Session at the Society of Biblical Literature annual meet- ing, Washington, DC, November 19, 2006). Further research into divine anger is provided in Bruce Edward Baloian, Anger in the Old Testament (American University Studies 7; Theology and Reli- gion 99; New York: Peter Lang, 1992) esp. 163-67. 95 Martha C. Nussbaum, Upheavals of Thought: The Intelligence of Emotions (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001) 139-73, esp. 141, 159-60.</page><page sequence="21">DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON DIVINE PATHOS 693 tion of emotions. Peter Stearns, for example, presents a well-researched account of the current American emotional style, which he characterizes as marked above all else by dispassion, or to use the term popular since the 1960s, by being "cool." Exhibiting an intolerance of emotions, this emotional style judges those display- ing emotional intensity to be weak, vulnerable, childish, and irrational.96 Biblical interpreters should not assume that the value judgments of their own culture are universal and presupposed by biblical texts. One wonders whether Brueggemann sometimes makes this assumption. As seen above, Brueggemann differs from Heschel and Fretheim by ascribing irra- tionality to God on the basis of emotional portrayals of the divine. Is there suffi- cient biblical evidence, however, to link emotion with irrationality the same way that many modern emotional styles do?97 Does Brueggemann's description of an irrational God result more from careful exegesis or from Western assumptions about the dichotomy between emotion and reason? One suspects that ancient Israel, so quick to express sorrow and anger in many of its psalms, did not consider these emotions to be irrational in the same way that many Americans do. When Heschel and Fretheim qualify anthropopathisms by maintaining divine rationality, they often prevent readers from importing modern Western assumptions into ancient Near Eastern literature. Their emphasis on metaphorical discontinuity frequently has merit. Fretheim and especially Heschel, however, go too far in the level of attention they devote to metaphorical discontinuity. Their emphasis on metaphorical dis- continuity threatens to eclipse the raw power of the text itself. They spend so much time explaining what the text does not say that insufficient attention falls on what the text does say. When they comment on Jer 12:7-1 3, for example, they carefully explain how God's hatred is different from humanity's. Whereas context does qual- ify how this language of hatred should be understood (Jer 12:15 talks of divine compassion), Heschel and Fretheim lose sight of the text's primary point, which uses shocking language to evoke fear among the audience. Brueggemann, on the other hand, captures the rhetorical force of this metaphor and numerous others. 96 Peter N. Stearns, American Cool: Constructing a Twentieth-Century Emotional Style (New York: New York University Press, 1994) passim, esp. 300-301, which contains a key summary. This emotional style, particularly its dichotomy between reason and emotion, has been criticized on philo- sophical and scientific grounds (Nussbaum, Upheavals of Thought, passim; Antonio R. Damasio, Descartes 'Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain [New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1994] esp. 3-79, 245-52). 97 Emotion in the Hebrew Bible is an area that needs additional research. As Paul A. Kruger ("A Cognitive Interpretation of the Emotion of Anger in the Hebrew Bible," JNSL 26 [2000] 181- 93, esp. 181 n. 1 ) puts it, "The subject of emotions in the Hebrew Bible is a most neglected theme and deserves an extensive treatment." Baloian {Anger in the Old Testament, 163-64) is one of the few to treat this subject. He examines anger and argues that the Hebrew Bible does not understand divine anger to be irrational.</page><page sequence="22">694 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 69,2007 Many texts are deeply disturbing, and Brueggemann's interpretive remarks con- sistently reflect these troublesome qualities. At times, he goes too far and gives insufficient attention to context, failing to prevent readers from imposing modern assumptions about emotions. Nevertheless, he excels at conveying the rhetorical force of the text's unsettling language. VIII. Conclusion Though Heschel, Fretheim, and Brueggemann have deeply enriched the fields of biblical theology and interpretation, none of their approaches is fully satisfac- tory. Metaphorical discontinuity receives too much attention by Heschel and even Fretheim, while it receives insufficient attention by Brueggemann. Neither the dis- turbing nature of the text nor its contextual qualifiers should be ignored. Respon- sible interpretation takes account of metaphorical discontinuity without being dominated by it. It avoids the dangers of imposing preconceived ideas about God and emotions onto the biblical text, allowing the text to speak on its own terms. It finds imaginative ways of capturing the rhetorical force of the text's language while also acknowledging the limits of such language.</page></plain_text>
