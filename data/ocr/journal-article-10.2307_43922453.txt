This cultural reality of China differs from that of medieval Europe, America and Africa when Christianity first came to those areas, where Christianity perhaps also faced the problem of religious pluralism, but as a «religion of scripture», Christianity maintained a major distinction from those indigenous religions of oral traditions. Writings and scripture can be the cultural apparatus for those areas to be quickly Christianized.1 However, in the Chinese context, Confucianism, Buddhism and Daoism each had a long scriptural tradition. How to interact with these plural scriptural traditions is a crucial question that doing Biblical studies needs to answer in the Chinese context. By proposing the concept of «comparative scriptural studies», the author tries to develop an engaged dialogue between the Christian scriptural tradition and those of Chinese indigenous religions. It is argued that comparative scrip- tural studies could be an important means in developing a «Sino-Christian scriptural hermeneutics».2 Questions discussed below include: 1.

What is the nature and role of comparative scriptural studies as a discipline that bridges the humanities and theology? 3. What are its goals and research methods? How can we give it a working definition? 4. Besides the general discussion above, the author also takes the scripture reading strategy of Zhu Xi (with the reverend title as Sage Zhu, the most important neo-Confucian in 12th century) as a case study for comparative scriptural studies, and then analyze the rele- vance of his scripture reading strategy to doing Biblical studies in China. A Retrospect of the Scholarly History of Comparative Scriptural Studies It could be safely stated that comparative studies is a fundamental method- ological presupposition ever since the Biblical Criticism was born. The move- ments of Enlightenment and Rationalism led Biblical critics to no longer take the Bible as a «revealed text», but rather as a literary work which records the historical and religious experience of ancient Israelites and early Christians. Hence methods of historical and religious studies were introduced into Biblical studies. Already this has implied comparative studies of the Bible, for it is con- sidered as a collection of religious experience belonging to different groups in different times and places. As a result the Biblical text could be divided into different faith traditions. By putting them together and comparing them, it could be seen that they were subject to distinctive social and cultural contexts which in turn lead to distinctive theological inclinations and expressions. In the field of Old Testament studies, the most famous theory using the comparative method is probably the «documentary hypothesis» by Julius Wellhausen. Its presupposition is that the Biblical text shows differences in terms of the divine names, the means of communication between God and humans, the roles of Moses and Aaron etc., which reflect the distinctive faith traditions of ancient Israelites. According to the classical Documentary Hypothesis, the Pentateuch can be separated into four sources: J, E, D, P. J comes from the southern kingdom of Judah, and it understands God as a per- sonal God, using an anthropomorphic manner to communicate with human beings. It demonstrates God's love and grace. And Moses is rather dwarfed. E comes from the northern kingdom of Israel; it understands God as majestic, communicating with humans in a mystic way which demonstrates God's jus- tice and the role of Moses is highlighted. D emphasizes centralized cult in Jerusalem and exclusive worship of Yahweh, and Moses' image as rather a law the Chinese Academic Context» in Pneuma and Logos: Chinese Journal of Theology (it A: SłtbtttiW tè) 31 (2009) 43-64.</page><page sequence="3">COMPARATIVE SCRIPTURAL STUDIES 667 interpreter than a law-maker. P stresses Aaron's family as the high priests, and the sacrifice is the essential means to communicate with God.3 Obviously, its methodology is a comparative study of the Biblical text. By using this method, nuances of Biblical narratives can be accentuated, and the ancient Israelite faith can be divided into diversified religious traditions. Though the classical Biblical criticism as Julius Wellhausen studies the texts from a comparative perspective, each tradition of J, E, D and P can still be seen as different expressions of ancient Israelite faith, belonging to the same general tradition. Some contemporary Jewish exegetes, Michael Fishbane as a representative, elaborated it further in showing that a hermeneutical prin- ciple underlies the process of the growth of the biblical text.4 He believes an inner-biblical exegesis was already practiced within the scripture even before it was finalized into a canon. It was a growth of the scriptural corpus through «inscribing the new in the old». From this perspective, there were «canons» not only in the ultimate stage of the growth of biblical texts, but also the ini- tial phase and each of the intermediate phases in the development of the Bible.5 To do biblical studies is to compare the different «scriptures» and to unknot the inner-biblical interpretive process within the Bible. Furthermore, when people gained more understanding of the Ancient Near East or the Greco-Roman world, taking the Bible as one of many scrip- tures of ancient religions, to study the Biblical texts in comparison with other religious or cultural texts truly became one of the mainstream meth- ods. In this sense, Biblical studies has become an exercise in comparative scriptural studies. For example, in the study of the Old Testament, people realized that Babylonian, Hittite, Egyptian, Assyrian, Sumerian and Israelite culture and religion each had, on the one hand, its own distinctive charac- ters, and on the other hand, some general features were found throughout the Ancient Near East. Scholars put them together and did comparison in order to find the similarities and differences between Israelite religion and its Ancient Near East neighbors. For example, the comparison between the Gilgamesh Epic and the flood story, Enuma Elish and the creation story in Genesis, the legend of Sargon the Akkad and the birth story of Moses, the 3 See J.

For example, genealo- gy, wisdom literature, and the legal texts are widely used both in the Old Testament and the Ancient Near East cultures. Therefore, an understanding of the function of these different genres in the Ancient Near East could help us to appreciate how they are used in the Old Testament, and on the other hand, by comparing them between the Ancient Near East cultures and the Old Testament, the new function and meaning appropriated by the Israelite religion could be deeply understood. As these comparative studies had already gone beyond the religious tradi- tions of ancient Israelite or early Christian traditions, and maintained a cross- textual, or cross-scriptural, dimension, they had fallen into a dilemma con- cerning whether they were doing comparative religious studies or theology. For those critical scholars, finding the counterparts of Biblical text in other cultures or even taking them as the sources of the Biblical texts challenged the theological belief that the Biblical text is Goďs unique revelation in history. Therefore, Judeo-Christianity is one of many religions, and the Bible is not a divine revelation, but rather a human work, which duplicates or derives from the Ancient Near East «scriptures».6 For those confessing scholars (either Christian or Jewish), these comparative studies can also be used to confirm their faith. By comparing the biblical text with other Ancient Near East litera- tures, one can infer the historicity of the biblical texts and further confirm that the revelation of God is based on authentic historical experience of the faith community.7 Furthermore, through some comparative studies, some scholars also point out the uniqueness of Israelite faith; they assert that, though some texts in the Bible might be derived from other religious scrip- tures, they nevertheless acquired a new theological meaning after being adapt- ed to the unique structure of the Biblical narrative. Since most of these studies discuss mainly the relationship between the Biblical texts and the Ancient Near East cultures during the formation process of the Bible, when the Bible is not yet a closed scripture, they could not be called «comparative scriptural studies» in its full sense. But as they are already doing comparative studies between multiple religions and proto-scrip- tures, their methodological and operating principles can shed much light to the construction of Sino-Christian scriptural hermeneutics, especially to the comparative studies between the Bible and the Chinese religious scriptures. These principles are as follows: 6 M.W. Chavalas, «Assyriology and Biblical Studies: A Century of Tension» in M.W. Chavalss - K.L.

Both similarities and difference of two cultures must be considered. 2. Similarities may suggest a common cultural heritage or intellectual environment. 3. It is possible to find similarities in form while differences at the conceptual level and vice versa. 4. All elements must be understood in their own context as accurately as possible before cross-cultural comparison is made. 5. Both the content of the text and the genres must be considered. 6. Similar functions may be performed by different genres in different cultures. 7. When literary or cultural elements are borrowed into another culture, they may in turn be transformed or appropriated into something quite different by those who borrowed them. 8. A culture is rarely monolithic, either in a contemporary cross-section or in consid- eration of a passage of time.8 In summary, since the beginning of modern Biblical criticism, a basic methodology used is comparative studies. It implies at least two presupposi- tions: First, it presupposed the multi-religious or cultural background of the Biblical texts. The faith of ancient Israelites or early Christians was regarded as one of the multiple religions, and these non-Jewish or Christian traditions were not simply rejected as paganism. Second, it presupposed that other reli- gious traditions can be an intellectual resource which helps to reflect and understand Jewish or Christian faith. Hence, as religious pluralism became the most dominating phenomena in the modern world, Christian theologians began to take the method of comparative religions and even comparative the- ologies to construct Christian theology.9 When it is performed in the field of Christian scriptural studies, the best representative might be the so-called «scriptural reasoning» movement. This term «scriptural reasoning» originally comes from «textual reason- ing», which is a movement initiated by a group of Jewish philosophers and Biblical textual scholars. Under the impact of the Enlightenment and histori- cism, the Hebrew Bible, notwithstanding the fact that it is the foundational scripture of the Jewish religion, seemed to be subordinated to the judgment of reason and historicity. As a reaction, some Jewish intellectuals put forward the questions as follows: 8 These principles had been applied to the comparative study of the Old Testament and Ancient Near East literature, see J.H. Walton, Ancient Near Eastern Thought and the Old Testament: Introducing the Conceptual World of the Hebrew Bible, Grand Rapids, 2006, 26-27. 9 Its representatives like Fr.

What remains of the text after it has been passed under the knife of scholarly suspicion and criticism? Can the text still have relevance for a community of interpreters today?10 For them, the Bible is a scripture «surplus in meaning». Even the most sophisticated critical studies cannot exhaust its meaning. Then they further developed the concept of «textual reasoning», because, on the one hand, the study is based on the text, and on the other, they believe that the person read- ing the Bible is not a skeptic but a reasoner who desires to find in the religious scriptures meanings relevant with the living faith community. In Ricoeur's words, it is a «hermeneutics of retrieval». The aim of textual reasoning is to develop a post-critical or post-liberal Jewish scriptural study. To achieve this, modern philosophies and theologies are introduced as intellectual resources for the interpretation of the Jewish scripture, for example, the modern Jewish theology of Hermann Cohen and Franz Rosenzweig, the cultural-linguistic model of G. Lindbeck, the cultural theory of C. Geertz, the linguistic theory of C.S. Peirce' etc. Hence, the initial impetus of textual reasoning is the engagement of the Biblical text with the wide range of humanistic thought, and the goal is to re-understand the scrip- ture of Jewish religion and tradition in developing a post-critical or post-liber- al hermeneutics. But in a pluralistic religious world, it is not enough for one religious text only to have interaction with modern humanistic thought. How multiple reli- gious scriptures and traditions can learn from each other and deepen each other is itself an important issue. Therefore, scholars from the three major Western religions, namely Judaism, Christianity and Islam, developed the movement of «textual reasoning» into «scriptural reasoning».11 Not only are the participants from diverse religious traditions, but the scriptures they read for reasoning are selected from different religious scriptures. Its intention is to make the participants go beyond the so-called «criticai» reading, and let them return to their own religious traditions in order to gain mutual under- standing and to reflect upon and reconstruct their own faith systems. We could conclude several main aspects of «scriptural reasoning» as follows: 10 St. Kepnes, «Introducing the Journal of Textual Reasoning: Rereading Judaism after Modernity» in The Journal of Textual Reasoning , vol. 1, no. 1 (http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/journals/tr/volumelAepnesTRl.html [log in on December 30, 2009]). 11 Its representatives are a Jewish scholar, Peter Ochs, a Christian scholar, David F. Ford, and an Anglican theologian Daniel W. Hardy etc. After 2007, some Islamic authorities also encouraged Muslims join the movement of «Scriptural Reasoning».</page><page sequence="7">COMPARATIVE SCRIPTURAL STUDIES 671 1. Scriptural reasoning is an activity that allows participants from multiple traditions to seek wisdom and communicate genuinely. In dialogue, all religious traditions are treated equally and respectfully 2. Scriptural reasoning is not only a dialogue among different religious traditions, but also a dialogue between religions and humanities. It is possible to construct a post- modern and post-liberal theology by re-reading the scriptural texts. 3. Scriptural reasoning tries to respond to the issues that the faith communities are facing so to make the scriptures relevant to the contemporary world. 4. In scriptural reasoning, no one or group is in sole possession of the meaning of the scriptures. 5. Scriptural reasoning should provide for the future a fresh wisdom, and deal with theoretical, philosophical and public issues in reading the text. 6. All the religions should not only return to their own traditions and scriptures, but also need to borrow from other traditions or religions so to help them to re-under- stand and rethink themselves. 7. Scriptural reasoning can not only help us understand neighboring religions, but also our own scripture and tradition, and finally highlight the ultimate "otherness" which is above either side of the dialogue in the activity of seeking wisdom. 8. The practice of scriptural reasoning contains a potential self-reflection, and a dis- solving of self-closure, self interpretation and pre-assurance.12 It is seen that though scriptural reasoning is concerned primarily with the authoritative text of a certain religious tradition, the aim of such reasoning is not to convert the readers but to deepen understanding of their faith by a comparative perspective and borrowing resources from other religions. It is an interfaith dialogue for the purpose of deepening mutual understanding but also a process of seeking wisdom by dialogue which stresses the transforma- tive role that scripture reading could play on the participants, and pursues the encounter with «the ultimate reality». With regard to the former, scriptural reasoning is a branch of humanities, while to the latter, it is a kind of theolo- gy. In short, it is a movement in-between humanities and theology. Comparative Scriptural Studies and Doing Biblical Studies in China In the author's view, the «scriptural reasoning» is essentially a movement of comparative scriptural studies. However, the participants and the scrip- tures involved are limited to the Abrahamie faiths: Judaism, Christianity and Islam, which have strong cultural affinities with each other. That is to say, 12 See Yang Huiun argument for the aspects and significance of «scriptural rea- soning» for the construction of public theology, in «The Significance of Scriptural Reasoning and Theological Studies in Public Life» in Journal of Yangtze River Academy 1 (2009) 51-52.</page><page sequence="8">672 YOU BIN though scriptural reasoning focuses on opening and listening to other tradi- tions, it is still limited to the religious situation of the West, and the «other- ness» of reasoning partners is not prominent. One could suggest that the par- ticipants would be provided with better chances to become open and to re- think themselves if they also had a comparative dialogue between Eastern and Western scriptures, for example, Chinese religious and Biblical, traditions. The necessity of developing a cross-textual reading between the Bible and the scriptures of Chinese religions has already been realized by Asian theolo- gians who are sensitive of indigenous resources.13 Archie Lee, a professor of the Hebrew Bible in Chinese University of Hong Kong, having developed a «cross-textual reading» is an outstanding example. To him, Asian scriptures including Chinese ones can be called «text A» (Asian text), while the Bible can be called «text B» (Biblical text). Hermeneutics of the Bible in Asia is a cross- reading between the two, so that «one can read a certain text using the method of reading the other, and cross from one to another to obtain the real meanings of the two texts [...]. Through such efforts, we can achieve a creative integration between the two or transformatively enrich each other's mean- ing».14 For him, cross-textual reading is not only a contemporary method of Biblical hermeneutics in the Chinese context, but also an expression of the life practice of Chinese Christians in history. Through research on the writings of Chinese Christians in the end of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644 A.D.), he found 13 Tai il Wang, a Korean professor of the Hebrew Bible, believes that the Eastern under- standing of the nature of scripture could help the Biblical studies «return to canon», see «Return to Canon: Korean Perspectives on Performing the Scripture» in Yeong Mee Lee - Yoon Jong Yoo (eds), Mapping and Engaging the Bible in Asian Cultures, SABS 2008 Conference Handbook, pp. 51-62.

Moreover, his awareness of «otherness» in taking the Chinese scriptures as the dialogue partner of the Bible is superior to that of Western Biblical schol- ars. Nonetheless, for doing the Biblical study in the Chinese context, cross-tex- tual reading is not enough to grasp the deep interaction between Chinese scriptures and the Bible. First, it only takes the text as the center of cross-tex- tual reading, but the text is only alive within its scriptural tradition, whether speaking of the Chinese scriptures or the Bible. It is almost impossible to have a deep dialogue between the two religious traditions if merely having the cross-reading of the two texts. Second, it seems that the primary goal of cross- textual reading is to interpret the Bible with the Chinese religious texts or to make the Biblical text easier to be understood or accepted by the Chinese audience. The deeper intellectual dynamics and significance for the other humanities disciplines is rather lacking in its concerns. Therefore, the author would like to propose the «comparative scriptural studies» as a method of doing Biblical studies in the Chinese context. It is to continue the scholarly enterprise of doing Biblical studies from the perspec- tive of cultural comparison, following the intellectual concerns of the «textu- al reasoning» and «scriptural reasoning» movement, and at the same time, absorbing the deep understanding of Chinese multi-religious scriptural con- text by the «cross-textual reading». It is also contextualized with the Chinese academia which is the main institutional background for doing the Biblical studies in China. Within the modern movements of Christian theology, it could be broadly regarded as a part of «comparative theology» mentioned above. A brief description about its possible working areas is as follows. As two of the most lasting scriptural traditions among the world civiliza- tions, the scriptural studies of Judeo-Christian and Chinese religions (espe- cially Confucianism which is the mainstream of Chinese culture) can general- ly be divided into four sub-categories: 1. Studies on the scripture itself. It focuses its study on the canon itself, e.g. the Christian Bible and the Thirteen Confucian Scriptures (+HÉŽ). The philological and textual criticisms are applied by the both traditions in studying their scriptures, though they are unfairly called as «lower criticism» by the modern exegetes, and «minor knowledge» by Confucians. The techniques, methodology, and signifi- cance of both scriptural traditions could be compared and enriched from each other. Particularly, some developed criticism, for example, tradition-history 15 Archie Lee «A Cross Reading Strategy», 169.</page><page sequence="10">674 YOU BIN criticism, feminism criticism, new literary criticism and ideological criticism in the modern Christian scriptural studies could shed much light on the Confucian scriptural studies. 2. The intellectual history of the Scriptures. In the development of intellectual history over two thousand years, both the Bible and Confucian scriptures have developed a close relationship with other disciplines like theology, philosophy, literature and politics, and vice versa been influenced by them. Most of the scriptural scholars were also important figures in the history of ideas. To compare the intellectual history of the dif- ferent scriptures would enhance the mutual understanding of each other. For example, the co-existence of «respect for scripture» and «suspicion about scripture» (§£!£) in the Song Dynasty (960-1276 A.D.), a period of the most drastic political and cultural transformation in Chinese history,16 is very similar to what the reformer did in the Reformation Era. Doing comparative studies on them can help us gain a better understanding of the nature of Eastern and Western religions and their scriptures, as well as the relationship between «respect of the scripture» and «suspicion of the scripture». 3. Scriptural hermeneutics. Scriptural hermeneutics is a fundamental discipline in both the Eastern and Western religions. By doing hermeneutics on the scrip- tures, scholars have developed various forms of theology, philosophy or socio-political thought, and have also formed an abundance of theories of hermeneutics. Doing comparative studies on them can be beneficial to the construction of both Chinese and Christian hermeneutical theories.17 4. Intellectual history of comparative scriptural studies. In the case of Christian history, the comparison between Christian, Jewish or Islamic scripture had been important intellectual practice in the inter-testamental period or the medieval age. On the other side, the scriptural comparison (even merge) between Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism had been conducted by the Chinese literati since the classical period, and reached its peaķ in the Neo- Confucian movement of Song Dynasty. And Christian Scriptures were added 16 See Yang Xinxun A Study on the Scriptural Criticism in Song Dynasty Beijing, Zhonghua Publishing 2007, 183. 17 The contemporary Chinese philosophers are aware of the necessity to recover and construct the scriptural hermeneutics according to Chinese intellectual tradition, and the development of Biblical criticism can shed light on that academic project from a comparative perspective. About the appeal for a Chinese scriptural hermeneutics, see its representative Tang Yijie «Is That Possible to Construct a Chinese Scriptural Hermeneutics?» in Scholars (¥A) 13 (1998) 6-9; and his successive papers, «Second Essay on the Construction of Chinese Scriptural Hermeneutics» in Chinese Social Sciences (ŤBliz?^^) 1 (2000) 83-90; «Third Essay on the Construction of Chinese Scriptural Hermeneutics» in Studies on Chinese Culture (Ť1ÍM® Summer (2000) 16-20; «On the Construction of Chinese Scriptural Hermeneutics» in Donghai Philosophical Collections (^fëïÎ^ffl^ijiiHI) 8 (2001) 7-23.</page><page sequence="11">COMPARATIVE SCRIPTURAL STUDIES 675 as a new element in the comparative scriptural dialogue by Chinese Christians when Christianity came into China since late Ming Dynasty.18 Though the author is proposing comparative scriptural studies as an approach of doing Biblical studies in contemporary Chinese context, as a matter of fact, histori- cally the Chinese Christians had already practiced the comparative scriptural studies in their cultural identity struggles. In conclusion, comparative scriptural studies are an intellectual enterprise that find themselves located in-between the humanities and theology. First, it could be a branch of the humanities, like comparative literature or compara- tive religious studies. A working definition of comparative scriptural studies as a branch of humanities could be as follows: Comparative scriptural studies do not only compare one scriptural tradition with another, but also provide a method that can broaden the intellectual vision of the researchers when they study certain scriptural tradition, and enable them to go beyond the border of a single scriptural tradition of one particular religion, and hereafter gain more understanding on the relationship between various human intellectual spheres and the scriptural tradition. In short, comparative scriptural studies can be viewed as a discipline of humanities that examines the relationship between the scriptures and other forms of human knowledge by comparing differ- ent scriptures and their traditions of interpretation. In this sense, the purpose of comparative religious studies or comparative liter- ature can also be adapted by comparative scriptural studies, i.e. understanding of other cultures, seeking to have dialogue with other religious traditions, broadening the spirituality of different religious traditions, and deepening the understanding and reflection of the participants from different faith traditions. Comparative scriptural studies can, on the other hand, be a particular «the- ological enterprise». That is to say, comparative scriptural studies is not only for a interfaith dialogue, but rather looks into other cultures for the resources which are beneficial for Christian scriptural studies, and further promotes the interaction between theology and Biblical studies, and enhances the ability of Christianity to respond to contemporary issues. In this sense, its purpose is rather to construct Christian theology. In the case of comparative scriptural 18 For the comparative scriptural studies of Matteo Ricci and his colleagues, especially the importance of this intellectual project for the life practice of common Chinese Christian in late-Ming and Qing Dynasties, see E.

It is root- ed in Christian tradition, but also to serve the tradition. In regard to its nature and purpose, it is similar to the contemporary «comparative theology» move- ment. Therefore we could give it a theological definition as well: Comparative scriptural studies try to explore the meaning of Christian faith by introducing resources of scriptural traditions of other religions. It locates itself in- between Christian and other scriptural traditions. On the one hand it commits itself to Christian religion; on the other hand, it opens itself sincerely to the scriptural tra- dition of other religions. Its purpose, however, is to learn the scriptural traditions of other religions in order to discover, rebuild and strengthen the ability to understand the Christian Scripture and to construct theology based on the Bible. In this sense, it is a kind of «Christian» comparative scriptural studies. Its aim in performing this comparison is to build a Sino-Christian scriptural hermeneutics. Essentially, comparative scriptural studies is a subject in-between human- ities and theology. As a subject within the humanities, it belongs to compara- tive religious studies or interfaith dialogue, and involves what a modern Confucian philosopher calls: «speaking accordingly» (MłB#); conversely, as a theological discipline it deepens the religious understanding of a specific tra- dition and we can assert that it involves «speaking continuingly» As a method of doing Biblical studies in Chinese context, it adopts an in- between approach and does not intend to dissolve its inner tension. It holds itself back from the confessional exegesis, but also is aware of its difference from the modern Biblical criticism. First of all, it endeavors to have a dialogue with the scriptural traditions of other religions. Second, it is a self-criticizing discipline as it tries to re-examine the Christian interpretation of the Bible in reference to the scriptural traditions of other religions, for instance, the Confucian one in the Chinese context. Lastly, it is an open discipline as it is ready to adjust or transform its theological understanding in absorbing inspiring elements from other scriptural traditions. 19 The terms of «speaking accordingly» and «speaking continuingly» is borrowed from Feng Youlan 1895-1990), a modern Confucian philosopher, in describing the modern role of Confucianism in China, the former refers to «just follow what the ancients said» while the latter «transformatively continue what the ancients said»; see Feng Youlan, «Neo-School of Principles (SfS^)» in Six Books on Chinese Renaissance (i^7UÄ^), Shanghia, Eastern China Normal University (^^]Ií1í?q^:^{±S|1řÍ±), 1996, 5.</page><page sequence="13">COMPARATIVE SCRIPTURAL STUDIES 677 Going Beyond the Biblical Criticism with the Inspiration from Sage Zhu's Scripture Reading Strategy: A Case of Comparative Scriptural Studies When we practice comparative scriptural studies in the Chinese cultural context, there is no doubt that the scriptural tradition of Confucianism should become a significant intellectual source in the construction of Sino-Christian scriptural hermeneutics. «The Thirteen Confucian Scriptures» are really the accumulation of the whole history of Chinese civilization from its origin. The study of these scriptures is the mainstream intellectual enterprise from Han (206 BC-220 A.D.) to the Ming-Qing (1368-1911 A.D.) dynasties. It is such a profound scriptural tradition that there are enormous inspirations that Sino- Christian scriptural hermeneutics can draw from. In this paper, the author intends to study the scripture reading strategy of Sage Zhu and discuss its possible inspiration for Sino-Christian scriptural hermeneutics to go beyond Biblical criticism. As it is regrettable to note that Biblical criticism, originating in the Enlightenment, tends to inspect the text according to exclusively rational, empirical and historical principles, and has come to dominate modern Biblical studies. Today, scholars apply literary, historical, and ideological criticisms to the Biblical text. When doing critical study, they replace the activity of actual- ly reading the scripture with a literary and aesthetic analysis, and with discus- sions of historical verification to the extent that the Bible almost becomes an archaeological manual. Similarly, in ideological criticism the Bible is often accused of suppressing the voice of women, of silencing the minorities, or of causing ecological problems. The scripture reading is manipulated by the claims of different interest groups, for example, both parties of Israel and Palestine use the Bible to support their land claims. In other word, the Biblical text seems to be in an awkward position, i.e., claimed as a holy scripture, but not many truly read it as a «scripture»; regarded as an «emperor», but has its destiny actually controlled by different «vassals». Nevertheless, after more than a century of critical studies, scholars also need to rethink this stress on Biblical criticism: Has the critical study exhaust- ed the meanings of the Bible? Do current Biblical studies still belong to theol- ogy?20 Is it the right direction for Biblical studies to deviate farther and farther from theological tradition of Christianity? In regard to this, scholars from both the West and the East are trying to find a way that might go beyond crit- ical studies. Some try to find resources from contemporary post-liberal theol- ogy, Wittgenstein's philosophy, etc. in order to fulfill a post-critical or post- liberal hermeneutics. Some Korean Bible scholars attempt to find their way 20 As Biblical scholar James Barr spoke in his inauguration speech at Oxford in May 16, 1977, see J. Barr, Does Biblical Studies Still Belong to Theology?, Oxford, 1978.</page><page sequence="14">678 YOU BIN from the Asian tradition of scripture reading.21 The author also believes that Chinese scriptural tradition is an important resource for doing Biblical stud- ies in China. This paper takes Sage Zhu's scripture reading strategy to see its inspiration for Chinese scriptural studies, especially for going beyond the Biblical criticism. It will discuss separately his answers to three basic ques- tions in scripture reading: 1. What is the scripture? 2. Why read the scripture? 3. How to read the scripture? What is the scripture? In his writings, Sage Zhu has an extensive and systematic discussion on «book-reading strategy» (i^ļīiž).22 First of all, with regard to the nature of Confucian scriptures, Sage Zhu has a clear consciousness of taking them as «holy books». For him, the reason why a book can be regarded as «holy» is either that it was written by ancient sages or that it embodies the heavenly principle or Tao. He said: The Six Scriptures (7'£ž) are the works of the Three Most Ancient Sages (HfÇ) and even earlier, and passed through the Sages' hands, they are full of heavenly princi- ple. ( Scripture Reading Strategy Ķ «ÍS15ÍÈT»).23 Thousands of words by sages can be concluded into one certain principle. Lest people can not understand it, they render it into scriptures. (Scripture Reading Strategy U) In short, the scriptures for Sage Zhu play vital roles in guiding human Ufe. He expressed this by distinguishing the difference between the scriptures and the historical books: 21 Tai il Wang, «Return to Canon: Korean Perspectives on Performing the Scripture» in Yeong Mee Lee - Yoon Jong Yoo (eds), Mapping and Engaging the Bible in Asian Cultures , 55. 22 Sage Zhu elaborated extensively and systematically on scripture reading. In the volume X and XI of Sayings of Sage Zhu edited by Li Jingde (SI Sr if), Beijing, Zhonghua Books 1986, there are First and Second Books of Scripture Reading Strategy (iSfivŽ). In Collection of Sage Zhu's Writings eds. by Guo Qi &amp; Yi Bo (F®, Chengdu, Sichuan Education Press (ÊJjllHcWíljJ&amp;ít), 1996, many passages are concerned with scripture reading strategy as well. A modern Confucian scholar, Qian Mu 1895- 1990), had collected the Sage Zhu's comments on scripture reading in Sayings of Sage Zhu and Collection of Sage Zhu's Writings , and edited them into a three-volume book of «Sage Zhu On Scripture Reading Strategy» in Xue Yue (^#), Beijing, Jiuzhou Press tfifflitiJKifc) ,2010. The author will render his own translation of Zhu Xi's work, with reference to D.K. Gardner, Chu Hsi: Learning To Be A Sage, Selections from Conversations of Master Chu, Arranged Topically , Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1990. 23 The «Three Most Ancient Sages» refers to, according to Confucianism, the three leg- endary sages, Yao {%), Shun ($0, Yu (H), who were the sage-kings before the founding of the state. They represent the cultural and moral Utopia of Confucianism.</page><page sequence="15">COMPARATIVE SCRIPTURAL STUDIES 679 Reading the scriptures is different from reading the histories History is superficial, not important. You can take notes on it and then consult with others about it. But should you have questions in scripture reading the affliction will be on yourself. You will be like a person who is in pain and wants to alleviate it quickly but can not. Is not this different greatly from reading histories, that you can just take on notes when you have questions? (Scripture Reading Strategy II) This means that history is just external knowledge; it is possible for a human to have no clear understanding about it. Scriptures, however, are the founda- tion of life; if there is a flaw, it is like disease on the body. He showed great respect for scripture and used the relationship of master and servant to compare the relationship between scripture and the exegetes. The scriptures are like the master, the exegetes like the servants. Since people are unacquainted with the master and turn to the servants for an introduction to know the master. In the end it is not as good as turning to the scriptures themselves. (Scripture Reading Strategy II) Let us make a brief conclusion about Sage Zhu's understanding of Confucian scriptures. As a Confucian humanist, he does not have the concept of «reve- lation» and does not deny that the scriptures were written by humans. However, he referred to the authors as the representatives of the ideal Confucian personality, namely ancient sages, and the scriptures are their understandings of the heavenly principles. In this regard, the starting point of Sage Zhu's scriptural studies should not be the hermeneutics of suspicion, but rather the hermeneutics of reverence. In Christian classical understanding about the scripture, the Bible is thought to be «word of God». Although fundamentalists believe that the Bible is the dictation of God's words, to most scholars it is not a contradiction to speak of the «Word of God» as also «the work of human beings». Judeo- Christian tradition attributes the authorship of the Bible to the prophets and apostles, from Moses, David to Matthew, John and Paul etc. Through literary and social-scientific analysis, modern critics believe that the Biblical texts are actually works of faith communities or individuals at different historical stages in different contexts. However, admitting that the author of the Bible lived in a specific circumstance does not necessarily make the exegetes lose their respect for the authority of the Biblical texts, just as Sage Zhu does not even have the concept of revelation or the «word of God», but still respects the authority of the Confucian scriptures. This might make him as a neo- Confucian close to the Catholic understanding of the Sacred Scripture, as in the encyclical Divino Afflante Spiritu, usually called as «a Magna Carta for bib- lical progress», Pope Pius XII concluded: «Let the interpreter then, with all care and without neglecting any light derived from recent research, endeavor to determine the peculiar character and circumstances of the sacred writer, the</page><page sequence="16">680 YOU BIN age in which he lived, the sources written or oral to which he had recourse and the forms of expression he employed».24 In fact, as Sage Zhu understood that the authorship of Confucian scriptures were ancient sages and that the scrip- tures were the embodiment of the Heavenly Principle, it is similar to the Catholic understanding that «the inspired writer, in composing the sacred book, is the living and reasonable instrument of the Holy Spirit».25 Sage Zhu' s understanding of the nature of the scriptures could help peo- ple to respect the scripture even though Biblical criticism has reduced the Biblical authors to normal people who lived in a peculiar social and cultural context. The purpose of reading the Bible is to pursue the encounter of the Holy Spirit through the archetypical experience of the first generation of faith community, just as Sage Zhu's reading Confucian scripture is to encounter the heavenly principle through the writings or compositions of ancient sages. Why read the scripture? As to why people should read the scripture, the answer of Sage Zhu is pro- found and systematic and emanates from his understanding of the meaning of life, the role of knowledge, life-cultivation etc. First, scripture reading is to «exhaust the Li (the heavenly principle)» (*Ê?ïI). In this regard, he said: The way of learning is to exhaust the heavenly principle. And the gist of exhausting the principles is to read the scripture. The method of reading is to follow the order and reach the details («Second Official Letters to the Emperor», in Collection of Sage Zhu's Writings, vol. XIV, i%M)) #+0 «ÍTĚÍSiŽilfL^l»). According to Sage Zhu, the heavenly principle, as natural law, is the basic rule of ethical life. The sages have experientially known all the principles, and wrote them down in the scriptures. Thus, scripture reading, especially combined with some practices of cultivating meditation, can lead people to the heavenly principle. It is evident that, according to Sage Zhu, scripture reading is far beyond a mere analysis of the text, whether that be literal, or historical, or ideological. It is to «read out», rather than «read into». Essentially it is an encounter with the natural law inherent in the scriptures. Scripture reading is not a process of evaluation by the so-called «enlightened» readers, but, first of all, of desir- ing «to be enlightened» waiting in humbleness. 24 Pope Pius XII, Divino Afflante Spiritu , Encyclical Letter on the Promotion of Biblical Studies , September 30, 1943, para. 33. 25 Ibid.</page><page sequence="17">COMPARATIVE SCRIPTURAL STUDIES 681 Secondly, the scripture reading is to «find the lost mind» According to Sage Zhu, scripture reading goes far beyond an intellectual analysis of the meaning of the scripture, rather it involves a kind of physical and psychological therapy which invites the «heavenly principle» to cure and occupy the «ill mind». It initiates a process of molding the ideal personality. It is an illness of mind being trapped in indulgence (PÉÍÜ), and not fully soaked with the heavenly principle. To cure this, one needs to read scripture constantly and then to exhaust the principles. If he can do this constantly, his mind won't be overwhelmed by evil desires and the his inner self will be calm and firm («The Tenth Reply Letter X to Wang Jinsi» in Collection of Sage Zhu* s Writings, vol. XXXIX, «#*» «sas» n+^). And in another saying, he quotes a saying of a contemporary Confucian sage, Zhang Zai (5&amp;Sc), that scripture reading is to sustain the human soul so that it does not fall: Read the scripture constantly is a way to govern one's soul (líSilifc'l», to keep it alive CßÄÄ#). As what Zhang Zai had said: «the scripture is to sustain one's soul. If one gives up scripture reading, even just for a while, the soul will fall, and then near to destruction» (Scripture Reading Strategy II). Unsurprisingly, Sage Zhu uses medical terms to express the purpose of scrip- ture reading: It is not enough for one to read only part of the scripture to grasp the heavenly prin- ciple. It is like taking medicine. Only one dose cannot cure the illness. One needs to take the medicine one dose after another and the effects combine, then the medi- cine will work (Scripture Reading Strategy I).26 Sage Zhu here is making a parable using concepts such as «lost soul», «illness of the soul», «reading the scripture is like taking medicine» etc. to indicate that readers are like patients, the scripture like the prescription, just as in Christian tradition readers are called «sinners» who expect to receive the Holy Spriťs cure and redemption by reading the Bible. It seems that both the 26 Sage Zhu often used the analogy of medicine with the scripture reading in his dialogue with disciples. For example, once he said: «Only doing exegesis upon the word of Sages in the scripture is not enough. One ought to practice experientially and do it, in the manner of medi- cine burning the body, then that is the true moment of scripture reading» (Sayings of Sage Zhu , vol. xxvi «ia!£» îifcfêJV))). In another occasion of his gathering with disciples, he show the way of scripture reading by a gesture of taking the packages of Chinese medicine to say «taking medicine is not just to pack them together, but to cook it, then drink it. Otherwise, the medicine can do nothing to the illness» (Scripture Reading Strategy H «iiļ^ŽT»).</page><page sequence="18">682 YOU BIN Confucian and Christian scriptural traditions believe that the reader is like a patient, the scripture a prescription, and the Holy Spirit or heavenly principle is the healer. This is opposed to the presupposition of much Biblical criticism according to which the Biblical text is like the patient, while the critic sitting in front of the texts is the doctor who uses modern ideology as a «scalpel» to open the body of the text and look for the pathogen. Lastly, the aim of scripture reading for Sage Zhu is to «change mentality» He clearly states that the aim of scripture reading is not to add up knowledge, or to read the claims of a social group «into» the text, but to «set- tle down» the personal existential concern. In a theological word, scripture reading is out of the necessity of personal «ultimate concern». In one dialogue with disciples, he asserts: He Sun asks: You Master asked us to read Mencius (S&amp;T, one of the Confucian scrip- ture). If I read it and understand it perfectly, shall my mentality (or personality) be changed? Sage Zhu answers: If you can understand the principles inside the scripture, you will be changed spontaneously. If you are still the same person and are never changed, it means that you have not read the scripture, or that you did not understand the book: Mencius is still that scripture, and you are still that person. In order to under- stand while reading the scriptures, it is necessary to add some strength, to cheer up, then you can understand fully, and then you can end in practicing unto yourself ( Saying of Sage Zhu , vol. CXX, +). The metaphors used here is very interesting. Reading is no longer only an intellectual activity of the mind, what it needs more is to «add some strength» (i ) and «cheer up» (łTłhłftt), and «ends in practicing unto yourself» (Ť^_hWí!]). It means that scripture reading requires a full devotion of the reader to the text, and ultimately to the heavenly principle within it. To summarize, the discourse of Sage Zhu on why one reads the scripture is in accordance with his opinion on the nature of the scripture. Scripture reading is neither motivated by mere historical or epistemological concerns, nor by the interest-claims of particular groups. Rather, its aim is to have the reader encounter the heavenly principle. It is a process by which a reader can recognize and admit his sickness and status as a patient. After combining other ways of spiritual exercises which help him to «open the mind» (Í&amp; JF'hlfêï), «add some strength» and «cheer up», the reader would open himself to the heavenly prin- ciple, and finally would grow spirituality through changing his mentality. It pro- vides a set of goals for scripture reading which is distinctive from modern Biblical criticism. In a sense it also goes beyond the canonical criticism and Biblical theology which still limits scripture reading to an intellectual activity.27 27 The classic study of canonical criticism, see Br.S. Childs, Biblical Theology of Old</page><page sequence="19">COMPARATIVE SCRIPTURAL STUDIES 683 How to read the scripture? Although Sage Zhu respects the scriptures, he is not a fundamentalist who insists that the Confucian scripture is inerrant. He was one of the leading exegetes in the camp of «suspecting scripture» in the Song dynasty. He show his skepticism to some of the Confucian scriptures such as «the Book of Odes» (Wèì), «the Book of History» (15£ž), «the Rites of Zhou» (jSiíL), «the Book of Rites » (^LiB), « Zuo Zhuan» (ŻE#), « Gongyang Zhuan » « Guliang Zhuan » (íř^ft), and «the Book of Filial Piety» (#£ž).28 On the other hand, he strongly objected to the manner in which some of his skeptical contempo- raries treated Confucian scriptures such as «the Book of Change» (J?ŽŽ), «Yi Li » (iX łL), « Mencius » CbĚť), «the Analects » (i&amp;ìnO. Hence, we can not simply classify him into the camp of «suspecting scripture» or «revering scripture». However, his discourse on «how to read the scripture» is in general accor- dance with his ideas of «what is the scripture» and «why read the scripture». To put it in a simple way, he has three principles on how to read the scripture. First is the principle of «emptying the mind» (JË&gt;1&gt;), which means that the reader should not set up his own standpoint for scripture reading. In other words, it is «hermeneutics of suspension». He said: One should empty one's mind and not judge while reading the scripture. When one section ends, go to the following one. Waiting till its end then one can judge (Scripture Reading Strategy /1). «To empty one's mind» is to follow the text itself. He said: One should empty one's mind and calm down while reading the scrip- tures. Follow the ideas in the scripture; do not form one's own opinion beforehand. If comments with one's own opinion, one cannot see the ideas of the sages («The Tenth Reply Letter to Liu Jizhang» in Collection of Sage Zhu's Writings , vol. LIII, «i In the vocabulary of contemporary Biblical studies, one's aim is to ask: «what is in the text?» The first step in scripture reading is to let the reader empty himself and wait for the meaning of the scripture, or the textual reality, to show itself. As for him, the meaning of a scripture will stand out if you read it «hundred of times». The approach of reading scripture with an empty mind seems clumsy, but it would obtain the real unity between the reader and the scripture. Testament and New Testament , Minneapolis, 1993; and J. A. Sanders, Canon &amp; Community: A Guide to Canonical Criticism , Eugene (OR), 2000. 28 Yang Xinxun (łlf§r®]), A Study on the Scriptural Criticism in Song Dynasty , 183.</page><page sequence="20">684 YOU BIN The next principle is «practicing unto oneself» (tj¡ B). If the first step is to empty or suspend one's judgment until the meaning of the text shows up, the second step of «practicing unto oneself» enables the textual reality to activate change in the reader. As he said: In reading, one should empty and then practice it unto oneself. Being empty, then one can understand ideas of the sages; practicing the text unto oneself, then one can experience the truth of the text ( Scripture Reading Strategy II) He often pointed out to his disciples the importance of practicing the text unto themselves in scripture reading. For example, he said: If one would only study the scripture but not practice unto himself, it is useless. Take the doctrine of charity (fc), justice (X), manners (}L), wisdom (H): how can one know what charity is, what justice is, what manners are, what wisdom is, with- out practicing these unto oneself and learning it experientially? (Scripture Reading Strategy J3) The way of learning is getting knowledge by the mind and practicing it on the body (Scripture Reading Strategy U ). According to Sage Zhu, only by practicing the text unto oneself can the aim of scripture reading, namely to change one's mentality, be fulfilled. The last principle is the unification between the scripture reader and the sages' mind, and, finally, the unification of reader and the heavenly principle. He said: Scripture reading is to experience the mind of the sages. Once the reader practices it naturally, his heart is one with the sages' mind (Saying of Sage Zhu , vol. CXX, « Hence, scripture readers seek for the ideas of the sages through the words in scrip- ture, and to reach the heavenly principle through the sages' ideas (Collection of Sage Zhu's Writings, vol. XLII, « jtļfc» For him, the final stage of scripture reading is to have the four elements in reading - the reader, the scripture, the sage who wrote the scripture, and the heavenly principle - reach a state of unity. He even uses the expression of «burying oneself in the scripture» (which means one is fully devoted to the scripture) to depict the state of «the unity of scripture and reader». He said: The reader should bury himself completely into the scripture and think on it all the time until he gets the meaning. Whatever happens outside, the reader does not care. With a single mind on the scripture, one can understand it fully (Scripture Reading Strategy U). The reader should bury his whole body in the scripture. In his walking, living, sit- ting and sleeping, his mind should have a single focus on the text with the aim to</page><page sequence="21">COMPARATIVE SCRIPTURAL STUDIES 685 understand it fully. He shall not care that anything happened outside and only keep his mind on the scripture. Only then, can we call him a good reader ( Saying of Sage Zhu, vol. CXVI, «ï&amp;iÉ» In short, Sage Zhu's three principles of scripture reading, namely emptying the heart, practicing unto oneself in reading, and unification between the reader and the scripture, could inspire the Biblical studies in Chinese context to develop a «hermeneutics of listening» and «hermeneutics of transforma- tion». In doing so, Biblical studies could develop a hermeneutics which could go beyond the Biblical criticism through absorbing the intellectual inspiration from Confucian scriptural tradition in a comparative scriptural perspective. Minzu University of China Beijing China Dr. You Bin Professor of Christianity</page><page sequence="22">686 YOU BIN SUMMARY After briefly analyzing Sage Zhu's answers to the questions: «What is Scripture?» «Why read Scripture?» and «How to read Scripture?», the article concludes that the inspiration of Sage Zhu' has a relevance for a strategy for doing Biblical studies in a Chinese context. The article proposes an example of comparative scriptural studies whereby intellectual resources from the Confucian scriptural tradition are offered to develop a Sino-Christian scriptural hermeneutic. The author believes that doing Biblical studies in China should go beyond Biblical criticism and develop into a properly Sino- Christian scriptural hermeneutics with a theological dimension. In this regard, Sage Zhu's answers to the three questions above are of great significance to the construction of a Sino-Christian scriptural hermeneutic. Dopo una breve analisi delle risposte del saggio Zhu alle questioni: «Cos'è la scrit- tura?», «Perché leggere la scrittura?» e «Come leggere la scrittura?», si arriva alla con- clusione che l'ispirazione del Saggio Zhu è importante per una strategia di lettura nello studio della Bibbia nel contesto cinese. L'articolo offre un esempio di studio comparati- vo della Scrittura in cui si presentano risorse intellettuali della tradizione scritturistica del Confusionismo per costruire un'ermeneutica sino-cristiana della Scrittura. L'autore ritiene che lo studio della Bibbia in Cina potrà andare al di là del criticismo biblico e svi- lupparsi in un'ermeneutica scritturale propriamente sino-cristiana con una dimensione teologica. Le risposte del saggio Zhu alle tre domande sopra citate hanno un grande significato per la costruzione di una ermeneutica scritturistica sino-cristiana.</page></plain_text>
