Statisticians have so far played a rather peripheral role in the international scientific endeavor to assess climate change. I am grateful to have the opportunity to discuss the article by Handcock and Wallis. My discussion will focus on two areas: "good" classes of isotropic correlation functions and the use of temperature data to detect climate change. I con- clude with some thoughts on where more statistical efforts are needed. 1. ISOTROPIC CORRELATION FUNCTIONS Following Matern (1986), we can write any continuous isotropic correlation functions in R' as r(v) = Eei"Tx where X is an n-dimensional random variable and v = I u I. It is easy to see by isotropy that the expectation only can depend on the distribution G of I X 1. Let Y have a uniform distribution on the unit sphere. Then, by looking at u for which the first component is v, it follows that r(v) = EeiVXl Y = Eby(v I X 1), where bky is the characteristic function of Y, namely 4by(t) = k!( Jk(t), k = 2 \t 2' and Jk is a Bessel function of the first kind. Now let n = 2, so 4by(t) = J0(t). Then r(v) = Jo(vt) dG(t); (1) that is, any continuous spatial isotropic correlation function is a scale mixture of Bessel functions JO. Figure 1 shows Jo, and we see that there is a lower bound for isotropic spatial correlations of -.403. The representation (1) can be used to find nonparametric estimates of spatial correlation. Compute empirical corre- lations rij between monitoring sites at distance dij, and then minimize with respect to G the expression Lr \~~~~~~2 z (7 Jo(dijt) dG(t) -rij w for a suitable weight function w11.

The Bessel Function JO. can be used in the optimization. They will yield a discrete cdf G, supported on at most (') points. Various choices of G yield various classes of correlation functions. The Matern class, used by Handcock and Wallis, obtains from letting G be the cdf of an F-type distribu- tion, namely G'(x) = 202012O2x(x2 + 0p2)-(02+l) while the Gaussian class obtains from the Rayleigh density G'(x) = 2x02e74x202. The integral (1) is essentially a Hankel transform (Erdelyi, Magnus, Oberhettinger, and Tricomi 1954), so many classes of correlation functions can be derived in this fashion. A drawback of the Matern class is that it does not allow for negative correlations, which can be induced by orographic effects. This would be particularly important when one has observations on both sides of a mountain ridge. A more general class of isotropic correlation functions allow for a discontinuity at the origin (called a nugget in geostatistics). This can be thought of as representing mea- surement error and spatial correlation on distances smaller than the minimum intersite distance. Although the mea- surement error may be small for temperature data, I was nonetheless surprised not to see a nugget effect in the fitted variogram. Schoenberg (1938) conjectured that all isotropic correlation functions can be obtained as a probability mixture of a pure nugget and a continuous correlation. I am not aware of any proof of this conjecture and consequently have not encountered any counterexample. The Matern correlation with 02 = 1 is due to Whittle (1954), who obtained it as the correlation function for the solution to the stochastic partial differential equation V24(x, y) - a20(x, y) = _(X, y), where e is white noise. The corresponding spectral density is of autoregression (AR) AR(l)-type, namely s(fi, f2) = u2/(f 2 + f 2+ a2). Vecchia (1985) and Jones and Vec- chia (1993) extended this to correlations corresponding to general rational spectra, or continuous autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models. This is another rich class of cor- relation functions, having the advantage over the Matern class in that it allows for negative correlations. 2. DETECTING CLIMATE CHANGE It is not clear that climate changes due to increased green- house gas emission is most easily detected in temperature records. Although it is nice to have available (in some areas, at least) about a century's worth of data, there are serious problems with these data; for example, effects of instrumen- tation change, increased urbanization, and stations being added and removed over time. Furthermore, it is not clear what the anthropomorphic greenhouse effect on a small re- gion in central North America should be. The outputs of various general circulation models are not unanimous, except in that none predict a uniform global temperature change, although the average global temperature generally increases under most scenarios (IPCC 1990). Although paleontological records indicate natural rapid temperature changes of the same order of magnitude as those expected to be seen globally on the half century spanning the year 2000 (.5-1 .5?C in 50 years), the recently obtained</page><page sequence="3">384 Journal of the American Statistical Association, June 1994 ice cores from Greenland indicate even more rapid temper- ature changes (EOS 1993). It must be emphasized that such records do not constitute global averages, but rather are more like the data analyzed by Handcock and Wallis. In fact, global average temperature is actually measured by an average of regional averages of local daily averages of the minimum and maximum temperature at each measuring location. If one confines attention to the temperature record, it would be more appropriate to look at minimum tempera- tures, because their increases are more likely to produce most of the increase in global average temperature. Substantial increases in maximum daily temperature are physically much less feasible. There are undoubtedly some indicators of cli- mate change that are much more sensitive than temperature, and much recent research has gone into identifying such indicators. 3. CONCLUDING REMARKS Where should statisticians concentrate their efforts in as- sessing climate change? First, if we are to estimate realistic correlation functions for meteorological variables, then it is important to realize that these cannot be assumed to be homogeneous on continental scales. Methods for heteroge- neous covariance estimation are currently being developed (see Guttorp and Sampson 1994 for a review). Second, I think that we need to get much more involved in areas such as data cleaning. Statistical methods, such as robust cleaner-smoothers (Brandt and Kunsch 1988) can be extended to the space-time context and may be useful in assisting scientists working on cleaning the various temper- ature series. Third, the estimation of global average temperature must take into account spatial structure. This amounts to the de- velopment of estimates of global correlation (a different class of correlation functions; cf. Jones 1963) and of methods for combining correlated data with widely varying precision. The statistical problems may be hard, but the fundamental tools are available, and I expect rapid developments in these areas. ADDITIONAL REFERENCES Brandt, A., and Kunsch, H. R.
