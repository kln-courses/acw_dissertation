<plain_text><page sequence="1">CORRESPONDENCE SMELTING AND ROCK ART Sir, Anything that Mr. C. K. Cooke writes con- cerning rock-art in Rhodesia is worthy of close attention, but I feel that his recent article' should be queried. While there is no scale to the map accompanying his note, only two of the paintings appear to be really near to the iron-smelting areas, which, if anything, are shown as peripheral to that of the paintings. Indeed from the map, the 'woman' paintings could as well be associated with rivers, which would, in fact, be less of a stretching of the imagination. Or with no teasing at all, why should the paintings not be of child- birth and nothing more? It would have been helpful to know how many furnaces there are in the demarcated smelting areas, to assess the pos- sibility of coincidence. The connexion between smelting furnaces and women is well established among Bantu smelters, but how is Mr. Cooke's Bushman artist, hiding himself behind his blade of grass, to know this- but one facet of a complex of beliefs-as un- obvious to the alien onlooker as were the sepa- rate existence of horse and rider to the painters of the Cape when confronted with horsemen for the first time? In my account' of smelting by Kaonde crafts- men, I raised the query as to why no representa- tion of smelting is known in rock art; the query still remains. Even if incomprehensible, there is no doubt that an able Bushman artist could have made a recognisable representation of a kiln, bellows' users and so on, rather than cloak his observation in an anthropomorphic form,. which, as far as we can tell from the surviving evidence would be alien to his mode of thought.
