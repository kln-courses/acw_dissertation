New York, D. Appleton &amp; Co., i896. - pp. viii, 527. Many of us had already read with deep interest Professor Sully's articles in the Popular Science Mon/lly and several English magazines on the subject of mental development in children. The present vol- ume is really a collection, comprising these articles, together with some valuable new material (particularly on children's drawings). The reader must therefore bear in mind, in the first place, that the book does not pretend to cover the whole field of child-psychology, but that it deals instead somewhat fully with a limited number of prominent topics; and, in the second place, that a considerable por- tion of the volume has been in print for a number of years in another form, and that the matter contained therein has thus become the common property of child-psychologists. This of course robs the work of the character of newness; and yet every student of childhood will be glad to have Professor Sully's work put into this convenient and permanent form; especially as the great bulk of the literature of this subject exists at present only in magazine articles and pamphlet reprints of these. A most commendable feature of the work is its cautious and con- servative tone, and its remarkable freedom from hasty generalizations. Over and over again, we find general statements ventured only hypo- thetically, and with the remark that " more observations are needed on this point." There can be little doubt that child-psychology has already suffered injury from the undue zeal of some of its friends, who hasten to the most sweeping generalizations on the scantiest data, and assume that all children " rigorously correspond to one pattern of which we have a perfect knowledge." This is to run into the very error which child study is intended to counteract. The principal defect of the psychology and pedagogy of the past was that they ignored individual differences, and subjected all children to the same mode of treatment. A chief reason for the cautious tone of Professor Sully's work lies, no doubt, in his keen appreciation of the diftcully of interpreting the facts observed. "The phenomena of a child's mental life, even on its physical and visible side, are of so subtle and fugitive a character that only a fine and quick observation is able to cope with them. But observation of children is never merely seeing. Even the smile has to be interpreted." And this very interpretation presents enormous difficulties. Let anyof those who speak of the child's mind as an open book, which one who runs may</page><page sequence="2">640 THEP 1IJ1L OSO/IICG/1L REVIE W. [VOL. V. read, sit down patiently before a little child, as Preyer has done, and let him undertake to tell us, not merely what sounds and movements the child made, physically and externally, but let him explain the mental state of which they are the 'outward and visible sign.' Before long he will probably come to Professor Sully's conclusion, that the child-observer needs to possess " a divining faculty, the offspring of child-love, perfected by scientific training." It is scarcely necessary to add that the book is written in a charming style, and that it fully sustains the author's reputation of being scholarly without being pedantic or dull. In chapter I, which is introductory, some general remarks are made on the characteristics of the infant mind, and on the present state of child study, showing how it has come to pass that " not merely to the perennial baby-worshipper, the mother, and not merely to the poet, touched with the mystery of far-off things, but to the grave man of science, the infant has become a centre of lively interest." That charming subject, the childish imagination, is treated in chapter II, and exemplified principally by the play and the story. Middle ground is taken between those who say that children are predominantly matter-of-fact, and those who speak of them as abound- ing in the play of fancy. The fact is, most children are both. They are " at once matter-of-fact observers and dreamers, passing from the one to the other as the mood takes them, and with a facility which grown-up people may well envy." Not only so, but there is a perio- dicity in most children's imaginativeness. Most children are for a time fancy-bound. Moreover, not all children are imaginative in the same way. Some live in a colored world, others in a world of sounds, others in a world of movements. The well-known tendency of the child-mind to personify inanimate nature is fully illustrated. Chil- dren's play, which arises out of the impulse to give outward embodi- ment to vivid and persistent images, is essentially "the acting of a part, and the realizing of a new situation"; not, however (as in the case of the actor), that others may be pleased, but purely in gratifi- cation of the child's own impulse. It is pointed out that only the human being in his play assumes other characters. The child assumes the ro'e of horse or cat, but the cat never assumes any other rose but that of cat. The intense activity of child-imagination is ascribed, on the physiological side, to the fact that the brain centres concerned in imagination have not as yet come to any great extent under the control of the higher thought centres, but remain under the sway of the senses.</page><page sequence="3">No. 6.j REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 64I In treating of the "dawn of reason " (chapter III), it is shown that the essential prerequisites of reason are observation, retention, and imagination. In observing, the child is apt to be spell-bound by some prominent feature, such as color, instead of grasping the object as a whole. The early reasoning of the child is dominated by a strong native impulse to connect and simplify, and by a " naive pre- possession of a regular, well-ordered world," which, " alas, finds itself confronted with an impenetrable tangle of disorder." This reminds us of Lotze's remark that metaphysic has its source in the apparent conflict of actual experience with our naive expectations regarding cosmic regularity and order. The child here shows him- self a metaphysician, as also in his interminable questionings in regard to the origin and purpose of things (the material and final causes of Aristotle). Children's thoughts about Nature, the Soul, and God (chapter IV) are dominated by the following impulses: to think of what is far off as like what is near (one form of which is the tendency to ascribe life, growth, and even " senile shrinkage," to inanimate as well as animate nature); to believe in the tangibility of all that is visible (the infant tries, for instance, to pick up sunbeams from the floor); to be specially interested in the sounds and movements of things; and to be anthropomorphic and anthropocentric in his ideas of the supernatural. In the development of language (chapter V), we have the familiar stages : (i) impulsive babblings, at first purely emotional, and then self-imitative and reduplicative ; (2) instinctive utterance, which is demonstrative or expressive, and quite spontaneous, as Preyer and others have also shown; (3) imitative (including the onomatopoetic) sounds, in which the child usually simplifies the sound heard, giving prominence to the accented syllable. " Such simplification of words is from the first opposed, and tends in time to be counteracted, by the growth of a feeling for their general form as determined by the number of syllables as well as the distribution of stress and any accompanying alterations of tone or pitch." Linguistic difficulties are avoided by means of omissions, substitutions, transpositions,' reduplications, and various other contrivances, familiar to the child- psychologist. Professor Sully seems to think that the variability of the order in which different children acquire the various sounds proves that the law of physiological ease is not followed. I must confess my inability to see the conclusiveness of this remark. If we once admit - what Professor Sully so strongly contends for -that children 1 I know a little girl who for a long time used to say " racksal " for " rascal."</page><page sequence="4">642 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. `V. differ widely from each other, then the order of acquisition of vocal sounds may be extremely various, and yet the line of least resistance may be followed in all cases. One child may find a certain sound difficult, and so acquire it late, while another may find it easy, and acquire it early. The mere fact of variation in order of acquisition certainly does not disprove the law of ease. In the account of the development of fear (chapter VI), its physi- ological groundwork in nervous shock is well explained. Sully thinks we do not require Darwin's hypothesis of heredity here, the bigness, strangeness, and unexpected movements of things being sufficient to account for the phenomena. He suspects that "fear of darkness takes its rise in a sensuous phenomenon, a kind of physical repug- nance." It has, perhaps, not yet been clearly shown that there is any fear of the dark as such, at all. Certainly Professor Sully's examples are not conclusive on this point; and, if one may speak from his own experience, the writer is quite sure that, though always a very timid child, he was never afraid of the darkness itself, but only of the monsters with which his childish imagination peopled it. The darkness itself, provided he could succeed in banishing these uncanny inhabitants, was a comfortable, soothing thing, of which he was quite fond, especially when tired. It is still an open question whether that 'reifying' of the darkness of which Mr. Sully speaks, is not really the same thing as that peopling of the darkness with rob- bers and tigers of which I have just spoken. Further investigation is needed on this point. Two of the most valuable chapters in the book are those on the child's moral nature, and his relation to authority (chapters VII and VIII). Here, as generally, the author avoids both the extremes of hasty theorizers. Refusing to accept either the doctrine that the child is essentially bad, or the opposite doctrine that he comes from the Creator's hand the ideal of virtue, he takes the position that in the infant there is no morality at all, but only its raw material in the shape of tendencies, some of which are pro-moral, and others contra- moral. "The infant, though it has a nature capable of becoming moral or immoral, is not as yet a moral being; and there is a certain impertinence in trying to force it under our categories of good and bad, pure and corrupt." It is not fair to call the little child a thief because he shows himself supremely indifferent to the distinction of meum and uurm, to put him down as wholly egotistic because of his boundless greed, or to describe him as a savage because of his vio- lent fits of passion. Indifferent to suffering he certainly is, but</page><page sequence="5">No. 6.] REVIEWS OF BOOAS. 643 only because he does not understand it. Children's cruelty to ani- mals is far from a mere delight in the sight of suffering, and has its source rather in the impulse to have, hold, possess, etc. It is shown by many examples that "generosity is as truly an impulse of child- hood as greediness " ; and that the so-called lies of children cannot, in many cases, be called lies at all in the strict sense. We must take the same view of the child's relation to authority. He is neither obedient nor disobedient by nature; but there are in him impulses in both directions. The very attempt to find excuses for his misdeeds is an evidence of a respect for law which, however, may consist pretty largely of " an innate disposition to follow precedent and rule, which precedes education," and which is " one of the forces to which education can appeal." The newest material in the book is to be found in the chapters on the art of childhood (IX and X). Art arises out of two impulses: the play impulse and the desire to please others. Art and play are therefore closely connected. In chapter X, we have the results of what has evidently been a very careful study of a large number of children's drawings, many of which are reproduced. Infantile draw- ing begins with a free, aimless swinging of the pencil to and fro, and then passes through the stage of "primitive design," in which the figure is largely symbolic, with very little attempt at exact rep- resentation, attaining finally to a more sophisticated treatment, in which, however, the child is apt to ignore perspective, and show both eyes in a profile, or make one's body visible through his clothing. The whole development shows a progress from bold symbolism to a naturalistic treatment (shall we say from idealism to realism?). Chapter XI is a record of an individual child, containing some very interesting illustrations of facts and principles discussed throughout the volume. Professor Sully's interpretations here are generally far- sighted and suggestive. The present writer has been very much impressed while reading this diary by the differences among children. The boy C, the subject of this chapter, is in most respects very much in advance of a little boy who came under the writer's own observa- tion, but in some particulars less precocious. The short chapter (XII) with which the book closes (the account of George Sand's childhood) is a gem which no one interested in children from any point of view can afford to miss. The account of her intensely vivid imagination, her original interpretations of religious ritual, and above all, her self-evolved religious system, with</page><page sequence="6">644 TH/E PHILOSOPHZICAL REVIEW [ [VOL. V. its temple and its god Corambe', constitutes the most interesting bit of child-literature with which the writer is acquainted. Those who are interested in that view of infant development which makes it a recapitulation of the growth of the species (the ontogenetic- phylogenetic parallel) will find many illustrations of the principle scattered throughout the volume. On the whole, it may be said that Professor Sully has given us the most readable, and one of the most valuable works on the psychology of childhood that have appeared in any language, - a distinct addition to the literature of this subject which will do much to gain for that line of study the appreciation which it deserves.
