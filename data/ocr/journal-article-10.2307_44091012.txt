<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ayyubid Jerusalem. The Holy City in Context 1187-1250 edited by Robert Hillenbrand and Sylvia Auld. 30 x 22,5; x-517 pp. London, Altajir Trust, 2009. - Hardback cased. ISBN 978-1-901435-06-1. With the publication of Ayyubid Jerusalem a forgotten period of Jerusalem's history reclaims its rights. The dynasty of Saladin ruled the Holy City for only 63 years, and to the visitor the traces they left are overshadowed by the spec- tacular building achievements of the bracketing Crusader and Mamluk periods. Edited by Robert Hillenbrand and Sylvia Auld, who also produced the mag- nificent Ottoman Jerusalem (RB, 2003, 142-45), Ayyubid Jerusalem does full justice to the historical, architectural, and artistic life of the city in the years 1 187-1250. The editors contribute two and three articles respectively. The other 21 studies are written by 19 scholars all eminent in their fields. The introduc- tory words of HRH Prince El Hassan bin Talal of Jordan glow with the ecu- menical spirit that is his trademark. Carole Hillenbrand provides an illuminating historical overview of the period, which is supplemented by biographies of the Ayyubid sultans by Don Richards. The latter also contributes an insightful article on Ibn Wasil (1208-98), the historian of the Ayyubids, with particular attention to the use and quality of his sources.

The majority, as might have been expected, commemorate the dedica- tion of religious buildings, but nearly 25% mark the construction or recon- struction of fortifications, an important subject to which the Arab chroniclers pay little or no attention. Other articles in this volume draw on this epi- graphic material for historical data and some system of cross-references would have been useful. The capture of Jerusalem was the climax of Saladin's career. The yearning that had gripped the Muslim world since the fall of the city to the Crusaders 88 years earlier gave way to an explosion of joy. He symbolically articulated the importance of the event by delaying his entry until 2 October 1187, the anni- versary of Muhammed's Night Journey. While he waited for the outcome of the siege, which began on 20 September, he must have reflected on how he would go about implementing his two priorities, the cleansing of the Haram al-Sharif and the re-islamicisation of a city crowded with Crusader monuments. His first concern naturally was for the Haram. Its purification took just a week. It was imperative that Saladin and his troops could pray there on the second Friday of the conquest. Imad al-Din al-Isfahani, Saladin's secretary and an eyewitness, describes how in that short time he removed all specifically Christian elements from the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aksa mosque, and dismandled the monastery of the Augustini√°n Canons north of the Dome of the Rock and most of the Templar structures east and west of the al-Aksa. How extensive these latter were is graphically illustrated by Sabri Jarrah from con- temporary sources. He suggests that it was for practical reasons that Saladin left four Templar structures in place, namely the hall of the Templars (now the women's mosque), the two Nijara vaults projecting east from the al-Aksa, and the three central bays of the porch. The last mentioned were rebuilt by al- Muazzam in 1217-18, and the dome over the middle bay is a textbook display of stoneworking virtuosity. Saladin embellished the al-Aksa mosque by installing the minbar , which his predecessor, Nur al-Din, had made for it in Aleppo (1 168-69) in anticipation of the Muslim conquest of Jerusalem. A glowing mosaic of complex patterns in wood, 'it had no rival in the whole of Islam' (Ibn al-Athir). Unfortunately it was destroyed in the fire of 1969. Nonetheless Sylvia Auld offers a fine study based on the remarkable photographs of Van Berchem and Creswell. The ven- eration in which the minbar is held is witnessed to by the fact that recently a recreation has been built and installed at great expense. Beside the minbar is the mihrab, which Saladin decorated with spectacular blue and white marble, which is studied by R. Hillenbrand in his article on the decorative aspects of the al-Aksa mosque. According to Ibn al-Athir, Saladin had the Aksa mosque "decorated with mosaics in the manner of Constanino- ple". Lorenz Korn interpretes this as meaning that there was no firmly rooted Muslim tradition of glass mosaic, and finds confirmation of Christian influence in the flowing tendrils of the glass mosaic of the hood of the niche, which apparently were inspired by Crusader book illumination. Positioned above the pointed arch is a glass mosaic inscription, which reads</page><page sequence="3">RECENSIONS 139 In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. The renovation of this hal- lowed mihrab and the restoration of the Aqsa mosque, founded on the fear of God, has ordered the slave and friend of God, Yusuf ibn Ayyub Abu'l Muzaffar al-Malik al-Nasir Salah al-Dunya w '1-Din, at the time when God conquered it through his hands in the months of the year 583. He prays to God that he may fill him with gra- titude for this benefaction and may grant him his share in mercy and grace. Korn notes that the title that Saladin here gives himself is far removed from the ornate political titles common in his insriptions and emphasizes the sultan's conviction of merely being an instrument in the hand of God, to whom should be given the credit for the recovery of Jerusalem. Korn also studies the one other Ayyubid glass mosaic in Jerusalem. It is the rarely noticed inscription on the cornice of a segmental section which separates the arcades from the mosaics in the drum of the Dome of the Rock. It provides no historical information, being a straightforward citation of the Sura Taha (20) 1-21, which is the story of Moses and the Burning Bush. Korn points out that the career of Moses prefigured that of Saladin, particularly in the move- ment from Egypt to the Holy Land, and that the inscription terminates with the words, "We will change it back to its former state", which must be understood as a reference to the Sakhra once again becoming a Muslim place of prayer. Auld is also responsible for the study of the wooden balustrade around the Sakhra. It is extraordinary that this is the first time that the 310 sq. m. of intri- cately carved woodwork has been studied closely. An inscription names the craftsmen and gives credit to al- Aziz, Saladin' s son who ruled Jerusalem 1 196- 99, but there is some doubt as to exactly how long it took to create the balus- trade. The structure clearly was dismantled and rebuilt at least once, and within the last century panels have been interchanged. The intriguing question of the relationship of the balustrade to the wrought iron grill of the Crusaders, which was in position by 1 150, is not resolved. Why should two surrounds be thought necessary? The issue is further complicated by the fact that Ibn Wasil reports that Saladin surrounded the rock with an iron grill. In my view, however, this should be set aside. Saladin had left the Crusader screen in position (it remained until 1963), but if it was thought that he had removed all Christian elements from the Dome of the Rock, Ibn Wasil had no option but to conclude that Sala- din was responsible for the screen. The basic catalogue of datable pieces, which constitutes the framework of Jonathan Bloom's "Woodwork in Syria, Palestine and Egypt during the 12th and 13th centuries", highlights a range of parallel material that supplements Auld' s detailed studies of the woodwork of the Dome of the Rock and the al- Aksa mosque. In addition to restoring what had always belonged to Islam, Saladin also had to re-islamicize Jerusalem by making it visibly a Muslim city. In order to understand the options open to him there are two very useful background arti- cles. A wide-ranging survey of Ayyubid architecture in Bilad al-Sham is pro- vided by Lorenz Korn, whereas Bernard O 'Kane focuses exclusively on Cairene buildings. Saladin opted for an unmistakable symbolic gesture. He took over two important Crusader buildings, one on each side of the city. He transformed</page><page sequence="4">140 REVUE BIBLIQUE the Church of St Anne into the Madrasa al-Salahiyya for Shafi'i jurists and the Palace of the Patriarch into the Khanqah al-Salahiyya, a residence for Sufis. Naturally both these edifices are included in Mahmoud Hawaii's overview of Ayyubid monuments in Jerusalem, but the treatment is poor. The description of the Khanqah is somewhat detailed, but there is no evidence of any original research. In particular the reprint of Schick's century-old plan is no substitute for a measured drawing. Virtually nothing is said about St Anne's, and one must have recourse to Pringle 's Crusader Churches. The failure to specify what changes Saladin felt constrained to make in the church is particularly disappointing. With respect to this building, figs 12.1, 12.2, and 12.14 are inac- curate. Michael Burgoyne, aided by the editors, provides the first measured draw- ings of the Qubbat al-Mir'aj, the Qubbat Sulaiman, and the Madrasa al-Nahaw- iyya in the Haram al-Sharif. His detailed discussion of their structure and pur- pose is greatly facilitated by comprehensive sets of photographs by Joe Rock, to whom many of the excellent photographs in this volume must be credited. The same three buildings are presented by Hawaii in his survey, but without a single cross-reference to Burgoyne 's much more thorough study. Hawaii terms his figs 12.6 and 12.7 'sketch plans' of the Madrasa al-Nahawiyya, but the scale provided shows them to have been measured! By whom? Hawaii attributes his plan of the Qubbat Sulaiman (fig. 12.48) to the Department of Islamc Archaeology. Obviously it is not the building measured by Burgoyne (fig. 8.4); the diameter is a metre less and the double columns are placed dif- ferently ! Hawaii quotes al-Aini (d. 1451) to the effect that "Saladin ordered that the church adjacent to the hospital near the the Church of the Resurrection be con- verted into a maristan or hospital to care for the ill and to teach medicine" (259b). His discussion, unfortunately, is inadequate. Not only does he ignore the obvious question of why Saladin did not take over the existing hospital, but he fails to identify the church in question; there were three in the vicinity of St John's hospital. Moreover, he makes no mention of the Arab hospital in Jerusalem singled out by Nasir-i Khusrau in 1047. The positive side of Hawaii's survey is its virtually comprehensive nature. He reports that some 40 Ayyubid buildings in and around Jerusalem are known, but that only 22 have survived. Fig. 12.1, however, does not adequately account for either figure, and there is no mention of the Suq al-Marifa 'Market of Knowledge' that is, of course, evoked by Burgoyne as a parallel to the Madrasa al-Nahawiyya. The 22 survivors are all religious buildings: 8 theological schools (madrasa/ zawiy a); 5 mosques (jami ); 3 commemorative domes (qub- bah)' 3 tombs, 2 mausolea (turba), one of which is outside the Old City, and one residence for Sufis (khanqah). As might have been expected, they are clus- tered in or around the Haram al-Sharif, where great concern was shown for the provision of drinking water and facilities for ablution. Repairs are evident in Bab al-Silsila/al-Sakina, Bab al-Atem, and Bab Hitta. In sum, therefore, the Ayyubids produced nothing to rival the Mamluks. Why not?

It was the wrong place and it was the wrong time, a time of alarums and excusions" (Robert Hillenbrand). It must not be forgotten that the Ayyubid occupation of Jerusalem was interrupted several times. For inter- nal Islamic political reasons the city was surrendered to the Crusaders, first in 1229-39 and then again in the winter of 1243-44. More importantly Jerusalem suffered two appalling tragedies. In 1219, to the horror of the Muslim world, al-Muazzam tore down the walls leaving the city defenseless and disgraced. The majority of the inhabitants left. Those who remained, particularly the Christians, perished when the city was sacked by the Khwarazmians in the summer of 1244. From the beginning of the 13th century they had been pushed ever further westward from the lower Oxus by the Mongols. Once invited into the Ayyubid sphere by princes desperate for allies in their internal quarrels, they proved to be uncontrollable. Their excesses in Jerusalem so shamed the Muslim world that the sultan of Egypt, Najm al-Din Ayyub, apologized in a formal letter to Pope Innocent IV. Given such dislocations, it is not surprising that virtually all the Ayyubid building in Jerusalem took place in the first thirty- two years of their rule. In order to take Jerusalem Saladin had to breach the north wall. Its repair became a high priority, and he got personally involved in the rebuilding during his visit in 1192-93. Work was also done on the walls around the NW corner and in the citadel, but the most important decision of the sultan was to extend the area of the city by incorporating Mount Sion within the walls. Epigraphic evidence indicates that al-Muazzam strengthened the Crusader southern wall from its south-west corner to the middle by a series of massive towers between 1202 and 1214. Yasser Tabbaa, who contributes the article on Ayyubid fortifi- cations, claims that al-Muazzam reversed Saladin' s southern extension around Mount Sion. This is a false inference from his principal source (to which he adds little or nothing), namely, G. J. Wightman's Walls of Jerusalem, where we find "The inclusion of massive towers in the earlier wall may have been prompted by the desire to secure control over the summit of Mount Sion out- side the walls without the expense of maintaining the longer defensive perim- eter". Strengthening of an inner ward, however, does not mean the abandon- ment of an outer one. One of the features of Ayyubid rebuilding of Jerusalem is the extensive reuse of Crusader elements (notably anthropomorphic and zoomorphic mate- rial) particularly in and around the Haram. Various explanations have been pro- posed - pragmatism, aesthetics, and the visual articulation of Muslim victory - and the issue is discussed in considerable detail in articles by Robert Hillen- brand and Finbar Barry Flood. The former seems to opt for symbolic trium- phalism, whereas the latter prefers to stress the inherent ambiguity of such reuse, insisting that it is a mistake to give priority to what an architectural ele- ment originally was; attention should focus on what it was seen to be, and that could vary considerably. Some articles that properly belong to the field of art history, notably those on woodwork by Auld and Floor, and on mosaics by Korn, have already been mentioned, because they belong to Jerusalem. One other focuses tightly on the</page><page sequence="6">142 REVUE BIBLIQUE Holy City, namely Milwright on the pottery found in excavations at Zion Gate, Damascus Gate and in the Armenian Garden; it was cheap, functional and pro- duced locally. To find material others are forced to range further afield, namely Auld on metalwork, Contadini on illustrated manuscripts, James on Qurans and calligraphers (his Appendix is printed twice), M√ºller-Wiener on science, art and technology. It is intriguing to read these articles in the light of Robert Hillenbrand's overview of Ayyubid art. Among other things he says, "The sheer extent of these possessions is in itself remarkable. But it also has signifi- cant ramifications in the visual arts, for it explains why they could comprise so many different, and indeed sometimes contradictory, strains and underlines how misguided it would be to think of 'Ayyubid art' as a single entity on the analogy, say, of Umayyad art.... There was no such thing as an international Ayyubid style.... The very notion of Ayyubid art is something of a chimera". In other words, the beautiful objects should be appreciated in and for them- selves without generalization. Once again the editors must be contratulated on a highly original and much needed contribution to our knowledge of a neglected period in the history of Jerusalem. It has been executed with exceptional care and skill. With one or two exceptions the articles are models of precise and uptodate scholarship. They are illustrated by a great number of photographs in both colour and black- and-white. The combination of broad overviews and tightly focused detail shots permits the reader to check and appreciate the authors' observations, and per- haps come to different conclusions. The high quality of the paper greatly enhances the clarity of the photographs. The publication of this volume rounds off a series, which does honour to the vision of those associated with the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem (now the Kenyon Institute). The study of the Mamluk architecture of Jerusalem was mooted over 40 years ago. What Burgoyne achieved (cf. RB, 1988, 452- 53) spawned further ambitious programs dealing with neglected fields, namely Crusader churches (cf. RB, 2008, pp. 635-36) and the architecture of the Ayyu- bid and Ottoman periods. Great persistence and generosity (in every sense) were indispensable for such a vast project to come to fruition. It would be ungracious to deny the editors their well-merited rest, but I cannot close with- out wondering if they might one day turn their attention to the Early Arab Period (638-1099), which cries out for treatment in the depth and quality dis- played in this volume.
