MUSICAL SYSTEMS: SOME PRELIMINARY REMARKS Here we enter the domain of "musical systems," the normal sub- ject matter of what is traditionally thought of as "music theory," though it is still "metatheory" relative to the "foreground" layers of theoretical discourse. It is at this stage that a point of divergence from maximum generality is reached by our music-structural system; the necessity of such a divergence arises as a direct consequence of the implementation of certain of our systematic objectives which, as the preceding section reveals, are mutually incompatible within a single system at a single functional level - in particular, the systematic incorporation of both content-determinacy and order-determinacy presents a difficulty of this nature. Further construction, moreover, awaits the explicit articulation of such syntax-building objectives as are essential for the conceptual guidance of our systematic formulations, if those formulations are to lead us to a system offering ranges and types of functions adequate to the construction of, say, "tonal" and "12-tone" syntactical models into which we could cleanly plug adequate analytic models of, respec- tively, the Schenker-tonal and Babbitt-"serial" types. Such syntax- building objectives are perhaps better represented as extrasystematic than as systematic notions," since they may be favorably viewed as concepts whose observable implementations are practically enabled by, rather than formally generated by, or generative of, the constructions under consideration. So, in connection with the elaboration of a notion of pitch centricity within a general modular pitch model into a particular reference collection (on the way to constructing a "tonal system"), it seems vital to have in hand, as a guiding "first principle," a well-analyzed concept of "polyphony" - one which, on investigation, appears to be itself explicable by way of a still deeper notion of "structural level."'1a n N. B., however, that the name of a notion introduced extrasystematically at some point may also serve as the name of a systematically defined predicate at some other, where such a definition is intended to correspond nontrivially to the intuitive sense of the notion. na The contention implicit here is, of course, substantive: if such a hierarchical relation and degree of significance can be demonstrably attributed to the notions of "polyphony" and "structural level," the demonstration would offer a striking indica- tion of the music-epistemic depth to which Schenker's strictly tonal-analytic notion of Schichte may be asserted to descend. * 232"</page><page sequence="2">MUSICAL SYNTAX (II) Then, "polyphony" itself may be regarded as an underlying basis for the explication of such other essential extrasystematic concepts as "simultaneity and succession," "rhythm," etc. The principal contention of what follows is that the notion of "struc- tural levels" is inferrable from any instance of (Western) music that we care to (and can find some way to) regard as "articulated" (to choose the weakest word that comes to mind) in more than a single sound attack-to-single sound attack sense. As soon as we speak of "this seg- ment" and suppose that we are speaking cognitively, we are neces- sarily invoking some "segment-isolating" characteristic that, for better or worse, entifies "segments" as complex individuals. The basis on which that identification is made for any given segment is also a basis on which it can be compared to other such individuals. And while we may easily construct an algorithmic instruction to generate such a passage or succession of passages as a whole, the purely formal con- tent of the algorithm might not incorporate anything from which the notion involved could be inferred as the "reason" for the construction of a particular succession of more-than-one-element "events." So the awareness of the extrasystematic notion (which, as noted, may else- where be systematic) that motivates the particular slicing of the ele- ment-stream is indispensable to confer structural significance on the results of applying the algorithm (especially since there is an unlimited number of algorithms capable of generating the same successions, however extended, and, presumably, equally no limit on the number of possible motivating notions). 4. STRUCTURAL LEVELS The construction of "structural levels" in music consists of making inferences of relations on a more than "one element-one element" scale, which thus groups sets of pitches (however minimally) so that "larger-scale" complex-unit ("thing") structures are assertible as well as a unit-to-unit structure. The interdependence of any two such structures generated for a given composition is, of course, not en- tailed or determined by this construction, but it is taken as a norma- tive objective of explanation (and hence, presumably of composition) to maximize the degree of interrelation that may be asserted to obtain among them. (The latter, in fact, seems to be one of the principal criteria for the adjudication among "ways of hearing" a given local relational structure when several ways may, on local evidence alone, appear to be equally supported experientially; moreover, it may also reasonably be regarded as a criterion for preferring, at any single "place" or local complex, an interpretation which would be, were that "place" the field of a "global structure," "far-fetched" or S233</page><page sequence="3">PERSPECTIVES OF NEW MUSIC less desirable than some other, as, for example, choosing an interpre- tation more elaborate or remotely inferred than some other because of the preference for some "global" explanation of which the former is a consistent part.) Example: Let us consider only macrorelations that are assertible "premetri- cally," i.e., before the placing of elements in a linear (higher than- lower than) array, thus using only pitch identity and interval iden- tity decidability as determinants of relatedness. Then, from an element-string (a b c a b c) where a 0 b 0 c which symbolizes a "unit structure," there may be inferred the "com- plex-unit structure" ((a b c)/(a b c)), which corresponds, where A = (a b c), to (A A), and to the (possible) "syntactical unit" (A). The basis for such a slicing of the succession, and for the identification of the names of its two subsets, is an extrasystematic notion of "repetition," whose status as a quite fundamental structural-level-creating notion corresponds to its operationality at such a minimally specified level of pitch-functional interpretation (as compared, say, with "transposi- tion"). But the conversion of this "intuitive" notion into a "systematic" definition, as a two-place predicate of the form "B is a repetition of A," might take several forms, depending on syntactical objectives or de- sired analytic range or the emphasis within the intuitive notion that is desired to be captured. Here is one possibility: Rep(B, A) - Va[(a E A V a E B D P(a)) A (a E A D A b(b e B A (a - b) A T(a) &lt; T(b) A Vc (c A) a d((c - d) A d E B A (T(a) &lt; T (c) - T (b) &lt; T (d)))))] "B is a repetition of A if B and A are sets of pitch elements, and if, for every pitch element in A, there is an equivalent pitch element in B, and if all the elements of A precede all the elements of B in time-posi- tion, and if all elements that precede any elements in A also precede them in B." The latter condition preserves one-to-one identity map- pings in terms of order position without invoking order-metric inter- pretations. The definition makes repetition irreflexive, asymmetric, and transitive, so that the time-dependency of repetition is incor- porated, which seems to me to preserve the essential feature that distinguishes it from simple identity, or equivalence, so that nothing is a repetition of itself or of something that follows it. Note, too, that this definition is not formulated as an "effective procedure" that could dig out of a string of tokens "the fact that" it contained subsets relatable as "repetitions." The reasons that such a S234</page><page sequence="4">MUSICAL SYNTAX (II) procedure does not seem preferable are, first, a basic doubt about the explanatory value of procedures that "create" relationships and ar- ticulations rather than providing a basis for defining, comparing, and ordering those articulations one chooses to adopt. And second, it would seem in any case that such effective procedures could operate only trivially without a multitude of conjoined boundary conditions involving syntactic definitions of a much higher order than any avail- able at this stage of definition. Finally, the question of which "things" assertible as "repetitions" (of what dimension, within what other syntactical boundaries, etc.) might be significant at a deep level and which at a relatively shallow level would require other analytic deci- sions as well.11b I have focused attention on a relatively simple example to show, 11b An alternative reading for "repetition" might be a definition that still further generalizes the "order" aspect from a specifically time-dependent one, to an "ordering in some dimension" one: Rep, (B, A) = Va[(a E A) D (P(a) A 3b ((be B) A (a - b) A T(a) &lt; T(b) A ((A= {ao, a1,..., an}) A (B= {bo, bi,..., bm}) D m=n A (a=aj D b = bj))))] Or, the definition might be generalized to specify only pitch-content, rather than also pitch-order, invariance: Rep2 (B, A) ~ Va((a E A) V (a EB) D P(a) A (aA D b(b E B A a - b) A T(a) &lt; T(b)))) This simply equates "repetition" with transposition by 0," or the "identity" transposi- tion operation on pitch sets, and perhaps the distinction between the two is worth preserving. On the other hand, the definition might be strengthened to require duration- contour equivalence as well as pitch-succession equivalence: Rep3 (B, A) = Va {(aEA VaEB D P(a)) AaeA D Ab(b EB A (a - b) A T(a) &lt; T(b) A (A= (ao, a ...., a,} A B = {bo, b ..., bmn} D m= n A (a=aj D b=bj) AV c(c E A A (A = aj A i &lt; j A3d(d E B A T(b) = r A T(d) = s A T(c)'=t A T(a) = uD (r - s) = (u - t)))))))} But this perhaps overspecifies the conditions normally presupposed by the notion of "repetition" since it is often advantageous to regard some passage as an "ordered pitch set repetition" of some other, preserving pitch order but not necessarily dura- tional contour (in fact, this seems one of the more nontrivial applications of the repeti- tion notion). Thus it might seem best to leave the definition "open" to allow pitch successions and duration-contour successions to be compared independently, so that one could always specify a repetition in either occurring in conjunction with a non- repetition in the other. Note, too, that given the two primitive relations of pitch and interval identity, a range of macrorelations is assertible beyond "complex" identity, e.g., interval-content identity: (a,b) E A D 3 c 3 d ((c, d) E B A ((a R b) - (c R d))); degree of pitch- (or in- terval-) content similitude: Given (a b c), (a b d), if A = (a b c) and B = (a b d), then A l B = (a b) (or if degree of pitch-intersectional similitude [where "X and Y have a degree of pitch-intersectional similitude equal to n" is reflexive, symmetrical, and transitive] = number of pitch elements intersecting/([dimension of set Ao + dimension of A, +... + dimepsion of Ak]/k), then "The degree of similitude of A and B" is 2/3). But prequantizationally, no functions except identity can be asserted to map elements of A into B. S235</page><page sequence="5">PERSPECTIVES OF NEW MUSIC first, how even at a very primitive systematic level basic "analytic" notions can be accounted for, by definitions restricted to terms de- fined in the primitive basis of the system, and also to show, within an area limited enough so that a relatively exhaustive investigation is practical, how extrasystematic notions such as we are concerned with here are continuously interconnected with the "systematic" definition chain, acting in many cases as criteria for priorities of definition and choices of primitives (see also the notes on content-centricity and order-determinacy, above). Also I have wished to indicate how funda- mental to our "normal" music-conceptual scheme the notion of "structural level" is, and how misguided are attempts to equate it with Schenker-type analyses instead of recognizing in Schenkerian thought an effort to impose orderings in terms of such a general, "musical," notion up to the level of its particular applicability to particular, "tonal," contexts. On the other hand, this characterization of "structural levels" as interrelated "slicings of the data" may seem counterintuitive to Schenker-oriented readers accustomed to thinking of more back- ground levels as "containing" fewer entities than are contained in more foreground levels, such that the larger numbers of entities at more foreground levels are derived by compositional elaboration. In fact, the Schenkerian notion is not denied but explicated by my charac- terization; for the notion here is just that the "levels" constitute - each individual level as well as all the levels collectively - a model of (all) the distinguishable data of the composition, such that each level specifies a particular degree of (and kind of) determinacy for that data. Such deter- minacy does in fact proceed from the "most background" (least de- terminate) stage, where the entire data-array is regarded as "a single entity"-an entity which "contains" all the discernible data of the actual array in question but determines them only to the degree that a relatively large number of other arrays might equally constitute an instance of that entity. And at the "most foreground" (most deter- minate) stage, the entities individually specified and thus accounted for include "all possible things" discernible in the array (i.e., "things" each consisting of one atomic element [pitch], having no distinguish- able proper parts): each discernible datum may, in fact, be ac- counted for more than once in this "structural foreground," which could thus possibly include more entities than there are distinguish- able data. So the "Schenker graph" or any other structural-level- notational model is meaningful insofar as it is regarded at every stage as laid against the data, as a model of a particular (and presumably significative) determinate thing-stage with respect to that data. Such a S236</page><page sequence="6">MUSICAL SYNTAX (II) graph, moreover, is extrasystematically regardable as symbolizing a data-generative stage (i.e., of composition) as well. Thus both "the back- ground" and "the foreground" are just relatively determinate ways of hearing "the piece." And so there is no discernible sense to the dichot- omy asserted by some theorists between "going from the background to the foreground" and the reverse procedure as a way of hearing, describing, or understanding a piece; the assertion of such a dichot- omy must be predicated upon the notion that only "the foreground" accounts for all the data, and that "the background" somehow "re- duces" the piece to some tiny subset of the data, a notion which seems to result from the confusion of a model with the entity it models. In my reconstruction, "structural levels" are regarded as an ordered "nest" from the "most background" (Oth) level to the "most fore- ground" (nth) level. All stages at which "the piece" is regarded as an assertion of "a single entity" are "syntactical" stages (symbolized as various "p-stages" distinguished by subscripts to 9); for a content-de- terminate piece, the 00th level is determined by the degree of content- determinacy assertible for the piece-for a tonal piece, it would be represented by a single pitch (class). Subsequent "syntactical" stages include those where "the piece" is regarded as instantiating "a con- struct" (e.g., "the tonic triad"). The maximal "syntactical stage" is that where the piece as a whole is regarded as instantiating (once) the ref- erential collection. Thus the "I th" stage is just the first stage at which succession (of normatively partitioned reference collections or of con- structs within a collection) is asserted (determined). This successional or ordering characteristic may be regarded as distinguishing the "Ith" and all higher-numbered stages as "structural" rather than "syntacti- cal" levels. The "nth" stage is minimally one at which every distinguish- able datum (or every "atomic element" as defined by the complexity [dimension] of the entity represented at the 00th stage) is accounted for individually as at least one entity. This, then, constitutes a "fore- ground" concept which actually suggests the possibility of proceeding further "upward" from the minimally assertible foreground-which makes the notion that the "arrival at" or "departure from" the nota- tional foreground represents some "ultimate" and thus universally dependable index to "what's there" seem particularly impoverished musically. For as we have noted, the "foreground" of "distinguishable data" may not only fail to account for all the entities in the eventual "structural" foreground, it may also contain (in a less than monadically determinate piece) more entities than the "structural foreground" does. In the latter case, maintaining the requirement of "arrival at" the distinguishable-data foreground as a criterion for the conferral of S237</page><page sequence="7">PERSPECTIVES OF NEW MUSIC "analytic cognitivity" on a structural model would result in the exclu- sion from the literature of "music" of any piece falling within the class of less than monadically determinate pieces.12 It should be clear from the foregoing that my notion of structural levels entails representation, for every level, in three interdependent notational models: 1) the distinguishable data as partitioned into "things"; 2) the symbolic notation of the "things" occasioning that partitioning (i.e., notation specifying just the determinate aspects of the "thingness" in question); and 3) a commentary explicating the relation-concept to be understood as generating each partitioning. "out of" the preceding level. At the 0-01, stages, the assertible relations among distinguishable components of "the thing" are as elements within the thing, in terms of such observables as relative order position and the identity or nonidentity of each component with the determi- nate (referential) entity that all the components are collectively being presumed to "represent." Non-referential elements at any given syn- tactical stage are determinately non-referential for the piece if they are referential at any subsequent syntactical stage (but they are in no case systematically determinate within any syntactical stage where they are non-referential). Thus, at the "0oth" level of a tonal piece, every dis- tinguishable pitch datum of "the piece" is simply either "the tonic pitch" or "not the tonic pitch"-the only other relation (omitting for brevity the pitch/pitch-class distinction) being relative attack position within the boundaries of "the piece" (as, "adjacent to," "three attack positions subsequent from," "simultaneous with," etc.). At the "01th" level, the identification might be in terms of "the tonic fifth" (so that at this level, "the tonic" would be indifferently "major" or "minor," since "the third" is at this stage not yet a determinate element). At the "02th" level, "the tonic triad" determines "the piece" (thus also determining the "major" or "minor" character of the piece by fixing the "referential third"). And at the "02bth" level, the "diatonic collec- tion" is what "the piece" represents. Since all subsequent levels model 12 I believe, too, that the "model-entity" confusion is also the reason that Michael Kassler's representation of each Schenker-level graph as "a piece" has been misunder- stood (e.g., by Eric Regener). Such a graph is indeed not "the piece" insofar as each single "entity" of each pre-foreground-level model is interpreted in "the piece" by a complex entity (whether or not the components of the complex are entifi ed in "more foreground" structural levels). But to be comprehensible as a "stage of geineration" of "the piece," each "structural level" must itself be a possible one-to-one model of "a piece" (i.e., must itself be something potentially regardable as a notation of "a piece"), for a suecession of "structural levels" explicates "the piece" just by invoking all the same determining referents for succession and simultaneity for every "level." Hence there is no way internal to the characteristics of the structural-level array to distinguish the "arrival at" the foreground from any other relation of adjacent levels; such an "arrival" can only be determined as such by reference to the "actual" foreground of a particular piece. . 238-</page><page sequence="8">MUSICAL SYNTAX (II) the piece as succession they may be considered "structural" rather than "syntactic" levels. (Thus, at the "Ith" level, successions are of instances of the reference construct - the triad - within the reference collection. This is a pre-Ursatz level; the Ursatz itself is describable as repre- senting "the basic succession" as well as "the basic structure" of "the basic composition," since "structure" in [most] music is successional structure. At more foreground levels, the successions represented are of instances of the reference collection as internally partitioned by the basic triad-successional model.) And the relations that each "struc- tural" level uniquely adds to the "within-things" relations defined at the "syntactic" levels are new "between-things" relations. Thus all temporally "adjacent" elements at any 0-type level are related simply as "adjacencies within 'the piece'" (although they may be distinguished as determinate [referential, defined] or indeterminate [non-refer- ential, undefined] pitch elements). But the assertion of succession cre- ates a new situation (superimposed on, not superseding, the more back- ground situation) in which some adjacencies are within and some are between the new sub-things created by the partitioning slices deter- mined at that level.12a Here is an example of a simple tonal piece, illustrating how the "slicing" and the "generating" are mutually representable as effec- tively constituting the same "structural level"-making activity: Let us begin with a "minimally elaborated" "tonal" composition: EFEDC CCCBG GAGGE CF CGC 12a Thus structural levels, as determinate slices of particular stretches of a given acoustical foreground, determine the rhythmic structure of a composition in every rele- vant sense of the notion. For spans are of certain time extents, creating specific duration contours at every layer. And the "accentual" question in rhythmic structure is answered by the relative backgroundness attributed to a span: since every span- boundary that appears at a given level is repeated in every more foreground level, "backgroundness" is obviously a direct index of "degree of articulation" represented by a given span-boundary, understood as the "divider" between the last attack of a span and the first attack of the next succeeding span. Thus the "strength" of the "division" inferred between successive attacks (the degree to which they are heard as "attached to" or "separated from" one another) is indexed by the number of dif- ferent-leveled span-boundary crossings which that succession represents. (Obviously, by intensive elaboration, a single attack may embody a span-boundary crossing, inso- far as that single attack is understood as a concatenation of (at least) the last attack of one span with the first attack of its successor.) The functional contents attributed to the spans of a structure (e.g., the expression of a triad) are, then, the motivating rationale for distinguishing just those particular spans, and for distributing them in a particular way in hierarchically relative layers; such distinctions and distributions represent a crucial determination by analysis of the rhythmic identity of the composition involved. . 239-</page><page sequence="9">PERSPECTIVES OF NEW MUSIC At the highest "0" level, this composition is representable as "the ref- erence collection"; Level Partition Array Generation Array Commentary13 I.

And at levels 0o-02b the rela- tion E-F is one of "adjacencies within the piece"; at the 0o and 01 stages it is also a relation of two "non-referential elements." At 01a the relation is that of a "reference element" (E) and a "non-reference ele- ment" (F), and at 02a and 02b it is that of "two reference elements," * 241 ?</page><page sequence="11">PERSPECTIVES OF NEW MUSIC at 2 it is "2 elements within a sub-thing," at 3 it is "an element (E) of a sub-thing and an element (F) of the adjacent subsequent sub-thing (i.e., an element each of two adjacent members of the succession). At 4 they are adjacent pitch-class things (here there are 3 different entities accounted for with respect to each simultaneity). And at 5 they are adjacent pitch entities (accounting for their registral relation, and thus distinguishing 4 distinct entities per simultaneity). Other extrasystematic (but potentially definable) properties in- ferrable within the immediate range of "structural levels" are such generalities as "size" (relative dimension of articulated sets), "contour" (size- and direction-patterns, more or less precisely determined by interval measurement or merely by "higher than-lower than" com- parisons), "span" (highest-lowest pitch-interval comparison, including highest-lowest pitch identity or "overlap"), etc. While the notion of "structural level" does not account for that of "polyphony," the latter is very strongly determined in terms of the former, as a special interpretation of it, as shall be seen below. But first, it is perhaps worthwhile to note that the "structural level" idea and its range of associated notions is, if not surely sufficient, at least necessary for any analysis of music which is to be considered "pre"- or "non"-polyphonic; and this also indicates the strength of the asserti- ble link between polyphonic music and its non-polyphonic predeces- sors, which might otherwise appear as one of those unbridged dis- junctions too frequent in music-historical discourse. As we shall see, the idea of "reference set," fundamental to even a primitive attempt to attribute coherence to any music, is a vital conceptual link between the two "kinds" of music. Thus, many remarks of Treitler in [34] (pp. 81-85), invoking numbers of undefined "macrorelational" terms, could be subsumed under a group of simple "referential set" defini- tions that would eliminate the difficulties occasioned by synesthetic transference of notions like "antecedent-consequent" (which here seems to mean only "comes before/comes after"), "phrase," "open- closed," "dominant-tonic," "cadences," etc. And a basic methodolog- ical problem here, as in some recent writings of Leonard Meyer, is the belief that analysis answers the question whether there is a syntax as well as what the syntax is. That the first of these is an empty question (the answer to which is always trivially "yes," because every "thing" "has a form") should already be evident from Meta-Variations, Part I. As to the second, its answer is, also trivially, "anything," since, as the present chapter demonstrates, syntaxes are universal collections of functions able to account for any actual musical events whatever. S242</page><page sequence="12">MUSICAL SYNTAX (II) 5. POLYPHONY "A path (p) through the data (of S)" may be defined as follows: if p is an ordered subset (proper or improper) of an ordered set S such that for any elements x and y in p where x precedes y, there are ele- ments z and t in S such that z is equivalent to x and t is equivalent to y and z precedes t, then p is a path through the data of S (and may be iden- tical with S). In such a path, every element is regarded as being dis- placed by its immediate successor. Where the union of the members of a set P of paths (po, pi, . . , pn) through the data of a given S exhausts the elements of S, then P is a structural-level partitioning of S. And if no element x in any member pi of P is displaced by an element y which does not also displace it in S, then P is a monophonic structural-level par- titioning of S. If, however, there is at least one element z in any mem- ber pj of P such that z is displaced by an element t in S, but such that t does not also displace z in pj, and t is not a member of pj, and there is a member m of pj such that m is a (immediate or nonimmediate) suc- cessor of t in S, then P is a polyphonic structural-level partitioning of S. In the latter case, too, z and t are defined as determining a simultaneity in S (regardless of their presented simultaneity or nonsimultaneity), so that t is a temporal displacement but not a [P-level] structural displacement of z. If Pa is an ordered subset of P such that for every member pk of Pa that contains an element q such that q precedes in S an element r of any other member pi of Pa, and there is no element s contained in pk such that s is preceded in S by r; and if Pb is another such subset of P then, if the members of Pa and Pb are (as they have been defined as being) paths through the data of S, then Pa and Pb are also paths through the data of S. And if at least one element of Pa precedes in S at least one element of Pb, and at least one element of Pb precedes at least one element of Pa, and no member of P is not a member of Pa or Pb (or of both), then Pa and Pb are polyphonic voices of S. If Qis the set containing Pa and Pb, then Q is a two-voice polyphonic structural-level partitioning of S. Thus polyphony is most generally describable as the notion that multiple relational paths may be inferred from pitch successions by the isolation and association of pitch elements into inferred "succes- sions" by criteria independent of presented temporal adjacency. Such "successions" are considered to associate such elements both within and between sets inferrable on "structural-level"-type grounds alone so that the entire pitch-adjacency-successional "map" is accounted for (most often, multiply accounted for) by conjunctions of "lines" vary- S243</page><page sequence="13">PERSPECTIVES OF NEW MUSIC ing, by virtue of their temporal independence, simultaneously over the total temporal extent of the array, and (although the rationale involved is not a precondition for the notion to be applicable) interdependently, in terms of determined pitch-relational constructs. These constructsl3a may be construed as partitionings of the pitch domain into mutually de- terminate sets whose union totally determines the primary reference sets of the structurel3b involved (which might be the same as those which, on other grounds, had also been inferrable as such at the "structural-level" stage). Example: From the succession A Bb C D Eb C F Bb may be inferred the 2-voice "polyphony" A C F Bb D Eb C Bb which contains the "simultaneities" (A, Bb), (Bb, C), (C, D), (C, Eb), (C, C), (F, C), (F, Bb). From the same succession there may also be inferred the 2-voice "polyphony" A D CF Bb C Eb Bb with the "simultaneities" (A, Bb), (A, C), (C, D), (D, Eb), (Eb, C), (Eb, F), (F, Bb), or the 3-voice "polyphony" A C Bb Bb Eb CD F with the "simultaneities" (A, Bb, C), (A, Bb, D), (A, Eb, D), (C, Eb, D), (C, Eb, F), (Bb, Eb, F) or the 4-voice "polyphony" A C Bb F C Bb D Eb with the "simultaneities" (A, Bb, C, D), (A, Bb, C, Eb), (C, Bb, C, Eb), (C, F, C, Eb), (C, F, Bb, Eb) or the 4-voice "polyphony" 13a In tonal music, the triad. 13b In tonal music, the diatonic collection. . 244 -</page><page sequence="14">MUSICAL SYNTAX (II) A CD CF Bb C Bb A D Eb C Bb Bb Eb F Bb with the "simultaneities" (A, A, Bb, Bb), (C, C, A, Bb), (D, C, D, Bb), (D, C, Eb, Eb), (C,, C C, Eb), (F, C, C, F), (F, C, Bb, Bb), (F, Bb, Bb, Bb), etc., etc.-as the last example indicates, the "possible" distinct poly- phonies are infinite, and any of them "can" be inferred as polyphonies "at will" without necessarily involving any "music-syntactical" or "structural" rationales. The partitionings so determined define, for any two (adjacent or simultaneous) pitches, whether the relation they present represents a relation between two pitches within a partitioning construct, or one between two pitches between such constructs, or both. In a content- determinate system, where significant relations are defined as "con- tent comparisons" of discrete pitch sets, and where, therefore, par- ticular orders of pitch-to-pitch succession are not referential at the primary syntactical level, these partitioning constructs may be con- sidered to define "pitch-voice regions" within the pitch domain, in which the elements of the "referential construct" itself are considered the interdependently principal referents for their "regions" - hence, their association as presented conjunctions (whether literally simul- taneous in presentation or not is beside the point) is considered "normative" in defining a "simultaneous" conjunction within which each "voice" is represented by its principal referential pitch class (the relevant member of the referential construct). In this sense, such a partitioning may be considered to assert a "model for simultaneity" (where "simultaneity," again, is understood as "inferred temporal overlap of distinct pitch-voice elements," i.e., the totality at every "moment" of "non-displaced" [or not structurally suppressed] pitches in all voices)-or plurally, as "models for simultaneity," if the par- titioning constructs taken as normative are non-isomorphic with one another. (This latter condition, however, if a criterion of maximally unique distinctness of "interpretation" on a given level is invoked, would seem to be decidedly disadvantageous.) Thus would be defined "intervals of simultaneity" (those occurring within constructs, hence always "between voices"), and "intervals of succession" (those occur- ring only between constructs, either within or between voices-for a stronger specification, see "Linearity and Adjacency," below). Under this definition, the assertion as a presented simultaneity of two pitches in a defined relation of succession constitutes a situation in which the locally referential construct is inferred to be either one to . 245-</page><page sequence="15">PERSPECTIVES OF NEW MUSIC which one of the two pitches belongs, or one to which the other does; this requires an amount of inference at any given level greater than that required at the same level where the presented simultaneity is among pitches all construable as belonging to the same local-referen- tial construct.14 This "resolution-requiring" situation (the resolution required being inferential, not in any necessary sense an actual presented simultaneity or displacement) is the functional-and the only neces- sary syntactic - meaning of "dissonance," and the local indicators of which pitch of a non-referential simultaneity is to be taken as "refer- ential" for the totality (or for the "others," if one prefers) is the essen- tial meaning of "resolution" (and whether the "backward" or the "forward" resolution is at a higher structural level is a significant con- sideration for time ["rhythmic"] structure - see Komar [21]). "Con- sonance," of course, simply designates the simultaneous presentation of elements in a syntactically defined relation of simultaneity. Where no such simultaneity-succession distinction is operative, the "disso- nance-consonance-resolution" complex of (interrelated) notions is equally inapplicable. And in any case, such syntactical determinants are completely detachable from any particular sonic interpretation, so that no "sound" is a priori dissonant-even in a system where disso- nance is a relevant predicate -but this is not merely to say that such a sound might in fact be "consonant," but also that the very determina- tion of whether the notions are applicable precedes the further deter- mination of the consonant-dissonant status of any given "sound."14a 14 This "greater amount of inference" arises from the condition that any such simul- taneous presentation of succession-related pitches results from an "intensive" elabora- tion of a preceding, "extensive" elaboration in which both simultaneities "implied" by the presented event appear as a succession. Thus a "more background" level may have more entities than a "more foreground" level generated out of it by intensive elaboration. So, for example, one might expect to find pre-foreground levels of Brahms's Op. 116, No. 3 (g minor) containing a considerably greater number of distinguishable (attack- specified) "events" than are represented in the "notational" foreground. 14a And it might be added that no sound is a priori consonant either, though it might be "prima facie consonant" by virtue of not being excluded as potentially representative of a single reference simultaneity. Thus the chord (C E G) is not prima facie excluded from representing a single triad, and hence from being regarded as consonant, but, in a given context, it might in fact be regarded as representing a simultaneous conjunc- tion of, say, the C, the E, and the G triads, in which case it would be dissonant. This explains the 4-chord question-and, in general, the question of the "perfect fourth" as sometimes a consonant, sometimes a dissonant, interval. For the case is that wherever the two elements of a perfect fourth are taken to represent the same triad, the sounded interval is consonant; but wherever they are taken to represent distinct triads, the 6 sounded interval is dissonant. Thus, since the bass of the 4 is frequently taken to S6,, represent the triad of which it is root (say, V, in the case of a so-called "14) but the 4bt h ? 246 -</page><page sequence="16">MUSICAL SYNTAX (II) Moreover, the "areas" defined by the "simultaneity model" may be further functionally hierarchized as well, though not necessarily, in a manner corresponding to the extrasystematic notion of pitch-(class) centricity (deriving a referential construct from a referential collection already confers "construct-centricity" on a syntax already collection- centrically determined by virtue of "structural-level" inference alone), which enables the hierarchical ordering of the individual pitches in the referential construct. This accounts in part for the relation of the tonic triad to the Schenker Urlinien, which are models for "resolving" the secondary pitch-voice areas defined by the tonic triad "into" the primary pitch-voice area. That these are in particular "linear" models requires further extrasystematic considerations, in particular that of "linearity" (q. v.). In summary: note that in a content-determined system the "mean- ing" of a given succession is defined solely with respect to the total interval content of the referential construct; "succession" is defined in terms of the constructs as "relations holding between but not within constructs." Actual simultaneity is only an explicit realization of the concept of simultaneously varying "voices," which by containing pitches that are inferred to "hang over" (remain undisplaced by) in- tervening pitches in the "other voices" imply simultaneity as an aspect of the structure even where it is not literally present. Now in an order-generated system, the partitioning constructs exhaust the pitch domain (as we have seen), which renders inoperative the notion of "voice areas" defined for content systems (see n. 18, pp. 252-53, below). What, then, do these partitionings define? Of course, they constitute "content groups" in themselves, as proper subsets of the "universal pitch vocabulary," but they cannot be asserted as "pitch-voice-area"-defining "constructs of simultaneity," as just noted. What they determine, then, are defined relations of precedence and subsequence, distinguishable as such from any presented prece- dences or subsequences. Thus with respect to any presented simul- taneity, it is determinable whether any interval it contains represents an interval of immediate or of nonimmediate succession (as well as, if other two pitches are regarded as components of a distinct triad (the I) which has been generated linearly as a subsidiary elaboration of the locally referential triad 6 (the V), the whole 4 is - in such a case - dissonant, since it is heard as representing the superposition of two distinct triads (V and I). But since the intervals it contains are all 6 compatible with a single-triad interpretation, the "dissonance" of such a 4 is imposed entirely by contextual preference, and a "consonant" interpretation is in no way sys- tematically counterentailed. . 247-</page><page sequence="17">PERSPECTIVES OF NEW MUSIC nonimmediate, what order interval it represents under any given possi- ble interpretation). This determination might, for example, contrib- ute in turn to a determination of whether a presented succession (either including or not including simultaneities) represents a "single- set" or "multiple (distinct)-set" unfolding. Here, if the inference is "multiple set unfolding," the inferred partitioning would be of the total pitch domain, multiply exhausted by as many unit-strings as there are inferred sets unfolding, each of which constitutes a "total" set, however related (relatable) to the others. But the "immediate-nonimmediate" distinction may also enable an inference of "referential sub-construct partitionings" of the pitch domain as the generators of the total referential set. (The plural is used to allow for the possibility of different such partitionings being opera- tive at different structural levels.) Here, any interval may be defined as obtaining between pitches in a defined adjacency-relation within a construct (or several), as a non-adjacency, within-construct relation, or as a "between-construct" relation, of adjacency (last-first), or non-ad- jacency (in local structure "adjacency-between-constructs" may not be determinable without invoking macrostructural considerations). Now the dimensions of such partitioning constructs determine the number of structural voices (always at a particular level of structure - the urgency of this stricture should be obvious to anyone familiar with complexly aggregate-forming 12-tone music). Thus, an array such as (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11)15 is a 6 x 2 partitioning, so that two "structural voices" are implied, and the only "harmonic" criteria asserted are the distinctions of relations "within the 6s" and those "between the 6s." The "structural level" stric- ture applies to cases like the following: (0 1 2 3 4 5) (6 7 8 9 10 11) (5 4 3 2 1 0) (11 10 9 8 7 6) where at one level a 6 x 2 partitioning is still inferrable where (0 1 2 3 4 5) and (5 4 3 2 1 0) belong to the same "structural voice"); but a 3 x 4 partitioning is also inferrable, in which it is no longer "immaterial" whether (0 1 2) and (5 4 3) "appear" in the "same har- monic association," as it is in an inference at a purely hexachordal- partitioning level. 15 Independent of ordering; the convention employed here (to avoid the encum- brance of order-number/pitch-number couple specification in every case where left-to- rightness can substitute for the former) is that unordered sets are 'inscribed with inter- vening commas between element-inscriptions, and ordered sets are inscribed with blanks only intervening between element inscriptions. ? 248 -</page><page sequence="18">MUSICAL SYNTAX (II) Thus here, "structural voices" consist of determinate interval-con- tents within the partition-dimensional limit. (Obviously, the degree of "ordering" determines the dimension of the "smallest possible infer- rable partitioning unit" interlocked in any "textural counterpoint.") This suggests a link between descriptions of order-determinate and content-determinate structures in terms of patterns of "within-be- tween" relations, with interpretations as order or content unspecified (see Part IV). But the "within-a-voice" criteria that are regarded as assertible for the two types of polyphony in the section following this seem to me to indicate that the usual equation of pitch-class adjacency with "voice"-connection, transferred from tonal to order-determinate music, represents a serious error of level-confusion. Thus I introduce the governing notions involved before returning to further considera- tion of polyphony in general.16 6. LINEARITY AND ADJACENCY Linear adjacency and order adjacency are the "counterpart" no- tions in content- and order-determinate systems, respectively, that determine "within-a-voice" or "between-voices-but-also-between-con- structs" inferences. Now, certain intervals are defined in content sys- tems as "intervals of adjacency" and certain as "intervals of non- adjacency"- the latter being either intervals of simultaneity or inter- vals "between constructs and voices." In order systems, "adjacency" is defined not as "higher than-lower than" adjacency but as order-posi- tional adjacency, which makes the linear adjacency criterion inopera- tive in order-determined music. So one possible (and frequent) "within-a-voice" notion associated with content systems, i.e., an em- pirically viable determinant of "pitch-voice areas," is pitch-class ad- jacency. Its determination is distinct from that of pitch, or registral adjacency, which is in the articulative rather than the functional di- rection17 within a given structure. This characteristic may be called linearity. And the relevance of its application is entirely dependent on 16 The "counterpoint" of order-determined music thus consists of particular par- titionings through ordered successions of normatively nonadjacent segments (down to monads), while its polyphony is defined as the ordering of successions of segments of these dimensions as defined adjacencies in the referential set. 17 I use "direction" here and elsewhere to relativize notions more frequently used absolutistically. Hence, I don't distinguish categorically between, e.g., "explanation" and "description," but rather consider them conceptual polarities between which relevant observations may be arrayed relative to a particular discourse. Thus some "analysis" may be "less explanatory" than another, which (if not counter-intuitive or counter- factual) may be therefore considered "more purely descriptive." Note that this notion is already introduced in Part II with respect to "coherence"/"opacity," "complexity/sim- plicity," etc. In default of this relativization, people would spend a great deal of time (as some seem to do) worrying, in ascending, just when they had got "up." . 249 -</page><page sequence="19">PERSPECTIVES OF NEW MUSIC syntactic definition. It is plainly a prime criterion for determining structural voice succession in tonal and pretonal music, but in trans- ferences to later music it seems most often to be equated with registral adjacency alone, an equation which would not be regarded as ap- propriate to content-music. In tonal music, for example, the explicit association of each tonic-triad pitch with a specific "neighbor-note" region is a syntactical factor in determining a "background line." The transference of such a particular normative criterion to nontonal music (even nontonal content-music) to support the derivation of an analogically background line seems highly problematic. This attempt at transference is made even by quite responsible theorists, most notably by Peter Westergaard in a series of articles on rhythmic and polyphonic structure in 12-tone music ([37], [38], [39], [40]). But, especially with respect to the subject matter of [37] and [38], I do not believe that linear adjacency has the same functional mean- ing, and surely not the same structural depth (in the sense noted above, that it seems a mostly articulative characteristic), in, for ex- ample, the Webern Op. 27, as an instance of order-generated music, as it does in content-generated music, and hence I regard the prof- fered transference of the Urlinie notion that depends on the affirma- tion of such a correspondence of functional meanings as uncon- vincing. The associations uncovered by Westergaard seem better understood as part of a "conceit," like "diatonic neoclassicism" in Stravinsky, or "Sonata Form"-or perhaps, better, "classical phrase- contour"-in Schoenberg, but such an analogy would occupy a con- siderably different explanatory niche from the one seemingly claimed in Westergaard's articles. In particular,the tonal "neighbor-note" criterion is defined in terms of a non-indifference with respect to "upper" or "lower" neighbor, only the tonic having both kinds asso- ciated with it (and each of those is intervallically, hence functionally, distinguishable), whereas no such or analogous criterion is asserted for Webern. And here, too (in Webern), not only is the semitone de- fined in particular order-successional terms rather than as a "kind of interval" of "general adjacency," but it is also universally inferrable in an extraregistral sense at the pitch-class level and hence seems "trivial" on that level (i.e., as a consequence of the "12-tone"-ness of the struc- ture). But this "pitch-class" level would seem to "correspond" to just that level in tonal music where "interval of adjacency" is particularly "nontrivial." Thus the "structural line" in Westergaard's analysis is evidently not the result of a transference of the Urlinie notion, since the context of its generation does not conform to the situation in the Schenker model of tonality in which the "registral" and the "linear" are at least separably definable. What this "structural line" seems S250</page><page sequence="20">MUSICAL SYNTAX (II) actually to be is, rather, a selection from a registral line based on a single interval, the interval of maximum presented adjacency (i.e., the semitone). This may be "equally" as explanatory as is the Schenker Urlinie, but surely it is differently explanatory from it. On the other hand, the actual determinant of structural-polyphonic "voices" in order systems is, as I have indicated, rather the ordering within sets (of elements or of whatever partitioning subsets are regarded as "sub- referential," quasi-analytically speaking-as the "triad" is subreferen- tial for the tonal collection), such "voices" being articulatively deline- ated (as "counterpoint") through whatever experientially "possible" dimension is also considered relevant (i.e., through registral, dynamic, timbral, etc., counterpoint, either independently or conjunctly). This difference in the defined basis of polyphony in the two types of sys- tems follows from the difference between the derivation of simultaneity- interpretation in order-generated music from coincidences of, or of parts of, order-successional "lines," and the derivation of lines in con- tent-generated music as inter-construct- and construct-definitionally partitioned successions. Now to return to polyphony itself: the above considerations suggest that the inference of polyphonic voices on a functional basis enables inferences of "multiple function" for elements, as parts of various "local" and ultimately of (single or multiple) "global" structures. In- ference of "constructs of simultaneity" in content systems widens this potential functional multiplicity by placing each atomic element into a new set of classes of relations with each other atomic element (the same, of course, is true for inferences of "constructs of succession" in order systems). The range of such an increased functional multi- plicity (i.e., a higher degree of determinacy) is thus in direct proportion to the dimensions of the constructs themselves and the uniqueness of function of each contained element within the construct. Hierarchiza- tion extends still further the range associated with single elements (here the defined "voice areas" are in a hierarchical relation, that is, a stage beyond simple conjunction). And this is still further extended by a defined "model for succession" determining a normative relation among successive simultaneities. Thus, the more determined (or defined) on the more levels of function a syntax is, the wider the range of possible cognitive relational paths and multiple associations it may account for (or generate). An analogous sequence of increasing determinacy can be traced for order-generated music as well, from the primary referential- order model to the "segment-associative" models; in this sense, the "interval element" in order-generated music directly correlates with S251</page><page sequence="21">PERSPECTIVES OF NEW MUSIC the interval element in content-generated music, in producing func- tional multiplicity between and within sets, between and within seg- ments, or, transformationally, in identifying such sets and segments as "adjacent" or "nonadjacent". And the order position of a pitch-class element in an order relation is like a hierarchical (voice) position of a pitch-class element in a content relation (i.e., being in "first," "second," or "third" position in a 12-tone set trichord is a determinate function, as determinate as, and "analogous" to, that of being "root," "fifth," or "third" of a tonal triad). Note, too, that although we have not ruled out the possibility of an identity of criteria of (i.e., normative inter- vallic models for) succession and simultaneity within a given system, it seems doubtful that such an identity would be usefully asserted at a single level of structure. (If both, "how both?" is the relevant explana- tion-seeking question, and the answer would presumably involve dis- tinctions such as we have been drawing.) Consider the following or- dered succession, for example, as an instance of a "serial" succession: C E G$ G# C E E G~ C At the level of individual sonority ("chords"), this succession can be construed as exhibiting a simple "exchange of structural voices" among successive "presented-voice" attacks. Note that at this level none of the particular "melodic" intervals (be they registral, timbral, dy- namic, or other kinds of melody) is "syntactically" determinate. This becomes especially evident if the succession is followed by another "harmony": C E G$ G B D$ (0 4 8 7 11 3: TOSorTORI) G$ C E D$ G B (8 0 4 3 7 11: T8S or T8RI) E G$ C B D$ G (4 8 0 11 3 7: T4SorT4RI) For here the "in-between" interval 1/11 is strongly explicable on suc- cessional (between partitioning constructs) rather than "partitional" (within partitioning constructs)18 grounds-which in the "global" 18 I use "partition" here rather than "simultaneity" to emphasize the fact that simul- taneity in the presented sense is a special case of the partitioning notion. Much of, e.g., early Stravinsky would seem to me polyphonically "incoherent" without this liberaliza- tion, since the "collection centricity" that I infer for works like Petrouchka (see Part IV) does not either entail or counter-entail the representation of particular segments, or even all, of the referential collection as actual simultaneity, but rather determines just the partitioning of pitch-class space by the totality of the components of the reference collection. Variant sub-partitionings of the reference collection are thus regarded as a variable of local articulation (compare the opening partitioning of the collection into 2 + 2 + 2 by the interval 2 (DE) (GA) (BCS/BbC), with the later "triads"). Insofar as these components are not internally hierarchized (even locally), the various unfoldings 0 252 -</page><page sequence="22">MUSICAL SYNTAX (II) (whole-array) sense "explains" the local (first or second-half), "purely content-exchanging" succession in terms of which each harmonic unit alone may be "completely" accounted for. (Of course contour, register, etc., are not intended to be specified, just "some" way of projecting these "voices" as "most favorably inferrable" "paths," rather than, say, E E E/G$ G$ G$/C C C/, etc. The point, however, is that the first, "content-only" explanation is indiferent with respect to this path-de- termining inference.)19 A last observation here: if the "harmonic" structure of a 12-tone piece is not evidently derivable from segmental partitioning relations, or from an "aggregate-formation" criterion (with or without "weight- ing"), we may at worst decide that the simultaneity dimension is rela- tively weakly determinate with respect to other compositional ex- amples, or we may invoke "associative" criteria to elucidate the "in- teriors" of the smallest inferrable "harmonic units" as locally rather than globally functional structures. But all of these retrenchments would presumably have some bearing on the coherence-complexity depth that we would assign to the composition in question. 7. STRUCTURAL COHERENCE IN "ORDER" AND "CONTENT" MUSIC The notions discussed in the preceding, then, represent conceptual- izations that discover and govern functional resources of musical sys- tems; and any construction of particular systems will, then, legiti- mately be guided by a wish to make choices that maximize the range, complexity, and unity of such resources available under a consistent single interpretation. We will, in other words, never shrink from "justifying" a constructional step, choice, or priority on "ideological" may be considered aspects of "structural levels" in the simpler sense, with "hetero- phonic" articulation but in a crucial sense "nonpolyphonic" structure-which is to suggest that the obverse of the coin of one-line polyphonic music is multilinear "mono- phonic" music (thus distinguishing "voice" as "deeper-structural" and "line" as "more foreground-articulative," as we have been doing all along). Although I suspect that Petrouchka might ultimately be convictable of polyphony (perhaps by tracing paths over intervening "cuts" in the manner suggested by Cone in [11], as well as on the macrolevel of this very variability of simultaneity-partitions), there are pieces of Debussy and perhaps Moussorgsky where I suspect the notion might prove useful, not to mention the various instances of "parallel organum" in its own time as well as ours. 19 This "presentation"-"definition" distinction hints at a problem in the "explanation" of certain compositions where such differentia as, e.g., the "characteristic interval" of an actual instrumental part are given as primary syntactical functions, with no accompany- ing criteria for the relations of "intervals between intervals" in those parts, for those between adjacent boundary pitches, or for those among pitches coincident in different parts (obviously these cannot be interpreted as the analog of those within a part, since that would seem to reduce the criterion to virtual absurdity). See, especially, discussions of Elliott Carter's Second String Quartet. . 253 -</page><page sequence="23">PERSPECTIVES OF NEW MUSIC grounds - that it will "give us what we want" -because we don't mean to pretend that we don't know what we want, and where we want to arrive. Clearly, such a program of maximization derives its desirabil- ity from the insight that the more definitionally distinct respects there are in which function can be asserted, the more the unique variability that can be "read out of" or "composed into" a given composition. This suggests the notion that the more "bound" a composer's or an analyst's syntax with respect to (and in terms of) a given composition, the more "creative freedom" he can assert, an idea proposed earlier in this essay, and one which might be pondered with profit by those who seek to "liberate" music from syntactic constraints. As far as the construction of particular systems beyond the general basis described in Part II is concerned, we will here terminate our consideration of order-generated systems with a few general remarks, and then proceed to sketch in outline some of the steps that might be taken in generating a content system. The reason for this reticence regarding order-generated systems is just that the amount of "pre- composition" inferrable from pieces regarded as instances thereof is sufficiently great that the generalizable "systematic" dimension is relatively trivial except for some theorems that can be proved about available properties of various structures under various constraints, and most of the existing literature is devoted to just such questions.20 Note, especially, that by virtue of what has already been said, it can be seen that "precomposition" is the relative depth in the music-deriva- tional chain at which thought particularly directed toward the genera- tion of a particular piece may be said to have significantly begun; put another way, it is indexed by the relative number of levels that we find it necessary to descend down the systematic definition-ladder to explain the non-shared aspects of a given composition (as distinct from the number of levels that it is desirable to descend, or possible to, which latter, in principle, is always "all"). And put still another way, the notion represents the "degree of contextuality" exhibited by the individual instances of some set of compositions we find it convenient to regard as comprising a "literature." (The latter consideration is relevant to historical matters, manifestly, in that it may be interesting to find ways that historically proximate compositions share character- istics which can be generalized into "the musical language of a time"; but it also may be relevant to extrahistorical investigations that group compositions for given explanatory purposes along quite otherwise- 20 See, for example, Babbitt [1], [2], [3], [4]; Lewin [24], [26]; Krenek [22]; Howe [16]; Winham [41]; even most of Forte [14] and [15], despite some evident claims to greater explanatory scope. All of this makes Westergaard [37], [38], [39], and [40] particularly significant as attempts to theorize analytically. . 254-</page><page sequence="24">MUSICAL SYNTAX (II) determined lines. An interesting "historical" experiment might be the examination of compositions for order- or content-generation to discover whether prevalent "historical-literature" beliefs actually prove descriptively relevant.) Thus, the analysis of the literature of tonal music does not require the reconsideration of the generation of referential sets in the reconstruction of each composition, whereas the analysis of the literature of 12-tone music does, symptomizing what we can consider the "greater contextuality" of the latter. I stress the point to distinguish the degree of contextuality that can be asserted for any music from that which, as it turns out, must be discovered for each composition in a "literature" where the "precompositional" chain for one or more pieces has been previously defined; simply, the num- ber and level of shared characteristics of this nature differs from litera- ture to literature. The extreme case is of that music which Babbitt calls "contextual," where each piece is - in the most extreme view - its own entire "literature." But this designation is itself slightly elliptical, since there are plenty of respects in which those ("free atonal") pieces can be seen to resemble each other; the problem is rather that for each individual instance no complete description of a comparable satis- factoriness to those we can give of members of earlier and later "litera- tures" can be derived. So in those cases, we are forced to make stra- tegic retrenchments, from regarding the minimum "discernible element" in delimited relational complexes, as "referential," or func- tional, to regarding as minimally functional larger "basic units" whose interiors remain relationally undefined and which thus "function" in a sense grosser than we should like. For example, we may find a local structure in such a composition that exhibits a high degree of defina- ble coherence, through which however we cannot account either for the interior structure of other localities, or for the relations between localities. Thus in order to produce a "global structure" we need to retreat to a more complex elementary unit, or "atom," admitting our "incoherence" at more individuated levels (such as, optimally, that of "minimum discriminable detail") with respect to that piece. This re- trenchment may, of course, proceed all the way to the boundaries of the compositional data, in which case we are, surely, incoherent with respect to that composition (see the earlier remarks on this subject, in Part I, PNM, Vol. 8, No. 1, and a reconsideration of the position in terms of analytic criteria in Part IV). So, with respect to order-generated systems, I will simply indicate the "paradigm" procedure for their construction as consisting in the generation of a "referential set" which constitutes an ordering of the total pitch-class vocabulary. In other words, where n is the total num- ber of pitch-class elements, then, for any ordered pitch array S255</page><page sequence="25">PERSPECTIVES OF NEW MUSIC (ai ai . ... aq) the referential set will be an ordered partitioning of the set (ao, a,, . ... , an-1) with n-related pitches considered equivalent. The nature (interpreted "sound") of "n," and the number of partitioning elements (to within the symmetrical requirements that no "common denominator" not ac- tually present is inferrable) are left open to individual-systematic interpretation. The notion of partitioning involved here can be easily extrapolated from the definition of pitch-class partitioning given elsewhere. But the primary referential set resulting from such parti- tion may itself be considered as having been generated by composi- tions of partitioning subclasses (not necessarily by isomorphic ones - e.g., compositional manifestation may make a segmental sub-parti- tioning relevant, as in the tetrachordal disposition of Schoenberg's Op. 25, even where the "derived-set" criterion is inoperative; and, con- versely, the degree to which it is useful to notice an isomorphic segmen- tation, even where one or several can be asserted is contextually dependent-cf. various discussions of the set of Schoenberg's Third Quartet). The degree of determination of the whole by such sub- partitions can also be variable (i.e., hexachord content may generate deeper structural levels, as a basis of isomorphism, than within-hexa- chord element order, and similar remarks apply to trichordal and/or dyadic partitionings that generate hexachords or tetrachordal [or trichordal, or dyadic] partitionings of whole sets). The crucial sys- tematic point here is that we regard the syntactical-referential norm as in all cases the maximal construct along certain lines generated by defined relations among sub-constructs.20a 20a That such considerations of varying degrees of order-determinancy within "the 12-tone system" are not reflected within the scope of Kassler's models [in [20]; see Part I, PNM, Vol. 8, No. 1, pp. 64ff.] is, though understandable from his point of view, one of the principal contributors to the "epistemic weakness" I have noted therein. In particular, it would seem that some of the "analytic puzzles" described in his article might have yielded under such considerations. That similar considerations are hinted at by Kassler as "stylistic rules" seems to me to place "style" [in his sense] at a rather too deep level of music-structural description, and, again, while I understand the possible notion of "maximum generality" motivating this, it seems to me preferable to "build in" such potential resources whose importance in composition we know quite well, and whatever "chances" it entails taking to do so. In fact, the risks seem especially worthwhile in contexts where sub-construct relations may consistently be asserted at levels of construction prior to those of which the supposed "syntactical conventions" [e.g., the "Schoenberg rules"] are assertible; for this assertion in no way predetermines the invocation of such "conventions" at any particular level in the particular analysis involved. That is, for any given piece, it might indeed be relevant to regard the unit- generated 12-tone set [as a monad set] as the "minimum partitioning" [or "minimum determinacy" of the structure], but such a determination could be made in the context of a syntax where smaller generating partitioning constructs could also be asserted in other cases [or as a more "general" determinacy in the given case]. But the procedure ? 256 -</page><page sequence="26">MUSICAL SYNTAX (II) 8. OUTLINE OF A TONAL-SYNTACTICAL SYSTEM Now we proceed to our final task in this Part, the sketch of a "syntactical model" for the tonal system, one that provides a basis into which the "Schenker model" of tonal structure can be plugged. What follows is merely an informal outline of such a construction, men- tioning relevant considerations and interesting properties in the process. Since what is being generated is a content system, whose referential set will therefore be a proper subset of the total pitch-class vocabulary, it may be useful to indicate in advance the necessity, in generating a system isomorphic with the tonal one, of dimensioning the pitch-class "octave" at 12, though the "actual" interpreted modular "size" (soni- cally speaking) is irrelevant; that is, what constitutes a "1," or a "1/12 octave" relation is open to individual acoustic interpretation. But as we shall see, the "12" is an important aspect of the system in more than one respect; the most important, however, is undoubtedly its "superabundance" (as pointed out by Babbitt), which in the tonal system has the virtue of restricting its "asymmetric partitioning cycles" (i.e., those whose cyclic application produces a partitioning such that the resultant set determined by that partitioning exhausts the ele- ments of the partitioned domain). The fact that only two integers in- cluded in 12 (and their mod-12 complements) are "prime" to 12 seems significant (and reasonable to invoke as a "decision" factor) in the "choice of dimension" for the tonal pitch-class universe. (Could it have been otherwise? I hope the question no longer seems meaningful.) A. First partitioning: Having dimensioned the "pitch-class octave" at 12, we take as initial partitioning a particular pitch-class octave, in conformity with our notion of "pitch centricity" as an "ultimate" basis for the tonal system. Thus we construct a domain, )0( )(12)( )0( where the pitch-class elements are assigned particular values with re- spect to a particular zero, rather than being regarded as "some value relative to some 0." This "fixes" the "centric" pitch-class element by its particular "octave partition" of the pitch domain. of beginning at the total monadic-ordered set level and then deriving any sub-partition- ings by a kind of "stylistic quasianalysis" seems incongruent for those pieces where such sub-partitioning is relevant at very basic levels. See the remarks on centricity and tonality above, also, for "content-system" analogs to the same problem. . 257 -</page><page sequence="27">PERSPECTIVES OF NEW MUSIC B. 1) We then seek to construct (with polyphonic malice afore- thought) a maximum partitioning construct through which to arrive at a maximum referential collection. 2) Since we have begun with a pitch-hierarchical notion, we seek to construct such a collection in one-pitch-at-a-time stages, such that each resultant relation is hierarchically defined with respect to the "preceding" stage and "subsequent" stages, and such that we maxi- mize the uniqueness of function associated with every relation at every stage (multiplicity of function derives from associations among differ- ent stages) resulting, first, in a succession such that were we to stop at any point we would have a potentially coherent system (i.e., every stage of a syntax is a potential syntax, just as every level of a composi- tion is a potential composition); second, in a succession that in fact is maximal for each of the transformations defined (this is clarified be- low); and third, in a succession which multiply defines, at different levels, the hierarchical relations of every pitch with respect to every other, on the basis of their commensurable relations to the pitch cen- ter. Thus we maximize, in particular, ways of asserting hierarchical degrees of similitude among differentiable, but comparably (content-) dimensioned subsets of elements. C. Second partitioning: To produce a construct, from a partitioning of the centric octave, such that that construct represents a determinate hierarchization of the partitioning element with respect to the centric element, the par- titioning must be "asymmetric," i.e., one that partitions the octave into non-equivalent segments whose (complement-class) intervallic value is "prime" to that of the modular-interval; otherwise the determina- tion of which is the partitioning and which the partitioned pitch-class octave would be non-unique. That is, if we choose 6 as the partitioning interval, the equivalence of (0, 6) and (6, 0) represents a non-unique basis for interpretation of the "reference octave." Similarly, 2, 3, 4, and their complements 8, 9, 10, are all extrapolable into non-unique partitionings in the same sense. Further, it may be said that any sym- metrical partitioning in any domain of any size is non-unique opera- tionally, in that the partitioning interval itself may be taken as an "octave" with internal isomorphism in structure to the "actual" octave (thus all relations assertible mod 12 are describable as relations mod 6, or 4, or 3, given reinterpretation of "complement," etc.). The only intervals conforming to the criterion are 1/11 and 5/7. The partitioning by 1/11 has several points against it: 1) its maximal extrapolation by, e.g., transpositions and complementations in terms S258</page><page sequence="28">MUSICAL SYNTAX (II) of itself, produces (at best) a subset of the pitch domain isomorphic to the domain itself (i.e., symmetrical in content-structure): Second Partitioning by 1/11: )0( )1( )0( Maximal reference-set extrapolation by transposition and comple- mentary transposition:21 "Prime": "Complement": 1 11 0 10 11 0 2 11 11 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 11 1 collection: (11, 0, 1, 2) collection: (10, 11, 0, 1) Further "secondary" extrapolation only enlarges the dimensions of the collection without affecting the non-uniqueness of internal struc- ture. 2) Beyond this initial extrapolation (which produces a "2-level" hier- archization), no further analogous partitioning is possible for 1/11, as the minimum pitch-class interval. 3) The notion of "polyphonic voice domains" defined linearly is impos- sible if the model for simultaneity contains intervals of minimum pitch-class adjacency while the intervals of succession include larger intervals: intervals of simultaneity (co-referential): 1/11, 0. primary intervals of succession (between reference construct and each of derived constructs, but not also within reference construct): 2/10. 21 The "maximization" of the reference set consists of generating new pitches (and intervals) by extending the relations implicit in the reference construct. At this stage maximization consists of generating, out of a pitch B in a central construct (A, B) wherein B partitions (the octave of) A, the pitch C such that C partitions B as B partitions A. Also, A generates a pitch D such that A partitions D as B partitions A. This is maxi- mal by the centric criterion, since it places every member of the reference construct into every relational position determined by the reference construct. The next maximizing stage for the syntax ("partitioning something (x) as x partitions something else (y)") generates new pitches out of each of the constructs generated at the current stage. This notion accounts for the procession described below ("Third partitioning"). 0 259 -</page><page sequence="29">PERSPECTIVES OF NEW MUSIC secondary interval of succession (between secondary constructs only): 3/9. 4) The resultant collection not only fails to exhibit a unique partition- ing of the pitch-class domain, but also fails to exhaust the interval con- tent of that domain, thus allowing "undefined" intervallic relations as "transposition relations" to arise, at every transpositional level. This leaves 5/7 as the remaining "prime to 12" interval. We shall not at this point distinguish between 5 and 7, since at the level of two- pitch "models for simultaneity" they seem equally viable. (In this re- spect, consider the "4th"- or "5th"-referential polyphony of the earli- est, even post-parallel-organum period. It is a question, with respect to this music, whether one wants to regard the following as in the "polyphonic" or "monophonic" domain, even though simultaneous variability in two dimensions could very well have been inferred from it: CCDEF GGF DEE CCCCCDDCDEE But organal polyphony later than this "free" organum still exhibits a "5"-model for two-pitch simultaneity. Note that two-pitch music most often has as its "minimal norm of sonority" a "3-part" textural articu- lation, just as three-pitch music most often has a "4-part" one: not only does this enable the multiple "definition" of each presented ele- ment of a simultaneity - "syntactical" hierarchical interpretation and "doubling" interpretation - but it also provides a "complete" closure for the partitioning by asserting "both ends" of the modular octave, thus exposing the referential partitioning "within": )0( )0( )7( or )5( )0( )0( as "presented," not just inferred, "final" sonorities. The connection with thefinalis of the Schenker model should be evident.) Another virtue of 5/7 is that it represents a maximal partitioning of the pitch domain in the sense that the two resultant "regions" are min- imally distinct in dimension (i.e., number of intervening elements); no other partitioning that produces any differential in dimension pro- duces less difference. This, of course, is an advantage in creating hier- archical "degrees of similitude," and maximizing the number and identities of "polyphonic voices." Whether or not we could at this point assert a preference for 7 over 5 on the grounds that 7 produces the uniquely non-duplicating parti- tion (is the smallest interval to do so, in fact), whereas 5 "repeats" within S260</page><page sequence="30">MUSICAL SYNTAX (II) the octave, is an open question. Stronger considerations determine our later preference for 7. Thus we can choose our second level of partitioning, and maxi- mize the collection it can generate by the operations of transpo- sition and complementary transposition. The complementary parti- tionings are constructed side by side: )7( )2( )5( )0( )0( )10( )7( )7( )7( )5( )5( )5( )0( )0( )0( )0( )7( )5( Collection: (5, 0, 7, 2) collection: (7, 0, 5, 10) Note that the collections resulting are transpositionally identical; the interval of simultaneity generated at this level is, after k at the "pri- mary" level (and trivially), 7 or 5; and the primary interval of succes- sion is 2. Note the relation between "level of generation" and "multi- plicity in the collection" (in the ultimate diatonic collection) translatable as "associational range" with respect to collection-transpositions. Note, too, the restricted "defined interval" range of the resultant collection (3 out of a possible 6 intervals); compare this to the degree to which simultaneity in two-pitch-simultaneity-model music is defined (i.e., determinate) for "interstitial" passages.22 Nevertheless, for elements within a given "mode," an interpretation is possible on transpositional grounds, which creates a defined polyphonic structure in which "voice areas" are primarily defined as neighbor-note relations around the center construct: 22 Also, in the 7-model, the lower degree of determinacy with respect to construct elements at this level provides the lower-level basis for regarding the tonal system as a "major-minor" system, since (at this level) only the "fifths" are determinate, i.e., a chord containing (C, Eb, G) is an equally possible interpretation of a tonic C chord (defined only as "C, G") as is one containing (C, E, G). But at a higher level, the distinction becomes operative - and no one would want to deny that we can distinguish major from minor at some level. This lower-higher level relation conforms to my claim that "higher levels" are simply more determinate ways of "hearing"; and the "5th" level is a stage at which the "3rds" are indeterminate. Cf. the "perceptual randomness" of the between- reference-construct interstices of pretriadic music (e.g., 12th- and 13th-century motets), which we hear as indeterminate except at the "5th" level. 0 261 -</page><page sequence="31">PERSPECTIVES OF NEW MUSIC 5-7 2-0 or: 7-5 10 - 0 with transpositionally derived intervals forming "secondary neighbor notes": t7S (5 0 7 2) = (0 7 2 9) 9 -)7(- 5 2 -)0( t7S (0 7 2 9) = (7 2 9 4) 9-7-5-4-2-0 This may explain the "hexachord" orientation, as well as the "indiffer- ent" modal-centric interpretation of pretonal music, and even to a certain extent of triadic pretonal music; but this is a largely unedu- cated guess. D. Third partitioning: The restricted intervallic range noted above leads us to pursue the goal of maximization in projecting a partitioning "referential con- struct" out of which to generate a collection. Thus, if we partition 7 by the analogous "maximal complement" criterion ("smallest difference from midpoint") we partition the interval 7 into two maximal comple- ments, as it partitions 12 into maximal complements, by 4 + 3/3 + 4. In our "complementary system," however, the result of "partitioning 5 as 5 partitions 12" are the constructs 025 (2 + 3) and 035 (3 + 2). But the interval 2 has already been defined as a primary interval, as a first- level primary interval of succession; thus this further partitioning sacri- fices a significant functional distinction available in pitch systems: that of functional uniqueness (and in fact the loss in uniqueness is a major loss in determinacy on other grounds too, for instead of increasing relational resources through the further partitioning, the determinacy "defined into" the interval by its being generated at its initial level is fatally weakened). Thus the 5-system is not capable of extension equivalent to that of the 7-system; this is the principal basis, as prom- ised, for preferring the 7-system as the tonal system. Note, too, that the collection resulting in the 5-system is a hexachord, the "diatonic hexachord" (5 7 9 10 0 2), which also fails to include and hence define functions for all "chromatic" intervals. To return to our 7-partition, then: the result here is dramatically different. The further partitioning of the previously constructed 7's, yields the following "complementary-systematic" results (intervals in square brackets): S262</page><page sequence="32">MUSICAL SYNTAX (II) [31 2 [4]2 [3] 11 [4] 10 [4] [3] 7 7 7 7 [3]4 [4] 3 [4] [3] 00[ 0 0 [3] [4] 9[4] [3]8 5 5 collection: (0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11) collection: (0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10) The two collections are, of course, transpositionally isomorphic, with the same "tonic fifth"; they represent, respectively, a "major-model" and a "minor-model" interpretation (generation) of the same collec- tion. Notice that in "logical" structure, the major-minor isomorphism is complete, and no hierarchy could be asserted between them on in- ternal grounds alone. But it seems nevertheless reasonable, on em- pirical grounds, to regard the major as the paradigm system, because of the alterations normally made in "minor-tonic" pieces to incor- porate "major-model" features. A more internal (possible) reason for this is considered below. At this stage, then, the "new" intervals generated are: intervals of simultaneity: 3, 4 (primary) interval of succession: 1 and the single interval that does not occur either within the central "model for simultaneity" or between it and one of its two transposi- tions (the relation we have called the "primary interval of succession" relation), but only between the two "secondary" constructs, is the "unique interval" 6. Now note that the (unique) multiplicity with which each chromatic interval occurs in this collection varies directly with its hierarchical position in the constructional chain, with all the intervals of simul- taneity generated at each level occurring more frequently than the intervals of succession generated at the same level: Intervals Frequency Intervals Frequency of Simul- of Occur- of Succes- of Occur- Levels: taneity rence sion rence First: 0 7 - - Second: 7 6 2 5 Third: 3/4 4/3 1 2 "4th": - - ("Secondary Interval of Succession"): 6 1 . 263 -</page><page sequence="33">PERSPECTIVES OF NEW MUSIC Of course, the significance of this unique multiplicity is the uniquely defined range of association (among collections) or uniqueness of identification (of a particular collection) characteristic of each interval. After total-collectional transposition is hierarchized and included in the construction, the number of occurrences within the collection of a given scale-degree interval will be seen to be equal to the total number of transpositionally related collections in which the pitches determining that interval in the reference collection occur. (This follows trivially from the transpositional isomorphism of the col- lections involved.) E. Before turning to other properties of the present collection, let us consider why it constitutes a "maximum referential set." In order to demonstrate this, we may try to maximize the generating construct still further, producing a fourth hierarchical level (after the "0," "7," and "4/3" levels of polyphonic voice definition). Thus we partition the "major" collection once more, again by analogy to our previous efforts: 7 7 7 7 .7 7 6 6 5 5 4 -- 4 or 4 or 4 or 4 or 4 etc. 3 3 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 But we need go no further: any of these partitions adjoins to our pre- vious construction a confusion of definition, since intervals previously (uniquely) defined as intervals of succession are here reconstructed as also intervals of simultaneity, thus in effect producing a weaker system than was produced at a lower level of partitioning. Moreover, since every chromatic interval has already been defined at earlier levels, no further construction adding to the referential collection could but similarly weaken the determinacy of the system. And if we examine a normal-form arrangement of the collection we find that the unique- ness of intervals of succession (2, 1) and of simultaneity (7, 3, 4) is paralleled by the relation of "scale-degree adjacency"- for intervals of succession-and "scale-degree non-adjacency," for intervals of simultaneity. Here is an interesting confirmation of the way that the "linearity" criterion for voice relations is "built into" the system: com- pare successional-"closeness" (order-interval) in the successional nor- mal-form representation to simultaneity-"closeness" (pitch-class inter- val) in the "models for simultaneity": S264</page><page sequence="34">MUSICAL SYNTAX (II) (0 2 4 5 7 9 11 0) 221222 1 But this criterion is violated by any new construct, which will produce conjunctions such as: (0 2 3 4 6 7) x x L21 x x L2J where the same intervals are produced by both adjacent and non- adjacent pitches-again in conformity with the simultaneity-succes- sion result. F. Collection transposition: Thus, at the stage where we have defined a referential collection, and a function within that collection for every chromatic interval, we have still to define a multiple-hierarchical ordering of relations among all pitches in the pitch-class vocabulary, in terms of the "centric" pitch class. An obvious extension of the partitioning-construct transposition to a collection-transposition suggests itself (and it is obvious from the isomorphism of tetrachords in the normal-form representation that this property follows: "tOS": (0 2 4 5) "t7S": (7 9 11 0)). Moreover, of course, it proves to be the case that transpositions by the "generative interval" 7 (and its complement) produce collections of maximum similitude (short of total identity) with the reference collec- tion, in that they exhibit just one nonidentical component. And in each of the complementary transpositions, the one-element difference involves the "replacement" of one of the two elements determining the "unique" 6: (0 2 4 (5) 7 9 (11) 0) 7 9 11 0 2 4 (6) 7) (5 7 9 (10) 0 2 4 5) The extension of this hierarchical chain (a "centrically interpreted" ordering of the syntactical content-array of which the reference set is a member) thus places every pitch class into multiple relation with every other in the pitch-class vocabulary. The exhaustion by the 7-cycle of the 12-pitch-class domain is operative in this hierarchiza- tion, which thus completes the "macrosyntactical basis" of the diatonic S265</page><page sequence="35">PERSPECTIVES OF NEW MUSIC tonal system (what is generated is, in fact, a complete "syntactical con- tent array" such as was defined in Section 2, above). Earlier we considered how "chromatic intervals" are given "double meaning" by their additional syntactic definitions as "scale-degree intervals." But under transposition, each chromatic interval acquires multiple possible "scale-degree-interval" interpretations, familiar from such terms as "augmented second," "diminished fourth," etc. This phenomenon arises in the "first transposition" shown above, where a succession such as (E, F, G, Bb, B) would not be considered an erosion of the "adjacency - non-adjacency" distinction, but rather the "double representation" of "adjacencies to A and C" in two different scales. Thus the pitches that determine a chromatic "1" are, in one place, an "augmented prime" (BE-B), and in another, a "minor second." The explanation for such weird interval types is that they arise as exten- sions of the notion of scale-degree interval within a collection to rela- tions between distinct collections. And the succession E-F-F#-G-A-Bb can be regarded simply as the result of superposition of both 5th-re- lated transpositions with the central collection (in the order (1) (5)). To illustrate the particular "scale-degree" dependency involved, con- sider the proposal to "hear" (notate) a pitch relation as (Cb, A). Now since, for all pairs of diatonic pitch-class collections, the minimum dimension of their intersection-sets in a 12 pitch-class system is 2, it will always be possible to "match" at least one scale-degree of each scale with an element of any other as a "0 prime."22a Then, regarding "equal scale-degree interval" as "equal number of intervening scale- degrees," we can correlate the "primes" to find the appropriate inter- val-designation (problems arising from the invocation of the supposed "fifth-spiral" are easily disposed of as pseudo-problems; enharmonic notation of a whole collection preserves everything relevant to the tonal syntax with regard to that collection): (Bb Cb Db Eb Fb Gb Ab Bb) (Bb C D Eb F G A Bb) Counting from Bb, it is a 2nd to Cb and a 7th to A; a 7th is a 6th larger than a 2nd, so the interval between Cb and A is a kind of 6th, a "10- 22a Although the minimum pitch-class intersection is 2, the minimum 0-prime scale- degree intersection is 1, because the 2 pitch classes may be in different scale-degree- interval relations in the two distinct collections. In such a case, either pitch class may be taken as the 0-prime intersection, but not both: F-B and Es-B in the C and F#collections, respectively, represent such a case; if B is taken as the 0-prime, the F and E#represent distinct scale-degree distances from it, while if F is taken as O-prime (changing the second collection enharmonically to Gb), B and (what is now) Cb represent distinct relative scale degrees. . 266 -</page><page sequence="36">MUSICAL SYNTAX (II) 6th" (which conforms to the functional view of the "augmented sixth" as the superposition of the minor-collection "upper neighbor" of V with the "leading tone" of the V-major collection). To return to the diatonic collection itself: note that the entire collec- tion is generated out of a single construct and its transpositions by its hierarchical principal components. Now (although the other plausi- ble additional partitioning, by transposition in terms of the tertiary elements [the "3rds"] as well, would lead to the same double-defini- tional problems encountered before), the transposition within the collection by the "thirds" of the triads produces a set of inverses of the principal constructs of the collection (such inverses being defined, where the major form is primary, as "secondary triads"): 11 7 4 4 0 9 9 5 2 (This is based on the (4 + 3)-cyclic representation of the collection as ((5 9 0) (0 4 7) (7 11 2)), and thus, also, as ((2 5 9) (9 0 4) (4 7 11)).) The "triad" (11 2 5) is thus produced only "by analogy," since it is not transpositionally or inversionally isomorphic with the others, and in fact includes a "relation of succession," so that it is a definitionally "linear" event, bound to a "resolution" (see p. 263, above). G. Tonal structure Finally, two remarks about polyphony and succession: the deriva- tion of the collection out of a hierarchical model for simultaneity de- fines three "structural voice" areas. Thus a "linear model" of the collection is assertible, wherein the entire collection is functionalized as "the tonic triad and the neighbor notes to its components," the neighbor notes being the "linear regions" for referential-construct component elaboration (or "structural-polyphonic voice regions"), according to the following model: 9-7 5-4 2-0 11-0 which exhausts the collection and suggests the "background" for the Schenker-linear (successional-i.e., "structural") model: S267</page><page sequence="37">PERSPECTIVES OF NEW MUSIC -(9) 7 -(7) -5 -4 -2 -0 Now note that the tonic pitch is, in the "neighbor-note" model, as- signed two neighbor notes, uniquely among the triadic components; they are functionally distinguishable as "upper" and "lower," and this distinction is identifiable by the different-sized 2nd that each repre- sents. It is this functional distinction that might suggest a more in- ternal reason for the primacy of the major model in tonal music, since the "leading tone" and "upper neighbor" are intervallically indistin- guishable in the minor model. And as a justification, this seems more plausible than anthropomorphic yearnings of semitones for their upper neighbors or the greater "strength" of a dominant relation when the dominant is major, etc. The fact that the triad is the "model for sonority" in tonal music means that every "linear" "polyphonic" embellishment is generated (at some determinable structural level) as a component of a resultant pitch conjunction modeled on the tonic triad (i.e., as a member of some determinate major or minor triad), as the familiar 7-9 -7 4 -5 -4 0 -2 0 -11 -022b (the "four-voice" representation familiar as the basic "contrapuntal model" for tonal music has evident correspondence to the above; .see the discussion of the question on pp. 239ff, above). So every entity in a tonal structure is initially, at least (i.e., at its level of initial appearance), a member of a triad, and a component of a purely triadic succession. 22b It seems plausible to regard 2 as displacing both 4 and 0, in which case it would be defined as a member of both the 0-voice and the 4-voice, assignable on some occasions to both (as both 11 and 2 are assignable to the single 0-voice), or otherwise to either one or the other depending on the context. Without this possibility of multiple assign- ment, it remains unexplained why in our model 4 is "suppressed" but not structurally "displaced" by the assertion of a (7 11 2) triad, such "suppression" requiring the introduction of what is in effect a new syntactical function. On the other hand, the prevalence of the dominant seventh as a "cadential" articu- lator may be considered to be motivated in part by the explicit voice displacement for the 4 this chord projects (as, 4-5-4), a displacement which must otherwise be "inferred" (given only (7 11 2) to go on). The question, it seems to me, remains open in view of the intelligibility of the seventhless (7 11 2) in the literature. 0 268-</page><page sequence="38">MUSICAL SYNTAX (II) At the same time, the (interval-7) relation between the referential construct (I) and the principal secondary constructs (IV and V), from which the definition of "interval of succession" has emerged, is de- fined, as a "total relation (between constructs)," as the normative "model for succession" for background-structural simultaneities, as well as for local articulations. Again, the presence of such a model does not necessarily constrain literally any foreground successions; but where the sonorities presented in a foreground are non-triadic and the successions non-"fifth" the presumption is still of a consistent level-derivational relation of what does happen in the foreground to such a background model. Thus, too, the status of a local, or fore- ground, articulation may be partially determined as "more linear" or "more construct-successional" by whether the presented voice relations are more akin to the "linear model" or to the "harmonic model" of the tonal collection. Here the function of the "fourth part" is particularly significant, in providing the "fifth-outlining 'bass'" in conjunction with the "adjacency-outlining 'upper voices.'" At this point, the entire "syntactic" basis of the tonal system may be considered to have been sketched. Further considerations, including concepts of "Ursatz," "tonicization,"23 etc., belong to the next, the analytic-compositional domain, and would be beyond our scope here in any case. But the constructions suggested in this and the preceding parts, if carried out, would presumably provide a sufficient basis on which to rest the (Schenker-type) tonal and (Babbitt-type)24 12-tone systems as "normally," if somewhat variably, defined, with a minimum of additional patching required to effect the join.
