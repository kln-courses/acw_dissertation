<plain_text><page sequence="1">E. S. Semeka, Is tori ja Buddhisma na Cejlone - Sangha v drevnosti i v srednie veka (History of Buddhism in Ceylon - The sangha in Antiq? uity and in the Middle Age) (USSR Academy of Sciences - Institute of Orientalistics - Moscow, ? Nauka ? Publishing House, Central Editorial Board for Oriental Literature, 1969, 236 pp., 10 ill., 1 map). The Author of the present treatise, Dr Elena Sergeevna Semeka, is no stranger to the readers of our review, if only in her quality as contributor of an important paper (already mentioned in EW, XVI, 1966, p. 162) to the sbornik Indiya v Drevnosti, a collective work dedicated to Ancient India. In this essay she had directed her attention to ? The Administrative System of the Monasteries of Ancient Ceylon in the Light of Sinhalese Epigraphy ?. The publication we now have before us can be considered as an elaboration of this preceding work, in the much more demanding form of an extensive historical study. It would be superfluous to recall the extraor? dinary, one is almost tempted to say dispropor? tionate, importance of the island of Ceylon in the spiritual, religious and artistic structure of the Indian world, and above all, in the history of Buddhism. The ancient, mediaeval, and more recent vicissitudes of Sri Lanka, cHoly Ceylon', 414</page><page sequence="2">are better known, over extended periods of history, than those of continental India thanks to the chronicles redacted in the P?li language, the Dipavamsa and Mahdvamsa (with their contin? uation up to the 19th century, the C?lavamsa), in its day so authoritatively translated and com? mented upon by W. Geiger, and now widely consulted by all, including our present Indologist. These are historical records of a documentary importance equalled in the sub-continent only by the R?jatarahgim of Kalhana, the noted chronicle of the kings of K?srnlr. Doubtless all these chronicles contain many historical facts, but natural? ly they are not lacking in the usual legendary and epic additions and embellishments, such that these narratives must only be utilized with a great deal of caution for any critical reconstruction of Indian and Ceylonese history. Fortunately a considerable corpus of ancient Ceylonese inscriptions exists as a supplement and basis of control, but so far this material has not yet been the subject of a sufficiently systematic and exhaustive study in spite of the laudable editions of the Epigraphia Zeylanica, the latest volume of which (Archaeological Survey of Ceylon, 1963, vol. V, part III), edited by two specialists of the stature of S. Paranavitana and C. E. Goda kumbura, offers another series of most informative new inscriptions, the equal of those collected in the previous volumes I-IV, edited by M. Wkkre masinghe (London, 1904-1917). It is on all this vast material yielded by both the epigraphical and the above-mentioned historiographical sources that the present treatise is based, but it is on the credibility of the epigraphy that the Author places the most reliance. Already in her paper in Indiya v drevnosti cited at the beginning of this compte rendu Dr Semeka had remarked: ?Thanks to the study of ancient Ceylonese epigraphy we have had the possibility of following step by step the transformations undergone by the Buddhist sangha over the course of centuries. We have been able to observe into what a complex economic institu? tion it has been transformed, and how far it has departed from its original principles of simplicity, democracy and asceticism ?. Such concrete problems as these relating to monastic life in Ceylon, including the organization of the monastery and the principal stages in the evolution of this institution ? of such fundamental importance for Buddhism in general and for Ceylonese Buddhism in particular ? already constituted the main subject of the Author's previous essay. But now in her new book this scholar makes use of much more extensive and perfected historical instruments to examine this institution anew. Of the three ? jewels ? (ratna traya, Pali: ratanattaya) which make up the ? Holy Trinity ? of Buddhism, our Russian historian con? tinues, also in this book, to concentrate her atten? tion systematically on the third element, on the third sarana, the sangha, seil, on the community life of the monks. ? Sahgham saranam gacch?mt ? could have been placed as a motto on the title page of this new volume of hers. Nor does it seem to us that such a preference be exclusively dictated by reason of methodological limitation. Behind this approach of an exclusively historico sociological stamp to such a complex phenomenon as ? Buddhism ? lies an attitude peculiar to the whole current of Soviet 'Buddhology5. It is an approach which has the effect of illustrating mainly one aspect, though admittedly this side of the third rat ana is anything but negligible. The work under review can be considered as a typical representative of this point of view, and it is this which explains both its undoubted scientific merits and its equally patent ideological inadequacy, both consequences of that first choice made at the outset. The inadequacy in the manner of understand? ing and judging the phenomenon of Buddhism inherent in the very approach used by Soviet science in studying the teaching of the Buddha, an insufficiency shared also by the present publica? tion, seems to us to consist in a ? we might almost say, constitutional ? lack of an adequate "organ5 of perception tuned to those dimensions beyond the empirical, the contingent and the historical, in brief, to those ontological dimensions that the analysis of reality effected by Buddhism has contributed to the human mind. It is obvious that if the phenomenon of Buddhism be considered solely from the historical, the economic or the sociological point of view, or worse still, within the obligatory evolutionistic and dialectic frame? work peculiar to the Marxist theory of economic determinism, then the results obtained can be scarcely other than unilateral and partial in the best of cases. The ontological level of the "re? sponse5 corresponds, as always, to the level from which the 'challenge5 originated. Nevertheless, also Russian science has contributed in the past to a deeper comprehension of Buddhist ideology and dogmatics, but it has been a contribution confined essentially to the first decade after the October Revolution. Among scholars of this epoch, today not sufficiently appreciated, a place of honour must go to F. I. Scerbatskoj (1866-1942), and immediately after him to his disciple, the Baltic Indologist O. O. Rosenberg, to both of whom we owe the clarification of such fundamental concepts of Buddhist metaphysics and eschatology as dharma and nirv?na, an original interpretation of the Abhidharma-kosa, etc. It is only in the succeeding period, which extends down to our 415</page><page sequence="3">own day, that Soviet Buddhologieal studies have concentrated almost exclusively on the historical, political and social aspects of Buddhism, that is to say, on its vicissitudes in the various countries of Asia, particularly, of course, in Central Asia, now part of the Soviet Union. A recent Outline History of Buddhism in Central Asia belongs to this context, as does the present treatise on monastic organizations in Ceylon. The former, an important documentary study, was presented by V. A. Litvinskij to the International Conference on the History, Archaeology and Culture of Central Asia in the Kushan Period, held at Dushanbe in 1968. Although it be evident from what we have already remarked that treatments such as the one we are now considering have little to contribute towards a more profound understanding of Bud? dhism as a religion and a doctrine, it is quite another question as to its social structures, the life of the bhiksu (Pali: bhikkhu) in the Ceylonese vih?ra, corresponding to the various phases of the island's history, and so on. For this social aspect of Buddhism our Author demonstrates on every page of her work an attention to detail and a conscientiousness in documentation that would be impossible to surpass. The phenomenol? ogy of religious community life in the Sinhalese world of Sri Lanka is introduced by a concise narration and critical interpretation of the island's and of Ceylonese society's memorable events. This historical sketch forms the first chapter of the book. It is then followed by four dense chapters, descriptive in character, but also these are developed on the basis of the individual historical periods experienced by this island. The second chapter examines the economic structure of the Buddhist sangha. Here we find ourselves in the field of a subject of study which goes beyond the ?sociology of religion? and becomes ? political economy ?, dealing as it does with the monastery's fundamental economic founda? tions and concrete forms of existence, with the vih?ra (Sinh: vehera) as landed proprietor, with the rules and laws regulating land tenure over the course of centuries, and the reciprocal relations of an economic and legal character between the sangha and the political and secular powers, and between the monastery and the lay environment in general. Our Author clarifies all these social and economic factors in exemplary fashion wherever such explanations are possible on the basis of the above-mentioned sources, always cited in detail in her footnotes. Relations between the king, the royal family, the high dignitaries of state, etc., on the one hand, and the sangha on the other, are examined in the second and third chapter under three headings: economic, political and ritual. As the Author has clearly seen, in societies like Ancient Ceylon, not yet distinguished by a developed differentiation, these three aspects appear intimately connected. From the documenta? tion offered by a great number of inscriptions we see the king and the ruling classes of the society in the role of generous benefactors in relation to the sangha, especially on the occasion of the great ritual festivities like the ariyavamsa and the giribhandap?ja. Sometimes their gifts consisted of whole villages, or at least the right to collect the taxes owing by the inhabitants of these villages, the monastyrskie derevni, as the Author calls them, while other villages were obliged to furnish the vih?ra with rice soup daily, or cloth, or building craftsmen, or even to support the slaves and servants belonging to the monastery glebe. To sum up, it is not a wholly edifying picture that the Soviet Author draws (always based upon literary and epigraphical sources, and perhaps not without a certain delight) of the Ancient Ceylonese vih?ra as a centre of profitable commercial and financial operations. As we have already had occasion to regret, the authentic religious and doctrinal substance which also lies concealed behind such ? human, all too human ? situations ? contingent and conditioned by the social and economic structures of the epoch ? is meth? odically ignored as not worth troubling about in the context of considerations of this nature. Nonetheless, even in a description such as that presented by Dr Semeka, which limits itself to a ? sociology of religion ? of Ancient Ceylonese Buddhism, certain traits of the picture she paints betray their unmistakeable religious and ?char? ismatic ? character, to use the term dear to Max Weber, particularly where the figure and the duties of the king are depicted. Quite correctly, the Author observes that ? The Kings of Ceylon during the entire period under consideration played a very substantial part in the life of the Buddhist community as protectors of the same. They had the right to participate actively in the internal life of the community ?. This is a ? right ? which derives from the ? charismatic? nature of the King, from his condition of potential cakra vartin, ? Wheel-King ?. Even little local kings were considered potentially as such. In fact this Ancient Indian ideal of the ? Dominator of the World ? recurs also, condensed in the above term (P?li: cakkavattin, Sinh.: sakviti), in Ceylonese inscriptions, e.g. in that recently (1963) published pertaining to Sri Virar?ja Nissanka and discovered on the ? place of his victory ?. In the delineation of the sacral character of the Ceylonese King the Author bases herself largely on the important researches and excavations of one of the great 416</page><page sequence="4">experts in Ancient Ceylon, A. M. Hocart, the author, after ten years of study in loco, of the famous treatise on Kingship (1927), whose continua? tion, Kings and Councillors (1936) also figures among the sources on which the Author draws for evidence and dates. We regret that the fundamental studies of J. Gonda on ancient Indian and Ceylonese kingship as an essential element of ancient Indian religiosity have been overlooked by our Author, both in the treatise and the bibliography. The structures of the Buddhist monastery provides the subject of the fourth chapter, one of the most detailed, but also one of the least ?original? insofar as the cosmological ideas at the base of the structure of the vih?ra had already been noted by not a few writers. Basing herself on this interpretative literature as well as on primary sources the Author traces the historico religious picture of the Ceylonese monastery, viewed as a miniature model of society and the cosmos. Also in this context her description repeats the researches of Hocart, who in a local scientific periodical, the Ceylon Journal of Science (Section G, I, 1924-1928) had analyzed, under the characteristic title of The Tour Quarters, the ancestral Indian conception of the universe as divided into four quarters, a cosmological concept which is reflected both in the organization of the ancient Sinhalese community as such and in that of the ? sangha of the four sides of the world ? as described in the above account. The biblio? graphy in reference to this cosmological picture is not even complete here insofar as such essential treatises as those of Ram Raz, E. B. Havell, W. Kirfel, S. Kramrisch, E. La Roche, etc., but above all that of W. M?ller (Die Heilige Stadt, 1961), are lacking. These cosmological conceptions are prevalently Brahmanic, differing however from Buddhistic ideas only in unimportant details, and present almost as a ? miniature model? in the ? sacral orientation ? of the Ceylonese vih?ra. On the whole one cannot deny that the Author is correct in affirming that some visibly archaic features of Indian Buddhism, e.g. the sacral symbolism connected with the tooth of the Buddha, almost in preference to his anthropomorphic representation, have been more integrally conserved in Ceylon than on the continent. Such archaisms are perhaps to be explained, as the Author maintains, by a reciprocal influence between Bud? dhism and pre-Buddhistic beliefs in the Ceylonese environment. The fifth and last section of the work provides an authentic Realienkunde of the monastery, so much so that here such ?concrete? things as the food of the monks, their dress, their daily life, their daily duties both sacred and profane, their way of teaching, etc. are discussed. The work concludes with a most useful glossary of Sanskrit, P?li and Sinhalese terms. In spite of the inadequacies which we have felt it our duty to point out, we do not hesitate to recommend this volume to scholars devoted to ? Buddhology ?. Gustav Glaesser</page></plain_text>
