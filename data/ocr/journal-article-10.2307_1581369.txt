<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Religion in Africa XX, 2 (1990) ORIKI ORISA: THE YORUBA PRAYER OF PRAISE BY THOMAS LINDON (St. Paul's College, Monrovia, Liberia) A recent article on prayer in the traditional religion of the Yoruba people of West Africa quotes with approval the complaint made by Shorter in 1975 that insufficient attention has been given to the prayers of African traditional religion generally. The writer goes on to treat of Yoruba petitionary prayer which he describes as "the totality of Yoruba traditional prayer par excellence". 1 Prayer, of course, can be understood in the narrow sense of requesting favours from beings belonging to the suprasensible world. In its wider sense, however, it includes such sentiments as praise and thanksgiving. The purpose of the present paper is to make a further contribution to the study of Yoruba traditional prayer by consider- ing in particular the Yoruba prayer of praise. Yoruba praise-prayer is found at its most elaborate in the communal worship of the orisa. The orisa are deified remote ancestors and/or natural forces.2 These divinities have inspired lengthy hymns of praise which are among the finest religious and literary products of Yoruba culture. The scale of this form of prayer can be judged from the description of a ceremony for Sango, the god of thunder, in Oyo Town, Nigeria. For the whole duration of a pro- cession in his honour a priestess chants his praises and continues to do so for some twenty minutes after it reaches the palace of the king.3 In this essay, the basic concept, form and content of Yoruba praise hymns are first examined, then some attributes in the hymns which are shared by many orisa are identified and, finally, the com- plete text of one praise hymn is presented by way of illustration. Concept, Form, Content The Yoruba word for praise is iyin or iyin logo. For a hymn of praise, however, the word used is oriki, understood in a plural</page><page sequence="2">Thomas Lindon sense. 'Oriki' has been variously translated as 'praises', 'praise poem', 'praise names', 'attributive names', 'verbal salutes', 'titles', etc.4 The Yoruba concept of religious praise can only be understood in the light of their custom of honouring people by reciting their orz'ki. As used in Yoruba social life, oriki have all got the same basic literary form and style. However, on the basis of the object praised there are three main categories: oriki ilu, for towns and townspeople, oriki orile, for lineages, and orz'ki inagie for promi- nent individuals whether living or dead.5 This last type, especially when the recipient of praise is a living ruler or public figure, is the one that most closely resembles orz'ki orisad, with which we are here concerned. As in other African societies, official singers and drummers were retained by Yoruba kings and nobles. Their chief function was to laud their master on specified occasions. Their tributes consisted principally of a proclamation of the names, deeds and character of the recipient and of some of his famous ancestors. A corresponding service for each orisd, regarded by the devotees as a king or queen having a noble past and still gloriously reigning, was carried out by his or her cult group.6 The present article is based on orz'ki of some of the more widely worshipped orisd, which have been recorded in different locations in S.W. Nigeria and the Republic of Benin.7 In oriki orisd, the names and deeds, status and power, points of character and appearance, likes and dislikes of the particular orisd are proclaimed in pithy statements. This is done without too much regard for logical or chronological sequence. Sometimes one can recognise units within the whole which have been formed by association of ideas or built around a particular image. However, the entire poem is best conceived as a loose collection of individual praises or oriki. An individual oriki can vary in length from a per- sonal name to a few sentences. Most of the praise is expressed in the third person. In other words, the orisd is referred to rather than addressed. The recital is enhanced by metaphor, allusion, analogue and other poetic devices. The orz'ki of a particular orisd are a set of individual orz'ki or praises loosely arranged like beads on a string. Individual orz'ki can be detached and used in isolation or as part of other forms of prayer such as petition or invocation.8 When they are recited together, however, they constitute the Yoruba prayer of praise at its best. In view of the loose unity of the hymn it would not be imperative that 206</page><page sequence="3">Oriki Orisdi: The Yoruba Prayer of Praise the order of praises or their number should remain constant. Allowance is made for the addition of new oriki in response to changing circumstances, as evidenced by the incorporation of oriki referring to Islam, Christianity and Western technology. On the other hand, older or'ki can survive change, for example, those refer- ring to human sacrifice, which is no longer practised. A salient feature of or{ki orisa is the use of a variety of appelations for the recipient of the praise. Apart from personal names, there are praise names or attributive names strictly so-called. These are short statements about the orisat which are used in the same manner as personal names. This means, for instance, that they can be the sub- ject or object of a sentence. One of the many praise names of Sango is, A-mu-gbe'-kn, interpreted as, 'The-one-who-fills-the-bush'. Other examples will be cited below. Secondly, there are names coming from the animal world, like Leopard, Elephant, Ram, Donkey, Hyena, Serpent, Vulture, Iworo bird. Thirdly, one finds titles which are derived from social institutions such as King (Qba), Chief (Olu or Bale.), War Chief (Baldgun), Queen (Ayaba), Head Woman (Iydldde). Other titles are based on kinship, expressing either kinship among the orisa themselves (Son of, Wife of, Hus- band of) or between the worshippers and their orisa (My Father, Our Mother, My Husband). This profusion of names and titles is well illustrated in a set of 171 orz'ki for Sangd in which he receives at least 30 different appela- tions some of which are repeated several times. In a set of 39 orz'ki, Esu, the trickster god, is given 7 different appelations; one of them is repeated 9 times.9 The multiple use of a variety of names and titles for the same orisa adds, no doubt, to the artistic quality of his oriki. But it does more. Given the significance of all names in Yoruba culture, this element must be seen as an important ingre- dient of praise. It repeatedly focuses the attention of the worship- pers on the person of the odrisa and helps to direct the whole recital as a prayer to him. The praise hymn may have a short introduction, such as a simple expression of respect and worship and a number of praise names and titles which are used as acclamations. Worship and acclama- tion may be repeated at some points in the body of the hymn and at the end. This feature, also, has the effect of focusing attention on the orisa as personally present. A set of or'ki for Sango begins thus: 207</page><page sequence="4">Thomas Lindon Iba Sango. Olu koso, jigi l(z) oko, ewon. (V.356/1-2) Sdngo, I bow down. Chief of Koso! Strong-in-the-farm! Chain! The body of a praise hymn is composed mainly of third person statements about the particular orisd, each of which constitutes an individual oriki. The descriptions are decidedly anthropomorphic. Great forces are compressed into a human frame and given a history and many names. The attention to physical appearance extends to details of the genital organs, dress, gait and the texture of the skin. To do justice to the gods in human form much use is made of hyperbole; this gives an epic tone to the poem as a whole. Of Ogu'n, the god of iron and war, it is said: (a) T(i) o n' ir'inwo aya 6 bi egbeje omo. (V.181/21) The one who has 400 wives and 1,400 children. (b) A m(u) erin bo or'. (V.175/9) The one who uses an elephant to worship his head.10 And of Sango': (a) A panrittete ogoo oke' wo (i)l nild. (V.357/27) The one who enters a big house with 160 large sacks balanced on his head. (b) Ati Ibaidn 6 j6 gbangu r(e) Oyo. (V.347/65) He does the gbangu dance all the way from Ibadan to OyQ (50 km). The praise chanter moves freely among the three phases of the divinity's existence: the mythical past when the orisa lived among men on earth; his present divine involvement in nature and human affairs; the continuing worship offered to him by his devotees in which he is mystically encountered. In order to understand and appreciate oriki orisd it is necessary to keep these three aspects in mind. First, the mythical past. The mythical exploits of the orisd are encapsulated in cryptic orz'ki. One of the myths of Ogun describes the key role played by him when at the beginning of time he set out from heaven with other orisd to occupy the newly created earth. His iron implements were the only ones strong enough to cut a way through the primeval bush. This is the background to the following prestigious or'ki: Apadtki (i)male, (a)ldkaiye, o sin (i)male. (V.192/3) Principal orisd, owner of the world, he walks before the orisa. 208</page><page sequence="5">Orzki Orisa: The Yoruba Prayer of Praise The subsequent adventures of Ogun in Ire Town, of which he became king; are echoed in many of his oriki. Turning to the story of Qya, goddess of the tempest and faithful wife of Sdngo, we find that she is admired for having committed suicide on hearing of the death of her husband: Oya aroju b(d) oko ku. (V.415/1) The courageous Qya died with her husband. The controversy surrounding the death of Sango himself has given birth to one of his most famous praise names, Qba-ko-so (The-king- did-not-hang). It epitomises the vehement denial by his followers that he actually committed suicide as alleged by his enemies. Some of the orz'ki in this mythical category can be extremely allusive and without a knowledge of the accompanying myth they may be completely unintelligible. This is particularly true of some of the praise names referred to above under the heading of appela- tions. Beier reminds us that the full interpretation of orzki of this kind may be known only to initiates." For them the myth-based orizki act as mnemonics recalling whole stirring episodes to their minds and enabling them to make these part of their worship. Secondly, the contemporary involvement of the orisd in the world. This accounts for a large proportion of oriki. These are more easily grasped, especially if one bears in mind the general area of human activity and the forces of nature with which the particular orisd is associated. Besides being proclaimed a bloodthirsty killer in his capacity as god of war, Ogun is hailed in his oriki as one who cir- cumcises, 'eats' hair and 'eats' wood, i.e., through the medium of iron implements. Not surprisingly, the involvement of Ogun in the forge, the place where iron instruments are made, is given promi- nence. In the following or'ki, assembled from various hymns, the wheezing of the bellows, the glow of the flying sparks and the ring- ing sound of the hammer on iron and anvil, when wielded by the heavenly blacksmith, are vividly reproduced: (a) Awo dofi (i)run kan s' (i)mun fon fenfen. (V.183/19) Secret who blows nasally with a tuft of hair in his nose. (b) Ogu'n aldgbe.de ab' finimun. (V.194/5) Ogun of the blacksmiths has mucus in his nose. (c) Ogudn elewiri fdkd-fiki. (V.187/51) Ogun, owner of the bellows that make a 'faka-fiki' sound. 209</page><page sequence="6">Thomas Lindon (d) Ogun a jz da wura 1(f) agbede. (V. 187/53) Ogun awakes and makes gold flow in the forge. (e) Ogu'n odimudimu baba ddwu. (V. 190/30) Massive Ogun, father of the hammer. (f) Ogun aldgbe.de aregun 1(i) agbede irin. (V.188/60) Ogun the blacksmith salutes when striking the iron in the forge. (g) Ogun alegbede orun. (V.188/61) Ogu'n the blacksmith of heaven. For his part, Sdngo does in an anthropomorphic way what thunder and lightning do. He laughs without opening his mouth and his chest burns like the growth at the foot of the palm tree. The panic caused in a Yoruba town by the mounting threat of a thunderstorm is conveyed in the form of a progressive parallelism: Koyi wo (i)lu' (aw)a gbo ise re lehin odi. Koyi wo (i)lu' batle ndi Ifd. Koyi Qo (i)lu'. bale. nbere agbo. (V.360/16-18) He has not yet entered the town and already we hear his cry outside the wall. He has not yet entered the town and already the chief is con- sulting the Ifa diviner. He has not yet entered the town and already the chief is demanding a ram (to sacrifice to Sdngd). A storm at sea is conceived as a battle between Qya, the tempest goddess, and Oldkun, the ocean divinity: Qya gudu-gudu l(f) okun a b(i) Oldkun jd ma'djbi. (V.416/3) Qya fights fiercely in the sea with Oldkun without being in the wrong. The image of a river in spate is conjured up by the following or'ki of Yemoja. a water goddess and mother of iSngo: (a) Yemoja a lobi Yij wo (i)lu. (V.297/6) Yemoja whirls when the tornado comes into the country. (b) Yemoja ti bznud ba gddd e. (V.297/8) When Yemoja is angry she destroys bridges. Qsun, a river goddess and wife of Sdngo, is credited with providing nice food: Iyda old (o)mi tutu% a bz'm(o) osun dundun. (V.428/16) The mother of fresh water gives birth to fresh vegetables. 210</page><page sequence="7">Oriki Orisd: The Yoruba Prayer of Praise The concept of water as the source of life is extended to human fer- tility and underlies oriki in which Yemoja and Qsun are recognised as great mothers who make other mothers fertile, and as great physi- cians who cure the sick with cold water. The third major source of orz'ki is the ongoing cult. The ritual actions and ceremonial dress of priests, mediums and devotees are attributed to the orisd. The particular musical instruments used in his cult belong to him and figure in his oriki. The cultic identifica- tion of orisa and worshipper becomes most explicit when an initiate is possessed by the orisa and goes into a trance during communal worship. This is the background to the following orz'ki of Sdngo: (a) A kq (i)gba nz'waju on'ibata Bale Koso. (V.351/109) The Chief of Koso (Sango) sings 200 songs before the bdtd drummers. (b) O jd gan beju orun wo. Aki Rabata ba won jo. (V.355/162-163) He dances with precision, casting a sly look at the sky. Aki Rabata (Sdngo) dances with the people. The custom of using the igbin drum in the worship of the creator god, Obatald, is defended by his devotees in the following tripartite orzki': Niania l(i) a jo (i)gbin lddrin. Enikan ki i jd (i)gbin du'n (a)wa. Ohun ti (a)waje b' a(wa) I(i) 6 mo eni. (V.470/18-20) He dances here in lively fashion to the sound of the igbin drum. Someone who does not dance to the igbin drum will be unhappy with us. We know the things with which we are born. The materials of sacrifice are often alluded to in the orz'ki as the things the orisd like to eat. The orisda are also identified with their cultic emblems. For instance, Ogun is hailed as Edan, olu irin (Edan, largest lump of iron). This praise name refers to one of his most sacred symbols.12 Another interesting example of the influence of cult on orz'ki is found in the worship of the farm god, Orisd-Oko. A tree which bears sweet-tasting fruit in abundance is planted close to his shrine, apparently as a symbol of human fertility. This cultic fact has given rise to an elaborate praise name for this orisd': Olosdn ko borule, kee siin bal, which is translated as, 'Owner-of-the- 211</page><page sequence="8">Thomas Lindon white- star-apple-which-dropped-on-the-roof-before- rolling-on-to- the-ground. 13 The three foregoing sources of oriki-the past, the present and the cult-must not, of course, be understood as watertight com- partments. They influence, complement and shade into one another, and at times all three merge in one and the same oriki. Together they constitute a reliable key to the full import of the ellip- tical statements that make up the praise hymn. The character of each orisa is proclaimed in his orz'ki and it too is related to his mythical past, present activity and continuing cult. His character is discovered and recalled in the myths, danced and mimed in the cult and experienced in the successes and failures, in the joys and sorrows of everyday life. The oriki unfold the characters of the orisd either in explicit statements or indirectly by the way they describe such things as their actions and reactions, their mode of dress and bodily movements, and the attitudes they arouse in others. For example, the attitude aroused by S.oponna', the god of smallpox, is one of sheer terror. He is easily offended and his punishment is of the cruellest kind. People do not dare to speak openly about him; they are compelled to use circumlocution so as to avoid pronouncing his personal name. This is the message of the following or'ki: (a) Awa ko fo (e)ni ki 6 mo pa (e)nije. (V.260/2) We do not talk about someone who can kill and eat people. (b) Awon t(i) 6 bu oko eni l(i) ond oko a(wa) ru (o)ku e. de boli. Those who insult the husband of someone (i.e. .Sponnd) on the way to the farm will be carried back as swollen corpses, (V.260/8) The extremely irritable disposition of Esuz is illustrated in the following triad, which shows him venting his ill-humour on inno- cent objects: On nad ni b nu g so igikzgz ki 6 wo. Ti d b' binu ti' ba' ta kuta ni (i)gbd okudta ndd si mda see. Ti 6 bad rbinu' ni fi awo kanyinkanyin jdkd. (V. 127/20-22) When angry he will strike any tree and knock it down. If he is annoyed he stamps on a stone in the forest and the stone begins to bleed. If he is annoyed he sits on the skin of an ant. 212</page><page sequence="9">Oriki Orisa: The Yoruba Prayer of Praise By contrast, Qbta'ld is endowed with the gravity and self-control that befit his role as royal judge: A ddke' st'ri'szirt dd (e)ni 1(i) ejo. O wo (e)ni pepepe bi eni (k)o ri (e)ni. (V.466/5-6) He remains quiet and judges people quietly. He looks at one out of the corner of his eye like someone who does not see. It is clear that, in delineating character, orz'ki ori.sd do not gloss over qualities which might be considered less attractive, less com- plimentary. In this sense the attitude is objective. In Yoruba religion the gods are what they are warts and all. The trickery and deceit of Esu are as much part of his orz'ki as is his activity as protec- tor of house, marketplace and farm. The dossier of Obta'ld includes his weakness for palm wine which caused him to produce albinos and cripples and, according to some sources, led to his replacement as creator by Odiduwd. Yet, in every case, the overall thrust of the or'ki is to stress the importance of the orisda whose praises are being chanted. Or'ki orisa are not without touches of humour and sarcasm. Qsun is gently chided for being more concerned with washing her jewels than with washing her children. (V.431/4) The following oriki Sdngd, which emphasises the impact of thunder and lightning, is even-handed in ridiculing both the followers of Mohammed and the worshippers of Ifd, the god of divination: Olelenle, a le 'Male to sz msdalds'. A le babaldwo md dtrd kofd. 14 The fearsome one who frightens a Moslem so that he urinates in the mosque; Frightens the babalawo (diviner) so much that he runs away, leaving his Ifd behind. It is perhaps appropriate that Esi, the trickster god, should inspire some of the most amusing orz'ki, including the following: Bara fi (i)mun fon awon sebi' oko lo rnsz. Ero palemo wara wara. (V. 131/8) When Bara blows his nose the people think the train is about to leave. They get ready very quickly. Before concluding this section on the basic concept, form and 213</page><page sequence="10">Thomas Lindon content of orz'ki oriisd, it is important to draw attention to the kind of petitionary prayer that is sometimes found in praise hymns. Just as some individual oriki may be attached to formal prayers of peti- tion, short petitions may likewise be inserted in oriki hymns. Such petitions are usually of a general nature and flow from the affir- mative praise statements which constitute the bulk of orz'ki prayer. For instance, a sequence of or'ki about the extremely quarrelsome nature of Sdngo, who takes revenge on his enemies, is followed by the simple plea: Md bd mi jd, mi o3 si ninnu' won. (Sdngo) do not quarrel with me; I am not one of them.'5 In a hymn of 41 orz'ki of Qsun only 3 contain a request, in each case to be given a child. Many of the available praise hymns have no trace of petition in them at all. It seems therefore that petitionary prayer plays a minor role in or'ki prayer as such. However, as with the recurring appelations and expressions of homage referred to above, the short petitions, when they do occur, help to ensure the prayerful character of the hymn as a whole; besides, they prepare the way for the more detailed requests which normally follow in the ceremonies. Common Attributes In the various ways indicated in the previous section, the praise chanter paints a picture of the particular o3risd for the latter's pleasure and that of the worshippers. With random strokes the por- trait is formed. The image created is broadly consistent and serves to individualise the o3risd in terms of character, activity and appearance. While the main thrust of oriki orisa is to highlight the distinctive traits of the orisd who is being worshipped, a comparative study reveals some family resemblances. In particular, one comes to appreciate the distinction which the Yoruba make between the 'hard' or 'hot' orisd and the 'white' orisd, between the ferocity of Ogdun, Sdngo, Oya, $Sponnd and the gentleness and patience of Qsun, Obatald and Ifd. Despite this rather sharp division, however, there are a number of important attributes predicated of the orisd in their orz'ki which appear to cut across all distinctions. These common attributes 214</page><page sequence="11">Orzki Orisd. The Yoruba Prayer of Praise deserve attention. For one thing they help to explain why orisa with very different characters and propensities are worshipped with equal enthusiasm and devotion by their respective cult groups. The first common factor among the orisa is their royal status and power. This is affirmed of many of them in their earthly state and probably of all of them in their present divine existence. In their oriki they are hailed as kings and queens. Verger notes that in the ceremonies the priestesses who represent female orisa such as Osun, Yemoja and Oya are dressed as queens wearing crowns with fringes of pearls which cover the face, the kind of crown which is reserved for Yoruba high kings.16 But perhaps the most prestigious title, and one which is widely distributed, is that of lord or owner of the world (oluhaiye, onz'lazye). It designates the extent of the kingdom and there- fore of the influence and power of the orisa. The notion of 'lord-of- the-world' is implied in the following oriki which refer respectively to Qsun, Sdngo and Obatald: (a) Kos' (i)bi t(i) a(wa ko) gbe mo Osun p(e) 6 tdbi 1(f) oba. There is no place where Qsun, who is powerful as a king, is not known. (V.424/29) (b) Gbogbo azye ni fi (o)rl ti oba. (V.381/6) The whole world prostrates to the king. (c) Akan (i)le md ni ipekun. (V.477/27) There is no limit to his activity on earth. The orisa is recognised by his worshippers as the powerful ruler of the world. It is known that his power extends beyond his field of special interest. For instance, even Sdngo is credited with making the barren woman fertile and the fertile woman more fertile. (V.371/69-70) As well as referring to the orisa as 'lord' (oluwa, oldwo), the praise chanter uses kinship terms like 'my father', 'our mother', 'my husband'. Again this practice is followed for all orisa. It attests a special bond between the worshipper and the orisa and it connotes a certain obligation in piety on the part of the orisa to use his great power for the benefit of his household. This belief inspires the kind of confidence that is expressed in the following oriki, which is shared by Qbata'ld, Sdngo, Osun and Ogun: A b' owo gbogbogbo ti yo omo re nznu ofin.17 With his long hands he rescues his child who has fallen into a trap. 215</page><page sequence="12">Thomas Lindon In the same vein, it is asserted in other oriki that Ogun and Sdngo will assist those who offer sacrifices and that Oya "protects her friends on earth". 8 A second common trait of the orisd which is proclaimed in their oriki is a lively concern for the observance of the moral order. They are prepared to use their great power to punish wrongdoers. The role of Sdngo as dispenser of justice is particularly marked. The impertinent, the obstinate, the quarrelsome and, above all, the liar incur his wrath. His detestation of lies is related to his function as heavenly witness in oathtaking, a role which he shares with Ogu'n and which is alluded to in the following orz'ki: At(i) Ogun dti Sdngo ko fi (i)di han enikan. (V.345/36) Neither Ogun nor Sdngo reveals any secret. While Ogun is said to kill both the thief and the owner of the thing stolen, other or'ki suggest that the former is more likely to be his vic- tim. One or'ki reproduces the sound that is made when Ogun punishes a criminal: 0 izi izi o fi ojiu onirdn po (i)le. (V. 189/18) He makes an 'o izi izi' sound as he wipes the ground with the face of the criminal. The same idea is expressed in a very similar way in oriki Qbatald which show that he loses his customary patience and self-control when confronted with moral evil: O fo osikd l(z) oju afota 0 gbo (i)dz osikd bi eni gbo oke'. (V.467/16-17) He smashes the eye of the evildoer completely. He drags the buttocks of the evildoer along the ground like a large sack. The dreaded punishment meted out by .Sponnd to evildoers has been so identified with him that from being an earth god he has become almost exclusively a god of smallpox. This change of role is reflected in his or'ki; very few of them associate him with the earth and its fertility. The female orisd are no less involved in punishing evil. Qya beats the head of the liar on the ground and tears his intestines apart with her thumb. Even the amiable Qsun pierces the belly of the liar with her bell and causes the lazy person to run for his life.'9 216</page><page sequence="13">Oriki Orisd: The Yoruba Prayer of Praise Idowu is appalled at the idea of the lawless Sdngo being given responsibility for the moral order. He thinks this prerogative has been stolen from the predecessor of Sangd, Jdktta.20 This may be true but one must also take into account the status given to the royal iSngo cult in the empire of Old Oyo where it was used to buttress political control. One should also remember that the fact that the orisd are recognised as guardians of good behaviour is not necessarily a tribute to their exemplary conduct but rather a recognition of their ability to inflict punishment. That the orisd are above the law is accepted in a number of orzki.21 Finally, the readiness of the orisd to punish is probably seen by their devotees mainly as a protection against external and internal enemies and, therefore, not as a cause for fear but for rejoicing and praising. The third common attribute of the orisd which is revealed in their oriki is their extraordinary medical power. There is a special god of medicine, Osanyin, but many of his fellow orisd are also actively engaged in the manufacture and use of medicine. Here one must understand medicine in the comprehensive Yoruba sense of the term. In aim, it can be beneficial or injurious; in scope, it is con- cerned not only with health and sickness but with the many bless- ings and misfortunes that come to humankind; in application, it has both a physical and mystical dimension. The concept embraces both magic devices and herbal remedies. This global concept is expressed by the Yoruba word oogun, and this is the word that appears most frequently in oriki which link orisa with medicine. One is left to deduce which kind of medicine is envisaged in a particular case. Another word that is very prominent in this context is dod. This is the name of a small gourd which is used in Yorubaland as a container for medicine in powder or liquid form. The substances from which medicines are made by orisd include leaves, roots, the heads of animals and human heads. Osanyin is known as Ewe-gbogbo-kiki-ogutn (One-who-turns-all-leaves-into- medicine). $.ponnd is one of those who use human beings for medicine. In his case the use of medicine to bring sickness and death is vividly portrayed. He is depicted wearing a garment that is covered with tiny gourds and carrying poisoned arrows. He is called A-run-'mo-looguin-ddntu (One-who-causes-medicines-to-be- thrown-away). The reason for this is the ritual prescription that when someone contracts smallpox all medicines in his house must be thrown out, so that he is left at the mercy of .Sponnd and his medicine.22 217</page><page sequence="14">Thomas Lindon Sdngo is called Oloogun (Owner-of-medicine) and Oba-Oso (Sorcerer-King). Another praise name is Ewe-gbe-mi (The-leaf- supports-me). For medicine he has recourse to the leaves of his special tree, the ay.on, but he also makes use of the heads of his human victims for the same purpose. His medical arsenal includes a magic belt.23 His partner, Qya, employs a special charm called dkdrdbd which makes her more powerful than the Dahomeans. (V.414/6-7) As pointed out in the previous section, Yemoja and Osun are renowned for the curative properties of the water in their rivers. Besides, Qsun has 200 slaves to look after her large farm of medicinal leaves.24 In the following triple orz'ki, we are given a glimpse of the orisa as she goes about her task of preparing potent medicines: 0 gba ooguin leri' pd sd. O6sa ti nrz kikere add yewo' O gun ooguzn, gun oogun, s(e) odd karawu (V.425/39-41) She takes the medicine that is on the roof post in order to use it. The orisd who finds a little gourd and looks carefully inside. She pounds and pounds the medicine and makes the mortar sound. In Yoruba everyday life, the priests of Ifa or Qruinmild, the god of divination, have the important function of prescribing and dispensing remedies for their clients. Of their orisd it is said, A jeju oogun ('He is even more powerful than medicine'). A similar tribute is paid to Ogun.25 In this section, three common attributes that emerge from a com- parative study of oriki o3risd have been identified. They are: univer- sal power exercised for the benefit of devotees; a punitive role for infringement of the moral and civil law; extraordinary medical expertise. The second and third qualities are closely related to the first. The punishment of lawbreakers is an exercise of executive and judicial power and a manifestation of the ability of the orisd to pro- tect his devotees against unruly neighbours. And the medical pro- wess is a symbol or instrument of the enormous power which each orisd enjoys for good or evil. The faith of the devotees in the omnipotence and benevolence of their orisd which is already implied in the or'ki receives its fullest practical expression in prayers of peti- 218</page><page sequence="15">Or'ki Orisd.

The man who is very close like the side of the road. 16. Profound respect. This hymn in praise of Esuz comes from the Lagos area.27 It has been chosen as an overall example of or/ki orisa because, although short, it has a certain completeness about it and serves to illustrate many of the points which have been made in the two previous sec- tions. Its completeness of form is shown especially in the typical introduction and conclusion, while the completeness of content is evident in the well-rounded description of Esui which it manages to convey in just 16 lines. The introduction in 11. 1 &amp; 2 consists of the classical Yoruba expression of respect for elders, ibd, followed by personal and praise names of the orisa. The body of the hymn follows no recognisable logical order, although 11. 8-10, 11. 11 &amp; 12, and possibly 11. 14 &amp; 15 form small praise units. This is in keeping with the loose structure of or'ki orisa. Let us now apply the criteria of myth, current activity and cult to the content of the hymn. In 1. 5, Esu is given the title of King of Ketu which is situated in the western part of Yorubaland and incorporated in the present- day Republic of Benin. This oriki is based on a myth which tells us that Esui began his earthly career in Ile-Ife, the cradle of the Yoruba race. He was refused a crown there, so he went to Ketu and made himself its first king.28 In 1. 7, the chanter moves eastward across Yorubaland to Benin City, Nigeria. Here again one would expect a mythical basis for the oriki. Although listed in the Yoruba myths of origin as descended from Odiduwad, the Yoruba progenitor, the Binis are a separtate people with their own language. However, it is a matter of historical record that Esuz is among their gods. The hymn reminds us of several of the contemporary activities of Esu. His concern with the farm is enshrined in his praise name in 1. 2. His involvement in the market is highlighted in 1. 14. He remains there to the end and then goes home with the people, for he is protector of the house compound as well. Little wonder that the next line of the hymn proclaims his all-pervasive presence! The troublesome side of Esu is not forgotten. According to 1. 6, he is in charge of the spirits that cause the death of babies. He is regarded as the cause of misunderstandings that lead to conflict; of the chicanery and injustice, the anomalies and absurdities that are part and parcel of life in this world. This belief is reflected in 11. 11 &amp; 12, which focus attention on the clubs and cudgels that are 220</page><page sequence="17">Oriki Orisd: The Yoruba Prayer of Praise wielded in local fights, and in 11. 9 &amp; 10, which indicate what can happen in court cases. The character behind activities of this kind is one that is quar- relsome, mischievous and lawless. This conception is reinforced in 11. 3 &amp; 8. According to 1. 3, Esu is so quarrelsome he actually goes around trying to start a row. L. 8 illustrates his lawless nature by imagining him using his eyes to shed blood instead of tears. The influence of cult on orzki is also evident in the hymn. L. 13, which refers to the drum that is proper to the worship of Esu, is obviously cult oriented. L. 4 points to the key position occupied by Esu as controller of access to the supreme God by both the other orisd and human beings. This role is acknowledged in the cult of every orisd by offering to Esu a portion of every sacrifice.29 The mention of short trousers has in mind the cult images of Esui which show him dressed in this way. The clubs and cudgels mentioned in 11. 11-12 have the same referent.30 In order to emphasise the smallness of stature of this orisd, 1. 14 takes the basic Yoruba word for 'short' (kurui), duplicates the first syllable (kukudru) and then pronounces the duplicated form three times! But the hymn leaves us in no doubt that this tiny man is very powerful. He is given the title of king. He occupies the exalted posi- tion of heavenly gatekeeper. His many clubs and cudgels (11. 11-12) are symbols of his ability to fight and to punish wrongdoers, especially those guilty of ritual offences such as failure to offer pre- scribed sacrifices. Besides, he is renowned for his powerful magic. L. 6 informs us that he is equipped with medicine from the moment he awakes in the morning. We know that many of his statues are decorated with tiny medicine gourds. All this prepares us for the final line of the hymn. It expresses the sentiment of the opening line but in a more intense way. The addi- tion of the superlative to-td-to to iba turns it into a greeting that is reserved for orisa. Conclusion The foregoing description and analysis of oriki orisd leads to the conclusion that they should be given recognition as a distinct and important form of prayer in Yoruba traditional religion. Chanted in the mode proper to the particular odrias and played on his special drums, they constitute an integral part of the cult which marks the 221</page><page sequence="18">Thomas Lindon annual festival of the orisa and other important occasions. A mastery of the or'ki is an essential qualification for becoming an initiate of the orisd. The or'ki are the precious patrimony of the cult group. The encyclopedic character of the praise hymn may make it sound like a long-winded, unorganised, though colourful, state- ment of belief, especially as it mostly refers to the orisa in the third person. It is indeed a repository of belief and information about the orisa. However, it is never just that nor principally that. It is an act of homage to someone who is regarded as a most powerful king or queen and a benevolent father or mother. It is a prolonged greeting. When the orz'ki are being chanted it is said, Nwon n'ki' ri'sa ("They are greeting the god"). The underlying note of homage and greeting is revealed in the recurring acclamation of the orisa with personal and praise names, and various titles. Oriki orisd are regarded as efficacious prayer. The effects of reciting the praises of an ancestor are described by Babalola. It makes a family proud of its pedigree. It can cure the sick and insane and pacify crying babies. It gratifies the progenitor in the spirit world and moves him to shower blessings on his offspring.31 Orizki orisd have similar effects. They are often chanted in the initial stages of the religious ceremony. They attract the attention and good will of the oriis and even, in some cases, induce him to appear among his people through the phenomenon of possession and trance. The oriis is pleased. He recognises these people as his own sons and daughters. He accepts their homage and sacrifices. He is put in a generous mood and is disposed to granting their petitions. We even read of oriki being chanted to pacify orisd when they have become agitated in the person of their mediums.32 Orizki orisd also constitute the standard Yoruba prayer of thanks for favours received. For the worshippers, the immediate effect of the chanting of orz'ki orisd in the religiously charged atmosphere of communal worship is to create a sense of family pride and of spiritual elation. Sometimes the intensity of the spiritual elation is such as to cause the identifica- tion of the worshipper with the orisai in the state of trance. Oriki are the basic form of Yoruba poetry and orz'ki orisac are the most elaborate of all. They mirror the world of man and nature, of human society and its environment, giving unparalleled scope to creative imagination. But above all they are a form of prayer. They harmonize with other prayer forms that occur in the worship and 222</page><page sequence="19">Oriki Orisd. The Yoruba Prayer of Praise they are sometimes joined to them to produce a composite prayer. But whether they are so joined or proclaimed in their pure form they constitute the Yoruba version of that universal mode of prayer which is categorized as praise. The Yoruba way of praising their orisd is of a piece with their way of praising the living and the dead-their lineages, towns and distinguished individuals. The dif- ference is not in kind but in degree. Orzki orisd are a form of prayer by which the Yoruba praise their gods in a manner that is in com- plete conformity with their culture. NOTES 1.

I am particularly indebted to the work of Pierre Verger for the texts. His op. cit., 1957, provides the most extensive written collection of oriki orisd that I am aware of. He gives the Yoruba texts with a French translation. In some cases, both for Verger and other authors quoted, I have modified the given translation, usually in the direction of a more literal rendering of the Yoruba original. I have also added tone marks to the quoted texts where it was considered necessary or useful to do so. References to Verger which are carried in the narrative will follow this model: V. 343/15 is to be understood as referring to Pierre Verger, op. cit., 1957, page 343, line 15. 8.
