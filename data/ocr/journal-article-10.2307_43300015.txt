<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Highest Deities of the Tibetan Bon Religion* B. I. Kuznetsov Translated from the Russian by Stanley Frye The Biography of gShen-rab (Dmura, or Mathora) to whom is attributed the founding of the Bon religion is entitled "The Key to the Collected (or the 'collection of words' - bk'a 'dus-pa) Precious Tradition ( Dus-pa rin-po-che'i rgyud gzer-mig). This work is one of the canonical Bon texts, a fact which indicates that its author, if not the teacher gShen-rab himself, was at least one of his close disciples, although the text itself contains no data concerning a specific individual as author. The Tibetan Bon tradition affirms that the Biography of gShen-rab was compiled in its basic form in Iran-Elam (' ol-mo rtag-gzigs ) and was handed down from generation to generation by the disciples and followers of gShen-rab. The original text of the biography was written in Phoenician ( spungs ), i.e. in an Aramaic script which was used in the country of Elam. It was translated into Tibetan from the Zhang-Zhung language which was once spoken in the northern districts of Tibet.1 According to the Bon tradition, the Biography of Shen-rab was a for- bidden book during the reign of King Khri-srong (8th century) and in 753 it was hidden in a cemetery in the location of bSam-yas in Central Tibet. It remained secreted for approximately 144 years when it was removed by the Bon priest gSer-mig.2 The question of the antiquity of the work is not of great importance. What is of special interest is the data which it contains. The fact that for many centuries the Vedas and the Avesta existed only in oral tradition by no means minimises their value. Future analysis of the Bon materials and their identification and interpretation will show whether this Tibetan monu- ment is valuable enough to employ in the study of the history and cultures of the peoples of the East. We are of the opinion that the Biography of gShen-rab is exceedingly ancient and the affirmation of the Tibetans that it has come down to us in an edition of the 9th century does not contradict what is known about the work although we find nothing in the contents which would relate its publi- *This article appeared in Issledovaniya po istorii i filologii central ' not azii (Research on the History and Philology of Central Asia), Academy of Sciences of the USSR, Siberian Branch (Ulan-Ude, 1976), pp. 142-148.</page><page sequence="2">48 THE TIBET JOURNAL cation even to the 13th century. We cannot go beyond this because somewhat later the complete Biography of gShen-rab was published in Tibet in twelve volumes ( gZi-brjid ) on the basis of the former. There are, however, direct indications in the version which we have used that point to its having existed in Tibet as long ago as the 8th century. One of the later chapters of the book (chapter 12) is a product of local Tibetan creative genius and states that the Teacher gShen-rab came to Tibet where he preached and propagated his religion after which he went to the land of Zhang-Zhung (Northern Tibet). This information concerning the sequence of the appearance of Bon first in Tibet, then in Zhang-Zhung is obviously tendentious and has a single purpose: to show Tibetan priority and its consequent primary role in the field of religion. There is no basis for this. The Bon tradition is entirely connected with the country of Zhang-Zhung, not with Tibet, as is proven by historical facts, especially the migration of Iranian tribes from the north- east of Iran, from Sogdiana, to the northern borders of Tibet where many of them mixed with the Tibetan population of this region in the first centuries of our era. It was from these Iranians that the Tibetans received the Bon religion and other aspects of Iranian culture.3 Secondly, this claim of Tibet to priority in the field of the Bon religion could have taken place only in the 7th-8th centuries during the period of the creation of the Tibetan empire with its claims to hegemony in Central Asia. Later, with the decline of the Tibetan state and the increased role of Buddhism in Central Tibet, the question of priority lost all meaning and would not have arisen. Let us go on to the identification of the names of the three most important divinities of the Tibetan Bon religion. Ahura Mazda: gShen-rab's supreme deity was the Wise Bumkhri {Sangjsj-po ' Bum-khri ) who is sometimes called the King of Being (srid-pďi rgyal-pó). Differing from the second half of the name, the word Sangs-po is Tibetan as is shown both by the typical Tibetan ending po and the typical position of the adjective. The word Sangs-po approximates in meaning the word sangs-rgyas which is the Tibetan equivalent of the Sanskrit "Buddha" and means "awakened, awake", i.e. "wise man, sage" and is formed from the verb sangs-pa - "to awaken." In one of the very brief Bon prayers the divinity Bumkhri is called the "highest of the gods, the lion which utters the highest wisdom.4 In this prayer, however, his name is translated into Sanskrit as "Manjusrï-ghoça". Etymolocally this name obviously has no relation to the Wise Bumkhri consisting, as it does, of the words "soft voice" and "glory" although the Tibetan translation does have some basis inasmuch as Mañjusrl is the god (bodhisattva) of wisdom among the Buddhists. The second component of the name of the supreme Bon deity, Bumkhri,</page><page sequence="3">THE HIGHEST DEITIES OF THE TIBETAN BON RELIGION 49 is a transcription of a foreign word. In the above-mentioned prayer this name is given to us in Tibetan script in the unknown "sacred language" as " Sangs-po ' bum-khri " and this is translated into Tibetan as "the lion which utters the highest truth." It is not strange that the Tibetans themselves did not consider the word sangs-po to be Tibetan as it is found in the Bon books only in combination with ' Bum-khri . When, occasionally, it is used independently, it means Bumkhri, i.e. indicates the divinity himself. The word, bum-khri consists of two word-syllables which in Tibetan mean "a hundred-thousand {'bum) and ten-thousand (khri). Another meaning of the latter word is "chair, seat, throne", i.e. as often happens in Tibetan, a foreign name is given not in exact transcription, but Tibetanized, although the combination of these syllables is meaningless and untranslatable. Taking into consideration the fact that the Wise Bumkhri was, in all probability, an ancient Iranian god, it is not difficult to conjecture that the Tibetan transcription of the name corresponds to the Iranian Mazda Ahura, i.e. the Wise Lord. The Tibetan transcription of Bumkhri may correspond, although very approximately to the Iranian ahura (lord). We know from Chinese sources that as far back as the 6th century A.D. the name of the chief divinity of Tibet was pronounced something like "ahura" as is evident from an ancient Chinese transcription.5 Thus bumkhri ( ukhari ) is a later distortion which originated from ahura . It seems quite evident that the Tibetans translated the Iranian mazda (wise) as sangs-po and left the word ahura untranslated. For the sake of comparison we may point out that the Indian name Šakyamuni corresponds to the Tibetan variant Sakya-thub-pa where the second half of the name is a translation of the word muni into Tibetan. It was impossible to translate the name ahura because in Tibetan there was no concept of "God" which corresponded to the Iranian concept or of the words "lord, master" as epithets of the Supreme God. The word lha - "divinity, god" in Tibetan Bon mythology indicates a special category of spirits or heavenly beings and originally the ancient Tibetan gods were the spirits of the mountains, lakes, rivers, etc. When the Iranian divinities became part of this category they occupied exclusive and supreme positions as is clearly evident from their titles. They are called not simply "gods" - lha , but "king of being, god-priest, mother of the eternal sphere." Let us now consider to what extent the description of this chief Bon deity in the Tibetan sources corresponds to what we know about the Iranian Ahura Mazda. Contemporary Tibetan Bon pictures in which the Wise Bumkhri, the King of Being, are portrayed are almost identical copies of Buddhist icons: the King of Being sits in the Buddha-posture; around his head there is a nimbus, etc.6 But there are several important differences which are not immediately apparent to the eye: he wears a short skirt, the remaining parts of his body are nude, on his head is a serrated crown, and the</page><page sequence="4">50 THE TIBET JOURNAL entire figure is white. His symbol is an eagle rending a serpent and the eagle is below, not above the figure. The latter is not due to chance as in the Bio- graphy of gShen-rab and other Bon works mention is constantly made of the fact that the eagle is the throne of the King of Being. In Ancient Iran the eagle was the symbol of Ahura Mazda and this god was portrayed either in the form of a disc with eagle's wings and tail or as an eagle with the trunk of a man, the latter's head bearing a serrated crown. Scholars believe that this anthropomorphic portrayal of Ahura Mazda is related to a portrayal of the Assyrian god Ashur and the Egyptian god of the sun.7 In the Tibetan texts the Wise Bumkhri is associated with the heavens. He lives in a heavenly palace in a turquoise dwelling in the realm of the wheel (or disc) of the great world. (Biography of gShen-rab, Chap. 1.) He himself gives instructions to those who are most worthy and utters supreme wisdom. All this finds exact parallels in the Avesta where Ahura Mazda constantly teaches Zarathustra, transmitting to him the supreme wisdom. From the above we may conclude that the name Wise Bumkhri is a Tibetan copy of the Iranian Ahura Mazda. The latter name goes back to Ancient Persian; in Middle Persian it is found in the form Ormuzd as we know with all certainty from the written monuments beginning with the first century A.D. Mithras: In the Indo-Iranian as well as the Iranian religion Ahura Mazda is accompanied by Mithras, the god of daylight. In the Biography of gShen-rab, in those sections relating to Iran-Elam, the god-priest "White" (i.e. daylight) is second after Ahura Mazda. As no icons portraying the god "White Light" ( fod-dkar ) have yet been discovered, we shall turn to a port- rayal of gShen-rab8 who is considered to be the incarnation of that divinity. gShen-rab is portrayed as sitting on a throne, his legs crossed, wearing a skirt, his body nude, the colour of his skin blue. On his head is a serrated crown and in his right hand is a ritual trihedral dagger the hilt of which is extended so as to appear rather like a sceptre than an instrument of murder. Below the throne is a disc with eight rays which symbolises the sun. The Biography of gShen-rab states that the bull is the throne of the god White Light. In the many portrayals of Mithras which have come down to us from the time of the Roman Empire we see an oft-recurring subject: Mithras in a short skirt, a serrated crown on his head, slaughtering a bull with a trihedral dagger. The god White Light is called the god-priest Qha-gshen) and in ancient Tibet the word priest ( gshan ) had a very concrete meaning: it was the function of this priest to slaughter the sacrificial animal with a dagger. It is obvious that gShen-rab's attire is not suitable for the Tibetan climate and neither the Tibetans nor their neighbours wore skirts, the exception being the Bon priests who did wear skirts over their regular Tibetan dress. This</page><page sequence="5">THE HIGHEST DEITIES OF THE TIBETAN BON RELIGION 51 detail of dress was subsequently borrowed from the Bon priests by the Tibetan Buddhist monks; in India, the homeland of Buddhism the monk's attire consisted of one long piece of material wound around the body. The Tibetan Buddhists also borrowed from the Bons the trihedral ritual dagger which became a requisite of the Tibetan Buddhists who followed Tantra which is connected with magic. During mystic rites the dagger is employed to suppress evil spirits. One final detail is worthy of note: no crowns of any kind were ever worn by anyone either in Tibet or in neigh- bouring countries, but crowns in the form of a circle with serrations were the usual ornaments of the Achamaenid kings and of certain Iranian divi- nities: Ahura Mazda and Mithras. In the medieval Tibetan monuments the god White Light is mentioned under his Iranian name of Mithras which has been retained in two phonetic variants: "Mitra" and "Pehar". The latter variant is a later one and derives from Middle Persian (cf. Persian Mihr ); it is under this name that this popular divinity is honoured in Tibet up to the present. The first variant goes back to Ancient Iranian and that form of the name may have been retained in Sogdian. The Medean and Avestian "thr" before a vowel corresponds to the Indo-European phoneme "tr" and this in turn corresponds to the Sogdian "dr".9 Astarte-Anahita: The next of the three chief divinities is the goddess Satrig Ersan ( Sa-trig Er-sangs) with her usual epithet of "mother of the eternal sphere". The chief female divinity throughout all of Western Asia was the goddess Ishtar or Astarte who was worshipped in the Persian state under the name of Anahita. The Tibetan transcription Sa-trig conveys the name Astarte (Elamitic: Shutruk) and the word er-sangs is an epithet from the Tibetan verb sang-ba (to purify, be purified). That er-sangs is an epithet (adjective) is evident from a phrase in a Tibetan prayer: "...Maitreya, oh pure {er-sangs) being, send down upon us... etc". 10 The primary factor which allows us to affirm the identity of Sa-trig and Astarte is that they coincide in nature and attributes. The goddess Sa-trig is the mother of the world. She radiates light and disperses the darkness. In her left hand she holds a mirror which possibly symbolises the moon. Her abode, a shining palace, is in the heavens, (Biography of gShen-rab, Chapters IX, XIV). If the god-priest White Light is associated with the daylight, the goddess Sa-trig, inasmuch as she dispels the darkness, is the goddess of the evening as was Astarte who was identified with the planet Venus. The throne of the goddess Astarte is a lion made of precious gems although she is sometimes portrayed mounted on a lion or a mighty bull. In scholarly literature mention has often been made of the fact that the cult of Astarte-Anahita is of Near Eastern origin. The name of Astarte in this form might have been popular in Iran no later than the first centuries of the Achamaenid era (6th-5th centuries B.C.), i.e. while there were still close relations and mutual influences between the Near and Middle East.</page><page sequence="6">52 THE TIBET JOURNAL notes &amp; references 1.
