MY SHIELD IS MY CANVAS Gallery DeRoche San Francisco, California February 28-March 28, 1992 This extensive exhibition highlighted a group of thirty-nine shields from Africa, Oceania, Australia, and North America, focusing on the theme of decoration and aestheticization in the creation of these traditional objects of war. Given its nature, that a shield should be purposefully embellished is indeed intrigu- ing, but arguably less so than the scope of spectacular artistic options that can be exer- cised on its flat surface. The Oceanic, Asian, and American exam- ples were insightfully chosen and striking in their shape and variety-an imposing assort- ment of Asmat shields ranging from the clas- sically abstract to the monstrous, a Dayak shield tufted with locks of hair, an Australian Aboriginal shield that could double as a drinking bowl, scimitar-shaped parrying shields, even a Taos Pueblo shield of painted muslin stretched over a book cover. They were more or less grouped on one side of the gallery, while the African pieces were arrayed on the opposing wall, implying the dominant contrast of the exhibition. Is it true that the sometimes plainer, more utilitarian African shields, unlike many non- African examples, eschew the use of wood? Surely not. Cameroon shields of wood exist, and some wood types are to be found in vari- ous parts of Central Africa. Yet it is in Africa where other materials, alone or in combina- tion with wood, emerged so competitively in shieldcraft and permitted a critical complexity of architecture and construction to take place. Basketry shields, Azande and Mangbetu here, are light and portable and in the latter case are used either alongside of or perhaps even in marked preference to wood. Basketry handles are flexible and woven surfaces are repairable. (One researcher confided to me that he has "benchtested" such raffia shields and found them to have superior resistance against knives and arrows; he maintains that it is not a question of availability of material but rather of better technology!) Though far from showy or decorative, they are handsomely done, and the Azande carried an in-woven anthropomorphic design. Hide shields, however, can be astonish- ingly heavy and thick, as for instance the round hippopotamus buckler from Ethiopia whose surface is scored with a brutal face- like composition that looks as if its swollen ridges were pulled and pinched from an impenetrable tar. The Maasai shield made of cowhide is a more elegant formulation on its wooden frame: large, distinctive, consonant with use in hunting (hide more resistant to lion claws), and aesthetically integral with ceremonial and costume requirements. The Banyoro mammiform shield was a well-documented Ugandan type, combining flat pieces of wood with a wicker covering. Whether the wooden "breast" that protrudes from the split vertical axis of its ellipse had a more decorative or pugilistic purpose is puz- zling, but the mammiform element does visu- ally complete a forceful military identity. An impression of ferocity also emanated from a Tuareg shield, reportedly collected in northern Nigeria. Though typical in shape (an inverted U), this shield of metal appeared to be crafted from animal hide, which is more usual among the Tuareg. In expressing its artful mimicry, the surface was welted and dulled and given an eight-pointed star design. It is also possible that the metal composition was a last attempt to salvage shields from anachronism. While the show succeeded in bringing together examples of craft from cultures sel- dom accounted for in presentations of Afri- can art, there was one case of rarely seen objects from a well-known group: in addition to the ceremonial knives and clubs that rounded out the display, the gallery exhibit- ed an elegant set of three Fang crossbows, whose sleekly fierce forms seemed, in this context, almost more futuristically sculptural than bellicose in intent.
