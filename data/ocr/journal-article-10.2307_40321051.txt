<plain_text><page sequence="1">714 Book Reviews Quantum Mechanics and the Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead Michael Epperson New York: Fordham University Press, 2004 xiv + 261 pp. There are strong motivations for a book, or several books, examining the relations between the two topics mentioned in the title of this book. Quantum mechanics (QM), more than any other branch of physics, has impinged on philosophical matters. As to Whitehead's Philosophy of Organism, it is a prime candidate for being the most ambitious and scientifically well-informed system of metaphysics developed in the twentieth century, and hence a plausible locus for accommodating the philosophical implications of QM and possibly for suggesting modifications of them. Epperson enthusiastically develops one of the possible theses concerning the relation of QM to Whitehead's philosophy: that they mesh admirably. After surveying the various interpretations of the formalism of QM and outlining his preference for the family of "decohere nee" interpretations, he asserts, "Careful analysis reveals that this family of interpretations of quantum mechanics can be characterized as a detailed and fundamental exemplification of Whitehead's philosophy of organism as it pertains to the physical sciences" (p.226). I shall assess this strong claim by examining his philosophical treatment of the quantum mechanical measurement problem. To get quickly to the heart of the matter I assume that the reader is familiar with the standard formalism of QM, as presented in excellent textbooks. I warn that Epperson does not provide an adequate summary of this formalism. For example, although he explains the mathematical concept of a vector |r&gt;, which according to QM represents the complete state of a physical object, he also uses the notation &lt;r|, the "dual vector" of |r&gt; without an explanation, even though it is essential to his concept of the density matrix on p. 78; nor does he explain the rules for calculating the probabilities of experimental outcomes when the density matrix is specified. The measurement problem arises when the initial state of an object S of interest is represented by a vector |v&gt; = ai|ri&gt; + a2|r2&gt;, where |rÄ&gt; represents the maximally specified state of the object characterized by the value rf of an appropriately comprehensive physical property R, with the protocol that each |n&gt; has inner product unity with itself, and in which each coefficient ^ is non-zero and their absolute squares sum to unity. It is a physical postulate of QM that if R is ideally measured the outcome will be one Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society Summer, 2005, Vol. XLI, No. 3</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 71 5 of the values of R appearing in the expression for |v&gt;, the probability of obtaining the outcome rj being |ai|2. It must be stressed that |v&gt; cannot be interpreted as representing a state of affairs in which, antecedent to the measurement, the property R definitely has either the value rx or the value r2, but which one is unspecified. To prove this important statement it suffices to consider an ensemble of systems all prepared in state |v&gt; and on each member of the ensemble measure a quantity Q which has a definite value q in the state |v&gt; - a quantity that can be proved to exist and be well defined when the formalism of QM is assumed. QM then implies that the result of measurements of Q on the members of this ensemble will always be q, whereas the rejected state of affairs implies that some of the results would be q and some would have some other value. Heisenberg interpreted this peculiar situation by saying that although |v&gt; represents an objective physical state and not just a psychological entity like a subjective belief, its objective content is a network of potentialities rather than actualities - an important conceptual interpretation which Epperson endorses (pp. 75-6). One might conjecture that a sufficient, though perhaps not a necessary, condition for a property R to have an actual value is the performance of a measurement of R. In an idealized treatment of measurement, an appropriately constructed physical system A is put into proper interaction with S in such a way that initially A is in a "ready" state |wo&gt;, but the composite system S+A temporally evolves in accordance with standard quantum dynamics from an initial state |ri&gt;|wo&gt; to a final state |ri&gt;|ai&gt;, where |aj&gt; is an apparatus state in which an "indexical" property a has the value a^ The value of the object's property R is thus "mirrored" or "revealed" by the indexical property of the apparatus. So far there is nothing paradoxical. But now take |v&gt; as the initial state of the object system and make use of the linearity of quantum dynamics (again consult a standard exposition of QM). One obtains the time evolution |v&gt;|wo&gt; -» [ai|r!&gt; + a2|r2&gt;] |wo&gt; = ai|r!&gt;|wo&gt; + a2|r2&gt;|w0&gt;. Where now is the actuality? Applying the foregoing interpretation of the sum of vectors as potentiality, we see that the final state of S+A does not ascribe actual values either to the object property R or to the indexical property a but presents each as potential.. This is the measurement problem. Von Neumann maintained that the problem could be solved only by postulating a limitation to the linear dynamics of standard QM and conjectured that this might occur beyond physics when the consciousness of an observer becomes aware of apparatus readings, a conjecture seconded by London and Bauer and also tentatively by Wigner.1 This conjecture is one of the possible bridges from QM to the philosophy of Whitehead. The various decoherence interpretations of QM2 treat the measurement problem entirely within physics, without amending or supplementing quantum</page><page sequence="3">716 Book Reviews dynamics, and aim at solving the problem or somehow mitigating its sting. Their procedure is to take seriously the fact that no apparatus can be entirely isolated physically from the environment, which of course is immense, presumably comprehending everything in the physical universe beyond the original object system and the apparatus. In outline the decoherence interpretations proceed as follows: 1. The vector |^&gt; representing the quantum state of the composite system consisting of system+apparatus+environment after a sufficient period of interaction is written schematically in terms of the vectors \r{&gt; and |a;&gt; and a basis of vectors representing states of the environment (though of course it is out of the question to specify the latter set of vectors explicitly). 2. The density matrix which makes the same probability evaluations for all ideally possible experiments on the composite system as does the vector |^&gt;can be expressed compactly as the product l^x^l, and this expression can then be opened up explicitly in terms of the basis vectors of object system, apparatus, and environment. 3. Since the environment is interesting only for its effect upon the object system and the apparatus, the detailed schematic information about the environment is thrown away by the operation of 'partial tracing' (again see a textbook of QM), leaving a 'reduced density matrix' to represent the total information remaining concerning object system +appara tus. 4. Mathematically the partial tracing operation contributes a very large number of uncorrelated or weakly correlated contributions to each of the terms of the reduced density matrix. Physical considerations permit reasonable models to be made of the statistics of these small contributions, permitting rigorous conclusions to be drawn concerning the models and plausible conclusions to be drawn concerning real situations which are too complex for exact mathematical treatment. This step is the deepest, most difficult, and most significant part of the entire decoherence analysis, but for illustrations one must consult the technical decoherence literature, since Epperson does not do so. He only states, with partial accuracy, the conclusion of this step: that the reduced density matrix is almost exactly diagonal in the object and apparatus basis of the latter (a basis which is suitably chosen to take advantage of physical characteristic of interactions between environment and apparatus - e.g., that the strength of</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 717 interactions typically diminishes rapidly with distance). If the reduced density matrix were exactly diagonal then predictions regarding all possible experimental outcomes would be exactly the same as for an ensemble of replicas object+apparatus all having definite values rj and ^ of the properties R and «with appropriate frequencies - as if one is dealing with classical actualities and not with quantum mechanical potentialities. And the correction of this conclusion necessitated by the fact that the reduced density matrix is only approximately diagonal nevertheless allows one to maintain the comforting conclusion that it suffices for all practical purposes (John Bell's famous expression, with the acronym UFAPP"). What has been accomplished, modulo the validity of generalizations from the simple models that are amenable to rigorous treatment, is an explanation of the emergence of a classical description from a strictly quantum mechanical theory of the physical world. Epperson is right to admire this accomplishment, which I believe is destined to be a permanent contribution to an eventual fully satisfactory interpretation of QM. However, he greatly underplays the difficulty of a problem that remains unsolved by the decoherence interpretations - the selection problem. This problem concerns a conflict between the strict quantum mechanical understanding of the reduced density matrix and the common sense conditions of empirical confirmation of its statistical predictions. As just noted, the reduced density matrix predicts the same statistics of apparatus readings ^ as an ensemble of replicas of object+apparatus in which each member has a definite value of object property R and apparatus property a, but this equivalence is an as if. Each member of the ensemble is actually only a tiny part of an immense state constituted by object+apparatus+environment, which is in a complete quantum state |^&gt;, in which the values of R and a are only potentialities. But the experimenter, reading the apparatus consciously sees an actual value of the property a, which entails by correlation a definite value of R. The consciousness of the observer is a physical fact according to a materialist treatment of the mind-matter relation, or it is a non-physical mental fact according to a mentalistic or a dualistic treatment. But in either case there is a problem of how a definite actual value z{ is selected from the entire set of potential values which the (approximate) diagonality of the reduced density matrix has so elegantly offered. This is the selection problem. Roughly, neglecting nuances, the adherents of the decoherence interpretation of QM have two attitudes to this</page><page sequence="5">718 Book Reviews problem. (1) The first is pragmatic, regarding the question of agreement between the statistics predicted by the reduced density matrix and the statistics of apparatus readings as the sole business of physics, while the question of agreement between physical and psychological realities is dismissed at best as the business of another discipline, philosophy, and at worst as a pseudo-question for which in principle no answer can be given. (2) The selection problem is a real scientific problem, perhaps within the scope of further developments of physics or of a future discipline of psychophysics. A candidate for a solution is the supplementation of the current linear dynamics of QM by nonlinear or chance processes.3 These theories were proposed independently of the decoherence interpretations, but a synthesis of these two approaches is conceivable in which the diagonalization of the reduced density matrix in a preferred basis provides a heuristic for the details of the hypothetical non-linear or stochastic modification of the dynamics of QM. I find this proposal attractive, partly because it is amenable in principle to experimental confirmation or disconfirmation. Epperson's proposed solution to the selection problem is different from both (1) and (2) and seems to me highly unsatisfactory: "This entire process [i.e., of measurement] is predicated upon the a priori existence of facts, as implied, for example, in the following three concepts: (i) state evolution (evolution from antecedent fact, through potentia, to novel fact); (ii) histories of states (histories being serial routes of facts perpetually augmented by novel facts); and probability (probability that an antecedent fact will become a particular potential novel fact according to a quantifiable valuation). It is the probability valuation of the mutually exclusive and exhaustive potential states that governs, and therefore guarantees, the actualization of a unique outcome state" (pp. 102-103). (i) is fairly clear but erroneous, because the dynamical evolution of a quantum state that begins with a superposition (whose interpretation as potentialities by Heisenberg is accepted by Epperson) yields a final superposition rather than a selected factual outcome. (ii) is obscure, since the dynamical evolution of the state is governed by the time-dependent Schroedinger equation (which contains terms representing the interactions among the object system, the apparatus, and the environment), and no novelty enters otherwise until the unexplained selection of</page><page sequence="6">Book Reviews 719 an outcome of measurement. (iii) asserts that assignments of probabilities by the quantum state guarantees "the actualization of a unique outcome state", whereas in fact it presents them all as propensities awaiting final selection. This passage is a bland announcement that the selection problem has been solved without specifying the occasion for selection, the mechanism of selection, or in any sense an explanation of selection. This criticism should not be construed as a demand that the selection problem be solved completely in terms of the present formalism of QM, because I am amenable to the amplification of QM with new principles, but I require that the new principles, if they are needed, be explicit. Epperson seems to have an option at this point to draw upon Whitehead's Philosophy of Organism to provide additional principles to supplement standard QM and provide a satisfactory solution to the measurement problem. By claiming that the concrescence of a novel actual occasion is an indeterministic process, Whitehead offers a candidate for a stochastic supplementation to the deterministic Schroedinger equation, which a speculative theoretical physicist could explore. But the quotation given in the second paragraph of this review shows that Epperson has made a different choice: to accept QM as it now stands, apparently without supplementation, as a "detailed and fundamental exemplification of Whitehead's philosophy." Before presenting and commenting on some samples of Epperson's defense of his strong thesis, I shall give an apologetically condensed summary of his philosophy in order to indicate a baffling lacuna which prevents me from becoming an enthusiastic Whiteheadian and also constitutes an obstacle to Epperson's ambitious harmonization of the QM and the Philosophy of Organism. Whitehead strongly criticizes a major theme in Western thought which he calls the "Bifurcation of Nature", that there are two grand types of substantial entities, matter and mind, which are utterly different in constitution and behavior. He proposes a unitary view of nature, which he calls "the Philosophy of Organism," according to which the elementary entities of the world are actual occasions, temporally and spatially extended units of experience of great variety; the highest of these, except for a unique entity God, are the occasions of conscious experience of organisms like ourselves, whereas the lowest are the occasions which compose the history of elementary physical particles, whose experiences are immensely dimmer than those of human consciousness and yet are governed by the same general principles. The data for the experience of a new (or concrescent) occasion are of two sorts - physical prehensions, which are the selective reenactment of the experiences of past occasions, and conceptual prehensions, which are the entertainment of eternal objects (similar to Platonic</page><page sequence="7">720 Book Reviews forms). It is evident that the model for Whitehead's philosophical view is human mentality, of course with the anti- anthropomorphic provision that all the mentalistic concepts are extrapolated and scaled down when applied to subhuman entities in nature, particularly to those commonly recognized as inorganic. Despite the attractiveness of Whitehead's proposed solution to the mind-matter problem, it is burdened with a profound difficulty: How can one make sense of the extrapolation of a concept like experience down to the level of physical particles? In other words, isn't the use of a common vocabulary with words like "experience" merely a verbal strategy for covering up a bifurcation that still remains between high level and low level occasions . At the end of this review I shall make some highly tentative suggestions about confronting this profound problem. That Epperson does not feel the urgency and difficulty of the problem is exhibited by a sample of collations that he offers between Whiteheadian and quantum mechanical principles. 1. Epperson summarizes the evolution of the quantum state from the decoherence point of view as follows: "The result is a matrix of decoherent, probability-valuated interations or potential system states. Of these, one will become actual fact in satisfaction of these valuations..." (p. 135). The expression "satisfaction" occurs immediately afterwards in a quotation from Whitehead: " The final phase in the process of concrescence ... is termed the 'satisfaction.' It is fully determinate (a) as to its genesis, (b) as to its objective character for the transcendent creativity [i.e., as datum for subsequent actualizations], and (c) as to its prehension, positive or negative, of every item in its universe.... The satisfaction is merely the culmination marking the evaporation of all indétermination" (p. 135). Comment (i). "Satisfaction" is a psychological term, well understood in the constext of high level conscious experience, but at best metaphorical when it is applied to occasion in the history of a physical particle. Comment (ii). The "evaporation of all indétermination" conflicts with principle of QM that in any definite quantum state, including the one picked out by the selection process at the conclusion of a measurement, there are always physical properties which are objectively indefinite. 2. Epperson quotes White head, "The process of concrescence is divisible into an initial stage of many feelings, and a succession of subsequent phases of more complex feelings integrating the earlier simpler</page><page sequence="8">Book Reviews 721 feelings, up to the satisfaction which is one complex unity of feeling." He then comments, "The process of concrescence described here by Whitehead is exemplified by the process of quantum mechanical state evolution.... This evolution consists of a succession of phases in which manifold potential specifications of each datum are integrated - relative to the measuring apparatus and, particularly, its preferred basis" (pp.1 34-5). Comment (i). The contrast of a plurality of feelings with a synthesis into a complex unity of feelings is derivative from high- level psychology, for instance the psychology of listening to music, and again its extrapolation to low-order physical occasions is obscure and metaphorical at best. Comment (ii). In the quantum mechanical account of measurement what seems to be complex is the phase in which the state of object+apparatus+environment is a superposition of my vectors in which the object property R and the apparatus property a have different values, a remarkable network of potentialities. When selection is made and one value n and one value ai are actualized, a simplification occurs, at least from the standpoint of R and cl Epperson's collation of Whitehead's "complex unity of feeling" with the conclusion of the measurement process in QM is tendentious, aiming at documenting his thesis of the meshing of these two bodies of thought. 3. Epperson proposes a Whiteheadian solution to the well-known tension between the locality of special relativity theory and the non- locality revealed in QM. Suppose two quantum mechanically entangled particles 1 and 2 are subjected to measurements at spacelike separated points A and B. Epperson says that there is no causal influence from A to B but there is an affect. "In terms of the relativistic spacetime order operative in the primary stage/physical pole, events in A and B are, in Whitehead's metaphysical scheme, mutual contemporaries and thus causally independent. But in terms of the logical order of the supplementary stage/mental pole, events in A and B are asymmetrically interrelated according to this order, such that logically antecedent actualities always condition the potential of subsequent quantum mechanical actualizations" (p. 229). Comment (i). It is entirely unclear how the Whiteheadian contrast of the physical and the mental poles of an occasion are related to the contrast</page><page sequence="9">722 Book Reviews between actuality and potentiality, both of which in QM are modalities of physical processes. Comment (ii). In the experiments on entangled particles in which the choice of properties to be measured on particles 1 and 2 are events with spacelike separation, the actual outcome of the experiment on 2 is correlated, in some cases strictly, with the actual outcome of the experiment on 1. More than potentialities are involved, and to this extent there is a causal connection. Comment (iii). The fact that no superluminal signal can be sent from A to B (which Epperson correctly reports) is not due to the absence of causal connection but to the fact that an observer at A cannot control the outcome of the experiment on particle 1 and therefore is not able to choose what message is to be sent to B. These three examples must suffice to make my case that Epperson's theme of admirable meshing of QM with Whitehead's philosophy is highly implausible. What other programs can be envisaged to relate these two bodies of thought? One is to use ideas from the one to suggest modifications of the other. The indeterminacy of the process of concrescence in Whitehead's actual occasions suggests taking seriously the speculations that the stochastic process of selecting a definite outcome from the set of possible outcomes of an experiment does not occur in purely physical situations, but in mental situations (notably, when the observer reads the apparatus) or in mixed psycho-physical situations, whatever these may be. On the other hand, the profound problem in Whitehead's philosophy of extrapolating "experience" from the domain of high level organisms to low level physical entities could conceivably be mitigated by making use of the modality of potentiality which QM has introduced to us.4 Another program is to make a virtue of difficulties in each body of thought by letting them suggest a new range of experiments. There have already been some good experiments testing nonlinear and stochastic terms modifying quantum dynamics, but these have not brought us closer to a solution of the selection problem because they uniformly gave no indication of the existence of these terms. There is one tantalizing</page><page sequence="10">Book Reviews 723 psychophysical experiment which deserves repetition and variation. Dick Bierman5 repeated an old experiment of Hall et al.6, using two observers who were entangled by being presented in separate rooms with two dials each registering detection by a single counter of radioactive decays. He investigated whether one of these observers could non- randomly discern whether the other observer had "reduced the superposition" by looking at his dial. Hall et cil. had found no non-random discernment, but Bierman found positive correlation. If this result holds up in subsequent experimentation, it would be a striking psychophysical phenomenon, relevant to the connection of QM to a mentalistic philosophy like Whitehead's. Needless to say, patience and great care are essential in subsequent experimentation. Boston University Abner Shimony shimony@verizon.net NOTES 1. E.P.
