This typology of skills and techniques  is suggestive of a ‘training manual’ that  comes to existence in the very process of  making, and which is perceptible in the  objects’ diversity of polish. At times, the act  of making itself seems on show. The strange  sculpture Cinq concentrés concentriques  (Paris, April 2007), for example, reprises  the procedure of disorientation experi- mented with in Ongles. Here, it is fingers  rather than fingernails that have been  submitted to an impossible dislocation.  Cast from the artist’s five fingers, in black  polyurethane elastomer, the fingers are  detached from the hand and joined at the  tips. Rather than God breathing life into  Adam, as in Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel,  and the infinite reproductions of this image,  it is the artist’s fingers that designate the  centre point of finite creation. They suggest  manual activity, but their converging  position, more importantly, evokes the  necessary reflexive quality of an artwork.  Instead of pointing outwards, they  converge towards a centre. This centripetal  quality is a central feature of Moulène’s  art, and unifies his production beyond its  diversity of subject matter and mediums,  and his work’s sometimes opaque quality.  Moulène has said: ‘In my view the work  is also a theoretical act. As for its conditions  of existence, it must be reflexive.’ 12 The  statement echoes the idea of the theoretical  object as defined by Hubert Damisch,  for whom it is ‘an object that obliges you  to do theory but also furnishes you with  the means of doing it’.13  12 Ibid., p.142.  13 Yve-Alain Bois, Denis Hollier, Rosalind Krauss and Hubert Damisch, ‘A Conversation with Hubert    Damisch’, October, vol.85, Summer 1998, p.8.
