<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHERNYSHEVSKY AND AMERICAN INFLUENCE ON RUSSIA DAVID HECHT back as the eighteenth century, the infant western re- public of the United States excited the interest of progressive social forces in Russia.1 Such general interest in the Ameri- can democracy, understandable under the oppressive conditions of life in monarchy-ridden Europe, was later to quicken the thought of the nineteenth-century Russian radical intelligentsia. From the De- cembrists through Herzen to Lenin, the impact of American events, personalities and institutions becomes ever more visible. Today it is more than ever necessary to review the history of cultural con- tacts between Russia and America to create a truer and more pro- found understanding between these two great countries for the sake, above all, of assuring an enduring peace in the post-war world.2 We may find typical and fruitful evidences of this role played by America among nineteenth century Russian radicals in the thought of Nicho- las G. Chernyshevsky, one of the pioneer revolutionary figures in old Russia and an individual who commanded Lenin's highest admira- tion. Chernyshevsky was unquestionably the outstanding representa- tive of "that generation of the middle classes . . . which was brought forth into the white world in the roots ... of ... mother Russia in the twenties and thirties of the nineteenth century." 3 Of all the Russian radical intellectuals of that time who remained within the confines of their native country, he was the most significant indi- vidual. 1 See B. Kamnetsky, "Two Centuries of Russian Writing on America," The Ameri- can Review of the Soviet Union (May, 1945), p. 16-20. 2 Even under the stress of devastating war, or perhaps because of the very needs of coalition warfare, investigations of these cultural ties on the part of Soviet scholars have increased noticeably. The crucial role of Chernyshevsky, together with Dobro- liubov and other contemporary Russian radicals as opponents of the Southern slave system in the time of the Russian emancipation, is recognized in recent Soviet his- toriography.

I This Russian "revolutionary democrat" was born in the quiet town of Saratov, along the Volga, in July, 1828.4 Unlike Herzen, Ogarev and Bakunin, Chernyshevsky's origins were plebian and clerical, and it is with this man that the great generation of "raz- nochinets" 5 intelligentsia comes into its own. Chernyshevsky's early life was uneventful, and he remained at home until the age of fourteen undergoing training for the priest- hood under his father's supervision. After this preliminary period the boy was sent to an Orthodox seminary where he apparently amazed his teachers and fellow students by his knowledge. It was hoped that the precocious youth would be a shining adornment of the Russian Orthodox Church, and indeed Chernyshevsky was quite inclined to religion in his youth. But priestly education ceased to satisfy him and in 1846 he entered in the historico-philo- logical faculty of St. Petersburg University, in pursuit of education in accord with his talent for languages. It was undoubtedly Cherny- shevsky's avid reading (even as a boy in his teens) of secular writing in philosophy and history, and of such literary authors as Pushkin, George Sand and Schiller, which caused this shift in his mental attitude and which shaped his future outlook on life. While he looked forward to a scholarly career, Chernyshevsky had already assimilated strong revolutionary elements to himself during his first four-year sojourn in the northern capital. Here it was that he joined a literary circle whose leader, Vvedenski, intro- duced him to the study of Belinski, the literary critic to whose po- 4 There are few materials on Chernyshevsky's biography and career in English. The most adequate brief sketches of his life and career in English are to be found in Thomas Masaryk, The Spirit of Russia, tr., 2 vols. (London, 1919), 11, p. 1-53; Georg Brandes, Glimpses of Russia, tr. (New York, 1889), p. 262-270; and in the Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences, 11, p. 369 f. George Plekhanov's N. G. Tschernischevsky, Eine Literarhistorische Studie (Stuttgart, 1894), emphasizes Chernyshevsky's interest in political economy, but there is a very good introductory section on the man and his milieu. The two-volume biography of Y. M. Steklov, N. G. Chernyshevsky [in Russian] (Moscow-Leningrad, 1928), is the most complete and best study in Russian. The brief sketch of Chernyshevsky in Valeriian Polianski's Tri Velikikh Russkikh Demokrata (Moscow, 1938), p. 106-187, is useful, and I. Kamenev's Gertsen i Chernyshevsky is also quite valuable in noting the place of Chernyshevsky in relation to the emancipation of serfs. 6 The "raznochintsy," or men of different social classes, broadened the ranks of the Russian intelligentsia, hitherto dominated by men of the gentry.</page><page sequence="3">320 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY sition Chernyshevsky very soon succeeded. He also proceeded to familiarize himself with the main currents of contemporary Euro- pean thought, being influenced at first chiefly by Guizot. Then he read copiously in Hegel, the Utopian Fourier, Saint Simon, and Adam Smith. The decisive influence belonged, however, to Ludwig Feuerbach, whose philosophy was greatly valued and utilized by the radical Russian opposition of the 1860's.6 Thus Chernyshev- sky's philosophical development paralleled that of Herzen and Ba- kunin, except that Feuerbach exercised a more preponderant influ- ence on him than did Hegel. The 1848 revolutions in the west evoked a sympathetic response in Chernyshevsky, as of course they had in Herzen and Bakunin likewise. The young student followed the turbulent events of that time with keen interest and rejoiced in the gains of the democratic and revolutionary parties.7 It was in that period too that Cherny- shevsky defined himself as a republican democrat and acknowledged a deep attachment to socialism.8 Democratic revolution, i.e., a re- &lt;*»See N. G. Chernyshevsky, Dneimik [Diary] 1848-1849 (Moscow, 1951), passim. On January 25, 1849, Chernyshevsky wrote in his diary that Hegel's Rechtsphilosophie moved him - but only his head and not his heart. He read Hegel a little, "but soon fell asleep" (p. 236). Though this statement is extreme, it is illustrative of the fact that Hegelian philosophy had no such sway over Chernyshevsky as it had over certain of the "men of the forties" in Russia. Yet Chernyshevsky knew Hegel's doctrines well, and distinguished clearly between his principles and conclusions - The influence of Feuerbach is most clearly visible in Chernyshevsky's work, The Anthropological Prin- ciple in Philosophy. Lenin was a great admirer of Chernyshevsky and estimated his philosophical work very highly. He asserted that Chernyshevsky was "actually the one great Russian writer who from the 1850 's to 1888 was able to remain on the level of a full philosophical materialism" though for the reasons of the backwardness of Russian life never attaining to Marx and Engels' plane of dialectical materialism.

I would limit administrative and general govern- mental power as quickly as possible. ... I would . . . attempt ... to give political rights to women." In practical affairs, Chernyshevsky called himself a friend of the Hungarians in their struggle for independence under Kossuth and "wished for the</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN IÑfrLÜÉfcéE ÖN ftÜSSIA 32 í gime of democratic reforms attained if necessary by revolution, and Utopian Socialism, with emphasis on the peasantry, i.e., the emanei* pation of the peasants with adequate land allotments and preserva- tion of the communal system, were to remain cardinal issues among the desiderata of the mature Chernyshevsky, although a little earlier he had expressed a belief in absolute, hereditary and centralized monarchy as a supra-class regime which might in certain circum- stances be the best agency for improving the conditions of the masses on the one hand, and which would be the natural enemy of the landed nobility on the other.9 After his stay in Petersburg University, Chernyshevsky returned to Saratov to teach Russian literature in the town gymnasium (Jan uary, 1851). By now, at the critical age of twenty-three, Cherny- shevsky already stood for the destruction of monarchy and expected a revolution in Russia in the near future. " 'Without convulsions there has never been one step forward in history.' " 10 In Saratov, Chernyshevsky met Kostomarov, who was living there in enforced exile. Around this historian of the Ukraine, a circle of intellectuals sprang up and Chernyshevsky soon became one of t^e leaders of this group. In 1853 he married Olga S. Vassilieva, the daughter of a local physician, and seems to have confided in her that he would take part in the uprising which he felt was impending in Russia.11 The atmosphere of Saratov, however, hung heavy on Chernyshev- defeat of the Russians there and for that would be prepared to sacrifice much/' p. 315 f. This last point is interesting and may be compared with an earlier entry, "I respect Russia very little and hardly think of her at all," ibid., p. 109.

In this same period, after praising Herzen's life and work in almost adultory manner to his affianced wife, Chernyshevsky made the fol- lowing prophetic observation: "I do not compare myself with Iskander [i.e., Herzen] in mind, for example, but I must say that I do not yield to him in the sharpness of my trend of thought and that I must expect a similar fate," i.e., persecution by gendarmes, harrying by an absolutist government, exile, family misfortunes, etc- and these did indeed befall him.

In the ten years that followed, he constructed the solid center of his liie work. The decade began with his rejected thesis, Aesthetic Rela- tions of Art to Reality , which expounded Belinsky's social dicta of literary criticism and decisively rejected the theory of a completely autonomous art; it closed with the novel writen in prison, What Is To Be Done? which became the Bible of two generations of Popu- list youth. In his nine years of journalistic activity, first in associa- tion with the Annals of the Fatherland, and then on the staff of NekrassoV's Contemporary- both outstanding radical democratic publications of the period-Chernyshevsky was responsible for over five hundred printed articles, including the very important Sketches of the Gogol Period and the Studies of Lessing and His Time. This was indefatiguable labor performed on a uniformly high level, in the face of the governmental censorship (which was quite rigorous throughout the first and last years at least of Chernyshevsky's liter- ary career), the constant attacks of reactionary elements against him and his colleagues and eve,n the sharp* criticism of the "older genera- tion" of the left, in the persons of Herzen and Turgenev.12 After an acceleration of repressive activities directed against the Contemporary and its editors by the autocracy, the Third Section of His Majesty's Chancery (i.e., the secret police), moved against Çhernyshevsky himself. In 1863 he was imprisoned in Petropav- lovsk Fortress in Petersburg and his magazine was suppressed for eight months, "for during the days of the Polish rising, reaction could not be long delayed."18 This preliminary imprisonment lasted for two years, succeeding which, after a farce trial, Cherny- shevsky was sentenced to the Siberian mines for fourteen years (com- muted by the Tsar to seven finally) and to exile for life in that re- mote region.14 Thus Chernyshevsky's carreer was abruptly and tragically arrested and the remainder of his life and writing is prac- tically without significance except as the symbol of a martyr. In 1883 he was allowed to return to Astrakhan (although still remain- 12 After the death of Nicholas I and the close of the Crimean War, censorship re- strictions were relaxed somewhat from their previous severity. They became more rigorous again from about 1859 on. See V.

It was Chernyshevsky who, after the death of Belinsky, served as outstanding representative of the Russian radical intelligentsia remaining at home to work in their native country. Possessing an inclusive knowledge of history, philosophy, sociology, economics, European literature, ancient and modern languages, Chernyshevsky was an avowed "westerner," a revolutionary man of letters.15 Within the narrow limits of freedom surviving in the relatively inefficient absolutist government of the mid-nineteenth century Russian autoc- racy, he stood out as a brilliant critic of society. He was the guiding' spirit of the most radical tendencies possible in a Russia where, as yet, narodnichestvo (the doctrines of the Narodniks ór Populists) was not yet clearly differentiated from scientific socialism. Thus Chernyshevsky was able to exercise the greatest influence upon the populist youth of the sixties and seventies, especially through the rationalist cult of the strong, principled and socially conscious char- cater portrayed in What Is To Be Done? At the same time, through his realism and materialism, he was one of the important precursors of Marxism in Russia;10 And both groups could justly unite in pay- ing homage to the exiled Chernyshevsky as perhaps the greatest of all the victims struck down by the autocracy. In estimating Chernyshevsky's significance and his contribution to the Russian revolutionary opposition, it must constantly be borne 15 The expression of Chernyshevsky's "western" orientation is perhaps best seen in his view that "the history of the other Slavic peoples has far less importance for our public than has the history of Western Europe and America," expressed in "Notices of Magazines," Contemporary (June, 1857), in Polnoe Sobranie Sochinene, 10 vols. (St. Petersburg, 1906), in, p. 318. (This 1906 edition of Chernyshevsky's works will here- after be referred to as Soch., 1906.) On such a central issue as the mir, Chernyshevsky took a more realistic view than did the Slavophils, certain later Narodniki or even Herzen, conceiving it to be something not peculiarly Russian, but the survival of an agricultural institution once common to most European peoples. He did agree with Herzen, however, that Russia could "skip" stages of social and economic development, passing from a lower stage to a higher one without evolving through intermediate stages. And Chernyshevsky wanted the mir preserved in Russia,partly to prevent the proletarianization of the peasant masses. Cf. J.

Certainly Dostoievsky, who after his exile in Siberia felt constantly compelled to defend Russia against the corroding influences of the radical "devils," believed that it was Chernyshevsky (even more v than Turgenev) who was the "father of lies/* 17 And perhaps Cherny- shevsky was regarded as a more dangerous opponent by such men and by the autocracy because he lacked that volatile quality of shift- ing his position in that spectacular way familiar to us in the work of Herzen and Bakunin. His stature as a revolutionary publicist has always remained high, and outstanding recognition has been offered to him by succeeding generations of revolutionaries, and by those of our time as well, in the U.S.S.R.18 II In turning to Chernyshevsky's views of American institutions, we find strikingly apparent a detailed and widespread knowledge of the most diverse phases of life in the United States. Chernyshevsky was almost uniformly laudatory in his generalized views of the coun- try. To Chernyshevsky, the United States was first of all noteworthy for its "glorious past." 19 Then, the progressive character of Amer- ica was presented as a demonstration of the inadequacies of a geo- graphical interpretation of history. "It is impossible to explain by any sort of geographical conditions why Brazil should lag so far be- hind the North American States." *° A fulsome appreciation of America, in the form of explanatory background for the events developing prior to the American Civil it For Dostoievskys* attacks on Chernyshevsky, see notably The Possessed, originally published 1870-72. 18 The contemplated new Soviet edition of Chernyshevsky's works in sixteen volumes (of which only two have so far appeared) contains a long preface of laudatory com- ment on Chernyshevsky by Lenin and others. Typical of these appreciative comments is that of Lenin's widow, Krupskaia, "There is hardly any person Vladimir Ilyich loved as much as he loved Chernyshevsky. Here was a man to whom he felt a kind of immediate affinity and [he] respected him exceedingly," Soch., 1, p. 5. i» Soch., 1906, vin, p. 387.

Somewhat in the manner of Herzen, although in much more guarded language, because of the exigencies of the censorship, Chernyshevsky wrote: Progressiva people of Western Europe point to North America when they are told that their ideas are impractical. On the other hand, West- ern European conservatives point out the bad things in American life as death to the theories which are defended by the progressives. Both ... parties, in a word, consider North America as a model for the verification of their convictions. A bad opinion of America is used as an argument in support of the existing Western European relations; a better opinion is aroused by the desire to reform these relations. The crisis which North America is passing through now cannot fail to have a very strong influence upon the destiny of the civilized world. If it leads to the iesult now predicted by almost everyone in Western Europe, the hands of one party will droop and public opinion will shift to the side of the other; if the outcome is different, then the course of events in Western Europe will be hastened considerably. It is obvious that in either case, the influence of North American history upon Western Euro- pean history will neither be discovered suddenly nor by some one effec- tive fact, the origin of which it might have been possible to point out directly from some one American event. No, the relations here are of a different order: the connection is not of certain isolated facts but rather in the general disposition of Western European thought either to cling to old times or to strive ahead; to fear the future or to hope for all that is good from it. The bond here is not external, it is not transitory . . . ; this bond is one which penetrates to the very root of Western European events. The example of North America is a constant force which must either draw Europe on to the well-known path or repel her from it. It may perhaps be impossible even within a year or two to reveal the changes in the history of Western Europe, stemming from the outcome of the present North American crisis, but nonetheless, it will affect the tendency of the history of Western Europe for whole decades, as the very founding of the North American Union has acted earlier- only with this difference- that now the example is offered not by a sparsely numbered people, weak in comparison with the states of Western Eu- rope, but by a powerful nation that already occupies one of the fore- most places among all states by virtue of her external power. To peer into the character of such a crisis, to attempt to unravel its tangled turns, to foresee its outcome- this task is of little interest for the consid- eration of European events of the coming summer or of the following winter, but it is very important for the evaluation of the future move-</page><page sequence="9">326 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY ment of the political ideas by which the events of our entire generation and, it may be, of the succeeding one, will begin to be determined.31 This apotheosis of America becomes even clearer when a reader not restricted by a censor is free to make certain justified emenda- tions and changs. First, where Chernyshevsky uses the term "West- ern European," he unquestionably does not wish to exclude Russia from his observations and may even intend to have the reader sub- stitute "Russia" in the place of it. Then, as will become evident later on, Chernyshevsky is here using the expression "the bad things in America" in a recognizable special sense, for to him these "bad things" were almost completely attributable to and corollaries of the Southern slave system. "The result now predicted by almost all in Western Europe" was, of course, the defeat of Northern arms and the sundering of the Union should the secession issue go to the extreme. By the sentence ending ". . . if the outcome is different, then the course of events in Western Europe will be hastened con- siderably," Chernyshevsky means in plain English (or plain Rus- sian) that if the free North should triumph, democratic developments would be hastened everywhere. And, as will be demonstrated, the very objective tone of Chernyshevsky's opinions here is camouflage for a most intense and partisan pro-Northern interest. Finally, Cher- nyshevsky himself is to be placed in the foremost ranks of the European "progressives" of whom he speaks. Thus Chernyshevsky's admiration for that which he considered the best in American life, namely American democracy in toto, is manifest, and his conscious- ness öf the salutary and growing influence of America upon the Old World is most alert. Elsewhere, Chernyshevsky emphasized these thoughts of the present and rising significance of America by singling ìàut the day of Lincoln's election, November 6, 1860, as a date marking a new epoch for "the great North American people," a turning point from which the American people would march to heights "not attained since Jefferson's time." And this was exemplary since "the good repute of the North American nation is important for all nations with the rapidly growing significance of the North American States in the life of all of humanity."22 /■ ziSoch., 1906, vm, p. 389 f. **$och., 1906, vi, p. 730 1</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN INFLUENCE ON RUSSIA 327 In his famous review of Peter Lavrov's work, Outlines of the Questions of Practical Philosophy (St. Petersburg, 1860), Cherny- shevsky, after acknowledging that the Russian Narodnik sociologist was "a progressive thinker," seized upon an expression which Lavrov had used: "the social despotism in the United States." The' phrase was applied to restrictions upon over-lavish spending of money upon luxuries, and was derived by Lawrov from John Stuart Mill's On Liberty. Chernyshevsky criticized Lavrov adversely for employing in too unqualified a manner, such phrases as this which, though under- standable to the English public, would not be so to the Russian.28 Then followed a three-pronged refutation: "social despotism" exists only in New England and chiefly in Boston, not in all of the United States; this far from universal phenomenon is simply a remnant of Puritanism, which is weakening with each year and does not stem from North American institutions, as superficial observers erroneous- ly infer; this "Puritan constraint" is now really little more than a sham serving as another pretext for the accumulation of worldly goods among the miserly descendants of the Puritans. * After having disposed of this issue, Chernyshevsky came to his main point and insisted that the real "social despotism" existed in the slave states where the Southern planting aristocracy ruled with an iron hand, permitting no word in favor of abolitionism and sub- jecting to spoliation, exile and criminal punishment all who dared to speak up against the slave system. All power in the South was. concentrated in the hands of à few tens of thousands of rich planters who kept not only their Negroes in ignorance and poverty, but also the mass of poor whites as well. These planter magnates were the descendants of the aristocratic Cavalier settlers of Virginia and the older Southern states in Stuart times. They maintained their power by accretion and expansion and the creation of new slave states, and "in general the contrast between Naples and Switzerland is not so great as the contrast between the Southern and the Northern half of the United States." Heretofore this Southern aristocracy, under the curious guise of the "Democratic" party, had dominated the American government, and the fundamental struggle between the Southern magnates and the abolitionists was then raging because the true democratic elements ruling in the Northern states wanted "to 23 Soch., 1906, vi, p. 183; and see Mill, On Liberty (London, 1859), p. 157.</page><page sequence="11">328 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY wrench political hegemony over the Union from the hands oí the aristocrat-planters/'24 Such was Chernyshevsky 's succinct delineation of the Southern slave system as "social despotism/' By and large it is a correct picture of the balance of power in the South on the eye of secession.25 These broad outlines were filled in many times over, with almost exhaust- ing detail, in other essays in which Chernyshevsky repeatedly re- curred to this question. Here the highlights were presented: the description of the Southern planter aristocracy, its relation to the Negroes, to the poor whites, to the anti-slavery elements and to the ¡rest of the country, besides a characterization of the deeper na^ ture of the sectional conflict. Where Chernyshevsky goes astray somewhat is in his explana- tion of the origins of the planter aristocracy. Here he lays far too much stress upon the continuity of the aristocracy from England to America. Today we know that it was no primarily aristocratic group who settled colonial Virginia, but in the main, members of the mer* chant class.26 But Chernyshevsky may perhaps be absolved from responsibility for this inaccuracy since this belief was a common fallacy in his time. Beyond this, Chernyshevsky, in his desire to uphold the free North against the slave-owning South, stressed a little too much the over-all democracy "ruling" the Northern States. Chernyshevsky was an uncompromising enemy of American slavery and a thorough-going partisan of the most radical elements SiSoch., 1906, vi, p. 184. 25 See Arthur M.

He, who was a firm believer in free trade, conceded the political necessity of supporting the pro- tectionist demands of the New England states in the face of the greater necessity of supporting them in their abolitionist tendencies. It is quite possible that they are wrong in this case, that protective tariffs are really not necessary for them- but what is to be done? . . . The historical path is not the sidewalk of the Nevski Prospect; it winds wholly through fields, now dusty, now muddy, through bogs and debris. He who is afraid to cover himself with dust and to soil his shoes ought not to participate in social activity.28 In line with his great regard for the "free North/' Chernyshevsky criticized Macaulay's sweeping condemnation of the American de- mocracy. The English historian, in a letter to an American cor- respondent (published posthumously) had remarked on the general distress, unemployment, mass unrest and the other familiar symp- toms of Western Europe in mid-Victorian times, and he had asserted that it was only the vast expanse of fertile and unoccupied lands, which siphoned off the surplus populations of the cities and thus acted as the "safety valve" against dangerous social ferment, which saved America temporarily from these disorders of advanced indus- trial capitalism. But there would come a time, Macaulay said, when these lands would be exhausted, and with them, the principles of Jeffersonian democracy. Then in the new "Manchesters" and "Birminghams" of New England, the inherent levelling tendencies of the American democracy would at last function unchecked and America in the twentieth century would succumb to her own inner "Vandals and Huns" as Rome presumably had succumbed to ex- ternal barbarians. Therefore, Macaulay concluded, "I cannot count Jefferson as a benefactor of humanity." He was more than ever convinced of the necessity of government by an aristocratic few to control this process. The interesting thing here is that Chernyshevsky agreed by and large with this prognosis of general economic and particularly American development, but he disagreed profoundly with Macau- STFor a more extended discussion of Chernyshevsky and American slavery» see a forthcoming article of the writer in the Slavonic and East European Review. 2&amp;$och., 1906, vin, p.36.38.</page><page sequence="13">330 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY lay's conclusions, though he dared not make his judgments (Le,, radical democratic ones) explicit. North America [he wrote, reviewing Macäulay's argument] is still a semi-wild country. ... It is possible for people to live in North America under democratic conditions without perishing from them be- cause of the wilderness character and savage state of that land. But this possibility will not last long. North America is rapidly becoming popu- lated and will enter upon the normal position. What then is the normal position of civilized countries? Chernyshevsky next recapitulated Macaulay's vivid descriptions of the impoverishment of the proletarian masses, adding that ... there are people who think that democratic institutions cannot operate properly under such conditions of the masses. Macaulay does not say this, however: he says that these institutions can never operate properly in any country which does not resemble a wilderness; he says that the condition of affairs traced by him is inevitable. Finally, Chernyshevsky attacked this blanket assertion of Macau- lay's and, by skillful indirection, the latter's anti-democratic con- clusions: In a country where the position of the masses is calamitous, no insti- tutions can operate well and indeed nothing can be genuinely healthy -who does not know this? ... But the sense of Macaulay's letter is different: except for savage countries, the masses in all countries must inevitably live in great poverty. And if in all inhabited countries the masses must live in great pov- erty, by the law of necessity which is not to be averted by human strength, then the conclusion is, of course, clçar. A human being who lives in poverty is inclined to be seduced by the words of charlatans who promise him either money or bread if he will deliver power up to them. Therefore the masses must be deprived of influence over public affairs. All this is entirely according to the system which is called present-day Whiggism and which is not to be distinguished in any essential from Toryism.29 In these extracts, therefore, we find an economic analysis of the WSoch., 1906, iv, p. 580-383.

Chernyshevsky's program for the radical alteration of society which in his estimation would preserve democratic political institutions, could, naturally, be no more than hinted at within the pages of the Contemporary.31 Ill Chernyshevsky's approval of the democratic character of the American people as a whole was expressed more overtly in his characterization of American attitudes regarding the individual and the "hero." Writing in January, 1862, Chernyshevsky flatly denied the possibility of General McClellan's becoming a Northern dictator in the course of the Civil War, for the reason, first, that he had not won sufficient victories, and second for a much more interesting reason which involved an analysis of American group thinking: When it [i.e., the American people] gains victories of any kind, the Americans attach almost the entire merit of it to themselves, to the mass of the army, to the mass of the whole nation, and not tq the strength of one man. . . . They are an impressionable people who love riotous scenes; therefore they are ready to arrange enthusiastic ovations for one or another person who distinguishes himself in some way; but they arrange these things, they are noisy and they shout, not only in his honor, but also for their own satisfaction, and they do not forget for a moment that the illustrious hero is no greater or lesser than their own creation and all his importance was received only from the fact that they took a fancy to make him their darling.82 to Oeuvres de Michael Bakunine, ed. J. Guillaume (Paris, 1907-12), 6 vols., 1, p. s8f. si However, Chernyshevsky may be criticized for too facile an expression of the "safety-valve" theory. It may also be noted that Chernyshevsky, following Macaulay, also anticipated Turner by several decades. &amp;Soch,, 1906, ix, p. 198.</page><page sequence="15">332 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY This close tie-up of the "hero" with the masses is perhaps a little over-idealized, but it was surely an American trait not to lean to the deification of the outstanding individual. Furthermore, the relation between the achievements of the outstanding public individual (especially a military leader) to the very numerous group of semi- anonymous followers who make this achievement largely possible, is recognized even today (at least theoretically) when the separation of the mass of men from the leaders or the heroes is much greater than it was in the mid-nineteenth century. And anyone who has ever followed the course of a presidential election campaign in America can only too easily testify to the love of Americans for a spectacle. In What Is To Be Done? an American character, Charles Beau- mont, who is suddenly introduced towards the very end of the novel, and who as a literary creation, is quite wooden and lustreless. As Chernyshevsky's spokesman, however, for his own views of America, this young; man is very favorably presented. Chernyshevsky tells us first that , . .either according to the American custom of not seeing any- thing extraordinary in a rapid accumulation of wealth or in a failure or because of his natural character, Beaumont had no desire either to be overpowered by the greatness of the mind that could make three or four millions or to feel great concern for the failure which left suffi- cient means to maintain a good cook. . . . [This last refers to the com- mercial rise and fall of Beaumont's future father-in-law, Polozof.]88 It is quite apparent from the context that Chernyshevsky ap- proved of this American energy and social mobility, but even more sa of the American and democratic trait of "not being impressed/' Beaumont now speaks: One need not be melancholy unless he pleases . . . but to be bored is in my opinion unpardonable. Loneliness is a fashion among our brethren, the English, but we Americans know nothing about it; we have no time to be melancholy. We have too much to do to allow of it, I think.«* Chernyshevsky here comes perilously close to an advocacy of 33 What I? To Be Done? A Vital Question, tr. (New York, 1886), p. 425. 34 ¡bid,, lac. cit.</page><page sequence="16">AMERICAN INFLUENCE ON RUSSIA 333 a rather cpmplacent cult of practicality, of feverish activity for its own sake, engendered alike in the ethics of capitalism and on the American frontier. But it is not quite that, for this presentation of the American "doer" is immediately followed by the opposite pic- ture of the "gloomy" sensitive Russian intellectuals who "have to sit and fold their hands." Katerina Vasilevna (Charles Beaumont's fiancée) cries, "Give me something to do and the chances are that I shall not be melancholy." Beaumont's call to arms follows directly: "You want something to do? ... You see all around you ignorance . . . there are great opportunities."35 Thus Chernyshevsky's message is really an appeal for a reasoned social canalization of all this energy. It is not quite the Let us, then, be up and doing, With a heart for any fate ... of Longfellow's Psalm of Life, although it must be admitted that there lurks in these phrases a certain admiration for a country where individual energy and power (even when not used for social ends) have free scope, even at the risk of nurturing a pragmatic philosophy of shallow optimism. And by "America," Chernyshevsky meant "of course . . . only the free Northern states."86 In summary it may be said that Chernyshevsky has touched upon the important aspects of American life: our democratic system, the economic and social order, the American psychology and the rising 35 Ibid., p. 426. S« This uncritical admiration for the American social mobility, ability to accumu- late wealth rapidly, recognition of individual merit and relatively untrammeled free- dom of individual action, is voiced in another part of the novel although Chernyshevsky is careful to place these views upon the lips of old Pólozof, Katerina's merchant father, and thus still maintain a certain ambiguity in his own attitude: "Among the Americans, a man who may be today a journeyman shoemaker, or a plowman, tomorrow will be a general, and the next day president; and after that he may be a lawyer or in a counting house. It is a peculiar people altogether; they care only for a main's money or his brains« This is the right way of looking at it" (p. 431). In the last analysis, however, when Katerina wants to migrate to America to "accomplish something/* Charles replies definitively, "One can find something to do in Petersburg," p. 488. This is to say that the job to undertake is the betterment of the condition of the Russian people, to remain at home, despite the attractions of the American democracy- and perhaps, by the organization of producers' and consumers* cooperatives and related Utopian schemes, to bring Russia up to the level of America, if not to surpass her.

He chose to stress those traits which would serve the Russian progressive movement of his day. The over-all impression derived from his generally intelligent and skilfully phrased observations is that of one long páean of praise for American life (in the "free Northern states"). If he went so far as to overlooking the effects of unbridled individualism in his enthusiasm for the democratic and forward-looking republic across the ocean- we must recall the con- ditions and restrictions under which he wrote. To him as to many of his colleagues in Russia, the United States represented almost the living embodiment of their liberal political aspirations- saving, of course, for the institution of slavery which in his day was common to both countries.
