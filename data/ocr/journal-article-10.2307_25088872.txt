<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jascha Kessler Chaos or Control: Our No-Win Situation About a generation ago, the notion of mind-control was -L\&gt; made part of our general fate for the future. It was fixed clearly for us in OrwelPs masterpiece, 1984y and illustrated practically in the news from senile Stalin's Russia and the con quest of China by Mao &amp; Company. Since that time, we have learned that control of the mind is certainly not something that has been achieved once and for all: force and the terror latent in it is still an absolute prerequisite. People must be watched constantly and assaulted physically with instruments of torture or injections in order to assure acquiescence in slavery. Viola tion is the basis, and it is still gross violence that must be done. Meanwhile, during this same quarter of a century, the world has grown simultaneously more intricately connected and cha otic. It is hard to say if we are witnessing a paradoxical phe nomenon, a contradictory one, or two developments, at the social and individual, personal level, which are parallel, yet destined to meet not at infinity but at the horizon, which may be closer in time than is apparent even now. Whatever the case will turn out to be, most of us are painfully aware that in this long interregnum we are calling the last quarter of the 20th Century both the forces of control and the currents of chaos seem to be augmenting exponentially at every level of society, including the private and subjective life itself. The America of the Sixties showed us that, graphically enough. And it is safe to say that the problems we witnessed then will explode before us in the time to come. And the issues at bottom will be much the same, arising from the tendency to chaos in our world and the attempts to find controls. 429</page><page sequence="2">The Massachusetts Review In what follows, I should like to ruminate about the ques tions that are connected with the word control, and perhaps place our situation, which may be a no-win situation basically, in another perspective than that called up by the terms we have been used to. That my conclusions may seem pessimistic is un important. The popular term a while ago was "the human con dition." That I use the contemporary term, "no-win situation," merely illustrates the contemporary tone of our thought, that nevertheless refuses to utter the thought, "both lose." The cancerous growth of chaos in the world and the evi dence of ingrained individual obduracy and resistance to ulti mate control both seem arguments that the Orwellian mon strousness of life in 1984 was not our inevitable fate, or at least not yet, not so soon. Yet I think that the prospects for eventual control of the mind are excellent still. Perhaps one indication that this is a deeply-felt intuition is the recrudescence of chiliastic styles of thought and indeed of behavior too at every level of society, from the intellectual and "scientific" chiliasm of a Teilhard de Chardin down to the Pentecostals and the many forms of transcendental practices of spiritualism, mysticism, occultism and scientism spreading everywhere pub licly in the Free World, and perhaps privately in the other parts of the world, despite regimentation and terror. Tran scendentalism, in whatever of its myriad forms, is still a method of escape from both chaos and control, which reign here and now. I leave all that aside for the moment. It is a very large subject, and it is not the first time we have seen the Beast of the Apocalypse materializing rampant above civilization. The vision of that beast may be induced by a virus, for all we know, and the fever may pass, having altered our world out of all recognition, as has happened before, and more than once. When we speak of "control of the mind," for example, we are taking it for granted, perhaps in the very words used, that we are talking about rational control. As though there were no other sort of control. For that which is out of control is what has broken from our grasp and is, say, running 430</page><page sequence="3">Chaos or Control: Our No-Win Situation amok. Amok is a Malay word for battling furiously, which people in Southeast Asia do, or used to do, when they had to act against the orderly, ceremonious life of cultivated ritual, the sanction of the complaisant smile, the agreeable rigidities of a comparatively gentle culture in which an individual could not say, No! or, Go to hell! Our word for such a battler is from the Old Norse, to go berserk, and the berserker was one whom fire and iron could not harm in his frenzy. Such violent ones were useful in the old warfare. Was Samson such? Was the Philistine champion, Goliath, such a one too? David, the clever shepherd lad, settled him from a distance, with a stone slung between his eyes. Goliath was not cut down and subdued in single combat, for he could not be. Perhaps the egg-sized stone only stunned him momentarily, yet long enough for David to seize his chance and hack off the giant's head. The story is suggestive for my theme, and it will illustrate the prob lem I pose at the end. To continue, we assume that control must be and can only be rational because the word's history in its present meaning goes very far back: through controler (Med. Fr.), contreroller (Old Fr.), contrarotulus (Med. Lat.), to contra -f- rotulus (Lat.), where it meant to compare with a list, to keep a checklist and to check against it. Control today generally denotes the means of guiding a ma chine with another, some device or mechanism, or employing the mechanism of our own body to do so. To control is to com pare the effects of two or more actions, rendered more or less absolutely identical or carefully divergent, as in scientific ex periment, even down to the limit of infinitesimal particles, even virtual or putative and imaginary particles nowadays, or the signs thereof. It is to check items or people against an inven tory, as at the entrance to the White House, or the boarding ramp of the airplane, or the powwow of godfathers. A con trol is also a reliable spirit who does all of that for you if you are a medium calling other spirits at random from the in numerable hosts of the dead. A control, a checklist, must in variably be the first accounting device of an organized society, and it must long antedate the inventory Joseph taught Pharaoh 431</page><page sequence="4">The Massachusetts Review to make 5000 years ago. As the story puts it, probably invert ing the truth, though Joseph was the son of a shepherd clan's patriarch from the barbarous outback with whom Egyptians could not sit down to eat, it was he who had the idea of the control, first teaching management to Potiphar, Captain of the Guard, and then to Pharaoh, whose Kingdoms he organized by means of mortgages against a checklist of grain and oil staples advanced to the starving vassals out of the royal store houses, those independent barons broken by the having to hock their estates. What is interesting in all this is that to have a controlling checklist you must have a means of noting items in records -, in short a code, or language. It is unnecessary to review the myth of language in Genesis, for it is obvious that the first sort of control is to be the peculiarly human novelty, development, or mutation, though language is hardly the first device that acts as a controlling code in living things. If other animals have "languages" or can learn them in the way we are teach ing chimpanzees to, then the issue is set back only that much farther in time, for it means that animal life itself developed certain mnemonic devices which were meant to help them tally items in the world about them, thus establishing guidelines for survival behavior. A checklist as we use it is an explicit varia ble code, a system of signs merging into symbols, and is a vocabulary developed slowly by addition or accretion or experi ence in the individual and in the social group through the passage of time. The world is full of many things, events and novelties, which in their number or their multitudinous individ uality are nearly infinite, if not actually infinite. It is our re sponse to our own life in time, it is our crying out, like Adam, the name of the creature, that gives us our language, our thoughts, and our means of control. One could say that lan guage is rational, in itself, no matter how disordered or scram bled the lists which have come into being over the last two or three million years, or more, lists constantly changing and blurring. One supposes too that the list has itself been in con stant evolution from the first words of Adam, or of our own 432</page><page sequence="5">Chaos or Control: Our No-Win Situation child of five months, lucky and innocent creatures that they were, and still are for that matter. But here is exactly where our problem lies, though it occurs first long ago, or if one prefers occurs first, for each of us, at about five months of age. Our lists obviously do not exhaust the world. We do not have a word or a mark for each single thing or event in existence. (One could speculate, however, that God, if He exists, does have such a thing, or did origi nally. Imagine a tag for each atom, and one for each of its many particle constituents. The ultimate list, the ultimate in ventory, is then some sort of duplication of existence itself. If so, its form must be interesting indeed. It makes God into the ultimate mathematician whom Laplace, Pascal, and Descartes speculated He must be, the ultimate memory bank of the ulti mate computer. That would be to understand God and His universe as rational. Or, perhaps better, as rationalized. But we have decided in the 20th Century that such a conception is utterly abhorrent, and in fact simply an hubristic anthropo morphism.) But because we use language as our checklist, we don't need an expression for each single atom and event. In stead we have the gross category of words and the blank classes and category of number to remember and to anticipate, and we use words at least with redundancy edged by a wide band of noise to rationalize experience, categorize it, arrange it accord ing to varying senses and degrees of order so as to place ex perience into some kind of mental structure by means of a process we call reason. One may perhaps look at history as the pattern of the growth of reason, or rationality of a special kind: a long, evolutionary groping through trial and error, on the strict interpretation of the theory of evolution, toward the reason we call rational: the scientific or positivistic process and method of arranging our findings and our thoughts, and the applications of these thoughts to reality. And with success, as shown by our technology. For the technological society, and the scientific methods of investigation upon which it is based, and for which we must be congratulated, as well as being re spectful and grateful towards it, has evolved by means of the 433</page><page sequence="6">The Massachusetts Review checklist, the mnemonic of the inventory of identified things which permits experiments on nature by means of control over the limited collection of events and observed actions and tagged items. It needed but the creation and development of the most powerful means of succinct generalization, mathematical nota tion, to free modern technology from alchemical myths and the unrefined traditions of the most ancient, traditional crafts, to bring humanity to this period of exponentially expanding powers, in which scientific theory and practice are interwoven indivisibly, and theory exists for the sake of practice and is called up, or out, or in by the demands of practice. We have been made aware over the last decades that science and tech nology, theoretically speaking, are subsuming the very earth itself, while at the very same time the kind of knowledge we have reveals how little we know about the effects of our own alterations of the fabric of global existence, micro- and macro cosmically. In the last decade our knowledge of the solar sys tem and the sun has increased hundreds-fold, in detail as well as in the gross fields of force. And now the leapfrogging re finements of computer technology seem to promise shortly that it would be possible, again theoretically speaking, or with just a little hyperbole, that we should obtain, store and thus re order, or make rational in mathematical formulation, informa tion about every physical event on the earth. Laplace's vision; or if not his exactly, that of some other hyperrational French mathematician, Poincare, say. What this suggests is that our dream of science, of Faustian knowing, seems to be evolving toward the rational control, the rationalized inventory at least, of existence itself. To know, to have recorded existence, to hold it conceptually in the grasp of mathematical statement, is a benign ideal?in principle. But one may ask, Why rationalize, why control existence? The answer is self-evident, though not necessary: for power's sake, for the sake of acting upon it. Since Bacon, modern science has dreamed of knowing, not for knowing's sake, but in order to exert power and to act upon existence. This has been the chief theme of our development, perhaps from the most ancient, 434</page><page sequence="7">Chaos or Control: Our No-Win Situation even paleolithic times, if not earlier. Insofar as science has a value or goal, that seems to be it. It has never been ascetic or contemplative, and perhaps cannot be because all checklisting is essentially a form of keeping count of time, and in time, making one tally, then another, and another, and so forth. And, as Bacon implied, to get to nature one must experiment upon it, obeying nature in order to command it, learning nature's rules in order to apply them, so as to maintain ourselves pro gressively more securely in it. To conquer nature, in short. It has been a faith, adhered to ever more strongly, more self justifyingly, since the late Renaissance . . . rather, it has been the faith of scientists, who are the new priests and theologians too. For it is the scientist who removed from both those offices what is considered unwarranted anthropomorphic presumption: the idea that life is a mystery, that it was created for us by God, and that human beings have existed or do exist for certain high ends or goods; furthermore, that they have a sense of those ends, a superior sense as compared to a dog or an oak tree, both of which creations find it more or less "easy" and "natural" to become what they finally are and must be: a dog, an oak tree. And, that man shares in the divine, the transcen dent, in a sense of those patterns preexistent in God's mind, which are the same as those fixed patterns that not only rule but that are the cosmos, an idea that was expressed by Socrates first, was developed by Aristotle and appears fully in Spinoza and Kant, and has developed through Hegel into the God of History, not the Old Testament deity at all, but rather the dialectic of matter itself. The modern temper, the scientific temper?evolutionist, empiricist, rationalistic?compares man with the natural event, indeed has reduced him to the natural event solely, without admitting that its presumption is as philo sophical and hypothetical as Epicurus' was. It tries to find the laws, no matter how subtle, that govern the movements of the natural event, which is taken to be essentially a thing that can be measured, counted, recorded and acted upon: these are the laws that are the interest of physics and chemistry. In short, the world as it is known to the scanner of the checklist. 435</page><page sequence="8">The Massachusetts Review Descartes would have approved it completely, although he might have been puzzled at the omission from that checklist of the cogitating being he presumed he was, the consciousness named as consciousness or awareness, but not yet amenable to measurement, or demonstrable as what one might call the pres ence of mind. One must agree unreservedly that the growth of our scien tific technology, as a mapping of the world, including the sphere of life, has helped us enormously to put things in their proper perspective. Things. All things. And now, life itself has been examined down to the smallest of its molecular struc tures. The prefix of life, or bios, has migrated to physics and chemistry, and the study of matter that lives is the fastest growing field in science today. There is hardly any question at all that the creation of life itself, and the structure encoding it?a set of two dozen amino acids on a twisted two-stranded rope of molecules that seem to be as fixed and determinable as the orbits of the planets, governing the activity of all organic existence?will imminently be achieved in a laboratory. Soon some biochemist will place a molecular needle through one of those microscopic molecules and replace an amino acid with an other ... in order to do?what? block a genetic defect, avoid the cleft palate? cure latent albinism? make all people white, or black? slow down the governor that controls the metabolism of growth and decay? The first act of that nature, the first tampering with an xxy chromosome or pigmentation gene, the first cloning of some privileged person, will be the release of a band of questionings of value, a demon band it may seem to some, that science has refused to contemplate, limited by its own rigorous attitude to nature as the mere world of things and only things. Scientists have been afraid of reviving an thropomorphic desires, images, patterns, lest teleological dog mas rise from the compost heap of civilizations, lest it become fashionable to think that there are purposes, forms, goals, de signs by which and for which life, not things, but life strives. If, of course, and only if life strives at all. 436</page><page sequence="9">Chaos or Control: Our No-Win Situation Yet such questions and their attendant teleological ghosts are coming, are upon us already. In fact, they have been upon us throughout this century, waiting for proper recogni tion. Since the withering away of European Dualism and the restricted cultivation of metaphysical thought in private plots of language, or linguistic analysis, the scientists have taken for themselves the entire world of things, the materiality of every where. They left the world of psyche, pneuma, soul, spirit, and (most important) that of mind to psychologists and a few ontologists and maverick theologians, in whose hands it sur vived decaying, or decayed as mode of survival, because it was unsupported by the mode of life in our times, as well as any self-evidencings of life itself ... or none that we could read in our existence. The interface of matter and mind, the person, the human personality or spirit, so-called, was aban doned like an uninhabitable city. The derelict ruins have been the temporary abode of transients, poets and artists among them, fanatic sects and heterodox religious clans and associa tions, more or less fortuitously assembled. Since the Romantic period those raggletaggles have too often resembled the mad men, distraught and fallen women, thieves, bums and simple tons that wander the wilderness between settled places during a great interregnum. Another way of observing that science has flooded out the world of the human past is to remark that the main feature of mature civilizations has been secularization. Formerly, the passing away of the old gods in such a time was marked by an expectation, hopeful and fearful at once, of signs announcing the birth of new gods and their new order, of anxious ques tions put to a society. We have not quite reached that stage in our time, however. The walls are still falling in upon us, and the din and darkness of confusion obscure our hearing and vision. One may wonder, though, if our scientists are prepared to put forward a system of philosophy that can account for the relationship that, on their theoretical ground, must obtain be tween the controls, dna and rna, the fundamental check list items of organic life, and thought, between dna and rna 437</page><page sequence="10">The Massachusetts Review and consciousness, between dna and rna and the life of the mind? There is much analysis and discussion of social systems, about the simplest and most complex forms of social group ings, the behavior of intracellular units, of salmon fry, Arctic terns who migrate from pole to pole annually, but nothing very clear yet describing the relationship of the genetic coding molecules and consciousness, language, thought. Philosophical values are not their business or proper concern, scientists say, because scientific pursuits must be value-free as far as possible; the questioner is referred to technologists for relief of his anxious ignorance. Or told that his questions are meaningless or mystical. But that powers given to us by science are out of control, their uses unquestioned, or questioned by ecologists in political ways merely, as holding actions meant to give more breathing space, is the great fact of this time. Yet, there are social grounds that have made scientific and technological knowledge possible in the first place. Since Bacon wrote, the values that created modern science have been sodal values, symbolized usually as those of Faustian Man. Science in short is not free, certainly not value-free. The most "humanist Marxism" never pretends to attack more than the social insti tutions in which technology flourishes. All other sects are silent on this topic, or cynical, supplying tribal cultures with the latest in weaponry and pamphlets and not much else. The past 150 years have shown us nothing but avant-garde artistic rebels, social reactionaries and a plethora of obscure and/or obscuran tist mystical sects and votaries, surviving as luxuries in rich societies, or destroyed by totalitarian systems like the Chinese, or going unnoticed as yet in the vast disorganization of India. There may be much, perhaps everything, to be learned from the spiritual adepts remaining in the world 5 yet it is also clear that there is a profound chasm between their kind of knowl edge and science itself. Perhaps it may well be unbridgeable. Nevertheless, though we stand now in this confusion, and though we are not being asked to understand, or condone, or forgive them?and certainly we may not be equipped to help the scientists erect a philosophical theory of life's evolution 438</page><page sequence="11">Chaos or Control: Our No-Win Situation into consciousness that they so desperately need, we can remind them that they are shirking the issues and their responsibility. There are some biophysicists who have even acknowledged that there is such a responsibility, at least indirectly, by meeting to establish guidelines concerning their work with mutant microbes being created in their laboratories, which constitute a potential threat greater than that of possible thermonuclear warfare. We may suggest that the history of modern science and its technological consequences demands of scientists that they face that responsibility to the world. That perhaps they cannot both reject Aristotle's concept that there may be ends that things exist fory goals toward which they strive, and at the same time accept the other Greek idea that knowledge is merely theory, speculation, contemplation of the world as a source of intellec tual gratification, of knowing for its own sake. Modern scien tific knowledge is underwritten by the implied order that it can doy and that it does do in order to know. It is dynamic, for ward-looking . . . but to what ends? It is as obscurantist to deny that knowledge has goals beyond knowledge as to deny all knowledge of science in the pursuit of nirvana, satori, identifi cation with Being itself. It is time to turn now to the question asked at the begin ning, What are the prospects for control of the mind? I said earlier that those prospects seem to be very good. First, what is meant in common parlance by mind? Do we think of persons? do we think of their brains, the kind of activity being manipulated in current feedback experimentation, which is a kind of laboratory yoga? Do we think of their whole lives? Do we have any scientific values or knowledge attached to the term life as personal history? as something more than the vast accumulation of psychological data, something more than the metabolism that differentiates us from the inorganic and atomic? Is the mechanical replication of dna molecules life? Is the resurrection of a Pharaoh by making up a chromosomal lattice from his mummified flesh the same as making him live? If so, will it be acceptable, or merely indifferent? Could we 439</page><page sequence="12">The Massachusetts Review bow down to him again? Would we pay millions if some simu lator copied, say, Rembrandt's portrait of his son Titus, and spat it out, identical, like a 2^ xerox copy of this page? Prob ably not, market considerations aside, simply because it is we who have created that Egyptian, or fabricated that canvas. Similarly, would we value a mind that we have ordered in the same rational way? I think not. It will merely have conformed, we would say, to what we have said is its (rational) life. Yet, ordering a mind because it is good to do so, perhaps a moral duty of some sort, is exactly what Plato prescribes for us in the Republic, it is the goal of higher religions everywhere, with some specialists in all religions seeking that control for further development in the form of escape itself and union with that which is transcendent Being. But if we do not have such a teleological end in view, some doctrine of purpose?which I think has already surreptitiously inserted itself into our scien tific experimentation on the basic elements of living things? then we are acting, as we always have, in ignorance. And igno rant action we certainly do not believe is good. If matter is merely blind matter, acting as it must and throwing up patterns in statistical agglutinations, as the Epicureans thought, why not let it alone, as the Taoists believed was the essential way to go? Why seek a knowledge of Nature so profound as to be able to alter its fabric significantly enough to disrupt its equilibrium? And why call that disruption progress, accelerated, assisted, or cooperative evolution, when, as Henry Adams remarked, evo lution could just as well be a tendentious, self-congratulatory term for change, and mere change at that? Why, in short, should we dare to tamper with the microparticles of the bio sphere's constituents, or consider directing and controlling the biosphere's global environment? Possibly because we have, as human beings, always done so to the full extent of our ability. But if human purposiveness is a delusion, at best only the effect of the blind momentum of dna and rna?as the mythical ex pansions of mind or exploded awarenesses are perhaps delu sions caused by the alkaloids of various powerful hallucinogens, from whose chemically-induced trips one must always return 440</page><page sequence="13">Chaos or Control: Our No-Win Situation home to our ancestral dwellingplace in reality?then we stand all the more in need of assistance from philosophy, from ra tional thought. Thinking is very difficult y it requires that lan guage transcend itself, as logic and mathematics have done. But language is not logical or mathematical; it is not an ab stract, created system, but something we do not understand yet. At any rate, it is a very well-recognized need today that thought must be given to the construction of a value system for scientists. Without some such framework, science remains as blind as technological inertia, and as demented and empty at the core. Much worse, it can be said, than the blind, uncon scious material world science explores, which is not free to re treat or turn aside from its own courses. Those who follow the hypothesis of Teilhard de Chardin have merely presumed with him that matter is impelled toward consciousness, that human ity, together with the reknit fabric of the biosphere, will poten tiate that consciousness, and that by some synergistic leap, intuited by mystics long ago, it will transcend itself and take all with it into the new condition of physics dematerialized, his notorious noosphere. All well and good. But it may be asked if Chardin, dreaming of his physics of communism, or com munalism, of his world of the spirit, ever really allowed him self to weigh the consequences of what he himself recognized as an ancient tendency of the species toward collectivism and a totalistic, terror-driven collectivism, at that? If he considered adequately the more likely possibility that, even if his surmise about evolution was in the right direction, that the whole leap forward might not be more likely to fall short of the energy level required, and come to rest in the lower orbit of a dark ened noosphere, a sort of dry, hot, lightless place: a new hell, in fact? He could not think that, as a believing Christian, and as a maverick scientific Catholic theologian, though he didn't perhaps count himself as qualified in theology. But if we accept the notion that rational, or rationalized thought has grown slowly together with science and technology, a new bud on the evolutionary tree, isn't it also possible that it may be a wild growth? that it may be as successful and de 441</page><page sequence="14">The Massachusetts R eview stabilizing as birds or plants introduced out of their original ecological niche to a defenseless environment? Or, if humanity is this vigorous shoot on the randomly growing evolutionary tree, why have we had to wait three or four million years for this new development to come about in its life? If thinkers are beginning to speculate on the future of human evolution, per haps it is merely an adaptive response to our current situation, and not free but a response conditioned by the awareness of a situation realized, too late, to be overwhelmingly dangerous to survival. Is that kind of defensive rationality good? Is it not just as likely that our kind of scientific, positivistic rationalism is a sort of cancerous growth, a rather successful adaptation of dna and rna to the "unnatural" environment we have our selves produced around us, one which includes not only the biosphere but the sublunary region of space around the planet. That environment is not one that it now seems possible to escape. Enrich it as we may by our operations, it may soon be a dead lake, having absorbed its own means of biological sup port. All of this kind of metaphorical questioning is hyper bolical, since one can describe the world and society in almost any way and seem to be saying something true of it. Yet, isn't it possible to assert that our kind of rationality, based on a view of man and the universe that excludes what used to be known as the spirit, once immanent in a unified cosmic web of natural events and things (whether the Greek view, the Egyptian or Chinese and Indian), and seen as transcendental in the Western monotheisms, is not a very full view of existence? The posi tivistic, scientific-technological rationalism that extirpated spirit, denied, banished spirit in the Cartesian view that made modern physics and mathematical analysis possible, the universe of iron law recognized as belonging to Zeus the Tyrant as long ago as Aeschylus' time?that may not be supportable any longer. To assume that all that lives is merely behaving according to the laws of matter is to assume what we have not yet been able to learn about consciousness, whether it is or is not present in some fashion at the most elementary levels. We hesitate to apply such a doctrine thoroughly, although positivism has urged us 442</page><page sequence="15">Chaos or Control: Our No-Win Situation to be systematic from the start, and to follow the way of think ing of Descartes, for instance, who asserts there is nothing else beside matter?and himself thinking. Yet the positivism that assumes that life has no goals at all, or no goals tangent to what it describes as the evolutionary drift, and then assumes further that our method of proceeding into the future must be dictated by rationality is perhaps assuming too much, as Faust ian Man has been wont to. But is existence only rational? Is it to be formulated only and ultimately by mathematical con stants? The answer must be yes, if one considers the develop ment of ever more incredibly powerful means of computation, and projects the design of machines for calculation into the near future, when the machines will be designing the machines. It may be, as the saying has it, the only way to go. If so, the irrational aspects of human life and society will dwindle to the status of luxuries, and the collectivity of the human future will be, because poorer, unable to tolerate lux uries, which are wasteful efforts. The inability of intelligent and educated young people to understand and respond to the questions of the spirit, as phrased by the arts, for example, is an ominous sign. The preferred arts are the unspiritual, or despiritualized and surrogate arts, or the "uneconomic" crafts, so-called. The rationalized checklist by which life is to be grasped and controlled, however, will be a determined neces sity, and the individual will perforce conform or be made to conform to its limitations, and all choices will be limited to the consumer inventory. Yet can we actually suppress by means of our powers of con trol all that remainder of the bios swarming about us in natural subsystems? what are termed ecological niches today? (rapidly being eliminated too). And who will determine, if it becomes the prerogative of a conscious, organized bureaucracy of tech nocrats, the rationalized, limited inventory that will constitute the future? Will it be indeed any sort of a future, capable of novelty? For novelty is unpredictable and by definition not rational, or even probable, if controls are so far extended over our life on earth. Or, is there to be no future at all, at least 443</page><page sequence="16">The Massachusetts Review not in the sense that it may contain or even can contain un known goals toward which the psyche, the mind, the body and spirit, whatever, are unconsciously striving? And unconsciously means nonrationally. As far as science thinks now, the answer is quite clearly, No. Even a thoroughgoing positivistic behav iorist like Professor Skinner cannot see, no matter how often it is pointed out to him, the contradiction between his theory and his propounding the construction of a society based on that theory?the propounding being in his own view determined freely, or so he claims. A future sans the spirit, whatever the term covers, is perhaps unacceptable. The rationalist has already accepted it, indeed Socrates both accepted it, in assuming the universe ran on its own momentum, and denied it, by calmly accepting extinction here because he assured his disciples, as in the Crito and Phaedo, that he himself had found the way out of existence and would be accepted at some other plane of being. In the West, since Socrates, the god of the philosophers has been the god absent since his act of creation, or the god immanent in the machine of the universe, that is the abstract concretion of the laws of matter. There is nothing therefore very surprising in the fact that humanity has launched itself on the path of identification with the laws of matter, by means of its application of its scien tific knowledge of them. Any refusal to join that present and future must be based on some nonrational disposition of the spirit, or even an irrational one. Despite the fact that the phi losophers long ago ruled such a disposition out of the discus sion, and the scientists have followed them, it is perhaps neces sary to say that we must find the way to look forward to the discovery, not the creation only, of a realm of spirituality in ourselves as individuals, on the basis of which, or merely from the hint of its possibility, one can think of a system of proper human goals, among which may be life and not death. Otherwise we are condemned to the slavery of the mat ter-machine, now being controlled more and more by our own unrationalized science and technology. We are condemned 444</page><page sequence="17">Chaos or Control: Our No-Win Situation to subsist somehow in what is simply a blind nihilism, or stoic existentialism. Which is where we are now, if we consider the range of thinking available to us today. Whatever one might come to understand by maintaining an open place for the term spirituality, open and expectant of definition and fulfillment, it is sure that it must mean far more than what we know now as rationality. And it must include some notion of ends that is greater than the surd of faith, in itself a fairly rare gift of irrationality, as Kierkegaard realized in despair, and something other than systematic or systemic derangement of the senses, for madness, like the poor, we have always had with us. We must be careful to remember that spirit was separated from matter by Descartes, for example, again, in order to get on with his mathematizing. The rationalism that excluded mind, lan guage, emotion and spirituality from matter was intent on measuring space and locating the stars; it was probably already rudimentarily pursuing numeration in paleolithic times, if not before. But when it began to realize that Nature was to be grasped by means of laws, it also began taking itself, the part, for the whole. And no one knows the whole, or ever did. What is imperative is that science must begin to think of the whole, beyond even the new cosmological theorization that our vastly expanded reach into past time and out to ungraspable distances of space has suscitated in the 70's. But the whole is to be grasped in some way as part of the infinitesimal here and now as well. Unfortunately, the very same instruments that have enlarged our views of the universe, both infinite and in finitesimal, have lent substance to the fear that we can use them to control that part which is the earth and everything on it with our small checklist of items, material items, that is. The danger posed to our ignorance of the whole by the little we now know is so imminent that it is possible to say that all that rationalism has excluded from any further attempts to consider and understand, the irrational, unreason, and the spiritual and absurd, however difficult to accommodate in our life's work, is hardly as threatening to our very existence as the illusions of rationality, its fascination with its own systems of power, and 445</page><page sequence="18">The Massachusetts Review its perhaps unself-conscious demonism. For the self-governing control is no control at all, since it refers to nothing else by way of checking itself out, and runs, like the universe of the philosophers, on its own momentum, which may be the ulti mate description, not of rationality but of essential unreason. Finally, the kind of rationality we have depended on, the mathematical model of timeless laws operant somehow in time may be fundamentally defective too. If one considers that one of the attributes of spirituality has been its contemplation of time and timelessness together, one will realize that time, which is most likely irreversible, and directed on one dimension only, forward, must suggest the idea of an end or goal. That exis tence is time-bound, hence bound somewhere with time, should suggest that we must develop some moral responsibility toward the future, the sense of which rationalism has been utterly de void of from the start. As animals we have always been domi nated by spatial thinking, like the other species sprung from this biomass. But as primates with language we have slowly come to some sense that time may be the dimension that chal lenges us fundamentally j reciprocally, that increasing knowl edge of time and the sense of living on a scale of greater ex panse than that of our own moment, may be the seed of a nascent spirituality that has not yet begun to mature, and may not ever come into being if we poison the earth itself. Or if, as I suggested at the outset, we presume to control the con tents of our thought and the nature of our physical being so thoroughly on the basis of our still very limited knowledge of the whole of reality, then we choose, or allow ourselves, to become the slaves of the unexamined dogma that nothing exists but the inertia of things as described by laws formulated in numbers, and if we accede to the despotism of the rule of those laws, we shall have only the impersonalism that has resulted in every great system of religion as well as in organized scien tific exploration and thought. At this point in history we have gained the means of applying those ancient doctrines very thoroughly indeed. It is childish to blame science or technology, of course. We must recognize this cause as lying in ourselves 446</page><page sequence="19">Chaos or Control: Our No-Win Situation alone, in our delusion that we are rational in pursuing only the rational itself. afterthought: In thinking about the pessimism expressed l\ in this essay on the possibilities of control of the mind in our future, I recalled a dream I had before writing it. Like many dreams it conveys a thought, but this one in opposition to the conscious thoughts I followed on the supposition that humanity faces either chaos or control. The dream seems to suggest another way ... I find myself standing in a city that had been destroyed once, or suddenly emptied. I stand among ruins, on a deserted square in the very center of the ancient city. Yet it has also the appearance of having been recently excavated, as in the Roman Forum, the old streets exposed again and cleared of debris. It also seems somehow a neighbor hood of my childhood, in summertime. It occurs to me that it was perhaps the ancient Jewish Quarter of Roman times. But ?there were new street signs on new posts: Kind Street, Charity Street, Faith Street, Hope Street, Good Street. How strange! I remark, to a young girl walking beside me. Yet one might deduce that naming ways after such qualities could be a clue to the vanished ideals of those long-dead people. Perhaps poor anthropology to assume such names as clues to the ethical ideals they may have pursued. I wonder how they would go in Italian today?Strada di Speranza? Via della Carita? Viale del Buono? etcetera. How amusing they sound! Yet everything was, alas, gone. Still, these signs were newly put up, freshly painted. How was that? How odd .... One might ask of this dream, merely, Who or what puts up such signs in the desolation of the abandoned city? The answer to that question will furnish a clue to my argument, perhaps not always explicit, against a future based on the human ideal of rational controls on the world and society. 447</page></plain_text>
