Heidegger, Hölderlins Hymne "Der Ister" Because Heidegger's thinking holds itself rapt on one issue, Being, the poetry of Hölderlin must pertain essentially to that issue; no mere aesthetic prefer ence or personal liking for Hölderlin could justify Heidegger's extensive reading of that poet's poetry. Reading Hölderlin, Heidegger says, is a question "only of That which sets this work into work and, that is, always, what it conceals and holds contained in itself' (A, 6).1 More specifically, Heidegger says that Hölderlin's poetry speaks in a mode of saying that overcomes the tradition's forgottenness of Being and prepares for thinking the way unto another beginning.2 Involved deeply "in the withdrawal and in the reserve" of Being,3 Hölderlin's poetry speaks neither the language of logic nor that of formal grammar, because Hölderlin's essential words, Heidegger writes, do not issue from anything like a metaphysical subject (I, 203). Hölderlin's poetizing is essential thinking, and thrives in the Free (G, 50). 139</page><page sequence="2">140 ARTHUR A. GRUGAN About Hölderlin, Heidegger writes, "Essential thinking must always orig inally say the same, the old, the oldest, the original. As Hölderlin says it—the most German [of poets] because he poetizes from the occidental history of Being itself and thus is the first coming poet of the Germans."4 Hölderlin is crucial to Heidegger's thinking of Being, because in Hölderlin's poetry we witness for the first time the transcendence beyond the realm of art and of beauty and, in fact, of all metaphysics (A, 63); because Hölderlin's poetry remains outside metaphysics and outside the realm of western art metaphys ically interpreted (I, 21); because the thinking that goes on in and as Hölderlin's poetry uncovers (I, 21), thus engaging it explicitly with the question of truth, "since what is poetized itself lets emerge the authentic truth of the true" (A, 53); and because the saying peculiar to Hölderlin's poetry "is in itself the jubilation of Being, the exulting peace of Being in the endurance of its storms" (G, 255). Accordingly, Heidegger's reading of Hölderlin's poetry understands itself as a "thoughtful discussion with the revelation of Being gained in this poetry" (G, 6). Hölderlin's poetry has established standards—measures—different from the measures of the tradition, wherein the principle of noncontradiction reigns with surpassing authority, demanding univocity of word-meanings and precision of concepts and rejecting all vestiges of ambiguity and indeter minateness (A, 14—16). Judged in the light of that principle, Hölderlin's poetry would not fare well. For example, in Hyperion,5 Hölderlin writes, "There are sacred names," while in Heimkunft he writes, "Sacred names are wanting." In the fragmentary essay "Uber Achill,"7 Hölderlin calls Homer "the poet of all poets," although in the second of his Magisterspecimina, Geschichte der schönen Künste unter den Griechen,6 he writes that the hymns of Pindar mark the "zenith of poetic art" in Greece. In Andenken,9 Hölderlin asks that some one "pass me the fragrant cup / Full of dark light, / So that I might rest." In what sense are goblets fragrant? Is it the cup's contents, the dark light, that is fragrant? Is this hypallage? Is there an aromaticity to light? Is that synaesthesia? Does not "dark light" stretch the most resilient oxymo ron to the edge of senselessness? Furthermore, Heidegger makes the following observations: First, he sug gests that Hölderlin's use of the arch categories Apollo and Dionysos must be understood as presaging the overcoming of metaphysics and thus as indicat ing precisely the reverse of what Nietzsche and hence the entire tradition have meant by them (A, 154). Second, Heidegger points out that, according to Hölderlin, men are and are not signs (cf I, 30-31); that at the source the poet is and is not at home (I, 160-61); that mysteries must be spoken yet allowed to remain unspoken (G, 44-45). Third, maps and documents from antiquity indicate that the ancients named the northern portion of the Danube River the Donau and the southern portion of that river the Ister; yet</page><page sequence="3">HEIDEGGER: PREPARING TO READ HÖLDERLIN'S "GERMANIEN" 141 Heidegger explains that Hölderlin reverses those designations (I, 10). How do we begin to read a poet whose poetry seems so extensively to flout logic and common sense, and to set significant traditional literary, philo sophical, and customary assumptions out of order and strain to the breaking point the authority oflong-standing aesthetic norms (A, 3)? How do we gain access to a poetry that is eminently but utterly unfamiliarly intelligible, especially if all our modes of knowledge are themselves rooted in metaphysics (I, 21)? Hölderlin's statements are always unintelligible, for essential rea sons, within a certain realm of intelligibility, Heidegger writes (I, 40). We can, therefore, ask if there exists an order of intelligibility independent of the tradition's, one not governed by the measures of logic or ruled by modern metaphysics.10 Hölderlin's poetry, Heidegger argues, moves about within a region of meaning that demands of thinking a lawfulness and rigor higher than metaphysical exactitude and definitional precision; it encounters mys teries and essential puzzles where such things do not exist for planning, reasonable man (A, 32), because, invested with singular rigor, it stands outside the opposition of the univocal and the equivocal, the exact and the inexact. (A, 26): Passages and fragments of pure limpidity and simple transport alternate with passages and fragments of utter darkness and concealed alarm. (A, 24) The two major figures Creon and Antigone do not oppose one another like dark and light, like black and white, like guilt and innocence. The essential element of both is, as it is, but in every case in another way—from the unity of essence and unessence. (I, 64) Heidegger's principle concern is to think "the poetry in the poem" (G, 25), to press ahead in thought "beyond the poem to its poetry as to what is essential" (G, 48)." Heidegger, therefore, is not concerned with poems as such, or with Hölderlin the man, or with Hölderlin's works. How, then, are we to contact that poetry? For poems do not deliver up their poetry as buckets empty their contents; or as physical bodies, their integuments sliced open and peeled back, reveal their crowded insides; or as organic com pounds, whose distinctive structures determine the wave length at which they absorb radiant energy, record their identifying structures on the ma chinery of infrared spectroscopy or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. To contact Hölderlin's poetry, we must learn to think nonmetaphysically, a task that requires a radical transformation of our essence (I, 40) and of our relationship to the essence of language (G, 23). What is poetized by a poem is not its "content," as if what is poetized were like the water and the poem like the glass that was filled up with it. Nor is what is poetized the "fruit" of the poem, as if what is poetized were the apple and the poem the growing branch of the surging tree. We do not generally find anything comparable to this relationship. (A, 29-30)</page><page sequence="4">142 ARTHUR A. GRUGAN Before interpreting Germanien's groundmood—a term central to Hölderlin's "aesthetics"12—Heidegger presents an initial reflection that consists of an Introduction (G, 3-8) and a Preparatory Meditation (G, 14—77). In this paper, we want to examine only one issue from the Introduction and only those preparatory reflections that deal with language and poetry. We will not treat the preparatory reflections on mood, time, history, or community. The Introduction How do we begin the work of reading? How do we avoid the error of "completely mistaking and misreading" the poetry (G, 79)? What does it mean to formulate questions about what we read—questions that transcend ordinary and even philosophical modes of questioning and answering and thus avoid the "devastation of all authentic thinking" (G, 41); questions about the interpenetration of Being and language, "because language," Heidegger writes, "stands in an essential relationship to the singularity of Being"13; questions that ground "a truthful knowledge of our Being and, accordingly and in advance, of Being as such" (G, 77)? How do we initiate our reading of Germanien, if indeed we are the real initiators? What is a start (Beginn) and a beginning (Anfang), and what does it mean to proceed? A start, Heidegger says, is that with which something commences (anhebt); a beginning is that from which something springs forth (entspringt). The former is derivative and the latter is originary. Indeed their difference is so radically primordial that man "can never begin with the beginning," can never master or direct or institute origins; "only a God can do that," Heidegger says (G, 3-4). Yet starts and beginnings remain essentially connected, as do unessence and essence, for "the beginning is concealed in the start.'"4 Accordingly, men "must start, that is, must commence with something that only leads into the origin or that points to it" (G, 4), but not with the origin itself, as if origins were present-at-hand objects to be manipulated as man sees fit: The start is immediately left behind; it vanishes in the progress of what is happening. On the other hand, the beginning, the origin, first of all comes to appear in what is happening, and it is fully there for the first time at its end. Who starts many things often never comes to the beginning. (G, 3) Heidegger thus starts his lectures on Germanien by "placing the poem 'Germanien' at the start to point ahead to the beginning" (G, 4), and he devotes special attention to the beginnings of each of Germanien's seven stanzas, for those beginnings indicate how, as the poem advances, "the mode and the level of saying and of the sayer is different" (G, 46). To start, therefore, Heidegger examines four issues: Everydayness, scholarship, the expression theory of language, and poetry. We should like to address each issue.</page><page sequence="5">HEIDEGGER: PREPARING TO READ HÖLDERLINS "GERMANIEN" 143 Everydayness To avoid misinterpreting Hölderlin's entirely different poetic saying from the outset, we must interrogate the pertinacious peculiarity of customariness itself (I, 26); indeed, to uncover the truth of any art-work, we must shatter and abandon the blind, opinionated self-assurance that marks precisely our everyday opinion-making (I, 76). Thoughtful reading of Hölderlin requires, therefore, that we submit everydayness, which is essential, constant, sys temic, to "relentless examination" (G, 20). This is a question of our fallen ness, of the fact that our thinking is constituted by an ineradicable declension towards nonessential thinking, towards errancy.15 Sein und Zeit already recognized that our fallenness leads us to "read, see, and judge works of literature and art" with everyday representations;16 and that insight con tinues to be operative in Heidegger's Hölderlin commentaries, since our original mode of encountering Germanien as a present-at-hand reading selec tion, Heidegger writes, "will persist—and in a certain sense continuously and inextinguishably—" throughout our reading of it (G, 47). Constantly lodging the unfamiliar in the familiar, we customarily interpret poetry as an exception to everyday modes of speaking, as a lofty anomaly.17 Heidegger writes, "Because, without our knowing it, we have everywhere at the ready the most familiar as the refuge for everything, the familiar relation ship to the 'works' of poetry must first be abandoned here" (A, 1-2). Indeed, when everydayness governs our perceptions, even philosophical views of language will erroneously regard poetry as merely what is different from the norm, just as we perceive greatness in terms of the measures of smallness (A, 21): Poetic saying declines, however, becomes genuine and then bad "prose," and this, finally, becomes Gerede. From this everyday use of words—from the form of decline, therefore—scientific reflections on language and language philosophy proceed, and then regard "poetry" as an exception to the rule. Thus is everything stood on its head. (G, 64) Yet poetry contests with everydayness, and estranges. As the essence of art, poetry "breaks open an open place, in whose openness everything is other than usual," Heidegger writes.18 Consequently, to think poetry, we must "slowly disabuse ourselves" of everyday views about poems and poetry (A, 25), and transform our customary modes of representing poetry into an uncustomary—because simple and thoughtful—experience.19 We learn to think Hölderlin's poetry authentically, therefore, when we think its strange ness as singularity rather than as exception. Heidegger writes, "Everyday things get worn out, dulled, used up, and emptied. [Yet] Hölderlin's poetry grows from year to year more inexhaustible, greater, stranger—never to be catalogued in a finally validated sense" (G, 23). Reading Hölderlin thus</page><page sequence="6">144 ARTHUR A. GRUGAN requires scrupulous confrontation, essential struggle, sustained polemic— precisely against ourselves, against our thinking itself.20 "It can be," Heideg ger writes, "that then one day we will have to move out of our everydayness and move into the power of poetry, that we will never again thus return into everydayness, as we have abandoned it" (G, 22). Thinking's polemic against itself reflects the polemic that inheres in and as Being itself (G, 243-44) and is therefore not of a subjectivistic nature. For, quoting Hölderlin, Heidegger writes, "The strife is a 'loving strife' of the things themselves."21 Accordingly, as we read Germanien, our self confrontation should not be understood as "an inquisitive soul-dissecting self-gaping" or as "a contrite 'moral' rebuke"; neither solipsism nor self correction, self-polemic flourishes, and must flourish, as we make our "la boring passage through the poem" (G, 23): But only in such wise as the poet himself becomes master and slave of the poetry, through a battle—only thus do we attain the space of the poetry beyond the present-at-hand poem. The battle for the poetry in the poem is the war against ourselves insofar as we, in the everydayness of our Dasein, are expelled from the poetry, set blind, lame, and deaf on the strand, and neither see nor hear nor feel the rolling waves of the sea. (G, 22) We must more and more relinquish the attitude of an arbitrary and unprepared reading of poems, for "the claim and the power of poetry are disclosed ever more strangely" (G, 59). Heidegger writes, "We must over come the poem as a mere present-at-hand reading selection. The poem must be transformed and get revealed as poetry" (G, 19). For our part, we must enter into that transformation—and "leave behind ourselves many wonted and allegedly evident matters" (A, 1), "abandon the tracks of everyday conjecturing,"22 disrupt our customary attachments and intelligences, and leap from them, as if through a flame, to essential thinking.23 "Perhaps first of all the customary must in general be shattered, so that we can obtain a first glance for the overflowing," Heidegger writes.24 Thus will we becomes genuine listeners to the word of poetry. Everydayness is shored up by its own tenacious unwillingness to take thinking and poetry essentially; while it values the banausic and worries over the failure of diesel engines, the collapse of bridges, the breaks in a dam, it does not trouble itself at all about mistakes in reading, thinking, and interpreting, because the planetary man of today simply does not have any time left over for essential words, Heidegger says, even though essential words pertain to the supreme characterization of his essence (A, 26, 11). Such attitudes are directly connected to the quotidian view that regards art as mere illusion, as marginal, as opposed to the hard realities of politics or medicine or business, for example. Specifically, everydayness rejects poetry as a decadent indulgence and a fluttering into the unreal, a mere flight into</page><page sequence="7">HEIDEGGER: PREPARING TO READ HÖLD ERLIN'S "GERMANIEN" 145 ivory towers.25 Or it deprecates poetry as a mere decoration that ac companies our Dasein, a temporary enthusiasm, or indeed only a mere excitement and amusement.26 It measures the significance of poetry's power against nonpoetic realities that, for their part, powerfully determine our Dasein and precisely contradict what poetry has to offer. It regards a poem as "flimsy, without resistance, ethereal, marginal, and nondurable," as a kind of thing that "does not belong anywhere anymore," and it falsely assumes that the "charming and pleasing leather-bound and gilt-edged volumes" of poetry collections are "the space for poetry" (G, 20). Since the authentic power-realm of poetry is elsewhere than in the present-at-hand and every day, however, our attitudes towards poetry must be essentially metamor phosed: Indeed, it reflects an accustomed, everyday attitude towards a poem when we, say, in a dry and empty hour resort to it as a fleeting spiritual emergency measure (Nothilfe) and then put it away again; or when we take to poems like something present-at-hand, and analyze and explain them, while others are occupying themselves with medieval papal documents, and others with the Code of Civil Law, and again others with guinea-pigs and earthworms. (G, 19) Yet perhaps it does not matter much to the poem that we no longer experience any power in it; but it well might matter to us that we have forfeited the power-for-experience, that our Dasein is entangled in an everydayness by which it remains excluded from that power-realm of art. (G, 20) Scholarship Additional obstacles impede our way into Germanien's power-realm, and these impediments have been established by a long tradition of literary criticism that stands entrenched in metaphysics. Readers of Hölderlin's poetry, therefore, must unlearn many misconceptions about poetry that literary criticism has generated; readers must learn to liberate the poetry from the unessence of poetry it moves into when traditional poetics functions as the measure for what poetry is. Wanting to gain entry into the immediacy and simplicity of Germanien's poetry, Heidegger distinguishes his own reading of Hölderlin from a scholar's reading (I, 38-39); he writes, "Neither a hurried acumen nor a blindly overladen scholarship, nor the artificial effervescence of imagined ur-feelings, nor the inflated modes of speech will help, but only that bright earnestness that stands firm in the face of the greatness of the task for a long time to come" (G, 8). Therefore, speaking of the need for a "preliminary way of drawing near to the poem as a present-at hand reading selection" (G, 14), Heidegger deeply questions certain essen tial issues of scholarship. Significant scholarly interpretations turn on the distinction between an</page><page sequence="8">146 ARTHUR A. GRUGAN art-work's form and its content. Concretely, scholarship clearly distinguishes Hölderlin's novel, translations, commentaries, essays, play, correspondence, and poems; it classifies his poetry into odes, elegies, and hymns; it correctly scans some of his poems as observing Alcaic metre, Aesculapian metre, or blank verse. Yet Heidegger's thinking, telescoped on That which overpowers (iüberdichtet) the poet, calling the poet to indite poems in the first place (A, 6-7), does not grant any essential significance to this issue of form versus content. For that distinction does not penetrate to the issue of the poetry, but, in fact, conceals certain metaphysical, aesthetic problematics concerning style as such (I, 28-29) and metre.27 If we give these poems the traditional designations "elegy" (song of mourning) and "hymn" (song of praise), then we may do so only if we know the essence of the sadness that here sings sorrowing songs, and when we know the essence of the holy which is called in these poems . . . What the poems of Hölderlin are in truth, however, we do not know down to this hour, despite the names "elegy" and "hymn."28 Perhaps the poem [Andenken] is neither "lyrical" nor "hymnal." Perhaps we should put all these characterizations aside so that they do not in advance draw our glance and our inner ear away onto wrong ways. For no doubt we would again catch ourselves talking "about" the poem, instead of having its word speak to us. (A, 24) Furthermore, Heidegger argues that the scholarly concern with content embodies definite metaphysical prejudices. In particular, Heidegger asks about the relationship between a poem's content and its poetry, which literary criticism frequently simply identifies. A poem's content is what the poem is about, the thoughts the poem contains; it can be stated and reported just as the content of a scientific treatise or a factual report can be formulated in propositional form. Specifically, the content of Germanien can be reported just as readily as its form can be described; "no special difficulties" would confront the reader who chose to do either of those two things (G, 15). Additionally, Heidegger asks whether knowledge of content can sufficiently illuminate the meaning of the transitions between the stanzas of a poem, where nothing is said in the usual sense of making statements, or the particularly rich beginnings and endings of so many of Hölderlin's verses, stanzas, and whole poems (A, 29). Does not authentic reading consist in involving ourselves, gathering ourselves, in exactly what is not said?29 How is one to understand the relationship betweeen the poem and its poetry, if the form-content distinction—a distinction that is thoroughly Greek and that therefore belongs only to the Greek Dasein as something eminently questionable—resembles an absolute, transcendent determination that is "worn out, and of no real use to anyone" (G, 15)? What kind of poem must Germanien be, since it imitates none of the metres one finds in traditional</page><page sequence="9">HEIDEGGER: PREPARING TO READ HÖLDERLIN'S "GERMANIEN" 147 poetry genres and possesses no rhyme at all, and since it gives such impor tant utterance to "utterly sober conjunctions," like "denn"? Does not the logical, grammatical "denn" pull Germanien away from poetry and towards prose?30 Does the form-content distinction mirror the metaphysical distinc tion between soul and body (A, 34), inner and outer (A, 37), spirit and matter (A, 55)? Scholarship teaches that a poem's content is conveyed through its images, and the main content of Germanien is presented by means of the images of the eagle, the dreamy young girl, and the man. Yet how far do readers get, Heidegger asks, as they approach Germanien's power-realm when they have even a thorough knowledge of its images and thus its content? Does reading Hölderlin mean understanding his poetry as if his essential utterances amount to little more than the enunciation of a "literary theme" (I, 38)? Is there anything more to the gods than their being "peacefully themes of scholarly preoccupation" (G, 50)? What is the relationship between a poem's table of contents and its poetry?31 Because traditional poetics teaches that content gets conveyed through images, therefore, we must ask about the nature of the image. Heidegger writes, "It is indeed a tried and true technique of poets to depict the authentically real by images of the unreal that are as sensuous (sinnliche) as possible. This mode of presentation is therefore in need of special attention and 'research'" (G, 16). Heidegger examines two images Hölderlin uses for language—"Die Blume des Mundes," from Germanien, and "Worte, wie Blumen," from Brot und Wein—and argues, "We would remain hanging in metaphysics were we given to regard as a metaphor this naming of Hölderlin's in the phrase 'Words, like flowers.'"32 And Heidegger says that Hölderlin's way of naming is essentially different from the way scholarship and metaphysics have for centuries been naming things (I, 38). How, then, should we understand Hölderlin's naming when that naming is freighted with images and in particular with metaphors? Two points are decisive here: First, images and metaphors—language—contain certain metaphysical judgments that were first enunciated by Plato and that have been normative ever since; second, the metaphysical tradition is decidedly incapable of interpreting Hölderlin precisely because of Hölderlin's independence from metaphysical judgments about art and language (I, 57-58). Everyone who is in any way familiar with the essence of poetic saying, Heidegger says, knows that The language of poets is always the language of images. And, yet, that does not suffice to understand Hölderlin's poetry. Indeed, [that view], as illuminating as it might be, is capable of leading our interpretation astray before we have even begun (G, 114) Language is penetrated by metaphysical conceits, and poetry incarnates that metaphysics perhaps nowhere more radically than in its understanding</page><page sequence="10">148 ARTHUR A. GRUGAN of images and metaphors. Metaphysics determines how art transforms historical man's Being-in-the-world by shaping his understanding of the essence of art, and Heidegger attributes the origin of this metaphysics to Plato's distinction of reality into two realms: The nonsensory, metasensory realm, inhabited by intellectually perceptible, constant, amaranthine reali ties; the sensory realm, inhabited by sensorily perceptible, fugacious, not truly-real entities. The relationship between the entities that inhabit these two realms constitutes the metaphysical core of the problem of metaphors. Although the sensory entity makes the essence perceptible, the sensory entity shows and points to the essence—only as something radically re stricted, disfigured. Thus, the sensory is, Heidegger says, "Platonically thought, a 'copy'—in every case only a restricting one—of the true reality, of the essence of an object (Sache), of that wherein its authentic truth and its 'sense' ('Sinn') consists, that is, what is graspable with the understanding and the reason (intellectus)—the intelligible (mundus intelligibilis). The sensory is the sense-image (Sinn-Bild) and the metasensory is the 'proto-image' ('Vor Bilcf)" (I, 27). The decisive point here is that in all uses of images the Platonic distinction is presupposed as something essentially accomplished, its original articula tion and subsequent development establishing norms for occidental meta physics down to Nietzsche. Furthermore, involved in this fundamental distinction is the value-judgment that the nonsensory, spiritual realm is the true reality, while the sensory realm is judged to be a mere pre-level or sub-grade (Vor- und Unterstufe) of reality.33 Heidegger says, "The distinction of the sensory (αίσθηόν) and the nonsensory (νοηίόν) is the basic distinction of what from time immemorial is called metaphysics" (I, 18). According to Heidegger, therefore, images—allegories, parables, symbols, exempla (Beispiele), emblems (Ab-zeichen), poetic analogies, and metaphors— bespeak the basic metaphysical distinction, because, according to the tradi tion, "all art is imaginary" (I, 19); significantly, that tradition has given "the metaphysically imaginary essence of art ... a special roie" to play in poetic art (I, 29). In poetry, such images present not only themselves, but a nonsensory meaning. They "mean" something. The sensory image points towards a "spiritual" import, a "sense" (I, 17). In this context, Heidegger's reflections on the metaphor, perhaps the most decisive image, are essential, because the metaphor seems to actuate meta physics most radically. "Metaphor"34 derives from μεταφορά, and precisely means a carrying over or beyond from the visible to the invisible, from the audible to the inaudible, thus holding open metaphysics's fundamental distinction. Metaphors are, accordingly, so entangled in the determinative</page><page sequence="11">HEIDEGGER: PREPARING TO READ HÖLDERLINS "GERMANIEN" 149 underweft of metaphysics that "There is the metaphoric only within metaphysics."35 Hölderlin's poetry, consequently, is not metaphysical pre cisely because it is neither imaginary nor metaphorical. In one of his most important preparatory reflections about our reading of Hölderlin's poetry, Heidegger writes: We should now merely note the fact that the master key of all 'poetics'— the teaching of the 'image' in poetry, of the 'metaphor'—opens not a single door in the realm of Hölderlin's hymnal poetry and never brings us into the Free. (A, 40) What, then, becomes of Germanien's readers when virtually no aspect of Hölderlin's poetry can be interpreted with basic categories of traditional scholarship? Does this not, in fact, argue for the urgency of transforming our essence and our relationship to the essence of language? How do we learn to think nonmetaphysically? Who are we? How do we gain access to Germanien's power-realm, to poetry as word? Let us take our point of departure here from Merleau-Ponty's meditation on fundamental thinking, because entrance into the poetry of Germanien is entrance into a region of fundamental thinking; in Signs,36 Merleau-Ponty writes: [Thinking is] "fundamental" because it is not borne by anything, but not fundamental as if with it one reached a foundation upon which one ought to base oneself and stay. As a matter of principle, fundamental thought is bottomless. It is, if you wish, an abyss. Germanien propels its readers into precisely such fundamental thinking, because, Heidegger says, the way into Hölderlin's poetry is a thinking (A, 16), and thinking requires leaps. As a leap out of and away from everyday ness and metaphysics, thinking jumps, bolts, into the unfamiliar, finding no supports, directives, guide-ropes; thinking leaps into an abyss (G, 105-07), into Being itself, and, thus, into language, since language is the "clearing concealing advent of Being itself."37 Authentic thinking hovers over ground that is in radical withdrawal, "brittle," "does not support," and gives no assistance by means of bridges, handrails, or ladders of explanation; it hovers, specifically, in the Free, the clearing, the open which is Being itself.38 To use Saliis's terminology, this leap of thinking is a "slippage into the open,"39 "into another realm and into another mode of saying."40 Thus Heidegger speaks of the abyssmal essence of Being41 and of "falling into the heights,"42 heights whose "depths" can be plumbed only after a thoughtful engagement with Hölderlin's words: "Wer das Tiefste gedacht, liebt das Lebendig ste." Through the essential saying of its opening words, Germanien snatches us away, precipitating our leap of thinking, and abruptly shattering our every day attitudes and metaphysical assumptions. For language, like thinking,</page><page sequence="12">150 ARTHUR A. GRUGAN ruptures, dislocates, wrests free. Concretely, Germanien's opening words sweep readers away into the vortex of its poetry, and that vortex—attendant by radical confusion43—suffuses the entire poem: The poem is language. But who is now really speaking in the poem? The author, the I, we, the man, the eagle. They are speaking of language, which should name (speak), and in naming yet should leave it unspoken. (G, 45) Everything is revolving, so that "no one knows what is happening to him." The poem is no longer a flat text, equipped with an equally level "mean ing." Rather, this linguistic construct is in itself a vortex, which drags us to some place or other. (G, 45) The being snatched away, the original rapture, "commences with the start of the poem harshly and suddenly . . . and ends in a mysteriously peaceful way"; it flings the reader into the complex spiraling speaking of the poem, into a conversation that brings language unto language, and leaves the readers to ask: "What kind of speaking is it, who is speaking, to whom, with whom, and about what?" (G, 45). Germanien's starting words transport its readers into radical dislocation, into essential eccentricity (I, 32), a key Hölderlinian concept.44 Because Hölderlin stands independent of metaphysi cal thinking, the beginning rapture, or throw, does not issue from the cogito of the reader but from the words of the poem; man is originally thrown by Being itself into the truth of Being, by language into language, into precisely what remains concealed to metaphysics45—into a reversal of essence, from man as master and originator of calls to man as follower and response. Germanien's poetry demands essential engagement in the poem's swirling displacing vorticity. From the condition of aesthetic placidity, of a detached subject beholding an object—perhaps a bored or complacent spectator seeking to pass some idle time enjoying a poem—the reader finds himself catapulted into something like a gyrating free fall, since the leap of thinking hangs in the aether,46 another key Hölderlinian concept. Thus, our entire customary and philosophical attitude towards poems and poetry, and so towards the essence of language, must be disrupted, and we must renew this transformation as we begin to read each new verse and stanza, because . . . each verse in the vortex of the poetry is revolving at a different place of the vortex. More precisely: Since the vortex is not in front [of us], in itself, every stanza in this change, in this revolution, creates the vortex for the first time, and its different places, if one can generally speak of "places" [or passages in a text] in a vortex (G, 47; our interpolation). Yet, significantly, Germanien confronts us with problems exactly at the start of our efforts to enter into its vortex. How do we start with the words that start the poem, particularly since those words—"Nicht sie, die Seeligen"— appear to speak right past us, to be at essential cross purposes with our</page><page sequence="13">HEIDEGGER: PREPARING TO READ HÖLDERLIN'S "GERMANIEN" 151 contemporary concerns, and, therefore, to be irrelevant to a people whose scientific and technological preoccupations have long since dispensed with the gods of antiquity? It would seem that the renunciation which those words pronounce falls on deaf ears, for today's standards do not trouble themselves about the kind of negation that those words utter, and they do not bother— for what could be more otiose—to think through the meaning of the "not," the avoidance, rejection, denial in precisely the word that starts a poem that speaks about a time period that has long since vanished, and that was composed, Heidegger says with some acerbity, by a madman, the poem Germanien being "a sign of his lack of peace, of that instability which, as is well known, is characteristic of a nervously overwrought man" (G, 48). Heidegger says that modern man believes that Hölderlin's renunciation of the gods comes too late and remains without import. "We do not first have to shake off something we are no longer burdened with," he writes (G, 48). We are left to wonder how the enrapturing displacement into the poem's vortex is to evenuatc, if the opening lines mean nothing to us, if indeed the entire poem remains "lifeless" to us ( G, 48). Furthermore, if Germanien's starting negation is, in fact, so emphatically irrelevant to contemporary man, "With what right," Heidegger asks, "do we make ourselves the standard of what the poem has to say?" (G, 48). A host of essential questions emerges, and we, Germanien's readers, are dragged along into the eddying formulation of those questions, because we are asking about ourselves. Neither quotidian standpoints nor logical norms suffice to ask such questions, for, in the words of "Was ist Metaphysik?", we are required to enter into "the vortex of a more original questioning."47 We will not grasp the vortex of the conversation, if we only gape at it instead of entering into its movement. But how do we do that? Now, the first thing will be that we begin to go at all, that we step forth out of our placid situation (.geruhsamen Lage) of the observer. This situation must be shocked so that our reading can indeed no longer maintain the placidity (Ruhelage) of a uniform reading off of a text. (G, 46) Everything is revolving. Our epicenter has shifted. Dislodged from the everyday, we stand in radical eccentricity. We are in nature, the Chaos,48 Germanien's power-realm. Our abandoning our everydayness, our polemic for authenticity, has to do with that change in our essence which Heidegger has argued Hölderlin's poetry demands: A transformation that runs so deep that it involves our entire mode of thinking and experiencing that concerns the totality of Being (I, 205). In turn, that transformation directly has to do with a genuine revolution, a genuine turning around, in our dealings with lan guage. In a text that Richardson highlights and that Sallis repeatedly interprets, Heidegger says:49 . . . That is to say, [Being-as-Utterance] plays in such a way with our</page><page sequence="14">152 ARTHUR A. GRUGAN process of language that it gladly lets our language wander astray in the more obvious meanings of words. It is as if man had difficulty in dwelling authentically in language. It is as if the danger to which man most easily succumbs is that of everydayness. Language Heidegger writes, "Everything depends on our learning how to dwell within the speaking of language."50 The Germanien lectures contribute significantly to preparing that later insight, for those lectures argue that we must reverse precisely our entire comportment to Germanien—as poem, poetry, language— if we are to enter into its power-realm, where the vortex swirls: All the time, we have our way there with the poem. But, on the contrary, poetry should reign over us, . . . that our Dasein might become the life support for the power of poetry. (G, 19) Our relation to language, to unessential words (Wörter) and to the word, has long been confused, undetermined, groundless. Language is like a present-at-hand thing; ... In a historical moment metaphysically so deter mined, we must learn something about our relationship or lack of relation ship to language and to the word. (A, 34, 35) Specifically, to understand Hölderlin's "characteristically gathered multi plicity" of language (A, 10), we must detach ourselves from the "most superficial view of the essence of language,"51 from the view that language is essentially something that man manipulates, that it is expression, an instru ment for communication and information, whose communicative purposes are best served by univocity and accuracy, by propositional logic, and by truncations and compressions of language into abbreviations, pictographs, and extreme technologizations (A, 10-11, 14). Regarded essentially as an instrument the understanding uses to communicate with, to express its thoughts with, language purports to grant man word-meanings "straight forwardly and conclusively," thereby illuminating "the transparent essence of a thing (Sache), like a theme that is ready to be used."52 Indeed, Heidegger was thinking this issue through already in Sein und Zeit's analysis of discus sion, showing the derivative nature of communication and questioning, at least implicitly, the view of language that nourishes it.53 Yet it is precisely this interpretation of language and its underlying assumption that man is the master of language that must be turned around; we must reverse "the inversion of the true relationship of domination between language and man,"54 Heidegger writes. The more powerfully poetry comes to power, the more pressing and enrapturing the saying of the word reigns. Then, though, the poem is no longer the present-at-hand readable and audible thing, as it was at first when we still regarded language as a means of expression and under standing which we, so to say, have, as the automobile has its horn.—We</page><page sequence="15">HEIDEGGER: PREPARING TO READ HOLDERLIN'S "GERMANIEN" 153 do not have language; rather, language has us, in the plain and simple sense. (G, 23) Through this reversal alone can we be put into the way of genuine reading, into the first condition of all hearing: "The still passion for the unsaid" (A, 38-39). For reading does not seek to dominate words, but requires that our accustomed relationship to words be radically "disturbed." The reversal, thus, effects powerful disturbances, notwithstanding the fact that "we our selves no longer take into account that for centuries our relation to the 'word' has already been completely disturbed by undisciplined scribbling, ground less Gerede, and indiscriminate cramming (Gelese)," (A, 38) and that "the references of the word to man and of the essence of man to the word were [long ago] disturbed" (A, 30). Language has man. It is an essentially different mode of Being-in-the world to dwell within language, where the thinker's and the poet's authen ticity consists primarily in exposure and response, than to dwell as language's master. Our holdfasts in logical univocity and conceptual accuracy— means necessary for communication—must be somehow uprooted as pri mary; we must undergo the leap into the open and acclimate ourselves to its brittle ground. Within the open, we approach essential beginnings, because within this Free, this cleared of the self-clearing, we have always already gone beyond our everydayness and begun to approach the poem as essential word, as the radical multiplicity of sense, as what is "fundamentally different from the usual understanding of assertions and statements of linguistic communication and presentation" (A, 16). Thus, reflections on the open go together with reflections on the beginning, reflections that get actuated radically by poetry; in particular, Germanien's, starting words are the address from language that draws us into the open, into the speaking of language. In the vortex, we notice that Germanien's words do not admit of usual interpretations; its word-meanings are not spelled out; its word-references are not identified. Indeed, Heidegger writes that Hölderlin's leaving so many essential points unsaid, his not saying exactly what it is we should be participating in or binding ourselves to, is essential poetry's way of saying "that this is a necessary condition for the fact that it is becoming the time when 'the divine touches' us, when the lightning strikes" (G, 58). Reversing the customary relation between man and language, readers enhance their abilities to cross the threshold from the poem as a present-at hand word-thing to the poem as word; crossing the threshold, we enter into the region of language where we discover that we do not have the poem before us as a written, read, and discussed vocalization, but that the word, from out of itself, assumes us up into the space of its truth (A, 37). It must, therefore, be made clear what language is, and in what sense we, had by language, reside in it as poet and thinker. To that end, Heidegger reads five intricately</page><page sequence="16">154 ARTHUR A. GRUGAN connected passages from Hölderlin that, according to Heidegger, deal with language and poetry, the examination of each text showing with deepening awareness how removed from everyday conceptions of language Hölderlin's thinking is. This preliminary reflection on language is necessary, Heidegger says, because Hölderlin's poetry—which claims to prosecute such powerful events as the establishment of Being—collides with the tenacious everyday convic tion that poetry, being mere words, is impotent; measured against what is commonly taken to be effective and real, poetry is not empowered to effect what Hölderlin claims it can and must effect (G, 74). For how can "a linguistic construct, a mere conversation," negotiate originary work, and how can what is "only language and essentially necessarily only language" compete with the unquestionable might of those direct and concrete realities that, in totally different ways, really do toss us around; or with those real events in our lives that, in totally different ways, drag us into our Dasein; or with that immediate action that brings us collisions with entities totally different from the kinds of collisions that the mere recitation and utterances of some poetry purport to bring us (G, 59)? The first step onto this way of questioning focusses on Hölderlin's "strange determination" (G, 60) that language is man's most dangerous good. Hölderlin's strange statement, Heidegger says, is about man himself, be cause it states that language was given to man so that he—creating, destroy ing, perishing, and eventually returning to his primordial mother, the earth—might testify to the legacy he has inherited and the genuine under standing he has learned from the earth. According to Heidegger, Hölderlin's reflection does not treat man as if he were just one entity living and moving about on the earth but as "the meaning of the earth" (G, 61), as that entity who testifies to his belongingness to the earth and who is "the heir and the learner in all things."55 Of course, [what is meant is] man not in the imbecilic idolization of an unrestrained being who, with his so-called advances, becomes the fool, but man as the witness of Being, exposed into the midst of the most extreme conflicts and existing essentially (wesend) in the embrace of the simplest inwardness. (G, 61) Man is the witness of Being, because he is empowered to witness, as neither animals nor plants are, by language. Yet within language man's Dasein also runs its greatest risk, is thrown open to its greatest danger, "for it is within language that man ventures forth the farthest," that he ventures indeed at all "out into Being" (G, 62), into "the midst of Being itself' (G, 288). Within this venture into language, Dasein finds himself in the matrix of primordial conflict, of the going over, the withdrawal, of the essential into the nonessential. Venturing into language and Being, Dasein undergoes a move</page><page sequence="17">HEIDEGGER: PREPARING TO READ HÖLDERLIN'S "GERMANIEN" 155 ment towards what is originally oppositional and rent, yet primordially held in utmost unity (G, 273). An original possibility for Dasein, as the there for Being, is precisely to witness Being's ownmost conflict, to ex-sist as exposure to that conflict as well as to the grip of the simplest inwardness. On two separated ways, the following has resulted: Poetry is the basic jointure of historical Dasein. As conversation, language is the basic happening of historical Dasein. As original conversation, poetry is the origin of language, with which, as with his most dangerous thing, man ventures forth into Being as such, and either stands fast there or falls, and in the decline of Gerede either blooms or withers. (G, 76) Moreover, while language sees that "the original uncovering itself," "the revelation of the entity, takes place," it is also the case that language provides "even for that reason covering over and its ruling degeneration, the appearance (Schein)" (G, 62). Being is man's exclusive concern, language ushering him into that concern. Without language there would be neither manifestation and rending open of Being nor not-Being and essential nothingness. Al though no world would reign where there is no language, language also presents "the menace to Being as such through not-Being," language's most threatening danger consisting in the fact that "it first creates and holds open the possibility of the menace to Being at all": Because man is in language, he, therefore, creates this danger and brings the destruction that is lurking in it. As the most dangerous of man's goods, language is that which is most double-edged and equivocal (Zweischneidig ste und Zweideutigste). It places man in the zone of supreme achievement and holds him simultaneously in the realm of abyssmal decline. (G, 62) Second, Heidegger looks explicitly at the question of the essence and the unessence of language, the Verfall of language, its downfall, decay, declina tion, essential declivity into nonessential utterances. The point of departure for this reflection is a text wherein Hölderlin, translating Hesiod,56 asserts that the first-born, the first fruits, always belong to the gods, not to the mortals. "The fruit," Hölderlin says, "must first become more common, more quotidian; then it will be fit for mortals." Heidegger does not use anthropomorphic categories to interpret the first-born; rather, he takes them to be original utterances of language. What is essential to his concern with the question of Being is the distinction between the first fruits of language— the creative, establishing sayings of essential poets—and their inescapable declension toward commonplaces. Every kind of utterance—"the purest and most concealed as well as the commonest and most insipid" (G, 63)—can be seized by and encased in trite, platitudinous modes of talking. Since lan guage, double-edged and most equivocal, speaks in revelatory modes, it also inclines to modes of banality, hollowness, and vapidity.57 Language that originally grounds Being stands in the fate of necessary</page><page sequence="18">156 ARTHUR A. GRUGAN decline, of leveling out into worn-out Gerede, from which nothing is able to withdraw, even because it rouses the appearance that—in its kind of saying, if it is indeed (nur) a saying—it touches and grasps the entity. To say an essential word means, in itself, already to relinquish this word into the realm of misinterpretation, of misuse, and of deception, into the dangerousness of the most immediate contrary effects of its determination. (G, 63) Heidegger's reflections on the decline of language think through that movement within language between different essential dangers. The first danger is reminiscent of the fates of Semele and of Tantalus, neither of whom could tolerate their proximity to the gods. Language threatens annihilation, "the danger of supreme nearness to the gods." The second danger is "the danger of the shallowest aversion and entanglement in used-up Gerede and its appearance": The inner togetherness of these two conflicting dangers—of the danger of the essence that is difficult to endure and of the danger of the frivolous unessence—intensifies the dangerousness of language to the extreme. The dangerousness of language is its most original essential determination. Its purest essence is unfolded originallly in poetry. It is the ur-language of a people. (G, 64) In an uncommonly important statement, Heidegger writes, "7o be sure, the unessence of language can never be eliminated" (G, 64; our italics). Nevertheless, although language necessarily drifts towards its own unessence, that unes sence can be endured "in its necessary dominance," and it can be com prehended "as danger and opposition, as thrust towards the constantly new preservation of the essence against the unessence" (G, 64). Yet to think that thought, we must transform our understanding of what language is, and unlearn the view that language is primarily man's tool for expressing an inwardness, for communicating, Cartesian-like, logically clear and distinct ideas. Third, corresponding to the drifting of language from essential sayings to unessential ones are fundamentally different deportments of Dasein that require a language appropriate to themselves, since language constitutes these different deportments precisely as being different. In the light of two statements from Hölderlin's critical notes on his translation of Sophocles's Oedipus Tyrannus,58 Heidegger argues that Hölderlin's "violent conditions" in the midst of which great-souled men like Oedipus stand are not "arbitrary circumstances" that a man might casually stumble into; on the contrary, they are "unique, unalterable ground possibilities within which man stands towards the entity in the whole, within which his destiny (Geschick) is unfolded" (G, 66). Evocative of the storm of Being, these violent conditions give us to think</page><page sequence="19">HEIDEGGER: PREPARING TO READ HOLDERLIN'S "GERMANIEN" 157 that language is something other than man's means for expressing or formulating or communicating to the public the nature of his context, his living conditions; indeed, language is precisely "what bears and supports and guides the essential discussion with the violent forces (dem gewaltsam Gewaltigen)" (G, 66). Heidegger again indicates how utterly remote Hölderlin's reflections are from our ordinary characterization of language: It has itself this character of Being, which it discloses and conveys to man. In language as such, happens the setting-apart-from-one-another of Being and of not-Being, the rising-up-against-one-another of the powers and the holding fast and the lying defeated in this conflict, but also the deteriora tion into the indifference of our knowing it all and our ability to do it all. (G, 66) Fourth, within language, something primordially oppositional happens, setting Being over against not-Being, the original against the derivative, disclosure against nondisclosure. Heidegger argues that Hölderlin, in his critical notes to his translation of Sophocles's Antigone, had precisely the insight of viewing language "almost in the counter direction to that determi nation according to which [language] seizes into the word the lightning flashes of the gods" (G, 66). For it is within language that man can turn himself exactly against the gods, protect himself from them, thus refusing to submit himself while in God's presence and^by so doing, not to destroy this basic relation to the entity. While prayers and hymnal poetry, for example, are essentially language turned towards God, the "bold, frequently blas phemous word" is language turned counter to God; both sayings of lan guage, hymns and blasphemy drift into and out of one another as do essence and counteressence. Ingredient in language is its own falsification and vulgarization. Heidegger's argument unfolds certain consequences for poetry interpreta tions that are inherent in his view that language is something that in a sense transcends man's many human possessions and capabilities, something that "in one or another way directs and determines his Dasein from the ground up" (G, 67). Since poetry is the primordial language of a people, and since the purest essence of language speaks when language poetizes, it is poetry that founds the most basic constitution of historical Dasein. Accordingly, to comprehend poetry in fundamental ways, we must abandon the expression view of language. Heidegger writes, "Language is not the mere external announcement of an inner poetic experience, the packaging, let us say, that is used to forward [word-goods, word-meanings] to other people"; rather, "poetry itself is only the exceptional happening in the event of language, in whose power man as an historical entity stands" (G, 67). Consequently, the poetic presents itself as fundamentally constitutive of historical Dasein, because language as language</page><page sequence="20">158 ARTHUR A. GRUGAN . . . constitutes the original essence of the historical Being of man. We cannot first determine the essence of the Being of man and then over and above and afterwards still assign language to him as a gift; rather, the original essence of his Being is language itself. (G, 67) Thus do we understand Dasein's struggling with his essential tendency to fallenness as reflective of the original drift of language towards nonessence. Heidegger writes, "Only where language is, is world there, that is, the constantly self-altering circuit of decision and work, of deed and responsibil ity, but also of capriciousness and noise, decay and confusion."59 Fifth, Heidegger says that the Being of man is to be understood as conversation. Yet when so many everyday meanings are proving inadequate, how are we to understand this argument about who we are? Heidegger quotes Hölderlin: Much has man experienced. Many of the heavenly ones named, Since we are a conversation And can listen to one another. Heidegger says that while language constitutes man's Being and that while man is a conversation, we would nevertheless be mistaken were we to hear Hölderlin's statement as if it were a proposition providing a definition to a question. Hölderlin's statement is not "a polished answer to the question 'Who are we?'"; asking this question, we must be ever mindful that we have "at once entered the realm of the supreme dangerousness of language" (G, 68). Heiddeger cautions us to read Hölderlin in a poetic context, and not to overlook any essential word, especially the word "Since." Heidegger does not interpret this "since" causally, but temporally, to mean "since the time when . . ." Consequently, if what Hölderlin says of man is a definition at all, it is neither a grammatical nor a logical one but a historical one with essential references to time. Hölderlin's poetry speaks of historical, temporal decisions that Dasein can enter into or not; his poetry necessitates our asking about ourselves: What does it mean to say that "we are a temporally determined, historically instituting conversation?" (G, 69). Let us attempt to answer in two points the question about the meaning of man's being a conversation. The first point focuses on the addressors and the addressees in the conversation; the former, the gods, address the latter, men, placing them under their claim, bringing them unto language by granting them the possibility of asking about their relationship to the gods and to their own Being. Our Being happens, accordingly, as conversation insofar as we, so addressed, speaking, bring to language the entity as such an entity, and disclose the entity in what and how it is, but also simultaneously cover</page><page sequence="21">HEIDEGGER: PREPARING TO READ HOLDERLIN'S "GERMANIEN" 159 over and occlude. Only where language happens are Being and not-Being disclosed. We ourselves are this disclosing and disguising. (G, 70) The second point concerns the possibility that we are a conversation even when the gods do not address us, when clues to their presence are precisely lacking. In this context, Heidegger argues that we, being a conversation, are "simultaneously and equally primordially" a fundamental silence (G, 70). Furthermore, because man's Being takes place in talk about entities and nonentities, "we become slaves of the prattle about things," that is, we become a Gerede (G, 70-71). The declination from essential to unessential saying is, as we have seen, inexorable, for Gerede is "the unessence that necessarily belongs to the essence of the conversation" (G, 71). Finally, Heidegger says that talking, listening, and being silent are, finally, "essen tially one" (G, 71). Poetry At this point, let us ask about poetry. In questions that complement the "reversal" argument in the Nachwort zu: "Was ist MetaphysikΡ"50 Heidegger asks: Yet how and whence and when is the poetic? Is it a creature of poets or are the poets and the poetic determined by poetry? But what is the essence of poetry? Who determines this? (I, 171) Heidegger writes, "One might almost want to say: Poetry and the poet is the single concern {Sorge) of his poetizing. Hölderlin is, therefore, the poet of the poet" (G, 30). How are we to understand Hölderlin's preoccupation with the poet and with poetry, in a way with himself? Is that single-mindedness "the symptom of a narcissism gone astray and at the same time the admis sion of one's lack of [participation in] the world's fullness"61; or is it rather "that this poet poetically thinks out into the ground and into the midst of Being from an abundance of drive"?62 Poets who place poetry into poetic question, Heidegger says, do not thereby indulge in "empty, fruitless, and uncreative analysis" of themselves, but, as is preeminently the case with Hölderlin, pursue "the extreme opposite" to self-absorption (G, 30). The etymology and the history of the word "dichten," although not very helpful in determining poetry's essence, do provide certain clues in the original signification of the Old High German lithdn, and the Latin dicere, words connected to δείκνυμι, meaning to show, to make something visible, to render it revealed, precisely in the way of its own indicating, pointing, referring. In Hölderlin's case, however, an everyday sense of hinting will fail to convey the poet's understanding of hints, because poetic hinting does not involve the pointing to something else beyond itself, as if to some autono mous signified: "the gods hint simply, in that they are," Heidegger writes (G, 32). This fundamental sense of poetry, however, conflicts with other represen</page><page sequence="22">160 ARTHUR A. GRUGAN tations of poetry, perhaps ones that significantly influence our very attempts to distinguish the poem from the poetry. Authentic poetry is covered over by unessential definitions. Specifically, poetry has been defined as imitation; as a linguistic construct with predominantly affective powers; as the issue of some initial, perhaps divine, inspiration. Yet the view of poetry that Heideg ger addresses the most defines poetry as expression, the outward appearance of some inner experience, and this view has enjoyed prestigious support in the tradition. For example:63 Poetry, in a general sense, may be defined to be "the expression of the Imagination": and poetry is connate with the origin of man. (Percy Bysshe Shelley) Poetry and eloquence are both alike the expression or utterance of feeling. . . . Poetry is feeling, confessing itself to itself in moments of solitude, and embodying itself in symbols, which are the nearest possible representations of the feeling in the exact shape in which it exists in the poet's mind. (John Stuart Mill) Poetry is the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge; it is the impassioned expression which is in the countenance of all Science. . . . the Poet is chiefly distinguished from other men by a greater promptness to think and feel without immediate external excitement, and a greater power in expressing such thoughts and feelings as are produced in him in that manner. . . . Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity: . . . (William Wordsworth) The common aim of all the arts is the unfolding and elucidation of the Idea expressing itself at each grade. . . . Thus poetry objectifies the Idea of man, an Idea which has the peculiarity of expressing itself in highly individual characters. (Arthur Schopenhauer) ... we may say that poetry is metrical and euphuistic discourse, express ing thought which is both sensuous and ideal. (George Santayana) In sharp contrast to that expression-view of poetry, Heidegger writes: Poetry is establishment, effective grounding of what remains. The poet is the grounder of Being . . . Poetry—expresssion of the soul's experiences? How remote all this is! Poetry—enduring the hints of the gods—establish ment of Being. (G, 33) What does the expression-view of poetry entail? The poet builds something up in himself, imagines something, which he has somehow experienced or lived through in either the outer or the inner world. From raw material yielded by those worlds, the imagination constructs an experience, which it then works on further, consolidating it into figurative, imaginary presen tation—poetizing it. Solidified, given shape, by the imagination, the poetry gets written down, and appears in the form of a poem. Poetry, therefore, is represented as "the soul's process of producing poems," (G, 28) "the</page><page sequence="23">HEIDEGGER: PREPARING TO READ HOLDERLIN'S "GERMANIEN" 161 expression of experiences, from which experience-expression the poem is then the written-down outcome," (G, 26) "the expressed appearance of the soul, experience" (G, 27). In Heidegger's view, however, essential poetry does not start from within, with a subject concerned with itself and its own inventions, and it does not understand itself as the externalization of an inwardness. Indeed, Heidegger writes that if we question the essence of an art-work and its relation to the event of the truth of entities, it "becomes questionable whether the essence of poetry, and that says simultaneously of the project, can adequately be thought from the perspective of the imagination and of the power-to-form images (Imagination und Einbildungskraft) ."64 Essential poets are not holed up in the ego,65 working over the experiences of their souls (G, 30); on the contrary, they ex-sist, outside, whereunto poetry has always already called them. The poet, writes Heidegger, "is he who has been thrown out-out into the between, between the gods and man."66 The poet is, consequently, radically communitarian, deeply penetrated by language, essentially defined as conversation. "Without protection, delivered up, and given away by himself" (G, 30), the poet—the Pindaric poet that Hölderlin is, bareheaded out of reverence for the divine—endures the violent conditions of nature's turbulent weather "without evasion" (G, 31). The poet is a demi-urge, a public servant, an intermediary; to poetize is to stand fast within the between and to establish Being: Dasein is nothing other than the exposure into the supreme power {Ubermacht) of Being. When Hölderlin speaks of the "soul of the poet," that does not mean some kind of wandering about within the experiences of his own soul, not a context of experience somewhere or other within, but the extreme outside of the naked exposure to the storms. (G, 30-31) Heidegger's concern is with essential poetry only, that is, with poetry that poetizes beginnings and illuminates origins and discloses mysteries. Essen tial poetry is original language, able to reveal a world and found a people's history, and essential poets are rare. Yet poetry, like all language, must also conceal beginnings, roil mysteries, forget Being. Language disguises Being, and dangerously disguises the disguise, for the unessence of language can never be entirely eliminated, the dangerousness of language being its own most determination. An everyday semblance of innocence and insipidity accrues to poetry as essentially as does its grave thoughtfulness, its being a "terrible vocation" (G, 35). Poetry—it is both: that semblance and this Being. That everyday sem blance belongs to it as the valley belongs to the mountain. Hölderlin's Dasein has endured this most extreme opposition of appearance and of Being in its widest tension—held it apart, and, that means, held it together with the greatest inwardness. (G, 35)</page><page sequence="24">162 ARTHUR A. GRUGAN Although there is no relationship quite so distinctive as the relationship between poetry and poems, poetry is in decline when it appears primarily as poems, and when essential words (Worte) degenerate into uncontextual ones (Wörter) (A, 33-34), an issue that Sein und Zeit's analysis of language had already made problematic.67 "Like every activity in which human powers and talents take part, poetizing, too, of course, now has its degenerations and deviations," Heidegger writes (A, 7). Poetry drifts inescapably away from original utterance into reports, definitions, logical assertions, and the first fruits of essential saying incline toward decay. Heidegger says that insofar as we, both beginning and ending history, are a conversation, we exist "as the most violent word, as poetry, as silence—as Gerede" (G, 71). Thus does the opening word of Der Ister, the call of Being to the poet, collapse forthwith into banality (I, 7); from a proximity to the gods, speech declines bathetically towards superficiality. Thus: Directly in the same way and on the same level as we talk with our neighbor even, so do we also say and hear the poem. And yet this saying is in the end and fundamentally an entirely different one. (G, 41) Heidegger says that Hölderlin is so difficult to listen to because he, more than any other poet, has achieved decisive distance from the ego (I, 203-04). That is what constitutes Hölderlin's "historical uniqueness,"68 his ability to remain bound to his calling, in his own company, in supreme isolation.69 Hölderlin and the essence of his poetry, Heidegger says, is "one of a kind," precisely because Hölderlin, in the midst of his poetry, is set out of every comparability.70 For, as the word of hymnal poetry, this word is unique in a unique sense even again. This word is like the lonely mountain range of a matched need (einer gewachsenen Not) which first opens another space of truth around itself. In this poetry, nothing is ornamentation, and there is no empty place [no vacuous passages]. (A, 38; our interpolation) It remains to learn how to scale the peaks of that mountain range, how to inhale the aethereal intelligibility on its heights. The Cartesian method will not help here, nor will dialectic; neither the planning and calculating of metaphysical man nor the interpretive categories of traditional poetics will avail. We must transform our essence and renounce the will to master language and nature, and become "like the shepherd who knows nothing but the stony path and the spring, the meadows and the clouds, the sun and the thunder storms" (G, 53). We must learn research, not in the sense of the mathematical and experimental sciences of nature, but in Hölderlin's unique sense, which thinks "in advance of all science" (G, 76). Reflecting on Spinoza, whom the theologians of the time classified among the atheists, Hölderlin wrote about research:71</page><page sequence="25">HEIDEGGER: PREPARING TO READ HOLDERLIN'S "GERMANIEN" 163 Das größte Verdienst des Forschers ist, Daseyn zu enthüllen, und zu offenbaren. Erklärung ist ihm Mittel, Weg zum Ziele, nächster—niemals lezter Zwek. Sein lezter Zwek ist, was sich nicht erklären läßt: das Unauflösliche, Unmittelbare, Einfache. Germanien still waits for readers, its starting words in harsh displacing readiness. The poem points to the poetry, as starts point to beginnings. The vortex spins out unfamiliar spaces wherein eccentrics alone are essentially oriented. The vortex tosses Dasein about, his relationship to words undergo ing radical disruption. The poet repudiates having power over words. Flourishing in the eye of violent conditions, essential poetry discloses. Essential poets sing singular words. Language speaks. Language striates Being, concealing and revealing, occluding and clearing. The abyss yawns, the ground withdrawing and poetic Dasein entering into that withdrawal. In the Chaos, the poet thinks. Immeasurably far from any subjectivity that would instill order into this "sacred wilderness" (G, 83-84), the poet either blooms or withers. Being calls as language speaks. "The poetizing word names Such that comes over the poet and transfers him into a belongingness which he did not create, which he himself can only follow," Heidegger says (A, 7). Authentic poets, like authentic thinkers, are answers. Song and thinking respond, are echoes of the bounty of Being. Dem folgt deutscher Gesang.™ NOTES 1. This paper draws heavily on three of Heidegger's texts: Hölderlins Hymne "Andenken" (Frankfurt am Main: Klostermann, 1982); Hölderlins Hymnen "Germanien" und "Der Rhein" (Frankfurt am Main: Klostermann, 1980); Hölderlins Hymne "Der Ister" (Frankfurt am Main: Klostermann, 1984). In the body of the paper, we refer to these books respectively as A, G, and I, followed by page numbers. 2. Grundfragen der Philosophie (Frankfurt am Main: Klostermann, 1984), 136.

In our judgment, Dallmayr misunderstands this point. He says on page 92 that he finds disconcerting the excessive emphasis on conflict and agon, but he nowhere mentions Heidegger's treatment of Heraclitus, under whose power Hölderlin's entire poetic project and understanding of Being stands (G, 128), whose thinking of πόλεμος (Kampf, Krieg) and ζρμονία (Innigkeit) transfuses Hölderlin's poetry and makes clear that the conflict and the harmony belong primarily to the things themselves—"the strife (Streit) of the great conflict (Widerstreit) between the essential powers of Being" (G, 125). Also, while "agon" means contest, such as the numerous musical contests held in antiquity or the various athletic events like the Isthmian, Nemean, Olympic, or Pythian games, it also refers to the Dionysia, the dramatic competitions held at Athens in honor of Dionysos. And it carries the meaning in Greek tragedy and comedy of a prolonged, often formal debate or exchange between the chorus, the actors, and the audience. In our view, since Heidegger reads Hölderlin in essential connection with both Pindar and Sophocles on the one hand and with Dionysos on the other hand, we should not ignore these meanings of agon, as we interpret the agonistic essence of Heidegger's thinking. For "agon," consult A Handbook to Literature, 4th ed., ed. C. Hugh Holman (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1980), and Frederick Adam Wright, "Agones," in Oxford Classical Dictionary, 2nd ed., ed. Ν. G. L. Hammond and Η. H. Scullard (Oxford: Clarendon, 1977). Finally, conflict emerges as an essential issue within the context of Heidegger's asking about Germanien's ground mood of sorrow or mourning (Trauer) and the meaning of the</page><page sequence="27">HEIDEGGER: PREPARING TO READ HÖLDERLIN'S "GERMANIEN" 165 pott's essential call, voiced in line 3 of Germanien. Heidegger says, "The calling is the settling of a conflict between the self-opening of preparedness and the remaining-out of fulfillment. The bearing up under (Ertragen) such a conflict is pain, a suffering·, thus, the calling is a lamenting. . . . The pain and the suffering is, at all, only by virtue of the endurance of the conflict" (G, 81, 82). Thus, it seems to us that reflection on the meaning of conflict requires, additionally, reflection on the essence of poetic calling and the complicated structure of the poem's ground mood.

Also cf. my translation "The Staiger-Heidegger Correspondence," Man and World, 14 (1981), 303. Cf. G, 16 further. By questioning critical categories as he does, Heidegger confronts the possible objection that his commentaries become arbitrary. His reading, however, never takes irresponsible flight from the "text." Indeed, he cautions his audience that they will not derive much understanding from his lectures if they have not first read the poems themselves (A, 17). He says that no kind of magic can relieve us of the burden of carefully attending to the immediate word (A, 30), and that we must concede that we are not able merely to jump over and ignore the factual and the episodic (Vorfindliche) elements in the poem (A, 22). Unterwegs zur Sprache, 205-07. Cf. Nietzsche: I, 166: "For nihilism, that is, Platonism posits the metasensory as the entity having truth, from which [perspective] every other entity is depreciated and slandered as the entity that authentically is not, and is regarded as nugatory." And I, 29: "Even where the Platonic 'devaluation' of the sensory is not accomplished, Platonism still is, metaphysics is." This difficult issue is addressed by Jacques Derrida, Margins of Philosophy, trans. Alan Bass (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1982), 209-29. In the thinking of this question, especially given Derrida's numismatic terminology, cf. Grundbegriffe, 61, where Heidegger writes that Being is "the most worn-out coin,. .
