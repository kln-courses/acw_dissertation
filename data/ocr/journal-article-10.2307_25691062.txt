<plain_text><page sequence="1">Siva and Indo-European Ideology: One Line of Thought Nicholas J. Allen When an Indianist colleague recently asked me what I could say about the Indo European background to Indian deities, I thought back over a twenty-year-old interest in the subject and noticed that my published comments on Siva have been particularly dispersed. This paper attempts to consolidate some of them and to push the same line of thought a bit further. The whole approach has been based on the work of Georges Dumezil. Thus, (a) it is diachronic or genetic, in that it looks for the cultural concomitants of the historical common origin of the Indo-European languages and their subsequent spread and diversification, (b) It focuses on ideology and, more precisely, on the notion of a partitional ideology?one divided into a small number of contrasting domains, (c) It recognizes that some features of Indo-European and Indo-Iranian tradition (the "para-Vedic" ones) bypass the Vedas and appear first in Classical Sanskrit texts, (d) It is structural in the sense that it examines entities less in themselves than in their relations to other entities. Thus we shall be less interested in Siva's intrinsic attributes than in his location within an ideology and his relations to other gods in particular contexts. I also follow Dumezil in recognizing frankly one consequence of the scale and complexity of the comparative undertaking, namely, that any single formulation is unlikely to prove either exhaustive or definitive. Given his importance in the Hindu pantheon, Siva naturally turns up in numerous different contexts, and each new analysis may cast unforeseen light on previous ones.1 My approach departs from Dumezil's in three main ways. First, Dumezil envis aged the Mahabharata as being composed in India by the transposition into epic form of bits and pieces of Vedic or para-Vedic mythology. I agree with several others, such as Christophe Vielle (1996), in thinking that, as a more or less unified epic cycle, the Mahabharata had a long prehistory outside the subcontinent before it was brought there by Indo-Aryan speakers. Second, where Dumezil rather seldom drew on comparisons between the Mahabharata and Greek epic, I have emphasized them (though for reasons of space I do not do so here). Third, to put it crudely and simplistically, where Dumezil envisages the Indo-European ideology as triadic, I International Journal of Hindu Studies 11,2 (2007): 191-207 ? 2007 Springer DOI 10.1007/sl 1407-007-9045-5</page><page sequence="2">192 / Nicholas J. Allen envisage it as pentadic. More precisely, although Dumezil only talks of three domains or "functions," he often bisects his first function into Varuna and Mitra aspects, so that in effect he operates with a fourfold schema. Conversely, although I talk of a pentadic ideology, I prefer to avoid proposing five functions and instead envisage a fourth function bisected into positive and negative aspects or "half functions."2 So the triadic and pentadic schemata contrast less sharply than may appear at first sight. The two schemata can be related most concisely in terms of social roles. While Dumezil's first, second, and third functions relate respectively to sovereign-plus priest, warrior, and producer, the pentadic schema dissolves that awkward fusion within the first function. The fourth function is defined as covering what is other, outside, or beyond relative to the three "classical" functions, and its positive aspect covers sovereigns, kings, founders, and creators, while its negative aspect covers enemies, slaves, demons, and other devalued outsiders. In other words, the larger schema departs from the smaller only by pruning the definition of the first function; otherwise it subsumes it, thereby making it potentially applicable to a wider range of phenomena. At the same time the reality of the larger schema becomes potentially more demonstrable, in that pentads conforming to the definitions of the functions are less likely to arise by chance than are triads. A deity as important as Siva is of course difficult to characterize briefly, but if one had to choose a single-word description, certainly for the early period, one could do worse than "outsider." The term has often been used. "From Rudra, Siva inherits the awesomeness and even malevolence of character which made him feared, as well as the exclusion from orthodox sacrifice which marked his outsider status" (Brockington 1981: 70). "That certain circles continued to regard him [Siva] as an outsider standing apart from the other gods may appear from the popular story of Daksa's sacrifice" (Gonda 1970: 13). In the earliest mythology of Rudra-Siva "the dark outsider is already beginning to be included in the Vedic ritual" (O'Flaherty 1975: 116). In the context of the epic the multivalent polarity of Visnu and Siva can be expressed by the opposition "Pervader" versus "Outsider" (Hiltebeitel 1976: 356). It is no surprise then that Rudra cannot be accommodated within the trifunctional structure (Dumezil 1971: 82, 108). On the other hand, he would fit well within the fourth function. I deliberately use the conditional since in general an entity should only be allocated to a function if it is coordinate with other entities that can be allocated to the other functions. As an outsider among the gods, Siva is eligible for interpretation as representing the fourth function, but to see whether the possibility is realized we must look at specific contexts. Pandavas and Kauravas Reduced to a single sentence, the Mahdbhdrata narrates the conflict between the Pandavas?Goodies and Winners?and the Kauravas?Baddies and Losers. However, the human agents incarnate supernaturals, and from this point of view the</page><page sequence="3">Siva and Indo-European Ideology I 193 Great War belongs in the endless list of conflicts between Sanskritic gods and demons. Dumezil comments valuably both on the conflict and on individual members of both sides, but his trifunctional schema, though it works reasonably well for the Pandavas and the gods who father them or are incarnated in them, cannot accommodate the Kauravas. This is clearly unsatisfactory. From a commonsensical point of view one might expect any ideology to have some place for the enemies of cosmic order, and more pertinently, there has to be something wrong with an account of Vedic and Hindu tradition which glosses over the god-demon opposition. The problem was sensed by F. B. J. Kuiper (1961), but he offered no solution to it. The pentadic theory raises two issues. If we start with the Panda va brothers, Dumezil's arguments work well for the elder pair (Yudhisthira son of Dharma, and Bhima son of Vayu) and for the younger pair (the twin sons of the Asvins). They are plausible representatives of the first, second, and third functions respectively. However, Arjuna, the central brother in the sequence of births, fits only awkwardly in the second function. As son of Indra, king of the gods, he fits at least as well under the positive or valued fourth function. Second, if we move to the Kauravas, we now have a slot available to accommodate them, but to maximize comparability with the Pandavas we should focus, not on the whole set of one hundred brothers, but on the eldest among them, the central figure of Duryodhana. Father's brother's son to the Pandavas ("cousin-brother," as the relationship is sometimes called), he is their enemy par excellence. From the Pandava viewpoint he is both an outsider and devalued, so he fits excellently under the fourth function negative. One asks next with which supernaturals the Kauravas are linked. While the younger brothers all incarnate raksasa demons, for Duryodhana the text gives two answers. The list of partial incarnations says that he was born from a portion of Kali (1.61.80);3 but during his nocturnal visit to the underworld (3.240.5-8) he learns from the demons the truth about his own divinity. The demons claim to have obtained him from Siva by their austerities; moreover, if his upper body was made from diamonds and is thus invulnerable to weapons, his lower body was made by Devi (Siva's consort) from flowers and is therefore seductive to females. His body is thus imbued with both deities. The Saivite associations of both answers are clear. As is well known, the eras are named after the throws of dice and the age of kali, the last and worst of them, is named after the lowest valued throw, which has but a single dot. Siva spends much of his time dicing and is often identified with Kala ("Time"). Moreover, "Kali is plain destruction" (Hopkins 1915: 76), and Siva is god of destruction. Again, although Siva sometimes fights demons, by virtue of a paradox that is typical of him, he is sometimes accompanied by them. Finally, the male-female divide in Duryodhana's body echoes that of Siva Ardhanarisvara, the lord who is half female (13.134.9), even though in images of the god the division is into right and left rather than up and down. In summary then, though Duryodhana's relationship with Siva is less straight forward than, for instance, Yudhisthira's with Dharma, it is undeniable.4 But if the</page><page sequence="4">194 / Nicholas J. Allen Pandavas with their associated deities represent the superior levels of the ideological hierarchy and the Kaurava prince represents fourth function negative, then by analogy the prince's associated deity should represent the same domain. In Arjuna's case, as we saw, a discrepancy exists between his relatively junior position in the birth order and his exalted position in the sequence of functions, and Duryodhana presents a sort of mirror image of this. He was born on the same day as his archenemy and killer Bhlma (1.114.14), and since the Pandavas were born at yearly intervals this makes him one year younger than Yudhisthira. But when the latter was born, Gandhari, Duryodhana's mother, had already been pregnant for two years (1.107.9, 114.1, 115.21, 213.79). She now aborts, and the prince spends a third year of foetal life, as it were, in vitro (in fact, in a pot). Thus if age is measured from conception, Duryodhana is at least a year older than any of the Pandavas.5 This accords with the birth order of their respective fathers since Dhrtarastra is older than Pandu, and also with the textual order?Duryodhana's birth is described before the Pandavas'. Among supernaturals the demons are usually the elder brothers of the gods (for example, 12.34.13), and we see that, similarly, Siva's seniority need not correlate with his position in functional lists. The Five Indras (1.189.1-40) The gods are holding a sacrifice beside the Ganges. Yama, god of Death, is participating, and since his normal activity is in abeyance, human population explodes. Anxious about their status, the gods consult Prajapati, who reassures them: in due course mortals will resume dying, and in large numbers. Seeing a golden lotus floating down the river, Indra leaves the ritual and, going upstream, finds that it originated from the tear of a female [the goddess Sri]. She takes him to Siva, who is playing dice with Parvati on a Himalayan peak. Indra accosts him arrogantly, but is humbled by Siva, who confines him in a cave with four other Indras from past eras. Begging to be released, Indra is told that he and the others will be born as human warriors?to return to Indra's heaven only when they die. "Our" Indra then volunteers to beget or become Arjuna, the fifth in the group. Siva ordains that Sri become their wife, i.e., Draupadi. Siva and his quintet visit Narayana [Visnu], who ratifies the decisions and arranges the incarnation of Balarama and Krsna. As Jacques Scheuer notes in passing (1982: 105n47), this is clearly a version of the better known myth of the "Overpopulated Earth" (narrated 1.58.1-59.7 and else where). But I ignore this topic, and others no less rich, to concentrate on the relation between the Indras and Siva. As in the previous section, we have at first sight a structure consisting of Pandava pentad plus individual?there Duryodhana with his Saivite associations, here Siva himself. Looked at more closely, however, the members of the pentad are not homogeneous. Among the Pandavas Arjuna stood apart, as transcendent, and here it is our Indra, the father of Arjuna, who stands apart,</page><page sequence="5">Siva and Indo-European Ideology I 195 being the main protagonist. Thus the structure is not so much 5+1 as 1+4+1. But even this formula is unsatisfying since the Asvins and their mortal counterparts, the Pandava twins, can be regarded as a single unit (born at the same time, they tend to act together), so that one can write 1+3+1. This in turn represents the structure of the pentadic ideology, with its three core functions (the third often represented by twins) and its two outsider half-functions. The difficult question here is the relation between the two half-functions, repre sented respectively by our Indra and Siva. One expects the king of the gods to be in some sense positive or valued and the "dark" or "malevolent" god to be the opposite, but here it is Indra who is humbled and Siva who dominates. Should one then talk of "reversal," as if in this episode Indra comes to represent the negative aspect of the fourth function and Siva the positive? This would be facile and unhelpful, for despite first impressions Siva remains closely linked with negativity. For instance, he is not there when other gods, such as Indra, are busy with a sacrifice, and although his absence (not explained in the text) may theoretically be voluntary and reflect his status as renouncer, nevertheless, from an orthodox or Vedic point of view it implies devaluation. Again, assuming that Sri is weeping for the imprisonment of her former husbands (Hiltebeitel 1976: 179), Siva has been afflicting a goddess who corre sponds to Prthivi in the "Over-populated Earth" and who is closely associated with sovereignty. Simultaneously he has been imprisoning successive Indras, each a king of the gods, with a view to punishing them by a temporary mission to earth, where they will aid the work of Yama and participate in massacring or sacrificing vast numbers of mortals. Such deeds may be necessary for the functioning of the cosmos, but they are hardly positive or valued?neither from the point of view of the luckless mortals, nor from that of the gods. It makes sense, then, that some Indian families regard the Mahabharata, in contrast to the Rdmdyana, as an inauspicious text unsuitable for reading in the house (Fitzgerald 1991: 156nl2). In other words, although he is here more powerful than Indra, Siva can still be analyzed as representing the fourth function negative. Belonging under this half function does not necessarily mean being weaker than representatives of the other half-function (any temptation to think it does may derive from excessive reliance on the varna schema). It is worth comparing power with age. As we saw, Duryodhana and Karna come last in the functional series but first in age, and similarly Siva is clearly older than our Indra and at least as old as the first of his prisoners. He is sometimes said to be the first born of all creatures (7.173.81). The normal assump tion is that seniority correlates with power, so Siva ought to be more powerful than Indra. The Five Husbands The Five Indras was narrated by Vyasa to Drupada to explain and justify Draupadi's polyandrous marriage, but a single explanation is apparently not enough and Vyasa continues immediately into the story I call the "Five Husbands" (1.189.41-49). The</page><page sequence="6">196 / Nicholas J. Allen sage had previously told the same story to the Pandavas (1.157.6-14): "A maiden who lacks a husband performs tapas to Siva and repeatedly prays to him to remedy her situation. As she has repeated her prayer five times, Siva decrees that, despite her protests, she shall have five husbands. In a later life she is reborn as Draupadi." Since the structure of this little tale looks triadic?maiden, Siva, the five undiffer entiated husbands (-Pandavas), one might try to analyze it as a 1+5+1 story. Arjuna would be regarded, here, as second-functional, and one would try allotting the god and maiden each to one half-function. However, such an analysis seems to me implausible?too remote from that of the "Five Indras," which Vyasa has just told. Instead, despite being unnamed, Arjuna should be retained as representing the fourth function positive while god and maiden together occupy the negative slot. This is not inappropriate since in two different ways the maiden is linked to earth. First, in the "Five Indras," her equivalent is Sri, who corresponds to Prthivi (Earth) in the "Overpopulated Earth"; and second, when bom as Draupadi, she will emerge from the middle of a Vedic altar, that is from earth (1.155.41). In the context of the elements, it is earth that represents fourth function negative. Moreover, when she emerges she has a strong smell (of blue lotuses), and in Samkhya philosophy smell is the subtle element corresponding to earth. The Kaurava Marshals Throughout the conflict the Kauravas have Duryodhana as their central leader or supremo, but during the war itself they have five successive marshals. This sequence is a good example of the common phenomenon whereby one level of ideological structure is involuted within another?one pentad within one element of a larger pentad. As the marshals have been treated several times elsewhere (see Appendix), I present them in tabular form (Table 1). Marshal Supernatural Tenure Function Basis of Argument Bhisma Dyaus 10 days F4+ hero and god Drona Brhaspati 5 days Fl hero and god Kama Surya 2 days (F2) position in sequence Salya Samhrada 1/2 day F3 hero Asvatthaman Siva... one night F4- hero and god Table 1. The Kaurava Marshals Column 2: the supernatural being incarnated in the marshal. Column 3: duration of marshalship. Column 5: main grounds on which each marshal is allocated to a (half-) function; thus both Drona and Brhaspati represent the first function for independent reasons, whereas in the case of Salya the asura Samhrada can at best only be tenuously linked with the third function. Only two entries in the Table demand comment. Qua Kaurava, as we saw, Kama</page><page sequence="7">Siva and Indo-European Ideology I 197 is to be associated with fourth function negative, but qua marshal, his central position in the pentadic sequence strongly suggests second function. His situation is thus analogous to that of Arjuna, who for many reasons has to be associated with the fourth function positive, but whose central position in the birth order strongly suggests second function. Both are of course outstanding warriors, and their duel in the middle one out of the five war books is in some ways the centrepiece of the whole conflict. As for Asvatthaman (1.61.66-67), he was born from portions not only of Siva (Mahadeva) but also of Antaka (Death), Kama (Lust) and Krodha (Anger); or simply from Rudra (15.39.15). Moreover, his Saivite nature is reinforced at the start of his marshalship as he prepares to massacre the sleeping Pandava army. Threatened by a monstrous apparition, Asvatthaman prays to Siva and offers himself into a sacrificial fire. Siva manifests himself, gives the hero a sword, and enters or possesses his body. The fourfold list in Book 1 is well recognized to echo the process of fusion that led to the birth of Vedic Rudra. The gods wanted someone to punish Prajapati for committing incest with his daughter, so they created Rudra by bringing together their most fearsome forms (for example, O'Flaherty 1975: 29, from Aitareya Brahmana 3.33-34). But the list is also interesting in that, complemented by Asvatthaman himself, it forms a pentad that could be functional: the god of gods, the core triad (Antaka, Krodha and Kama possibly representing Fl,2,3, respectively) and the mortal they form or animate. The functional interpretation of Antaka, normally equated with Yama, is not obvious, but it may relate somehow to the puzzling fact that both first-functional Yudhisthira and Yama are sometimes called Dharmaraja.6 But I do not press the idea. The Five Marshals provides perhaps the strongest single argument for allocating Siva to the fourth function negative. The Night Attackers When the fifth marshal launches his attack on the Pandavas (Book 10), the Kaurava army has been reduced to three soldiers, namely Asvatthaman himself, Krpa and Krtavarman. Can anything be made of this triad? Let us first look for agents who might frame or surround the triad. The story of the fifth marshalship in fact begins at the end of the previous book. Mortally wounded by Bhlma, Duryodhana lies on the ground, writhing in agony, but when the triad approach he is able to converse with Asvatthaman and ratify the attempt at revenge. He orders Krpa to perform the ritual installation of the marshal (9.64). After the massacre the triad return to the stricken prince. Hearing Asvatthaman's report of mission accomplished, Duryodhana congratulates his marshal and dies happy (10.9). The prince is clearly part of the story, and on both occasions he is repeatedly addressed as 'king," so we have a reasonable candidate for the positive half-function. At the other end of the scale, the triad are not accompanied by any humans, but</page><page sequence="8">198 / Nicholas J. Allen this does not mean that they are alone. Having entered the body of Asvatthaman, Siva himself is hardly relevant, but the marshal has prayed to him as the lord of myriad troops of spirits, and when he attempts self-immolation these troops appear (10.7.4b, 8a, 15). The description of their appearance and activities is prolix and fantastic. Whether theriomorphic or anthropomorphic, these bizarre but beloved emanations of Siva (42) wield an assortment of fearsome weapons; they are noisy cannibals with supernatural powers. Their aim is to glorify Asvatthaman and enjoy the massacre (47-48), so they accompany the marshal as he approaches the camp (66). Together with their wives and children, they gorge themselves on human flesh and blood (126-35). Although the victims believe that they are being attacked by demons (116, 119), the text itself ascribes all the killing to the triad. Nevertheless the demons are part of the picture and fit well under the negative half-function.7 Between the dying king and the demonic subhuman horde comes the warrior triad, so we meet again the familiar 1-3-1 pattern. Within the triad the leader presents no problem: Asvatthaman is a Brahmana (as is recalled implicitly in 10.9.36-37). Krtavarman (incarnation of a Marut) is a Ksatriya, so two of the core functions are represented by members of appropriate varnas. However, Krpa (incarnation of a Rudra) is also a Brahmana, and I can see no good way of interpreting him as third functional. Probably this is one of those cases (not uncommon), where the pentadic ideology is expressed only incompletely. I abstain from speculating on why this is so. The Weapon Givers My next case is somewhat similar: the 1-3-1 pattern is clear and the fourth function is satisfactorily represented, but one item within the triad does not accord with the pentadic schema. During the Pandavas' twelve-year exile (Book 3) a set of individual journeys are made, each conducted or led by one or other hero. The first of these (3.38-45) is Arjuna's five-year-long visit to Indra in heaven, and it is balanced by the last (3.240), Duryodhana's overnight visit to the underworld (see above, "Pandavas and Kauravas"). These essentially solo journeys are carried out by heroes who in other contexts represent the positive and negative half-functions. Between them come three other journeys, the first a pilgrimage (3.91-145) led by first-functional Yudhisthira. The other two (146-53 and 157-59), rather similar to each other, raise difficult issues, and I ignore the set here because despite the Saivite atmosphere of Duryodhana's journey, Siva himself is not mentioned. Siva intervenes prominently, however, in Arjuna's journey, for which aid and instructions are provided by Vyasa. To obtain weapons, the hero is to go to Indra and Rudra (3.37.28ab) and to Varuna, Kubera and Dharmaraja, that is, Yama (28cd); or to Indra and Rudra (30a) and the Lokapalas (30b). Both slokas group together gods we have earlier linked with the half-functions, distinguishing them from a triad (28) or a quartet (30; the Lokapalas of course guard the four cardinal points). The</page><page sequence="9">Siva and Indo-European Ideology I 199 numerical discrepancy is resolved when Arjuna actually meets the gods in question. After receiving weapons from Siva in the Himalayas, he is in fact visited by four Lokapalas (a common list, consisting of Kubera, Yama, Varuna and Indra), but only the first three give weapons at this point; Indra promises to do so later, in heaven, as indeed he does. But there may be more to it. As E. Washburn Hopkins (1915: 150) notes, the title of the quartet is curious. The worlds (lokas) are normally envisaged as a triad arranged vertically, while the cardinal points, being four and arranged hori zontally, should be guarded by Disampalas. Hopkins hypothesizes that "originally there were three real world-protectors." In any case, what the text gives us is five weapon-givers, Rudra (3.41), the triad (3.42, cf. 3.164), and Indra (3.45.4). Within the triad Kubera, god of wealth, normally represents the third function and Varuna, at least in Vedic times, the first; but I doubt whether a convincing case can be made for Yama representing the second; perhaps he has replaced a second function deity. The order of listing of the relevant gods is variable and only in 3.164.13-14 does it even approximate to the rising hierarchy that would fit best in a structure opening with Siva and culminating in Indra. Daksa's Sacrifice The myth of Daksa's sacrifice is known in many versions and has a considerable secondary literature. Of the half-dozen versions in the Mahdbhdrata let us summa rize the one that is most convenient for our purposes (10.18). It is narrated by Krsna in response to Yudhisthira's question of how Asvatthaman was able single-handed to carry out the nocturnal massacre. That this particular text fails to mention Daksa is insignificant. The gods organise a sacrifice but in their ignorance they fail to invite Siva. Siva wants his portion of the offering, creates a large and effective bow and goes to the sacrificial site. Portentous signs occur, including earthquakes. Siva shoots the sacrifice, which flees in the form of a deer. Amid the confusion, using the end of his bow, Siva breaks the arms of Savitr, blinds Bhaga and knocks out the teeth of Pusan. Siva laughs and halts the fleeing gods. They and the sacrifice beg for mercy. Siva casts his anger into the sea, restores the three gods he has mutilated, and receives his share of the offerings. Other versions of the myth (for example, Kramrisch 1981: 322-30) fill out the plot by mentioning additional participants. Daksa, son or grandson of Brahma and "a kind of secondary creator" (Johnson 1998: 129), is usually named, and sometimes (as in 12.274) Siva's reaction is ascribed to the urging of Uma, mortified at her husband's exclusion. But such additional figures leave the basic structure unaffected. The story is of an outsider god disrupting the sacrifice of the other gods in order to be included among its beneficiaries. But the other gods are not undifferentiated: the one who stands apart is Daksa, the demiurge. It is sometimes he in person who</page><page sequence="10">200 / Nicholas J. Allen refuses Siva (12.330.42). Such a structure recalls the Five Indras. There too the gods in general perform a ritual from which Siva is absent, and their leader ends up humiliated by the absentee. One difference is that while the fifth Indra, like his predecessors, traveled to encounter Siva, here it is Siva who travels to encounter Daksa. A more interesting difference concerns not the current leaders of the gods but the other gods humiliated by Siva. In the earlier analysis they were the four previous Indras, presented as essentially homogeneous. The homogeneity is qualified since, as well as belonging to different ages, they differ proleptically in that each will become one of the well differentiated Pandava brothers; but as we noted, following Dumezil, the four brothers represent the three functions, two of them together representing the third function. In the present case mortals are irrelevant, and we have a straightforward triad. So is it trifunctional? A preliminary point is that the triad of gods plus mutilations is well established in the Vedas. When Rudra shoots Prajapati to punish him for his incest, the damaged part of the latter's body becomes the focus of attention. Prajapati is identified with the sacrifice, and the problem is what to do with this dangerous part of the offering.8 According to the Satapatha Brahmana (1.7.4.1-8), it is taken successively to Bhaga, Pusan and eventually Savitr. In this Vedic text it mutilates only the first two, but Savitr's mutilation is described in other sources.9 Pusan is straightforward. A god associated with cattle and prosperity, he is often and convincingly interpreted as third-functional (for example, Dumezil 1969: 273-87). His mutilation relates to nourishment, one of the various facets of that function. Bhaga too is often prayed to for wealth, but Dumezil's emphasis is less on the wealth as such than on the god's role in distributing it or sharing it out; this role he performs from the position of "Minor sovereign" very closely allied to Mitra (for example, 1968: 149-51). After a lengthy discussion drawing on Roman as well as Indo-Iranian material, a table is presented (Dumezil 1977: 182) in which Bhaga is located under the first function (and Pusan under the third). As for Bhaga's mutila tion, Dumezil sees it as reflecting the blindness or inscrutability with which in other cultures deities like Fortune or Destiny distribute their gifts. Another interpretive approach might turn to Samkhya philosophy, which is permeated by the pentadic ideology. If fire is the first-functional gross element, the corresponding sense capacity (buddhindriya) is seeing (convenient tabulation in Larson 1979: 236). So the god and the mutilation both belong, for separate reasons, under the first function. One can now recall third-functional Pusan. The only gross element pertaining to nourishment is third-functional water, whose correlated sense capacity is tasting. Teeth are not used for tasting, but tongue and teeth both relate to nourishment; and the texts (for example, Satapatha Brahmana 1.7.4.7) often pass from Pusan's mutilation to his diet (since he cannot chew he receives not meat but liquid vegetarian preparations). So again the god and the mutilation belong to the same domain.</page><page sequence="11">Siva and Indo-European Ideology I 201 The hypothesis must now be that Savitr is second-functional. However, he is not allocated by Dumezil to any function, and he is not presented by the texts as particu larly strong or martial. On the other hand, in some contexts the standard definition of the second function is too narrow, and what is needed is a more general notion of force, of which bodily strength and warrior prowess are particular realizations. For instance, when it is argued that the gunas are trifunctional, it is not claimed that rajas falls under the standard definition but that it pertains to energy or dynamism. Now Savitr's name derives from the root sii-, a derivation that governs a good deal of word-play in the hymns; and this root has the sense of "stimulating, arousing, vivifying" (Macdonell 1898: 34). He is sometimes "the stimulator god" (Macdonell 1898: 34), and to stimulate is to rouse to action, to impart additional energy to (an activity or process). Dumezil himself sees that the god is a mover (moteur) and "dynamic" (1948: 194). As for Savitr's arms or hands, three points are worth noting. In the Rg Veda it is a characteristic gesture of the god that he raises aloft his arms (Macdonell 1898: 323), and in the Purusa Sukta (Rg Veda 10.90.12) the arms of the primal being are the origin of the second-function varna. Finally, we can again call on Samkhya. The sense capacity corresponding to second-functional air or wind is feeling (correlating with the action-capacity grasping and the subtle element touch), and the body part most obviously linked with touch is the hand. We must not oversimplify. Some versions of the myth give more or less than three mutilations and the sequence varies. But this does not detract from the trifunc tionality of the triad in Mahdbhdrata 10, and when the mutilations are repaired, the gods are for once listed in the standard order (Fl,2,3), as they are in Gopatha Brdhmana 2.1.2. The Horse Sacrifice Held in order to purify Yudhisthira from the guilt incurred in the Great War, the horse sacrifice is narrated at length in Book 14. For our purposes only two episodes are relevant. The first arises because a horse sacrifice needs to be held in style and is enormously expensive, while the royal treasuries have been emptied by the war. The Pandavas therefore travel to the Himalayas to collect wealth left there by a former king called Marutta. After looking at this episode, we can ignore the journey round India made by the horse and move directly to the final ritual. The Saivite atmosphere of the Himalayan trip is unmistakable (14.62-4; conven ient summary in Biardeau 2002, 2: 584-87). When the Pandavas are planning the trip, Bhima suggests that the first thing to do is propitiate Siva, and his suggestion is followed. Traveling from the center of the kingdom to a remote periphery ("the Outside"), they arrive at the right area at an auspicious moment, and Yudhisthira makes another offering to Siva (together with Kubera, lord of wealth, and other less important beings). Having worshiped Rudra and his host (and again, Kubera and others), they begin digging up and loading the valuables. Before returning to the</page><page sequence="12">202 / Nicholas J. Allen plains, they worship Siva one final time. This is clear enough, but Siva is also prominent in the story of Marutta and his rivalry with Indra (which is eventually resolved). The story is couched in dualistic terms. The two kings, divine and human, have as chaplains two brothers, Brhaspati and Samvarta, who are in turn linked with devas and asuras and with tejas and tapas. According to the Vulgate (14.6.22), Samvarta is a devotee of Siva, and he advises Marutta to go to the idyllic mountain that Siva shares with Kubera and gain the god's favor by reciting his names. As Madeleine Biardeau notes (2002, 2: 570n3, 593), the names Marutta and Samvarta associate their owners with the wind and fire that destroy the world at the end of a cosmic cycle; but such destruction is under the control of Siva. As for the horse sacrifice itself, although the lead-up is described at some length (notably the gathering of the guests), the ritual proper is disposed of quite briefly (14.90.19-91.5, followed by the paying off of the priests). The priests are said to assign each victim to a deity, but the recipient of the horse is not named. However, the Mahabharata insists that the ritual was performed correctly, that is in accordance with the Vedas, and the Brahmana texts say that the horse is for Prajapati (Satapatha Brahmana 13.1.2.9, 13.2.2.15). But the horse is not the only victim. There are twenty-one sacrificial stakes, and three hundred victims tied to them?animals including the horse and bulls, but also birds and fishes; it seems that each victim is publicly assigned to a particular god (Mahabharata 14.90.26-27, 32-34). The Brahmana texts confirm the inclusion in the ritual of "all" the other gods, who are to be individually named. Thus, to a first approximation, the sacrificial ritual in Book 14 has two phases. First comes the event oriented primarily to Siva (though secondarily to Kubera)?an event that is set apart in time and space. This preliminary event contrasts with the central ritual involving the gods in general. The same duality?Siva versus gods in general?has been a regular feature in our previous analyses, but no less regularly we have found that the "gods in general" also exhibit a dualism: one among them has some sort of transcendence, superiority or priority, which sets him apart from the others and justifies associating him with the superior half-function. Often this figure has been Indra, but as at Daksa's sacrifice (referred to in a simile at 14.90.30) we have here a creator figure rather than a king/warrior. Sacrifice One of Siva's best-known names is Pasupati, lord of beasts, and more particularly of sacrificial animals. The texts give various explanations, but the question arises whether the name in any way reflects the pentadic ideology. Here is a possible line of thought, focusing on the agents involved in the ritual. In principle, Sudras are excluded from Vedic sacrifice, but it seems that the other three varnas all have a role. Brahmanas of course officiate, and typically their employers are Ksatriyas, whether kings or warriors. But who supplies the offerings?</page><page sequence="13">Siva and Indo-European Ideology I 203 Animal victims must have been bred by herders and stockmen, and vegetable offerings must have been grown by farmers. Soma was supposedly acquired from merchants (Satapatha Brahmana 3.3.3). All these roles typically belong to the third varna. Via the varnas then, the humans involved can be linked with the core functions. However, it is not only humans that are involved. The ritual includes the gods, who are superior to humans, and the victims, animal or vegetable, who are inferior. No single figure could represent the gods better than their creator Prajapati, who in addition is so often identified with the sacrifice, that is, with the totality of the event; and Siva, lord of the victims, fits well enough at the other end of the scale. Summary Table 2 (Appendix) brings together the various contexts we have considered. The entries chosen to represent each context could sometimes be different. For instance, in the first row the humans could be replaced by the gods incarnated in them.

Hopefully, the limitations will be regarded as incentives to participate in developing this line of thought, creatively as well as critically. Other contexts, whether narrative or didactic, need attention. For instance the picture should surely draw in Jarasamdha and Sisupala, those figures with strongly Saivite overtones analyzed as complementary by Dumezil (1971: Part 1). But theoretical questions are no less attractive. We have noted in passing how the pentadic ideology is often applied at multiple levels, one level being involuted within another. Thus, in the context of the varna schema, the most prominent agents in the epic are second-function warriors, but in the context of the great conflict the Kaurava warriors represent fourth-function negative. Among the Kauravas, but more precisely among their marshals, the last, Asvatthaman, represents the same half function, but during the final marshalship, among the night attackers, the same individual, qua Brahmana, apparently represents the first function. We see here a</page><page sequence="14">204 / Nicholas J. Allen cascade of contexts of decreasing scope, but this cannot be the only way in which contexts interrelate. Another topic, touched on but not treated, is the relation of male and female within the fourth function negative?among deities, between Siva and Devi (Sri, Prthivi, Parvati...). The equally important topic of Siva's relation to Visnu has been deliber ately avoided. Yet another huge topic might start from the Vedic equation between Rudra and Agni or from Siva's relation to tapas (his "heat, austerity") or to his destructive eschatological fire (as opposed to the first-functional sacrificial fire). More generally, the god's association with "negativity" offers scope for reflection on philosophical issues, such as the opposition between pravrtti and nivrtti or between hyperactivity (dancing) and hypoactivity (trance). In linking Siva with the negative half-function, the paper has perhaps contributed towards reducing the disconcerting character of this unusual Indian deity, and it has tried to add further weight to the case for a fourth function, which is still regarded as unproven by a number of serious and learned comparativists. More specifically, it has shown that despite the "devaluation" that sometimes attaches to representatives of the negative half-function, they can sometimes be more powerful than represen tatives of the positive half-function. The key to such apparent paradoxes probably lies in seeing the functional schema not in terms of a linear hierarchy but in terms of a cycle?more precisely in terms of the largest temporal cycle that we regularly encounter. Prajapati is equated not only with sacrifice but also with the year, while Siva is equated with Time. Perhaps the ambivalent relation between the represen tatives of the two half-functions relates somehow to the ambivalence commonly associated with the passage from the Old Year to the New. Notes 1.1 use the name Siva to refer to the god whom the Vedas call Rudra and who in classical texts has a great variety of names (Mahadeva, Sankara, and so on). 2. I have discussed these issues in many previous papers, for example, Allen 2005d (where the reference to Allen 2006 should be corrected, see Allen 2007 here). To avoid irritatingly frequent use of my own name, references to these earlier papers have mostly been collected in Table 2 (Appendix). 3. Confirmed in 11.8.27 and 15.39.10 ("D. was Kali"). According to 18.5.19 all the sons of Dhrtarastra were demons (ydtudhdndh). 4. Though the details are complex, this claim receives some further support from the story of his breastplate (7.69.35-71, Scheuer 1982: 272-74). This piece of armor, originally Siva's, had a succession of owners before being worn by Duryodhana. A fuller study could also draw on the role of dicing and Kali in the misfortunes of Nala. 5. Similarly, as a Kaurava champion, Karna, Duryodhana's friend and ally, occupies the same lowly half-function as the prince, but he is actually the eldest among the Pandava half-brothers. The son of Surya, he is only linked to Siva</page><page sequence="15">Siva and Indo-European Ideology I 205 indirectly, via the notion of heat and tapas. 6. The pairing of Anger and Lust within a triad recalls the pairing of hatred and passion (dvesa and rdga) in the trifunctional set of Buddhist "fires." 7. One might recall the masses of deformed beings excluded from Yima's vara and analyzed under this same half-function. 8. Or (O'Flaherty 1975: 117) what to do with the dangerous fiery seed emitted by Prajapati on being shot. 9. Mentioned for instance by Dumezil (1948: 193-99, translation 164-69?later amended, see 1969: 284).

Papers by myself, relating to different sections of the paper A closely related to the line of thought compares Siva with other Indo-European deities. The comparison with Greece has been the most popular, and a number of my articles cited in Table 2 (notably 1997) present Siva-Poseidon rapprochements, but that does not rule out other possibilities. Rudra-Apollo is favored by Thomas Oberlies (1998: 206-7, 214-15), and the rapprochement between Kauravas and Trojans strongly suggests Siva~Apollo. For Siva-Dionysus see for instance Bernard Sergent(1997: 321-24). References Cited Allen, Nicholas J. 1997. "Why did Odysseus Become a Horse?"
