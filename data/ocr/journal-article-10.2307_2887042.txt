<plain_text><page sequence="1">DAVID WILLIAMS, Deformed Discourse: The Function of the Monster in Mediaeval Thought and Literature. Montreal and Kingston, Ont.: McGill-Queen's University Press, 1996. Pp. xiv, 392; black-and-white frontispiece and figures. $55. Published simulta- neously in the European Union by University of Exeter Press. Williams looks into the pervasive medieval interest in deformity, polymorphism, and the grotesque and sees there the influence of Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite, whose "negative theology" is manifested in a "symbolism of negation and paradox whose chief sign was the monster" (p. i). This claim for the medieval interest in monstrosity as a Dionysian "deformed discourse" and a way of knowing God through what he is not is developed in an introduction, conclusion, and eight chapters, accompanied by ninety black-and-white illustrations, footnotes, bibliography, and index. The book deals first with monstrosity among plants and animals, followed by monstrous "concepts" such as medieval numer- ology and anthropomorphic alphabets, and ends by considering "two types of literary narratives in which the monstrous and the deformed seem particularly prominent, the heroic saga [sic] and the saint's life" (p. 15). Examples of these so-called sagas include the Middle English Wars of Alexandei; Sir Gawvain and the Green Knight, and the medieval Oedipus legend. Saints treated are the headless Denis, the sometimes dog-headed Chris- topher, and the bearded, androgynous Wilgeforte or Uncomber. Williams writes clearly and entertainingly, translating all foreign quotations in order to make his work accessible to the beginner. Moreover, topics like the vagina dentata and the monstrous nature of sponges, and the drawings of priapic penises, would certainly catch the undergraduate's attention. Yet the book would be unsuitable for such an audience because it operates on too high a level of abstraction. Much of the argument for the idea that "God cannot be known except by knowing what he is not" (p. i), that is, through monstrosity, seems to exist as a construct created by Williams. Rarely is it tied to specific lands and periods, and he uses such phrases as "during the long period we call the Middle Ages" (p. 6) without ever indicating a century or place. Williams's enthusiasm for his construct and his belief in the superiority of paradoxes to exposition lead him to reject a more systematic approach; there is "no attempt ... to</page><page sequence="2">1138 Reviews provide an exhaustive description of the historical development of the concept of the gro- tesque and the monstrous, nor do I trace, one by one, the cultural and intellectual steps that lead from Pseudo-Dionysius . . . [to] the Pearl Poet" (p. 16). Moreover, because the concepts, objects, or works to which "negative theology" is applied seem to exist in an odd cultural isolation, rarely does corroborative material make the main conclusion of a section compelling. The specialist reader is apt to find the book everywhere fascinating and full of rich analogies and interesting insights, but often very idiosyncratic. For example, it is nearly impossible for a scholar to use the in-text illustrations and the documentation in notes and bibliography as springboards to further investigation of monstrous matters. The purpose of Williams's illustrations in either supporting what he is saying about monsters and mon- strosity or guiding the reader further into aspects of this subject outside the book is unclear to me, and I feel that what could have been the richest part of the entire book is in fact the weakest. Illustrations of manuscript miniatures are not reproduced from sharp, original photo- graphs (with their attendant costly and time-consuming permission fees) but from books often long out of copyright (and perhaps chosen for that reason). Sixteen of the illustrations are of objects and scenes represented by lithographic line drawings taken from books pub- lished in the 1870s and 1880s. The pictures do not have figure numbers and are generally not discussed in the text. There is no theoretical treatment of the relation of medieval literature and the visual arts, nor any attempt to situate the pictures in a developing tra- dition of unnatural history representation. Of the remaining illustrations, thirty-six are unusable for any scholarly purpose, lacking essential details enabling one to locate them in the library in question. For one of his most common sources of illustration, Paris, Bibliotheque nationale de France, MS fr. 2810 (in- formation never provided in Deformed Discourse), Williams fails to give the author (Henri Omont) or the correct title of the facsimile from which he takes ten of his pictures. A miniature from Hildegard of Bingen (p. 105) has no library, manuscript, or folio number. A line drawing of a sculpture of a Pygmy is called simply "Pygmy, Bronze statue, Mahdia" (p. 112); a miniature from the British Library's MS Cotton Nero C.IV lacks the "C." in the shelfmark and the folio number (144); and a scene on a vase from among the thousands owned by the British Museum is identified only as "Ulysses and the sirens. British Museum, Greek vase" (p. 190). Much of the documentation for texts on which Williams bases his argument is similarly casual. For example, a source that Williams quotes from or refers to on eleven occasions is first introduced on page 59 as "The Book of the Monsters," with no further information as to date or language. No footnote identifies this work until page 119, where finally we learn that it is from Douglas Butturff's 1968 dissertation, which was an edition and study of the seventh-century Liber monstrorum. Since Butturff's work, the Liber has been edited by Franco Porsia (1976), Corrado Bologna (1977), and (with English translation) by Andy Orchard in Pride and Prodigies (1995). Many of the human or natural monstrosities, themes, motifs, or literary works discussed in the book have out-of-date or inadequate documentation. For teratology we find J. Berger de Xivray (1836) and F. Denis (1843), and on iconography A. Didron (1851). Yet there is no reference to the work of Michael Camille on the grotesque and marginal, and the pages on the antipodes need recent scholarship by Valerie Flint and Anna Dorothee von den Brincken. The material on hell mouths would profit from Gary D. Schmidt's Iconography of the Mouth of Hell: Eighth Century Britain to the Fifteenth Century (1995). The pages on the mandrake need, besides C. J. S. Thompson's 1934 study (not noted is the 1968 reprint), works by Hermann Menhardt (1962) and Gustave Le Rouge (1967). The discus- sion of Alexander the Great's ascent to the heavens aided by griffins needs to be guided by</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 1139 Anna Maria Bisi, Il grifone: Storia di un motivo iconografico nell'antico Oriente mediter- raneo (1965), and Chiara Settis-Frugoni, Historia Alexandri elevati per griphos ad aerem: Origine, iconografia, e fortuna di un tema (1973). Among the most interesting-and yet most poorly documented-parts of the book is the material under the heading "Genitals" including the vagina dentata and the sheela-na- gig, or walking vagina, motifs, where Williams cites only Richard Knight's Discourse on the Worship of Priapus (1865) and reproduces some of the line drawings from that book. His comments about these carvings in Ireland-where they were admittedly most preva- lent-ignore those in England, Scotland, and Wales, not does he ever seem to have actually seen a sheela in situ, though there are some 159 of these carvings recorded, many still extant. A fine specimen for photography is at Haddon Hall in Derbyshire. Jorgen Ander- son's Witch on the Wall: Medieval Erotic Sculpture in the British Isles (1977) and James Jerman and Anthony Weir's Images of Lust: Sexual Carvings on Medieval Churches (1986) would have guided Williams; unfortunately too recent for his book is Jack Roberts and Joanne McMahon, The Sheela-na Gigs of Britain and Ireland: An Illustrated Map/Guide (1997). The deficient character of the documentation for Deformed Discourse extends to the bibliography as well. Of its 252 items, 40 have errors in their titles. These can range from words run together ("sacree profane"), first names missing (McFarlane), names and words misspelled ("Porphory" for Porphyry; "Lillian" for Lilian Randall; "greque" for grecque), accents missing (Liege) or backward, and missing or incorrect places of publication (To- ronto as home to the Edward Mellen Press), to the mangling of titles so as to make them unfindable. For another example of inadequate treatment let us take the work of Thomas of Can- timpr6, the De naturis reruni, a twenty-book encyclopedia edited by H. Boese in 1973, which Williams mentions on page 155 as De natura rerurn and on 159 as De naturis rertim. According to Williams, this work, "a main source of knowledge of the monsters for gen- erations of mediaeval students, depicts the monster [Cyclops] both verbally and visually, naming it a cyclops, but without reference to the classical legend." Nothing supports this statement, which is only partially true. Only book 3 of Thomas's encyclopedia treats mon- strous races of men; it mentions the Cyclops but as a race, "homines alij sunt ibi monoculi, qui Arismaspi uocuntur et Ciclopes nominantur," not as a single entity. Moreover, there is nothing "visual" in this passage; indeed, only a few manuscripts, such as Valenciennes, Bibliotheque Municipale, MS 320, are illustrated. When we turn to the bibliography, De naturis rerumn is attributed to "Cantimpre, Thomas de," edited by A. Hilka in Festschrift ztr Jabrbundertfeier der Universitat Breslau. Later, under "Thomas de Cantimpre" is the correct work edited by Alfons Hilka, Liber de nionstruosis hominibus Orientis (but man- gled to bomenilius). Why does a book published in English direct its readers to a French translation of Thomas Wright's History of Caricature and Grotesque in Literature and Art (London, 1865)? And why on page 159 is Hartmann Schedel's Chronicon titled "Chronique de Nuremberg"? Note 98 for this title refers the reader to "Schramm, Der Bilderschbnttck der Frihdrucke" with no further name, place, or date of publication. No such author is listed in the bibliography, but there Schedel's Chronicon is correctly titled in both German and Latin. All that I have said about the book's casualness is doubly unfortunate because, though Williams's argument as to the importance of the "via negativa" may not be solidly grounded in a medieval reality, the author is a fine reader of texts.
