<plain_text><page sequence="1">GREEK GODS AND FIGURINES. ASPECTS OF THE AN- THROPOMORPHIC DEDICATIONS, by Brita Alroth. (Boreas. Uppsala Studies in Ancient Mediterra- nean and Near Eastern Civilization 18.) Pp. 120, figs. 60, tables 20. Uppsala 1989. Alroth is a recent recipient of the Ph.D. from Uppsala University. This slim volume is her dissertation, published (if I understand the accompanying blurb correctly) in ad- vance of its defense. She poses two problems for herself: whether the appearance of votive figurines may be influ- enced by the cult image of the sanctuary in which they are dedicated, and whether a figurine of one god may be dedi- cated to ("visit") another god. In both cases she responds with a qualified "maybe." Alroth notes that she has examined the figurines from more than 50 sanctuaries (p. 18). The study, however, is restricted to the anthropomorphic figurines (chiefly of the Archaic and Classical periods) from some 20 shrines. She seems uneasy with the incompleteness of her dossier, and repeatedly cautions that her book constitutes only a small sample of the evidence (e.g., 66, 108). She nowhere, however, offers a reasoned justification of her selection and exclusion of certain shrines. In her attempt to isolate the influence of the cult statue on the votive figurines, Alroth encounters a predictable difficulty: there are rarely any detailed representations of Archaic cult statues; in fact, cult statues are often recon- structed on the basis of the votive figurines. She has little new to say about this problem, yet nevertheless devotes a</page><page sequence="2">506 BOOK REVIEWS [AJA 94 great deal of space in her catalogue to the evidence for the appearance of the cult statues. In all but a few cases, this detailed discussion amounts to a repetitive summary of Irene Romano's University of Pennsylvania dissertation, Early Greek Cult Images (1980). Alroth proceeds to evaluate the formal characteristics marking a figurine that has been influenced by the appear- ance of the cult statue. She reviews the various arguments that have been used to show that influence, e.g., a distinctive attribute, or homogeneity of figurines at a sanctuary. The best indication, in her opinion, is a "type or trait" that "can be traced through various developments of style" (18). What exactly a "trait" may be is not clear from her catalogue: it may be as specific as a weapon or an item of clothing, or as general as simple posture, i.e., standing or sitting (see her conclusions, 106-108). The section of the book devoted to "visiting gods" is particularly disappointing. In most cases it is uncertain to whom a given figurine may have been dedicated. Sites such as Olympia, Delphi, and the Athenian Acropolis are occu- pied by the cults of many gods. Alroth notes this problem (see, e.g., 67-68, 88) and then proceeds as though there is no difficulty: for instance, "it is undisputed that Athena was the principal goddess on the Acropolis at Athens. There certainly existed cult places of other deities or heroes such as ... [a long list indeed!]. All the same, I think that we can assume that the greatest part of the votives were intended for Athena and I proceed on this assumption" (p. 88). The archaeological context of the figurines is clearly crucial to this problem. Where in the sanctuary were the figurines found? Were they part of a larger deposit, or isolated finds? What other objects were found with them? Thorough con- sideration of such questions might have added much to the discussion. Even when full documentation is available, how- ever, Alroth provides no more than a cursory description of provenience (see, e.g., the discussion of the figurines from Lindos, 54-59, 83-87). The issue of "visiting gods" raises questions regarding the specific cult context of the various dedications. Alroth de- votes two pages of her conclusion (112-13) to the problem. She scrupulously tabulates the "visiting gods," the sanctu- aries they visited and the gods to whom (she assumes) they are dedicated. Her solutions here seem to be excessively simplistic and naive. It is not surprising to hear that Artemis may be given to Apollo (as at Amyklai) because they are siblings, but it is not enlightening, either. It is absolutely pointless to note that various gods are given to Zeus at Olympia and Dodona because "all deities are appropriate as a gift to the supreme god, especially as he was also related to them in various ways at least in myth" (112). I do not recommend this book. The author, too, seems to have reservations about the project: the study is full of equivocation, qualification, and disclaimer. Her discomfort emerges most clearly in the conclusion: for example, "in summary, I think that it is possible to argue that the cult image in some cases influenced the appearance of the figu- rines, but that the figurines did not copy the image closely" (108). The flaws in this study were created by the problems, questions, and scope chosen by the author. She would have been better advised (by her examiners) to provide an ex- haustive analysis of the figurines from one or two well- documented shrines, concentrating in detail on issues such as cult practices, context of dedication, and the iconography of all representations of the various divinities known from the shrine (not just of the cult statue). The results from such a study might profitably be applied to figurines from other, less well-known shrines. CHARLES W. HEDRICK, JR.
