<plain_text><page sequence="1">PERIODICAL LITERATURE CONDUCTED BY DR ALEXANDER F. CHAMBERLAIN GENERAL Anthony (R.) Le muscle pristernal: ses formes fibreuses rudimentaires, leur frequence chez 1'homme et leur presence chez certains animaux. (Bull. et Mem. Soc. d' Anthrop. de Paris, 1900oo, ve s., I, 486-514.) Details the results of observations on 52 human subjects (males 30, females 22, of which I were foetuses) and a number of animals. It appears that presternal formations of the kind in question do not occur only in man, but also in the platystern- ian animals; and in man they are met with at all stages of development. The article is illustrated with 13 text-figures, and a digest of previous investigations precedes the new matter. Barker (L. F.) On the study of anat- omy. (Bull. Johns Hopkins Hosp., Baltimore, 1901o, xII, 87-95.) This general discussion, which emphasizes productive study, contains a valuable list of previous addresses on the nature and the subjects of anatomical teach- ing. Brown (A. E.) On some points in the phylogeny of the primates. (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci., Phila., 1901, LIII, I19-125.) The author notes that "'the fact that before monkeys, as now known, began to exist, man-like apes were far advanced in development, and that the earliest evidence of existing genera of apes is coeval with that of existing genera of catarrhines, tells enormously in favor of the early and independent origin of anthropomorpha." He also suggests " the multiple rather than the single origin of the Lemur- oidea. " Brush (C. E.) Notes on cervical ribs. (Bull. Johns Hopkins Hosp., Balti- more, 1901, xn, II14-117.) Brief ac- count of three cases, of which two presented some uncommon variations. Capitan (L.) Les pierres A cupule. (Rev. de 1' Ycole d' Anthrop. d. Paris, Ig91, XI, 114-127.) An interesting general discussion, with I3 figures, of " cupped stones" from different parts of the globe, and the various hypotheses re- lating to their use. Among the theories suggested are: Ornamentation, " idle- work," numeration, amulets, talismans, finger-holes (in case of implements, etc.), miniature bowls, blood-receivers (in sacrifice), polishers, holes used by children for smoothing balls (marbles), etc. The author himself is quite ec- lectic in his opinion. Ehrefireich (P.) Wilhelm Wundt's V61- ker - psychologie. (Globus, Braun- schweig, I900, LXXIX, 21-22.) Critical review and resum6 of Wundt's recent work on " Race Psychology," which Dr Ehrenreich thinks may lead to a new era of linguistics. But the Ameri- can languages, Chinese, etc., have been given none or too little attention in the book. Gaudry (A.) Sur la similitude des dents de 1' homme et de quelques animaux. (Anthropologie, Paris, 19goI, xII, 93- Io2.) This paper, illustrated with 14 figures, discusses the comparative de. velopment of the teeth of man and those of certain anthropomorphic apes, fossil and actually existing. The auo thor's conclusion is that, " while with certain animals the complication of the teeth is a mark of progress, with man superiority is indicated by their dimin- ution." Of all teeth considered those of the white race are the most incom- plete. Paper read at Congress of 19oo. Giuffrida - Ruggeri (V.) Sui residui della fontanella metopica o medio- frontale.

G.) On the occurrence of tails in man, with a description of the case reported by Dr. Watson. (Bull. Johns Hopkins Hosp., Baltimore, Igor, XII, 96-1or.) This paper, illustrated with 6 figures, discusses briefly the general subject, the tail in embryos, etc., with special reference to a tail on a three-months' infant, reported about a year ago by Dr Watson of Baltimore. According to Dr Harrison five cases of " tails" have so far been reported in the United States. The range of estima- tion of the tail in folk-thought is from the opinion of the Ranas of Poorbunder that the elongation of their spines al- lied them to the monkey-god, Hanu- man, to the views held by their neighbors concerning the " tailed men " of Turk- estan, who were held in the greatest contempt. Hofer (P.) Fortschritte in der Datierung der Steinzeit. (Globus, Braunschweig, 1901, LXXIX, lo8-rog.) Based on Goetze and Montelius. Jordan (D. S.) The blood of the nation. (Pop. Sci. Mo., N. Y., 1901, LIX, 129- 140.) Continued from previous num- ber. Discusses in popular strain the decay of races through the survival of the unfit in war. Illustrations of thesis from history of ancient empires and of modern America. Lasch (R.) Die Anfainge des Gewerbe- standes. (Ztschr. f. Socialwiss., Berlin, 1901, IV, 73-89.) Seeks to resume, with references to literature, our present knowledge of the beginnings of indus- trial classes and special trades and occupations (clothing, pottery, weapons, implements, metal-working, carpentry, etc.) " Home-spun " clothes are well- known among the primitive people of Africa and Polynesia; pottery is very often an art confined (e. g., in New Guinea), to women, or to some special tribe (Nu-Arawaks, e. g., in South America), but sometimes (as with the Northern Bantu in Africa), an art of men,-in parts of Africa, Melanesia, etc., pottery rises to the dignity of an industry for the market; arrow-makers of a special sort occur in many quarters, and the shield-maker among certain Australian tribes touches the point of separate industries; the blacksmith in Africa and the carpenter in Polynesia have a right to consideration as trades- men, so too the gold and silver worker, the basket-maker, etc. Other callings sometimes restricted to one sex, one portion of the community, one tribe, etc., are tattooing, net-making, house- building, manufacture of household utensils, etc. The author distinguishes the following types of industries: A, House-industry. B, Professional in- dustry (sex- industry, tribe-industry, caste-industry, free, separate industry). The facts in our possession, he thinks, do not allow to dogmatize concerning either the order of evolution of primi- tive industries or their historical and other relations. In his future investi- gations Dr Lasch should make use of the studies of Holmes, McGuire, Cush- ing, Haddon, Mason, et al. Lef6bure (E.) L'arc-en-ciel podtique. (Milusine, Paris, 1901, x, 145-153, 176-186.) Continuation of detailed comparative study of the rainbow in poetry, ancient and modern. Leggiardi-Laura (C.) Questioni sulle circonvoluzioni cerebrali. (Riv. di Biol. gen., Torino, 1901, III, 304-320.) This article, illustrated with a plate (6 figs.) and four figures in the text, treats of the variation, modes of association, etc., of the cerebral convolutions, the data studied being some 5oo human brains investigated during the last two years by the author and Dr Varaglia. The cerebral convolutions are divided into constant and inconstant, - the former comprising nine varieties, and having probably ethnic significance, the latter (pathological, arrests of em- bryonal development, atavistic, pro- gressive, etc.), being of individual significance. The author considers that the cranio-cerebral relation cannot be reduced to the confines of the cephalic index. Letoumeau (C. L.) Des reves ances- traux. (Bull. Soc. d' Anthrop. de Paris, 1900, ve s., I, 425-432.) After some general remarks on dreams and hallucinations, the author, believing that mental impressions, etc., can be inherited, proceeds to argue that dreams of the d/ej vu, dej/ connu type (" I seem to have been there before," etc.), and kindred impressions of the indi- vidual are " recollections hereditarily transmitted," or ancestral dreams. To a similar psychic subsoil may be attrib- uted changes of character at death, infant-prodigies, etc.</page><page sequence="3">552 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 3, 1901 von Luschan (F.) Ueber kindliche Vorstellungen bei den sogen. Natur- v1lkern. (Ztschr. f. Pad. Psychol. u. Pathol., Berlin, 19o0, II, 89-96.) Af- ter indicating the unfairness of some of the distinctions sought to be made be- tween savage and civilized man and noting the absurdity of some of the re- ports of casual visitors and the lack of skilfulness on the part of travelers in getting to understand the primitive mind, Dr von Luschan proceeds to combat the view that primitive races are " weak in thinking, and weak in abstract thinking," paying special at- tention to numeration. In the light of the facts that our Roman numerals represent the fingers of the hand or the hand closed, that our count clearly begins again at ii (if not before), that French has soixante-dix for 70, that Homer did not know the numeral pvpzoz, that the word million had its origin since 1494 (the Romans could only say decies centena millia), that milliarde dates only from 1830, and that billion in German and in French does not mean the same number of millions,-these and other things like the differing names of the milleped (" forty feet" with the Turk, but " thousand foot" in German),-we ought to be cautious about inferences from the mere inspection of the nu- merals of primitive peoples. Example of real child-actions on the part of the Maoris of New Zealand and of the Konde of the region of Lake Nyassa in Africa are given. Macalister (A.) Variations in the ossi- fication of the occipital bone. (Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc., 1901, XI, 150- 152.) Treats of the classification of variations in the union of the compo- nent elements. The most prolific of varieties is the planum interparietale, where there "'are normally at least four spots at which ossification begins in this membranous area." Type forms are indicated. McGee (W J) Man's place in nature. (Science, N. Y., 1901, N. s., XTIJ, 453- 46o.) This address appears in full in the American Anthropologist, 1901, N. S., III, 1-13. Minakov (P. A.) Volosi bii antropolo- gitcheskom' otnoshenii. (Russk. An- trop. Zhur., Moskva, I9oo, I, No. I, 83-94.) An anthropological study of the hair, with many tables and 4 text- figures. The various theories are noted, especially those of Pruner Bey and Deniker. Nogti tchelovetcheskoi ruki. (Ibid., No. II, 30-39.) An interesting study, with statistical tables of the nails of the human hand. By a combination of callipers and tape the real breadth (curvature) of the nail was measured, and this, compared with the apparent breadth, gave the index of flattening. Among the conclusions arrived at are the following: Greater chest-circum- ference is accompanied with broader nails; in individuals who use both hands equally no difference seems to occur between the two hands, but gen- erally right-handed persons have broader and flatter nails on the right hand, and left-handed persons on the left hand. Details as to breadth, flat- ness, and thickness of the separate fin- ger-nails are given. The subjects of investigation were 278 soldiers and stu- dents and a number of new-born chil- dren. The work was suggested by the study of Regnault in 1898. Paul-Boncour (G.) Etude des modifi- cations squelettiques consecutives A l'hemiplegie infantile. (Bull. et Mkm. Soc. d'Anthrop. de Paris, I900oo, ve s., , 359-414.) This first section treats with 2 figures of the femur only, a detailed account with tables of measurements of the condition of six sound and six un- healthy femurs belonging to skeletons of children affected with cerebral hemi- plegia. Length, weight, neck of femur, iliac impress, head of femur, cotyloid cavity, angle of neck of femur, curve of diaphysis, obliquity of dia- physis, pilaster, linea aspera, flattening of femur, popliteal index, muscle inser- tion, third trochanter, etc., are dis- cussed at length. The presence of a third trochanter on both healthy and unhealthy femurs seems to weaken the theory of origin from muscular vigor. The healthy femurs, naturally, show the best development. Peet (S. D.) The serpent and tree. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 1901, XxIII, 179-198.)

According to Dr Rabaud: " Teratol- ogy is the study of the variations of embryonic evolution, leading to the production, under the influence of nu- tritive modifications, of adult forms differing from the normal ones." Tera- tology, far from being an accessory part of normal embryology, is an im- portant branch of general biology. The normal state, indeed, is only one par- ticular case, not always the necessary or the general one. Permanence of form is related to permanence of milieu. Teratology is thus more comprehensive than normal embryology. The author illustrates his ideas with a schema on page III. Regnault (F.) La chronophotographie dans l'etnographie. (Bull. et Mdm. Soc. d'Anthrop. de Paris, ve s., I, 421- 422.) Brief notes on chronophoto- graphic pictures presented to the museum of the Society, made in 1895 in the laboratory of M. Marey, and of ethnic import. - L'dvolution du costume. (Ibid., 329-344.) This article appeared also in the Revue Sientifique, I901, 4e s., xv, 103-112. See American Anthro- pologist, 1901, N. S., III, 178. Retzius (G.) Om trepanation af huf- vudskalen, sasom folksed i forna och nyara tider. (Ymer, Stockholm, 190O, XXI, 11-28.) Discusses, with to figures (skulls from Sweden and elsewhere in Europe, Peru, Mexico), trepanation in ancient and modern times. Of the three skulls from Alvastra in Sweden, two are meso-dolichocephalic, and one brachycephalic. In -parts of the Bal- kan peninsula trepanning still flourishes. See Almgren (0.) Rivers (W. H. R.) Primitive orienta- tion. (Folk-Lore, London, 1901, xII, 210-212.) Brief discussion of orienta- tion among certain primitive peoples of'Africa, Asia, and Indonesia, and the folk of civilized Europe, particularly the use of right and left for north and south or vice versa, their expression by the same word, etc. For the normal and reversed position of the letter E used in testing eyesight the natives of Mabuing in Torres Straits used the terms for " windward " and " leeward," the former being used " when the open side was towards the direction of the prevailing south-east trade wind." The Heligolanders styled the position of the same letter (used by Cohn) north and south instead of right and left. Dr Rivers is of opinion that primitive man originially oriented himself in relation to his surroundings rather than in rela- tion to himself. Hence the words for " north " and "6south " are more origi- nal than those for " right" and " left." Schwalbe (G.) Ueber die Fontanelle metopica (medio-frontalis) und ihre Bildungen. (Ztschr. f. Morphol. u. Anthrop., Stuttgart, I9o0, iii.) A good discussion with resume of litera- ture of the subject. Prof. Schwalbe holds that the four centers cannot be explained as a fact of phylogenesis or atavism, but must be regarded as a pro- gressive phenomenon, the result of greater cerebral development. Phylo- genesis could account for only two frontals. Seashore (C. E.) Suggestions for tests, on school children. (Educ. Rev., N. Y., 1901, XXII, 69-82.) Outlines tests of observation, physical measurements, fatigue, sight, hearing, discriminative action, etc., suggested by committee of Iowa Child-Study Society in 1897 and worked out by the author in the labora- tory of the State University. Sorel (G.) La valeur sociale de l'art. (Rev. de Mdtaphysique et de Morale, Paris, 1901, IX, 251-278.) According to the author the mission of art is to ennoble manual labor and to make it the equal of scientific work. Artistic education, no longer the delight of the idle, is to become the basis of indus- trial production, that which will clothe labor with an esthetic charm. Spitzka (E. A.) The redundancy of the pre-insula in the brains of distinguished educated men. (Med. Rec., N. Y. 19or, LIX, 94o-943.) After general discussion, treats of the excessive growth and de- velopment of the left pre-insula in the two Seguins, father and son. The cur- rent view that an exposure of the island of Reil indicates a low form or defect- ive type of brain, must be modified, since in both the Seguins, physicians of high intellectual capacity, such expos- ure occurs.

Thomas (N. W.) Animal superstitions. (Folk-Lore, London, 19o0, xII, 189- 194.)

(Pop. Sci. Mo., N. Y., 1901, LIX, 273-279.) Brief account of observations and experiments made in 19oo upon three individuals of the genus Cebus. According to Prof. Thorndike monkeys "occupy an intermediate posi- tion in every main psychological feature between mammals in general and the human species. In their power of vision, use of the body, physical and mental activity for the sake of activity, method of learning, etc., monkeys are nearer man. These observations of Prof. Thorndike are given in detail in " The Mental Life of Monkeys," which forms Monograph Supplement No. 15 (May, 1901) to the Psychological Review. EUROPE Almgren (0.) Ett graffidlt fran den ldre firnmldern vid Alvastra i Osterg6tland. (Ymer, Stockholm, 1901o, XXI, 5-1o.) Treats, with 4 figures, of a burial place belonging to the first Iron age, discov- ered in 1900oo near Alvastra, in the dis- trict of (Osterg6tland, Sweden. The most important contents of these graves were three trepanned skulls, the first recorded from Sweden. See Retzius (G.) Andersson (G.) Ett bidrag till kiinne- domen om histens f6rekomst i Sverige under stengldern. (Ibid., 79-91.) Dis- cusses with 2 tables (cranium) and 3 text figures, the presence of the horse during the Stone age in Sweden. The skull-fragment in question was discov- ered in I9oo, near Ingelstadt, with flint weapons of the later neolithic period. Anutchin (D. N.) Veglit vzylyad' na proshloe antropologil i na yeya zadatchi bfi Rossii. (Russk. Antrop. Zhur., Moskva, 1900oo, I, No. I, 25-42.) A historical sketch of anthropology in the Russian Empire. Bacher (J.) Von dem deutschen Grenz- posten LusErn im wilschen Siadtirol. (Ztschr. d. Ver. f. Volkskunde, Berlin, Ig9o, xI, 169-180.) Gives the dialect text and German translation of six folk-tales from Lusern, a German out- post in the Italian Tirol. Continued from previous number. Balliot (M.) Tumulus de Perrogney. (Bull. et Mem. Soc. d'Anthrop. de Paris, 19oo, ve s., I, 446-447.) In continuing his investigations of the tumuli of Perrogney, Balliot found in one of them a coin of Nero, together with a fragment of a bracelet and a golden buckle. These tumuli were thought to belong to the Marne epoch. Barbot (J.) Ustensiles et bibelots popu- laires dans la Lozere. (Rev. d. Trad. Pop., Paris, 19O0, xvI, 213-214.) De- scribes, with 8 text-figures, whistles of young wood, noise instruments from peach-stones and nut-shells; also a guillotine for flies. de las Barras (F.) Un ensayo de trab- ajos cefalometricos realizados por alum- nos de segunda ensefianza. (Bol. d. 1. Inst. libre de Enseiianza, Madrid, 1901, xxv, 44-46.) Gives cephalic, nasal and facial indices and head-circumferences of 19 pupils between 14 and 19 years of age in the Institute of Avila, a Spanish town, 71 miles from Madrid, at the foot of the Sierra Guadarrama. Prof. de las Barras intends to carry on these measurements year by year. Bartsch (A.) Sagen aus Oberschlesien. (Mitth. d. Schles. Ges. f. Volkskunde, Breslau, 1901, 45-53.) Brief notes of folk-tales from Upper Silesia, relat,. ing to water-spirits, mountain-spirits, moras, dragon, serpent, mouse, horse, dog, cat, dove, frog, etc. These tales were collected by the author, who is a teacher in Benthen, from his pupils.

Anthrop., Mtinchen, 1901, XXXTI, 30-32, 37-39.) Continuation and conclusion of Dr Beltz's explanatory discussion of the pre- history of Mecklenburg as indicated on the four maps published by him. The third map deals with the Celtic and Roman Iron age,-up to this time there has been from the Stone age to the Age of Iron a continuity of burial customs, and, inferentially, of popula- tion. Then, with the time of the fourth map, comes a break, and a new people, the Wends, dominate Mecklen- burg for 600 years, after which the Germanization of the land occurred. Bischoff (H.) Die germanisch-roman- ische Sprachgrenze in Belgien und Nordfrankreich. (Globus, Braunsch- weig, 19go, LXXIX, 94-97.) Critical review of Kurth's recent work on this subject. The difference between po- litical conquest and real taking posses- sion of a country is emphasized. The history of language in this region is of great interest. Here we have illus- trated the curious fact that bilingual people ultimately give up their own speech. Bloch (A.) Galien anthropologiste. (Bull. et Mem. Soc. d'Anthrop. de Paris, Igoo, ve s., I, 347-359.) Galen (b. 13T A.D.), the celebrated Greek physician, is for anthropologists the most important writer of antiquity, having made a special study of the or- ganism of the anthropoid ape, and hav- Ing made observations on various human races. He is also said to have been the first to employ the word dxe;erd'S to the bony ensemble. Dr Bloch cites from the work of Galen passages concerning articulation, mus- culature, hair, eyes, skin, Celts and Teutons, etc. - Interpretation anthropologique du mot Latin Gallus, Gaulois. (Ibid., 432-440.) The author produces evi- dence to show that Gallus (" Gaul ") is identical with gallus (" rooster "), an essentially Latin word. Celts, Galates, and Gauls are words not derived from one root, and therefore not akin to each other. The fact that the Gauls were looked upon as " red,"-in French a ruddy-complexioned man is still de- scribed as rouge comme un coq,-made the passage from the fowl to the human being easy. Bliimml (E. K.) Beitrige zur Flora der Friedhofe in Niedertsterreich. (Ztschr. d. Ver. f. Volkskunde, Berlin, 1901, xI, 210-213.) After noting the scarcity of literature on the subject, the author gives a list of fifty species of plants found in some seven cemeteries in Lower Austria. An interesting contri- bution to folk-esthetics. Body (A.) La ldgende Spadoise du pied de St.-Remacle. (Wallonia, Li ge, 1901, IX, 113-125.) Interesting de- tailed historical account of the legend of the foot of St Remacle, one of the many stories connected with Spa and its springs. By placing her foot in the miraculous imprint of that of St Rem- acle, any woman suffering from sterility, who likewise drinks of the waters of Sauveniere, will become a mother. Brissaud (J.) La couvade en B6arn et chez les Basques. (Rev. d. Pyr6ndes, 1900, 225-239.) An attempt, after dis- cussing the various theories about the " couvade," and referring to the liter- ature of the subject, to indicate how much truth and how much myth exist concerning it. The cases of " cou- vade " among the Basques are said to be more historical than actual. In re- viewing Dr Brissaud's article in Anthro- pologie (1901, xII, 199), M. E.C artallhac suggests an element of humor due to reaction against the laws of the Pyrenees so favorable to woman, as having some- thing to do with the couvade tradition. But this would not explain its existence elsewhere in the world. Blinker (J. R.) Typen von Dorffluren an der dreifachen Grenze von Nieder6s- terreich, Ungarn und Steiermark. (Mitth. d. Anthrop.

Buschan (G.) Der Stand unserer Kennt- nis fiber die Basken. (Globus, Braunschweig, 1901, LXXIX, 117-124.) An excellent resume, with bibliography, of our present knowledge of the Bas- ques,-language, physical character- istics (stature and skull-form in par- ticular), history, etc. Dr Buschan, recognizing an undoubted "Basque type," considers it probable that " this Basque race has arisen from a crossing of the shortheaded (immigrant in early prehistoric times from Asia) and the native (Mediterranean) long-headed race, aided by long ages of inbreeding." Capitan (L.) Les divers instruments chelliens et acheuldens compris sous la denomination unique de coup-de-poing. (Anthropologie, Paris, 1901, xII, III- ii8.) Paper read at Congress of rgoo, illustrated with 9 text-figures. M. Capitan tries to show that there was really considerable variety in the imple- ments from the oldest alluvium, the so-called coup-de-poing, representing a long series of implements of divers forms, and probably very diverse uses. - Exposition de 1' ~icole d' Anthro- pologie et de la Sous-Commission des Monuments Migalithiques. Catalogue raisonni et descriptif. (Bull. et. Mem. Soc. d'Anthrop. de Paris, 1900, ve s., I, 295-319.) This excellent descriptive catalogue of the Paris exhibit of the Icole d' Anthropologie and the Sub- Commission on Megalithic Monuments relates to prehistoric art, architecture, and industries, ranging from the en- gravings of the cave-men to the speci- mens (vases, ornaments arms) from the Gaulish cemeteries of the Marne, where the beginnings of Roman influence are perceptible.

A brief gen- eral account of the werwolf in the folk- thought of Belgium. The werwolf is the form the servant of the devil most commonly takes. Like the modern French (loup-garou) Walloon has the pleonastic form loup-warou ("wolf man-wolf "). Another term in use vertbouc, the author considers to signify " man goat." In Hainault the werwolf is replaced by the tchi t tchatnes (" chien A chaines ") and the dog ap- pears elsewhere in the Walloon country, as the tchin de l'ronhe (" chien de la ronce "). The werwolf's elbows and knees are " backwards." In Ardennes the skin he covers himself with is thought to be that of a male wolf. A " lady killer" is said to be amoureux comme un loup-warou. Conradt (Frieda) Das Leben einer deutschen Hausfrau in Kamerun. (Globus, Braunschweig, 1901, LXXIX, 135-140.) Account, with 5 illustrations in the text, of a German woman's round of life in the Cameroons, with notes about the natives. De Cock (A.) Le gargon au bonnet rouge. (Rev. de Trad. Pop., Paris, 1901, XVI, 217-231.)

Croissance des elves d'une ecole professionnelle pendant l'ann6e scolaire. (Bullet. d. 1. Soc. libre p. l'etude psychol. de l'enfant, Paris, I90, I, 34-41). Gives, with three sets of curves, results of measure- ments of weight, height, and chest girth, taken in I889-9o and 1890-91 on 269 pupils (aged 12-15 years) in the National Professional School at Vier- zon.

Consecrated bread is a talisman against the water-spirit. He can be caught with a consecrated rope, and subdued with the left hand. The "water man" is particularly at home in Upper Silesia. Ellis (H.) A study of British genius. (Pop. Sci. Mo., N. V., 1901, LIX, 209- 216.) Continued from previous num- ber. Treats of marriage and family, longevity. British men of genius show a tendency not only to marry seldom, but to marry late, while with women there is " a tendency for the years of greatest reproductive activity to be re- served for intellectual development, by accelerating or retarding the disturbing emotional and practical influences of real life." The statistics as to family" con- firm only to a limited extent the belief in the relative sterility of men of genius." Moreover, the average fertility of non- barren marriages is not at all small. In general, " families of men of genius differ from genius-producing families by approximating to normal families. An excess of boys in the families of men of genius (corresponding to a similar excess in genius-producing families) is suggested by the statistics. The author finds an evolutional reason for the com- mon longevity of men of genius in the fact that " they must live a long time, or they will never become eminent." This, more than the favorable circum- stances of intellectual avocations, ex- plains why death comes so late,-fame in most walks of life being very slowly achieved. A very low mortality is no- ticeable between the ages of 53 and 57, -" after the first climax at 49 the feeble have mostly died out, and the vigorous are then in possession of their best powers and working at full pressure." Fifty-seven seems to be " a critical age at which exhaustion and collapse are specially liable to occur." - A study of British genius. (Ibid., 266-272.) This seventh section of Mr Ellis' study discusses the pathology of genius, - brain - lesions, consumption, asthma, angina pectoris, gout, stone, insanity, and other rather frequently occurring affections are referred to. The author's general conclusion seems to be that "1if the man of genius is all the better for a slight ferment of disease [gout, e. g.], we must not forget that if he is to accomplish much hard work he also requires a robust constitution." Gout in the joints tends to make the mind of the genius " abnormally clear and vigorous" ; in the blood, " to ab- normally overcloud his brain." The relationship between genius and insani- ty " is far from being either so frequent or so significant as is assumed by some writers "-for " genius cannot be accu- rately defined as a disease." The sta- tistics of British men of genius " do not furnish a single shred of evidence in support of the theory that genius is an epileptoid neurosis." While neuras- thenia is common, "grave nervous dis- eases of definite type" are rare. Clum- siness in the use of the hands and in walking are, Mr Ellis thinks, of con- siderable significance.

The former are offered up on account of headache ; the latter for af- fections of the internal organs. Other votive customs are also noted. von Fellenberg(E.) Ueber den Bronze- fund in Muri bei Bern. (Verh. d. Berl. Ges. f. Anthrop., 1901, 34-36.) Brief account of bronze remains (statuettes of deities, etc.) from Muri belonging to the Roman period.

Brief ac- count, with 18 figures in the text, of the "grave-posts" of the Szdkl people buried in Kronstadt in Transylvania. In the Szdkl dialect these posts are called sir-fa (" grave-wood "), and are set up some time after the interment, when a fair brings the relatives to town.

(Journ. Anthrop. Inst., Lond., igoo, xxx, 161- I68.) Detailed account, with schedules, of Dr Garson's modification of the Bertillon - Galton systems. Technics, liability to error, records, etc., are treated of. The great utility and ap- plicability of the Galton finger-print tests are doubted. For British criminals the Garson system is said to have worked well. A fact of interest in this connec- tion is that in India, by reason of the impossibility of securing, at widely dis- tant stations, accurate observers, the Bertillon system has practically been abandoned in favor of Galton's finger- print test.

(Medd. fr. Nord. Mus., Stockholm, 1898 [1goo], 1-38.) A detailed discus- sion, with a plate and a text-figure of the worship of St Lucia in Christian lands and its relation to heathen re- ligions. The author concludes that the festivals of St Lucia, in the Catholic countries of Europe, are largely heathen survivals. In Scandinavian folk-belief Lucia is a personification of growth in Nature, given perpetuation by the Christian church. Hamy (E. T.) La grotte neolithique de Gemenon, Bouches-du-Rh8ne. (Bull. d. Mus. d'Hist. Nat., Paris, 1900, 405- 409.) Brief description with measure- ments of male and female skulls found in the Gemenos grotto in 1876, and now in the Museum, also of a skull from a pre-Roman tumulus in Peyrolles, which reproduces the characteristics of the Gimenos crania. The female skull is rather voluminous (capacity 1,605 + ccm.), and all three are dolichocephalic. - Note sur une sdpulture ndolithique de Fonvieille-ls-Arles. (Ibid., r901, 8-io.) Brief descriptions, with meas- urements, of four skulls (one brachy- cephalic) from the grotto of Castellet and a tomb at Fonvieille, investigated in 187r. Dr Hamy considers that the fourth skull indicates the presence in Provence at the end of the Neolithic period of "a brachycephalic, euryg- nathous element, which in one day has risen to be the preponderating one."

(Ztschr. d. Ver. f. Volkskunde, Berlin, 1901, XI, 117-149.) A detailed discus- sion of the old Norse riddles in the Hervarar saga, with estimate of their poetical qualities and their value as culture - material. According to the author they belong to the very best riddle-verses, and were thoroughly pop- ular in their nature, when one takes into consideration the social relations of Iceland at the time,-they are Norse, pre-literary, pre-Christian, pre-chival- ric, and in them lives the Viking age. Two thirds of the motifs are taken from nature, and one of the commonest of these is the vivifying of the inanimate. H16fler(M.) Sankt Michaelsbrot. (Ibid., 193-201.) Describes, with 4 text-fig- ures, the St Michael's bread or cakes and certain customs connected with them in various countries of Europe (Germany and Switzerland in particu- lar.) On Michaelmas day offerings were commonly made to the dead, and the day was thought to have influence on seed-time and harvest. According to Dr Hofler, the St Michael customs prove that the Teutonic New Year was connected with a pronounced funeral ceremony and a harvest-festival.</page><page sequence="10">PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 559 H6fler- Continued. ----St. Hubertus-Schltissel. (Ibid., 207- 21o.) Brief account, with a figure in the text, of two St Hubert "keys" (really long iron nails, with seal-shaped heads) from the Spessart. These "keys" are used in cases of hydrophobia to cauterize the wound or to brand the dog. Directions for their use are cited from a manuscript of 1757. Hoppin (J. C.) Three Argive lekythi in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. (Amer. Journ. Archmaol., Norwood, Mass., 1900, IV, 441-457.) Detailed description (with 3 plates) and discus- sion of three lekythi of somewhat uncer- tain history, which the author styles "Argive," rather than " Proto-Corin- thian," since "the rightful home of the style lies in the Argolid,"-which theory he produces evidence to support. The Argive style is a direct offshoot of the Mycensean and not a connecting link between the geometric and the Corinthian, being older than hitherto believed. Ihm (M.)

(An- thropologie, Paris, 1901, xII, 158-I59.) Brief abstract of paper read at Con- gress of 19oo. Treats of the investiga- tions up to the present of the paleolithic station discovered in 1894 on St Cyril St. in the city of Kiev,-here some 50 skeletons of the mammoth, remains of a rhinoceros, tree-trunks, flint imple- ments, etc., have been found. The most interesting specimens, however, are two mammoth-tusks, one of which has been incised and notched by a flint tool, the other is covered with neat engravings, which represent apparently fauna and flora of the time. The con- dition of these tusks, Prof. Khvoika thinks, proves that here man was con- temporary with the mammoth, and did not follow him, as Prof. Anutchin holds. Koren (A.) Die K6rperliinge norwegi- scher Soldaten. (Corrbl. d. deutschen Ges. f. Anthrop., 1901, xxxII, 46.) Brief rdsumd of the results of the meas- urements of 1,284 soldiers in their twenty-second (1893) and twenty-eighth years (1899.) Increase of stature during this time was noted in 83.41 %, decrease in 6.07 %, no change in o10.52 %. These investigations clearly indicate that there is not a little individual growth after the twenty-second year and that such growth has not entirely ceased even at the twenty-eighth year. The average height of the 1,284 soldiers was, in 1893, 169.7I cm., in 1899, 171.34 cm., an increase of 1.63 cm. Measurements taken of 48 soldiers in 1898 and 1899 show an average increase for the year of I.0 cm. Law (L. A.) Death and burial customs in Wiltshire. (Folk-Lore, London, 1900, XI, 344-347.)

Here the remains of the mammoth abound, and there have been discovered also 2o human skeletons, be- sides some 15,ooo flint implements, a large number of ivory and bone objects, ornaments, etc. The skull of a young adult strikingly resembles the famous Neanderthal cranium.

Treats of witchcraft in the region of Troyes in northeastern France, with illustrations from ecclesiastical legislation, local legends, etc. Some of the villages in this part of the country had a great reputation for witches. Of Galilee the saying went, "in Galilee 12 houses, 13 witches," and of Orquevaux " more witches than horses," of De Sognes that the inhabitants were all witches. A case before the courts of Bar-sur-Aube, as late as 1851, involved belief in witch- craft, and it has not entirely disappeared even now. de Mortillet (A.)

The collections embrace speci- mens ranging from the flints of Thenay (Lower Miocene?) to remains of the MWrovingian period. Included are also some specimens (paleolithic and neo- lithic) from countries outside of France, and from other continents.

Among the topics touched upon are: Nature of the death-path, terms for "to die," length of journey, the path of the demons of disease and death, search for and tests of the pres- ence of the dead, etc. The author notes the fact that in Germany the opinion prevails that the dead wander far and long; "the long journey" is thus a common euphemism.</page><page sequence="13">562 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 3, 1901 Nicolet (C.)

Some 6o have been more or less explored by the author,-of these some 15 are briefly described, the Trilobite grotto in the Cure valley, and the grotto des Fees, in the same region, being treated more in detail. The Abbe Parat recognizes in the Seine basin four epochs of the cavern period, differentiated geologi- cally and by the fauna and remains of human industry. The last epoch has a fauna quite different from the rest and the implements are sui generis, indicat- ing perhaps emigration at the beginning of the period. In the Trilobite grotto there was discovered the upper portion of the humerus of a reindeer on which was incised a branch of some tree or plant with leaves and flowers. Paton (W. R.)

Items of popular belief relating to stones, the weather, wind, heavenly bodies, love- charms, fairies, giants, goblins, witch- craft and counter-magic, taboos, etc. The author notes that the folklore of Lincolnshire is rather "prosaic" and is "lacking in the beauties which distin- guish the conceptions of the Celtic peoples," but "it is scarcely pos- sible yet to come to a definite con- clusion as to a connection between Lin- colnshire and Scandinavian beliefs." The old custom of " luck-money" on purchases seems bound to disappear, although " on a certain day in August, 1898, a large number of buyers kept aloof from the auction sale in Lincoln market because ' luck-money' was withheld."

Piroutet (M.) Note sur les sdpultures antirieures A 1' age du fer dans le Jura salinois. (Anthropologie, Paris, 190o, xII, 29-40.) Author cites evidence to show that, while in the Jura region megalithic burials do not occur and sepulchral caverns are extremely rare, tumuli of the neolithic period and the early metal period are not so rare. Purely neolithic burials occur in con- siderable numbers in the region of Salins,-of some of these brief descrip- tions are given. Some tumuli of the bronze age are also referred to. Pommerol (F.)

Discusses recent finds of Teutonic remains belonging to the period of the Roman Empire on the Lippe, at Giessen, on the Lahn, on the Main, near the Bodensee, near Heidelberg, at Grossgerau, etc. Ac- cording to Dr Reinecke the Teutonic skeleton-graves, when compared with the contemporaneous provincial Roman graves, indicate by their contents " the marked difference between the Teu- tons on the right bank of the Rhine and the provincial Roman population on the left. On the right bank of the Rhine, in spite of evident Roman in- fluence, the connections are with the distant Teutonic regions of North Ger- many." Remond (M.) Douze cent mille ans d'humanite et l'age de la terre. (An- thropologie, Paris, 1901, XII, 105-107.) From mathematical calculations hav- ing reference to the inclination of the earth's axis, the author of this curious paper read at the International Con- gress of Prehistoric Anthropology and Archeology (Paris, Igoo), concludes that the earth has been habitable for 3 milliards 400 millions of years, and that man knowing how to fashion im- plements has existed on it for at least 1,200,000 years. Richardson (R. B.) The fountain of Glauce at Corinth. (Amer. Journ. Archaeol., Norwood, Mass., 19o00, Iv, 458-475.)

This article, illus- trated with 5 text-figures and accom- panied by references to the literature of the subject, treats in detail of gyne- comastia in a 17-year-old peasant,- the enlarged mammae were removed and microscopically examined. At pages 34-35 the anthropometric data of the individual in question are given in detail. Ruge (S.) Rattenberger Studien zur Volkskunde aus dem unteren Innthal in Tirol und aus Oberbaiern.

The basal words numbering more than Ioo used as place names in the Bavarian dialect give rise to more than 4000 place-names in Bavaria, or one-twelfth of all names in use. Some of the names are spelled in very many ways (Reut 22 times), and the number of Meyer (Maier, etc.) is legion. This article is illustrated with 5 figures. Rumel (A.) Obrzedy weselne we wsi Masi. (Wisla, Warszawa, 1901, xv, 7-12.) Brief account of marriage rites at Masi in the Bialostock district, gov- ernment of Grodno (Poland), with texts of songs. - Pregn' do'ynkowa. (Ibid., 13-14.) Text of harvest-song from Masi. Schoetensack (0.) A quoi servaient les ' batons de commandement ? " (Anthropologie, Paris, Igor, XII, 140- 144.) This paper, read at the Congress of IgoO, is illustrated with five text- figures and one plate. According to the author, these bdtons, of which a goodly number have been discovered in stations of the Magdalenian epoch (at Veyrier, e. g.) are nothing more than fibule or clothes-fasteners. This ingenious suggestion is emphasized by the plate, on which Dr Schoetensack has portrayed five individuals of the reindeer period in France (typed as Eskimo) wearing fibule in the fashion suggested. This idea gives a reason for the ornamentation as well as the perforation of these articles. One of the ornaments on the "batons" from Veyrier he considers to represent a string of animals' teeth. - Sur un os sculpt6 de la grotte pal6o- lithique de Thayingen. (Ibid., 145- 146.) Treats of the figure of an animal carved on a round piece of bone from the paleolithic grotto of Kesslerloch at Thayingen, Switzerland. The speci- men is interesting as an example of one-sided sculpture. Schuchardt (H.) Zum Stande unserer Kenntnis uber die Basken. (Globus, Braunschweig, I901, LXXIX, 208.) Brief but interesting note on the char- acteristics of the Basque language,--a protest against widespread misconcep- tions, many of which, repeated by modern authorities, go back to Yanguas in 1843. The " monsters " of Basque composition can easily be equaled in German. S6billot (P.) Cultes prd-mdgalithiques et prehistoriques. (Rev. d. Trad. Pop., Paris, 1901oi, xv, 65-71.) Treats of certain practices (such as girls sliding down stones or rocks, prospective parents or newly-married people rub- bing themselves against stones or rocks, running round such objects, passing the head, hand, or a child through pierced rocks) reported from various parts of France (chiefly Brittany). These practices are connected in folk- thought with marriage, fecundity, etc. The author terms them "pre-mega- lithic," because, in all probability, natural stones and rocks served these purposes before menhir or dolmens were erected. - Contes et ldgendes de la Haute-Bre- tagne.

Treats of donaria or votive-gifts from the old temple of /Esculapius in Rome, from Veii, CivitA Lavinia, CivitA Castellana, etc., and also from a sanct- uary of Diana in Nemi. These donaria are generally of reddish clay (sometimes painted) and consist of heads, half heads, eyes, ears, noses, lips, hands, feet, breasts, and organs of the abdo- men, etc. They are representations of</page><page sequence="16">PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 565 Stieda-Continued. healthy parts of the body, for the wor- shipper took care not to lay before the gods a diseased or deformed organ, lest their will might conform to that. As these clay objects are the work of ignorant artisans largely, they reveal no great anatomical knowledge. The ar- ticle is illustrated with 4 plates con- taining 28 figures. Swiney (F.) An ethical birth rate. (Westm. Rev., London, 1901, 550-553.) Discusses present birth statistics in England, and evidence of degeneracy in the youthful part of the population. Argues for making woman " not a race-producer but a race-developer." The " ethical birth rate " is four chil- dren per mother at intervals of six years between successive births. Szombathy (J.) Un crane de la race de Cro-Magnon trouve en Moravie. (An- thropologie, Paris, 190r, xII, 150- 157.) Paper read at Congress of 19oo. Describes, with three text-figures and detailed table of measurements, a cranium from Fiirst Johanns Hohle, near Lautsch in Moravia, which seems to prove the existence of the race of Cro-Magnon in central Europe in pre- historic times. The cranium, belong- ing to an individual of about 20 years of age, presents, with the exception of the high parietal bones of the skull of the old man in the Museum of Paris, all the characteristics of the Cro-Magnon type. If this find in Moravia is, as it seems to be, Quaternary, the antiquity of the race of Cro-Magnon itself is in- creased. In the discussion of the paper M. Verneau emphasized the great im- portance of this discovery. Tetzner (F.) Das bosnische und herze- gowinische Haus. (Globus, Braun- schweig, 1901, LXXIX, 220-224.) This article, with thirteen text-figures, is based upon the larger work of Dr R. Meringer on the folk-house in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This region of Eu- rope possesses houses of a remarkably primitive type,-cave-dwellings, pile- dwellings, one-roomed buildings, etc., and is of great interest to the sociolo- gist. ---- Klete und Swirne. (Ibid., 252-255.) An historical-linguistic study (with five text-figures) of the Slavonic words klete, "granary," and swirne, a large sort of klete with " girls' room " and rooms for other groups of the popu- lation. Thieullen (A.) Les pierres-figures A retouches intentionnelles A l'epoque du creusement des valles. (Anthro- pologie, Paris, 1901, XII, io8-iio.) Ab- stract of paper read at Congress of 190o. Treats of stones from the diluvian age suggesting certain animal figures which primitive man " retouched." The author certainly sees more in these specimens than the man of the drift ever could. In the discussion following, Sir John Evans and Professor Montelius expressed themselves as unconvinced, while the Abbe Breuil seemed more favorably disposed. Thiot (L.) Notice sur la station prehis- torique de Montmille, Oise. (Bull. et Mem. Soc. d'Anthrop. de Paris, Iqoo, ve s., 1, 440-446.) Describes briefly, with five text-figures, the early neolithic station of Montmille, in the department of Oise, the implements, etc., found there. The station belonged to a peo- ple acquainted with agriculture, and yet devoted to the chase. Thomas (N. W.) Horses' heads, weather-cocks, etc. (Folk-Lore, Lon- don, 1900, xI, 322-323.) Brief notes, illustrated by four plates (28 figs.) from Petersen's work on the horses' heads on the gables of German houses, with ref- erence to literature. Vauvill6 (0.) Puits neolithique pour l'extraction du silex sur Froucourt, commune, de Saint-Romain, Somme. (Bull. et Mem. Soc. d'Anthrop. de Paris, 1900oo, e S., I, 483-485.) Brief account, with one cut, of a circular " well" or excavation at Frocourt ex- amined in i899, in which were discov- ered some relics (charred wood, pottery, etc.) of the neolithic period. This " well" and perhaps other similar ex- cavations in this region seem to have been made for the extraction of flint. Verneau (R.) and de Villeneuve (L.) La grotte des Bas-Moulins. Anthro- pologie, Paris, I9I01, XII, 1-27.) De- tailed account, with two plates and six text-figures, of the finds (ossuary, etc.) of 1898 in the Bas-Moulins grotto at Monte Carlo. The explorations were made by M. l'Abbe Janin, at the ex- pense of the Prince of Monaco. The caves themselves, the burials, imple- ments, and art remains, fauna, human</page><page sequence="17">566 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 3; 1901 Verneau-Continaed. remains (portions of some 60 skeletons), are treated of. The skeletons indicate that these neolithic people were of a stature considerably lower than the average, brachycephalic generally, and not very robust. The brachycephalic crania of Bas-Moulins seem to resemble the Furfooz type No. 2, while the doli- chocephalic skull recalls the Cro-Mag- non,- this indicates a heterogeneous population probably related to the Ligurians. Vetter (A.) SchwAibische Beitrige zu Blumml und Rott, Verwendung der Pflanzen. (Ztschr. d. Ver. f, Volks- kunde, Berlin, 19go, xI, 224-226.) Gives additional examples from Swabia of the use of plants by children,-in all seventeen items. de Villeneuve (L.) See Vauvillb (0.) Volkov (T.) Dgfense du mammouth gravee du gisement paleolithique de Kiev. (Bull. et. Mim. Soc. d'Anthrop. de Paris, 1900oo, ve s., 1, 478-479.) The author expresses the opinion that the carved mammoth-tusk discovered in 1898 by KhvoYka in a paldolithic situs in Kiev is " really a specimen of art of the Magdaline type." This relic proves not only the existence of Magdalenian art, but also that since the reindeer did not yet exist in this part of Russia, art served itself with the mammoth-tusk at an age when, in France, the horns of the reindeer were employed for like purposes. Vorobjev (V. V.) 0 sootnoshenii mezhdu glavnuishimi razmerami golo- vwt i litza tchelovlka i yego rostom. (Russk. Antrop. Zhur, Moskva, i9oo, I, No. 1in, 83-99.) Gives, with three tables and six diagrams, the results of the investigation of 212 individuals from the Government of Rsjisan and 232 others (workmen) from the Government of Moscow, with respect to the relation between the chief head and face meas- urements and those of stature. The author refers in comparison to the studies of Anutchin, Erismann, Rozh- destvensky, etc., the last somewhat in detail. The most interesting general conclusion attained is that tall indivi- duals possess a head smaller in all its principal measurements, the head grow- ing more slowly than the stature in every way. The head measurements seem to increase with stature less than the measurements of the face. - Velikorussii. (Ibid., No. I, 43-82.) An anthropological sketch of the "Great Russians," with bibliography (pp. 80-82), and six text-illustrations of types. Stature, form of head and face, etc., are considered. Wateff (S.) Anthropologische Beobach- tungen an den Schtilern und Soldaten in Bulgarien. (Corrbl. d. deutschen Ges. f. Anthrop., MUnchen, i9oI, xxxII, 29-30.) Brief rdsume of the results of the investigation of the color of skin, hair, and eyes of Bulgarian school chil- dren and soldiers by the Commission of 1896, which has undertaken to secure data for a monograph on the anthro- pology of Bavaria. The statistics are grouped after the Virchow model. Al- together 209,929 children 6-io years of age, 20,810 children 10-15 years of age, 6,145 children 15-20 years of age from all grades of the schools (total 236,884 out of 258,368 school-children in all), and 31,469 (out of 35,000 in all) soldiers 20-25 years of age, were examined. Besides this the army-physicians took detailed anthropological measurements of 5,000 soldiers. Of the total number of children and soldiers examined 9.12% were blond, 47.39% brunette, and 43.49% of mixed type; the highest percentage of any one characteristic was white skin 64.74 (next to this brown eyes 59.76), the lowest, red hair o.o8 (next to this green eyes 0.67). The highest percent- age of blonds for five-year periods of age was 9.94 at 6-io years, the low- est 4.65 at 15-20 years; of brunettes 6o.97 at 15-20 years, and 45.98 at 6- io years; of the mixed type 45.47 at 20-25 years, and 34.38 at 15-20 years.

Discusses, with two text- figures, an earthen pot, noteworthy on account of having been made, appa- rently, without a lathe, and containing evidence of burial by incineration. If the remains are really Slavonic, the custom was probably borrowed from the surrounding Teutonic population. Willame (G.) Les festins du tir de l'oiseau A Nivelles, Brabant.

Soc. d' An- throp. de Paris, I9oo, ve s., I, 451-456.) Brief rdsumi of recent investigations in the Dniester and Dnieper regions in Russia, where remains of the premy- cenian or iEgean culture have been found,-some 30 places in all have been noted (Horodnica, Bilcze Zlote, the cave of Werteba, Zielencze,- a neo- lithic village,-etc.) Zielencze, the author thinks, is "synchronous with the oldest AEgean civilization." The painted pottery of the Dniester-- Dnieper region "proves indisputably the existence of commercial relations (maritime, fluvial) between that part of the world and the eastern Mediter- ranean, at an epoch when its indigenous population were still in the stone age and without intercourse with the more civilized peoples of Asia and Europe." - Cranes de kourganes prdhistoriques, scythiques, drewlanes et polanes. (Ibid., 456-465.) Resumis, after Talko- Hryncenicz, the prehistoric and proto- historic craniology of the lower Dnie- per region,-the people of the kourgans of the Ukraine. The measurements relate to 150 crania belonging to differ- ent periods. The author considers that these investigations confirm his own studies in virtue of which he recognized the dolichocephalic skulls as belonging to the oldest population, while the brachycephalic minority represented a later, foreign element, coincident with the arrival of metals, etc. The Drew- lanes (" forest people") and Polanes (" plains peoples ") were either Slavonic peoples or peoples who were Slavoni- cized at a very early period. - Le feu sacrd et le culte du foyerchez les Slaves contemporains.

S., 3, 1901 Girard (H.) Yakomas et Bougous, an- thropophages du Haut-Oubanghi. (Anthropologie, Paris, 190o, XII, 51- 92.) This interesting paper contains valuable anthropometric (3 pages of measurements of 30 Yakomas and 4 Bougous, besides data in text) and eth- nographical (including a Yakoma vo- cabulary of some 150 words) details concerning the Yakomas and Bugus, two little-known negro peoples of the Upper Ubanghi, a tributary of the Congo from the northeast. The Yako- mas appear to be small-statured, mesati- cephalic (rather brachycephalic), the Bugus rather tall and dolichocephalic. The relations between stature and ce- phalic index among the Yakomas indi- cate a mixture of races, a duality of cephalic index among these small ne- groes, as Verneau maintained. Both tribes are cannibals, the custom being largely due, Dr Girard thinks, to glut- tony. They are not so grossly fetish- istic as the Coast negroes. In their mimic dances the sexes do not mingle. Adultery is said to be rare. These negroes are gay, affable, and easy to govern if the right way be taken. Gorilla (Der) im Kamerungebiete. (Globus, Braunschweig, 901, LXXIX, 147-148.) Brief description, with meas- urements and photograph, of the largest gorilla hitherto discovered (killed by H. Paschen in April 9goo), and now in the Umlauff Museum in Hamburg. The height of the skeleton was 165 cm. (arm-stretch 280 cm.), and the cranial capacity 56.2 ccm. Hartmann (A.) Der G6ttersitz Nan- ganga und seine Zerstorung. (Ibid., 201-202.)

This account of the Uha coun- try in German East Africa, contains notes on the Waha, a Bantu people, the chief Mtale and his villages, the king- dom of Kihitia, etc. von Luschan (F.) Zur anthropologi- schen Stellung der alten Agypter. (Ibid., 196-200.) Discusses, with io text-figures, some aspects of compara- tive Egyptology. The oldest statues (from Negadeh, recently described by Naville) have a penis-cover like that of the Mobo in northern Togo, rather than the nutschi of the Kaffirs. Dr von Luschan does not favor Naville's new attempt to connect the ancient Egyp- tians with the Bantu tribes, holding to the theory of Semitic relationship, as evidenced by language. de Mortillet (A.) La circoncision en Tunisie. (Bull. et Memr. Soc. d'An- throp. de Paris, 900oo, e s., I, 538- 543.) Describes (with two figures), after Dr A. Loir, the practice of cir- cumcision among the Jews and Mussul- mans of Tunis. With the two peoples, method, rite, ceremonial, etc., are dif- ferent, and while the former circumcise at eight days after birth, the latter do so only at about the sixth year (except that when the elder brother is circum- cised, all his brothers two years of age or over have to submit to the operation). Suction of the wound still survives among the Tunisian Jews, but has been abandoned in France and England, and is prohibited in Germany. Its aboli- tion is now being sought in Tunis.</page><page sequence="20">PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 569 Miiller (P. F.) Folkloristische Ewhe- texte, G&amp;-Dialekt.

Worthy of note is the custom of giving away the first fruits of one's skill in manufacture, farming, hunting, fishing, etc. In this part of the world when a man becomes drunk, " he sticks a leaf in his hair to show it, and then no notice is taken of any stupid or insulting remark he may make, or any business transactions he may enter upon."

A valuable study, with abundant refer- ences to the modern literature of the subject, of the ethnology of the Pamir and the adjoining regions, after the data in ancient Chinese annals. The oldest inhabitants of the region of Pamir and Kashgar seem to have been a people closely related to the Tibetans, and they continued to possess it until about the first century B.C. Barth (A.)

Sculpture, archi- tecture, inscriptions (Greek, Latin Syriac, Hebrew, Palmyraean, Naba- taean, Safartic, Kufic,-Arabic,-) are referred to. Some of the grafiti found are of unusual importance. The full results of the expedition will shortly be published. The material is to be stored at Princeton University.</page><page sequence="21">570 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 3, 1901 Carus (P.) Seven. (Open Court, Chi- cago, 1901, xv, 335-340.) First part of an illustrated discussion of the sacred number seven in relation to the religion and mythology of Chaldea, Egypt, Pal- estine, etc. - The Babylonian and Hebrew views of man's fate after death. (Ibid, 346- 366.) General account with numerous citations from Hebrew and Babylonian writings and records. The author at- tributes the absence of a cult of immor- tality in the Old Testament to the redactors of the Hebrew canon, who, "since the belief in immortality, as expressed in the Assyrio-Babylonian legends, cannot easily be extracted from the Babylonian religion without retain- ing at the same time a good deal of the mythological elements, preferred to omit the whole and embraced an atti- tude of positive unbelief rather than defile the Scriptures with paganism." Crowfoot (J. W.) Survivals among the Kappadokian Kizilbash. (Journ. An- throp. Inst., Lond., I9oo, xxx, 305- 330.) This paper, accompanied by a map, two plates of portraits, and tables of cephalic measurements of 15 sub- jects, treats of the Bektash or Kizilbash (" Red Heads ") of two villages in the province of Angora, a pre-Osmanli people, whose religion and marriage customs in particular show many sur- vivals from the pre-Islamic period. Indeed Kappadokia now contains many fragments of a pre-Islamic civilization ; these people were sui generis before the time of Alexander, and Greek, Per- sian, and Islamic culture have all failed to change them completely. Evans (A. J.) Myceneean Cyprus as il- lustrated in the British Museum excava- tions. (Jour. Anthrop. Inst., Lond., 1900, XXX, 199-220.) This paper, il- lustrated with fourteen text figures, deals with the results of the Turner Bequest excavation in Cyprus, which have made possible for the first time "a clear insight into a distinct and highly important phase of the insular civilization." According to the author the impress of the ,Egean element is so strong " that we find ourselves in presence not of sporadic influences or isolated importations of objects, but of a distinct period in the insular civiliza- tion to which the name Cypro-Myce- naean must henceforward be given." In Cyprus the Mycenaean civilization survives to a later period than in Greece proper. Frederichsen (M.) Professor Futterers Reise durch Asien. (Globus, Braun- schweig, 1901, LXXIX, 188-194.) This article, illustrated with eight text fig- ures, contains some notes (pp. 192- 194) on the Tangut, a people of north- eastern Tibet,-the Amdo, as they call themselves, Tangut being their Mongol name. Furness (W. H.) See Hiller (H. M.) Gardiner (J. S.) The natives of the Maldives. (Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc., I9oo-I9or, xI, 18-21.) Brief geographical - ethnographical sketch. The author holds that the Singhalese and the natives of the Maldives " seem to have been the result of a dichotomous branching of a common stem, one divi- sion perhaps travelling along the west coast of Hindustan to Ceylon and the other sailing through the Laccadives to the Maldives,"-the Maldivian tongue appears to be related to ancient Singha- lese. In historical times there has been "comparatively little admixture of races" in the Maldives. The people of the northern atolls " approximate closely to the Mahommedans of the south-west of the Peninsula"; in the central group Caucasian, Malay, and Negro elements are recognizable; in other parts, the people "very closely resemble village Singhalese." At the beginning of the thirteenth century the Maldives are said to have been con- verted to Islam, but both Christianity and Buddhism have also left traces. The Maldivians " have no stories of the origin of their race nor islands." An outrigged boat, found on one of the islands, " is now only used by the chil- dren as a toy, but formerly it was in common use for inter-atoll voyages." The term faranje, now applied to all western peoples, keeps green the mem- ory of the French. The Maldivian language enjoys the honor of furnishing English with the word atoll. Accord- ing to Mr Gardiner atolu in Maldivian signifies " province," and " these prov- inces are often conterminous with the atolls, whence arose this term." Hiller (H. M.) and Furness (W. H.) Notes of a trip to the Veddahs of Cey- lon. (Bull. Free Mus. of Sci. and</page><page sequence="22">PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 571 Hiller and Furness- Continued. Art, Phila., igoI, III, 69-87.) Brief account, illustrated with thirteen plates of a flying visit to the aborigines of the Bintenne region of the Badulla-Nil- galla hills and a part of the east coast of the island,--" village Veddahs" and "rock Veddahs." The photographs rather belie the statement on page 78, " the most impressive thing about them was their inhuman apathy and lack of interest, a peculiarity of the lowest types of man." The features of the Veddahs, the authors thought, " are decidedly more Hindoo than Negroid or Mongoloid." Brief notes on physi- cal characteristics, food, clothing, prim-, itive industries, bows and arrows, fire-making, religion, dancing, are given. There are also some notes on the Singhalese, whose votive offerings at the time of the harvest festival are represented in one of the plates. The figure of a village Veddah boy opposite page 82 is significant, while the family group on plate 14 is of great interest. It is a curious fact that these primitive people, while acquainted with the fire- drill, also use matches. There are other instances of the effect of contact with civilization, such as the Buddhist charm-book in the house of the chief at Makulugulla, etc. Ivanowski (A.) Yezidl. (Russk. An. throp. Zhur., Moskva, 1900oo, I, No. III, 100-103.) A brief anthropological sketch (after Gorostchenko, etc.) of the Yezidis, a people of Kurdistan, who are probably Kurds, in spite of their pres- ent religious tenets. On page roI are given the average measuremerts of seven children (Io-II years) and 33 adults (16-65 years), belonging to the Government of Eriwan. Although the Yezidis speak a Kurdish dialect, they have a theocracy and a caste system, unknown to the Kurds proper. They also deform the head of the new-born child by binding. They are mesoce- phalic with an average stature of 1633 mm. ten Kate (H.) Eine japanische Rache- puppe. (Globus, Braunschweig, 19go, LXXIX, IO9-IIO.) Brief note, with figure, on a " witch doll" from Japan. Laufer (B.) Felszeichnungen vom Us- suri. (Ibid., 69-72.) Treats, with fifteen figures, of the petroglyphs on the banks of the Ussuri, a tributary of the Amur, of which an account was given in 1896 by their discoverer, Lieut. Alftan, in comparison with those dis- covered by the author on the Amur (see American Anthropologist, 1899, N. S., I, 746-750). Marnet (M.) Les castes dans l'Inde. (Bull. Soc. Amis d. Sci. et Arts de Rochechouart, 1900oo, x, 73-77.) First part of general discussion. Author holds that a caste-system or the begin- nings of one can be noted among all peoples of Aryan stock. Martin (W. A. P.) Poetry of the Chi- nese. (N. Am. Review, N. Y., 19oI, CLXXII, 853-862.) General account, with specimens in English rendering. Myres (J. L.) A primitive figurine from Adalia. (Jour. Anthrop. Inst., Lond., I9oo, xxx, 25T-256. Describes (with plate) a female figure in black clay, closely resembling that of the earliest Hissarlik pottery, obtained in I9oo from Adalia in Asia Minor. The posi- tion of the figure is half sitting, half kneeling, with steatopygia. It may be compared with the " temple boy " atti- tude of votive sculptures on Cypriote sanctuary sites. The author assigns the specimen " close to the boundary between the latest Neolithic and the earliest Metallic Age," and concludes that it resembles closely the relics of "the phase of culture represented by the lowest settlement of Hissarlik. Nikolskj (D. P.) 0 tchuktchach~i Ko- lymskago okruga. (Russk. Antrop. Zhur., Moskva, Igoo, I, No. II, 23-29.) brief account, after Bogoras, of the Tchukchi of the region of Kolymsk. See American Anthropologist, I901, N. s., II, 8o-io8. Ozaki (Y.) Yubana, die Heisswasser- probe in Japan. (Globus, Braun- schweig, I9go, LXXIX, 128-131.) Brief account, illustrated with eight text- figures, of the half-yearly " Shinto miracle," the Yubana, or "hot-water ordeal," as performed in the Houshi Shinshukyo temple in the Kanda dis- trict of Tokio. The author inclines to the belief that " suggestion and thick skin " count for much in this ordeal.

S., 3, 1901 Pelletier-Continued. squelettes japonais. (Bull. et Mdm. Soc. d'Anthrop de Paris, 1900, ve s., I, 514-529.) Gives, with detailed sta- tistics, the results of observation of 55 skeletons (from Set tsu, Isumi, Izi Jamachiri) belonging to the Stenackers collection. Cranio-femoral, cranio- mandibular, cranio-cerebral (89 skulls), humero-femoral, cnemo-crural indices, weight of crania, long-bones, etc., are considered, besides cranial capacity. Among other interesting facts the fol- lowing are brought out: In skeletal development the Japanese woman is nearer the Japanese man than the two sexes of Europeans are to each other; for both sexes the cerebro-mandibular index is higher with Japanese ; with the Japanese the right humerus is hardly heavier than the left; the cranial ca- pacity of Japanese women is rather high, as is also the weight of the female fe- mur. Some comparisons of the condi- tion of the adolescential with the adult skeleton are also given. Regnault (F.) Les terres-cuites de Smyrne. (Ibid., 467-477.) Brief ac- count, with 21 text-figures, of a col- lection of terra-cottas (statuettes) from the ruins of Smyrna, largely house or- naments or vase-attachments, amulets, etc., and embracing a great variety of types. These interesting statuettes represent the Coroplasts of Smyrna,and besides normal attitudes and forms the grotesque and the pathological occur quite numerously. Some of the physi- ognomic types (a Chinaman; facial expression of pleasure, pain, etc.; facial deformations, cranial peculiarities and deformations,heads of idiots and degen- erates) are evidently quite true to life. Representations of hunchbacks, preg- nant women, gnomes, etc., are also found, while the figures of the sexual characteristics are often well executed. It must be remembered that Galen began his medical career in the schools of Smyrna. Seland (N.) K' antropologil zapadno- sibirskago krest' yanina. (Russk. An- trop. Zhur., Moskva, 1900oo, I, No. iii, 75-82.) Gives, with two tables, the results of the measurements (stature, chest-girth, head, strength of right hand) of 241 soldiers (from Tobolsk, Tomsk, Perm, Semiretchje, Orenburg) at Verniye in Turkestan, where the author is resident as a physician. The type of the West-Siberian peasants is Slavonic, and eyelids, cheek-bones, and lips of the Mongolic type were not met with. The head-measurements are treated more in detail. The average pressure-strength (right hand) of 35 individuals from Tobolsk, 60o from Tomsk, 49 from Perm, 47 from Semi- retchje, and 50 from Orenburg was 47.4, 49.2, 47.7, 49.2, 48.6 respectively, that of 23 women whose measurements are also given being 32. The average stature of the women is 1581 mm., as compared with 1683, 1689, 1667, 1694, 1636 for the five groups of men. Stadling (J.) The people at the top of the world. (Century, N. Y., 190o, LXI, 511-520, 754-762.) This account of a search for Andree in Siberia con- tains notes on the natives on the Tai- mur, Lena, etc.,-shamans, property, marriage customs. Stenz (P.) Die Gesellschaft "vom gros- sen Messer," Boxer. (Globus, Braun- schweig, 1901, LXXIX, 9-12.) Brief account (with reproduction of a page in colors from the " Book of Prophecy") of the now famous society of "Boxers." The author is a Catholic missionary, and the paper is of more than passing interest. Sternberg (L.) Ueber die Giljaken. (Verh. d. Berl. Ges. f. Anthrop., IgoI, 36-39.) Brief account of observations during several years' residence among the Giliaks of the Amur. The author considers the Giliaks an isolated people (by language, customs, etc.) with possi- bly American affinities,--they are cer- tainly of northern origin. They seem to be "almost one with the Aleuts." Among the 4,500 Giliaks, there exist two principal dialects, divided into five or six lesser ones. The physical feat- ures of these people have changed more than their mental characteristics. Beneath a somewhat stolid face the Giliaks hide a rather merry and sociable nature,-their women are even acquaint- ed with coquetry. Talko-Gryntzevitsch (Y. D.) Drevnie obitateli Tzentral'noi Azii. (Russk. Antrop. Zhur.,Moskva, 19oo, I, No. II, I-IT.) A brief ethnological sketch of the ancient peoples of central Asia, Turko-Tatars and Mongols, who came into contact with Shamanism, Islam, Buddhism, Christianity, and underwent</page><page sequence="24">PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 573 Talko-Gryntzevitsch--Continued. not only physical but also linguistic intermixture, so that now one finds even a Turkic people with Mongolian speech and Hindu religion. The evi- dence cited by the author comes from the investigations of burial-places and the accounts in Chinese annals. Venkataswami (M. N.). Hindu notes. (Folk-Lore, London, 1900oo, xI, 218- 219.) Brief items about monkeys, childhood marriage. Zaborowski (M.) Mensurations des Tonkinois. Les dolichocephales Chi- noisdel' Indo-Chine. CrAnes Tonkinois et Annamites. (Bull. et Mem. Soc. d' Anthrop. de Paris, 1900, ve s., I, 319- 328.) After a brief resum6 of the work and opinions of Girard (who took meas- urements of some 2,000 subjects), Eitel (studies of the Hakkas), Piton, etc., and some ethnographic details, the author gives the measurements of an old Tonkinese skull, those of the skull of an Annamese mandarin from Tonkin after Neis, of three Annamese after Mondiere, one after Vinson, and one after d'Enjoy. It has been thought that there is in China an ancient Eski- mo element, like the Tungus, whose analogues, however, are to be sought among the ancient people of the Baikal region, or the Turko-Tatars, rather than among the Eskimo. There is considerable evidence now to indicate a prevailing dolichocephaly for a large part of the ancient population of China. The Annamites show traces of mixture with the dolichocephalic Mois, whom they dispossessed, and there is evidence also of the presence of a sub-Caucasian type in this region. - La Chine et les chinois. (Ibid. 544-560.) This paper has appeared also in the Revue Scientifique 1901, 4S s., xv, 161-7o0. See American Anthropologist, 1901, N. S. III, 189. Zachariae (T.) Zu Goethe's Pariale- gende. (Ztschr. d. Ver. f. Volkskunde, Berlin, go901, xI, 186-192.) A discus- sion,with bibliographical references, of Goethe's Paria-legend poem, which is based upon the story of Marlatale, a goddess of southern India. Goethe became acquainted with the legend from Sonnerat's book of Oriental trav- els published in 1783 in German. INDONESIA, AUSTRALASIA, POLY- NESIA. Blumentritt (F.) List of the native tribes of the Philippines and of the languages spoken by them. (Ann. Rep. Smith- son. Inst., Washington, 1899 [iqoi], 527-547.) Translated (with introduc- tion and notes) by Prof. O. T. Mason from the Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft fir Erdkunde zu Berlin for 189o. The article is illustrated with a colored map reproduced from the Boletin de la Sociedad Geografica de Madrid for 1890 and with ten plates representing natives of the islands from the Hilder collection of the Bureau of American Ethnology. Bouchal (L.) Bezoarsteine in Indonesien. (Mitth. d. Anthrop. Ges. in Wien, 1900, xxx, N. F. X, 179-180.) Brief references, with etymologies of native names, to bezoar-stones among Indone- sian peoples. The term uldwu or kuldu, with its connections, is cited from the dictionary of the Macassar language. Some kuldus are believed to keep old men alive, others to be of great virtue for the coitus. The list of kuldu sub- stances (not of all which can be called bezoars) is quite long. - Noch einige Belegstellen fUr Geo- phagie in Indonesien. (Ibid., i8o-181.) Notes the occurrence of geophagy or earth-eating in New Caledonia, Nusa- laut, Saparua, Ambona, Java, and Su- matra. Among the names for edible earth in Malay languages are batu, .joan, ampo, (tano) bange, etc. In small quantities this earth seems to have me- dicinal or even nutritive properties, especially with women and children. Chamberlain (A. F.) Philippine stud- ies. Iv. Father Kamel and his writings. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 1901, xxlII, 203-206.) Notes on the papers about the Philippines (fauna, flora, mon- strosities, etc.) of Father G. J. Camel, a Jesuit from Moravia, resident in the archipelago in the latter part of the seventeenth century. After him the botanical genus Camellia is named. Erdweg (J.) Ein Besuch bei den Var6pu.

The stately forms of both men and women distinguish them from their neighbors. Foy (W.) Zur Ethnographie von Neu- Pommern. (Ibid., 47.) Brief resume of recent literature. Fraser (J.) Some Indian words of re- lationship used by the Australian tribes. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 1901, XXIII, 171-178.) In this second section of his paper the author discusses the philologi- cal, anthropological, and ethnological bearings of his theory of the existence of Indian (Hindustan) relationship- words in the speech of certain Australian aborigines, and that " a simple mono- syllable ka, having a very simple mean- ing, viz.: 'with,' has spread itself from the banks of the Tiber to Samoa and Japan in the far east, and has given birth to very many derivatives by a simple modification of its original form or by simple accretions." According to Dr Fraser the Malays are " not the progenitors of the Polynesians, much less of the Australians." Haddon (A. C.) A classification of the stone clubs of British New Guinea. (Journ. Anthrop. Inst., Lond., Igoo, xxx, 221-250.) In order of simplicity Prof. Haddon classifies: Natural (or only slightly worked), ring, ball, ovoid, disc, flat (with notched edges), knobbed, pickaxe, and star-clubs. Of the disc and star and knobbed (particularly) there are many varieties. The study is based on the Ballentine collection at Pt. Moresby. The descriptive portion of the paper is followed by notes on the geographical distribution of stone clubs in New Guinea, some half dozen areas being distinguished. Two sketch maps and four plates (figuring 107 clubs) accompany this valuable article. Up the Mambare river, stone clubs have been imitated in pottery. Moir (J. P.) Stone implements from Tasmania. (Journ. Anthrop. Inst., Lond., 1900, xxx, 257-262.) This brief paper, accompanied by two plates (nineteen figures), consists of extracts from a letter relating to stone imple- ments found in various parts of Tasma- nia. According to Mr Moir, gravers, scrapers, and skinners occur in about equal proportions, while axes are much fewer, and large axes very few. The author has carefully examined thou- sands of implements, and remarks the absence of stones made to fit or use in a club or handle,-" every implement is made to fit the hand." Mason (0. T.) See: Blumentritt (F.), Virchow (R.) Kramer (A.) Der Purgierfisch der Gil- bertinseln. (Globus, Braunschweig, 1901, LXXIX, 181-183.) This article interests the anthropologist by reason of the peculiar fishhook figured on page 182. Parkinson (R.) Die Einwohner der Insel St. Matthias, Bismarck-Archipel. (Globus, Braunschweig, 1901, LXXIX, 229-233.) Brief ethnological sketch,- physical characteristics, dress and orna- ment, houses and utensils, food, indus- tries, weapons (figures of 12 spears are given). The spears seem to be the highest artistic products of the natives, who possess no iron. Pleyte (C. M.) Die Mentawei-Inseln und ihre Bewohner. (Ibid., 1-7, 24- 32.) This well-illustrated (io cuts from photos) article deals with the geography and ethnography of the Mentawei islands off the west coast of Sumatra, whose inhabitants are Malayo-Polynesi- ans of a rather individual type. Among the topics briefly discussed are: Le- gends, names, language, food, dress and ornament, houses, hunting and fishing, agriculture, war, birth, teeth- filing, tattooing, wooing and marriage, death and burial, religion, cultus, priests, punin (tabu), oracles, adminis- tration, law and crime, music and dance, chronology, etc. The absence of betel- chewing and the existence of fishing with the bow and arrow deserve men- tion here. Real war also is unknown, only treacherous surprises of the Malay sort. The archery of these people is good, and they use Morse's secondary release. A sub-form of the couvade appears to prevail. Tattooing is a pre- requisite for marriage,-women are less tattooed than men. Monogamy is the general practice; the chiefs, however, have sometimes several wives. For mourning the relatives leave off (in case of children for five months, for widows</page><page sequence="26">PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 575 Pleyte-Continued. till re-marriage) their ornaments, flow- ers, etc. Religion is chiefly soul-lore. There are two souls (brain, flesh), a sensitive and a vegetative one, both of which reconstitute the man in the next world. There are also evil spirits or anitu, and good spirits, or bulungan. Both sexes may be priests. Punin, or tabu, is an integral part of the cultus. The four crimes are: Murder, poison- ing, theft, and adultery, of which the first two are punished with death, which follows for the third only after three times disregarded warning. The adul- terer can be slain by the injured party. Regnault (F.) La physionomie dans 1'art sauvage. (La Nature, Paris, 1901, 408-41o.) Discusses, with four figures of Polynesian war-gods, the efforts of savage peoples to render in art the hu- man face. The author holds that primi- tive peoples have succeeded better than is commonly believed in representing the human physiognomy. Stokes (J. F. G.) The mat-sails of the Pacific. (Occas. Papers, B. P. Bishop Mus., Honolulu, 1900oo, I, 25-32.) Gen- eral account, with one plate showing board for mat-weaving, of the manu- facture and use of mat-sails among the islanders of the Pacific. Mats were used for sails because tapa or bark cloth, the only other available material, was not durable enough. The Pacific sails are compared with those of eastern Asia, and the fact noted that " the Chi- nese sail has retained its shape since the first visit of the Western civilizer, until very modern times." The natives of the Marquesas islands seem to have had better sails when Mendana visited them in 1595 than in Dalrymple's time two centuries later. Imitations of European sails also occur. Virchow (R.) The peopling of the Philippines. (Ann. Rep. Smithson. Inst., Washington, 1899 [I9goi, 509- 529.) Translated (with notes) by Prof. O. T. Mason from the Sitzungsberichte der K6niglich-Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin for I897. Illustrated with two plates showing three skulls. The same paper appears, without the illustrations, in the Popular Science Monthly, 1901, LIX, 257-265; 351-360. From the cave-skulls Prof. Virchow argues for "a very old, if not autochthonous, prehistoric layer of population "-pre-Malay. Walcott (A. M.) Ray-skin rasps. (Oc- cas. Pap., B. P. Bishop Mus., Honolulu, 1900, I, 32-33.) Brief account, with figures of the ray-skin rasps (now sub- stituted largely by steel) more or less common throughout the islands of the Pacific. The Gilbert islanders, e.g., had various grades of them for so shap- ing the edges of the boards of their canoes that when sewed together they would be water-tight. Of these rasps we learn " their effectiveness when new is quite as great as that of those brought by the white man." Walkley (C. S.) Philippine funerals.

This valuable article translated from the Marine- Rundschau (Berlin) for 1898, is illustrated with fifteen plates from U. S. National Museum and other collections. AMERICA Boyle (D.) The paganism of the civil- ized Iroquois of Ontario. (Journ. An- throp. Inst., Lond., 19oo, xxx, 263- 274.) A brief account of the pagan Iroquois (Iooo in number) of Grand River reserve, Ontario,-" a condition of society in which paganism openly professed and practiced has existed side by side with Christianity for nearly three hundred years." The paganism of these Iroquois has been modified very little by their Christian brethren. Conservatism has preserved, with loss of origin and meaning, " in almost their pristine simplicity and crudity, the mu- sic, the songs, the dances, the speeches, and the ceremonies of old." More about these interesting people may be read in Mr Boyle's Archaeological Re- port for 1898, where many valuable de- tails, fully illustrated, are given. Brosius (S. M.)

Digger Indian legends. (Land of Sunshine, Los Angeles, 19Ol, XIV, 310-314, 397-402.) These last two sections of Mr Burns' paper record "the love-making of Quatuk (Coyote)," "the Rabbit and the Toad," and " the legend of Edoochme." The tale of how Coyote took a fog for the ocean and tried to swim it " is a general fa- vorite." In the second tale the Rabbit gets the Toad to jump into the fire and get burned,-the Toad had killed the Rabbit's love, the little green Frog. The third tale is of an abandoned child, who performed wonderful deeds. He lies now turned (by himself) into stone in the bed of Salmon river, " with his arms and legs uplifted in arches." And today "the Indian boy who can swim through without touching will never be harmed by a grizzly." Culin (S.) A summer trip among the western Indians. (Bull. Free Mus. of Sci. and Art, Phila., 190o, III, 1-22, 88-122, 143-175.) This interesting pa- per, illustrated with 27 excellent plates, gives details of ethnographic and ethno- logic sort obtained during a visit in the summer of 19oo to the Sacs and Foxes of Iowa, the Shoshoni and Arapaho of Wyoming, the Bannocks of Idaho, the Utes of Utah, the Piutes of Nevada, the Hupa of California, the Makah and Yakima of Washington, the Umatilla of Oregon, the Siouan Indians of Montana and North Dakota. Mr Culin notes the inroads of white civilization on the Indians and the progressive abandon- ment of primitive customs and indus- tries. Many items of great anthropologi- cal and folk-lore interest are contained in these pages,-at pages 20-22 are " Notes on the Shoshoni and Arapaho " by Rev. John Roberts. The pictures of Wa-pa-lete-hihi, the Umatilla (oppo- site page 166), and of the Umatilla In- dian girl (opposite page 164) are well worth examining. If the brush does not render the Indian at his best, the camera may. Drew (C. A.) Signs of degeneracy and types of the criminal insane. (Amer. Journ. Insan., Baltimore, 1901, LVII 689-698.)

Workman, Hampton, Va., 1901, xxx, 390-395.) Prof. Dubois approaches the problem by a study of the Negro's "African past," giving (with illustrations) a brief account of houses and huts in the Old World negro lands. Durham (J. S.) Race traits and general culture. (Ibid., 302-305.) Author's thesis is: " Man in his relationship [historical] is, then, the beginning and end of this general culture; and the special culture has as its beginning and end the Negro in his relationships to the extent that the race experience in this country has been peculiar." The object of Negro education is "the eradication of those undesirable traits which have been the result of race ex- perience, and the conservation of those traits which are desirable."

(Psychol. Rev., N. Y., VIII, 396-402.) Discusses the importance of the facts revealed by Mr Rivers in his paper on "The color-vision of the Eskimo." The acute color-consciousness of the Labra- dor Eskimo has revealed to them that "red, yellow, green, and blue (and no other colors) are of a unitary char- acter," a very remarkable " coincidence of scientific color scheme with an im- personal character of color experience."

Treats of infancy, travel, schooling of Sioux children of the Rosebud agency, Guevara (T.) Historia de la civilizacion de Araucania. (Anales de la Univ., Santiago de Chile, I9oI, cvIII, 3-82.) This section of Guevara's history of the subjection of Araucania deals with the wars with the Indians from 1561 to 1598, including the second general rising of I594-1595. During the battles of this period the Indians showed that they had made pro- gress in the art of fortification and had studied well the tactics of the Spaniards. The number of horses used by them increased, and they began to exhibit skill in their management. A brief account of the military tactics of the Indians is given at pages 69-72. Dr Guevara points out the imitation of Spanish tactics, the use of cavalry, armor copied from that of the Euro- peans, etc. They also manifested moral progress and some augmentation of prescience. To this period belongs Captain Fernando Alvarez de Toledo's Purdn Inddmito, one of the historical poems of the conquest. Halbert (H. S.) The derivation of Mo- bile and Alabama. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 1901, xxIII, 179.) According to the author the name Mobile repre. sents an archaic form (mowelik or mobelih) of the Choctaw moelih mean- ing "rowers" or "paddlers." Ala- bama, he thinks, comes from the Choctaw alba, "vegetation (of the lesser sort)," amo, "to gather," refer- ring to the d/frichement practised by the Indians. This etymology of Alabama does not differ in sense from that sug- gested by Dr A. S. Gatschet in 1888 in his "Migration Legend of the Creeks," -alba ayalmu " cleared thicket." Harsha (W. J.) The pride of the In- dian. (South. Workman, Hampton, Va., Igor, xxx, 264-268.) Author holds that it may be said of the Indian, " one main trait, if not the very central and moving trait, of his character is pride." This is an obstacle to convert- ing and civilizing him, but wisely used, could lead him to higher and nobler things. Holmes (W. H.)

Katzer (F.) Zur Ethnographie des Rio Tapaj6s. (Globus, Braunschweig, 1901o, LXXIX, 37-41.) This article, illustrated with 13 figures (implements, head-trophies, face-tattooing), treats of the Mauhes, Mundurukis,and 'Apiakis, tribes on the Tapaj6s, in Brazil. A brief word-list from the Mauhd tongue and a few words of the Apiakas are given, and the author makes some cor- rections of Coudreau's linguistic ma- terial from this region. Some of the stone implements are described in de- tail. Certain polished implements are now made by the Munduruktis but " only as ornaments and children's toys," and not for use, for which pur- poses similar objects of the European stone age were doubtless also made. Krause (E.) Die Schraube, eine Eskimo- Erfindung? (Ibid., 8-9.)

States results of investigations in six non- reservation boarding schools in Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Montana, and Colorado, where the pupils are "nearest to white children in culture, experience, and general knowledge of life," and where also they " speak English, are thoroughly trained in the ways of civiliz- ation, and look at life from the civilized standpoint." The statistics relate to 975 boys and 658 girls between the ages of 4 and 26. Naturally enough, it is found that "white children have the larger field of vision and higher am- bitions," since these are largely school- suggested. Like white children, it is the girls who vary most. McGee (W J) The old Yuma trail. Nat. Geogr. Mag., Washington, 19or, XII, 103-1o7, 129-143.) An interesting account, with 7 illustrations and map of the old Yuma trail in southern Arizona, its history, etc. The activity of the Amerinds in this region is noted. Maclean (J.) Blackfoot amusements. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 1901, XXIII, 163-169.) A general account of the amusement-side of Blackfoot Indian life, songs, " teas," dances, gambling, foot-races, smoking, guessing-games, throwing games, swimming, etc. The texts (Blackfoot and English) of three brief songs (war, love, divorce) are given. According to an interpreter, "there existed an historical song, similar to the song of Hiawatha as recorded in " The Iroquois Book of Rites," but the only Indian who knew it is dead. The " tea feasts" are now quite a factor in Indian social life. Since the advent of the whites the great Buffalo dance has become "a begging dance." Like tea, cards for gaming were quickly adopted by the Blackfeet. The " smoke talk" was all-embracing and the topics in- numerable. The game of "throwing the wheel," the Indians claim, was taught them by Napio, "the Old Man of the Mountains." The Blackfeet swim dog fashion. Meeker (L. L.) Ogalala games. (Bull. Free Mus. of Sci. and Art, Phila., Io0r, III, 23-46.) This article, illustrated with 26 text-figures, and accompanied by a vocabulary of Indian technical terms, treats of the games of Ogalala Indians of Pine Ridge reservation, " an isolated camp of full blood Indians." Men's games (great hoop, elk, buckskin hoop, moccasin), women's games (shinny, plumstone, deer-bone), boys' games (grizzly bear, wood shinny, whip top, etc.), girls' games, and play activities of a miscellaneous sort are briefly described. At pages 36-39 is an account of " games and sports of the boys and girls of an Ogalala camp in the summer of rgoo, played for the writer's benefit." Pages 39-44 are oc- cupied by a descriptive catalogue of the objects and implements used in these various games. Remarkable are the absence of whistling and the presence of " stopping the circulation in the hand" as an amusement. Peabody (C.) The so-called "plum- mets." (Bull. Free Mus. of Sci. and</page><page sequence="30">PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 579 Peabody--Continued. Art, Phila., 1901, III, 125-142.) In this interesting article, illustrated with 9 plates and 2 figures in the text, the author discusses the various theories concerning the use of the prehistoric objects known as " plummets," in con- nection with fishing, the chase and war- fare, textile work, hitting and grinding, ornament, superstition, drum-rattles, real plummets, game stones, phallic objects,-all of these uses have been suggested by one investigator or an- other. The author's conclusion is: "All things considered, many of the New England 'plummets' were origi- nally sinkers, while some of the larger ones were used as pestles and some of the smaller ones as bolas; many of the Florida specimens were probably sink- ers, while the smaller and better worked ones were used as ornaments. The California specimens have been proved to be, many of them at least, charm stones. The beautifully worked and symmetrical specimens from the central civilization were very likely, in the ab- sence of any better theory, wearing weights. Other uses in connection with fishing, the chase, and domestic pursuits, may have been common." These " plummets" are found from Maine to California. Preuss (K. T.) Kosmische Hiero- glyphen der Mexikaner. (Ztschr. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 19o0, XXXIII, 1-47.) This valuable article, illustrated with 214 figures, treats of such " cosmic" symbols in ancient Mexican picture- writing as the " butterfly-half-moon," eye, cross, and cognate figures, snail, etc., their varieties, significations, and inter-relations. These figures are sym- bols of earth-goddesses, gods of death, and the earth, and their appearance on representations of the gods Quetzal- coatl, Tezcatlipoca, Mixcouatl, etc., is discussed, and the opinion expressed that these deities were originally chthonic. - Mexikanische Thonfiguren. (Glo- bus, Braunschweig, 1901, LXXIX, 85- 91.) Discusses, with 59 text-illustra- tions, the little clay figures and heads of deities,,etc., which form so charac- teristic a part of Mexican antiquities. These figures in clay represent : Earth, maize and water goddesses; Tlaloc and Quetzalcoatl, rain and wind gods ; Xipe, earth god ; Macuilxochitl, god of play and song, and his fellows; Tez-. catlipoca as patron of the dance-house. Some of these figures may have served as private deities ; others were used by the shamans and those who practised magic. Few, if any, were mere chil- dren's toys. Purpus (C. A.) Felsmalereien und In- dianergr-ber in Tulare County, Kali- fornien. (Ibid., 216-217.) Treats of rock-mortars, petroglyphs, and burial places in the" Digger Indian" country. The author notes that, unlike similar "pictured rocks " in British Columbia, Lower California, etc., these petro- glyphs lack figures of human beings, mammals, birds, etc. Details of a grave-opening are also given.

Report on the examina- tion of the ears of 440 school-children. (Bull. Johns Hopkins Hosp., Balti- more, 1900, XI, 318-321.) Brief gen- eral report with tables and figures. Dr Reik thinks "normal limit" for hearing is now too low. Boys exhibit more aural anomalies than girls,-due probably in some part to rougher life, caps, hats, etc. The most rapid growth of the auricle seems to be in the earlier years, there being little increase after the fifteenth. The author endorses Dr Hrd]icka's views about the occurrence of " abnormalities " among the normal classes of the community. Rivers (W. ti. R.) The color-vision of the Eskimo. (Proc.

Reports re- sults of examination (in England) of 18 (ten males, eight females) Labrador Eskimo with Holmgren's wools, and of a study pf Eskimo color-terms, both lexical and those obtained by presenta- tion of colors. In this brief but valua- ble paper many interesting facts are brought out : The definiteness (excep- tional for primitive peoples) of nomen- clature for green and blue, the absence of the tendency (common to most primitive languages) to confuse blue and black; the extensive use of qualifying affixes and the denoting of</page><page sequence="31">580 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 3, 1901 Rivers-Continued. differences of color by using modifica- tions of a few color-names (a process not very common in primitive tongues, where colors are named after natural objects more frequently) ; a superiority of the women in color matching and naming (said to be rather unusual in low stages of culture). These Eskimo resemble the generality of primitive people in the prominence of red in color-nomenclature, the absence of a word for brown, etc. Very remarka- ble is the following statement: " If one excepts three words, sinanuk, axjangatuk, and kaijuk, which were comparatively rarely used, all hues, shades, and tints of color were named by various modifications of the six words for red, yellow, green, blue, white, and black." Also this: " The Eskimo, however, told me that in the autumn they could see all the colors I had shown them in the hills of their country, and it is possible that where color is only a transient occurrence in the year's experiences [color does not appear largely in Eskimo dress or deco- ration], it may excite more attention and therefore receive more definite nomenclature than in those parts of the world where luxuriance of color is so familiar that it receives little notice." This paper emphasizes the need of thorough-going studies of the color- vision of the American aborigines, from which important psychological results may flow. See Franklin (C. L.) Sanford (D. A.)

A discussion of the chief qualities, physical and mental, of man as an inhabitant of the United States, -" as suited to our kind as in any part of the earth." The American environ- ment has proved hospitable to the red, the white, and the black races in num- bers amounting to millions in each case. Among the qualities noted by Prof. Shaler are: Confidence in fel- low-men (resulting in kindliness), commonwealth-ideal, allegiance within allegiance (State and Union), lawless- ness within the law (lynching), religious freedom, public education, democracy in the household, non-critical frame of mind. Of the ultimate outcome the author takes an optimistic view. Sparhawk (Frances C.) The Indian industries league. (South. Workman, Hampton, Va., I901, xxx, 336-339.)

Steffens (C.) Die Verfeinerung des Ne- gertypus in den Vereinigten Staaten. (Globus, Braunschweig, I0ot, LXXIX, 171-174.) In this article, with four text- figures (6 representative negroes), the author argues against the so-called " refinement" of the physical charac- teristics (physiognomy in particular) said to be due to his American envir- onment and contact with the whites. What changes can be noted are proba- bly due to intermixture of white blood. He admits, however, the advance of the negro in certain intellectual and indus- trial directions which would have been impossible in the African habitat-a sort of "negro aristocracy" has been de- veloped. von den Steinen (K.) Die Schraube keine Eskimo-Erfindung. (Ibid., I25- 127.) A reply to a previous article in Globus by Krause (q v.). Dr von den Steinen adduces evidence to prove that the Eskimo have simply imitated the European screw. The article has nine text-figures.

(Folk-Lore, London, 190gor, xII, 132-16I.) This paper, which is illustrated with three plates, is in part reprinted from the rather in- accessible Guiana journal Timehri. Among the subjects treated are: Imita- tion by children of their elders; the</page><page sequence="32">PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 58I im Thurn-Continued. "coming from town" dramatics of the Macusi children; " playing animal " (jaguar, monkey, acoorie, duck, ant- eater, trumpet-bird games); monkey- game of adult Arawaks; the Arawak macquari or whipping game (possibly a funeral rite),-a detailed description (pp. 141-150) is given; the Warau- shield-game or taratoo (used as an or- deal), and the parasheera, a ceremonial feast of the Partamonas,-the last two are described with some minuteness. By "igames" the author means "the pleasurable exercise of any of the bod- ily or mental faculties without any other purpose on the part of the player than either developing the faculty ex- ercised, or developing in the player a fervid state of mind-in this case gen- erally for quasi-religious purposes.' In Guiana games are practically the education of Indian children. By them they become men and women. Ball- play, the author tells us, " is almost unrepresented among these utilitarian Red-men. I never saw any ball- game except among the Arekunas of Roraima." Its use only by adults and its rarity alike suggest borrowing from some other people. The " com- ing from town " representations are very interesting and afford abundant scope for the primitive imagination. Some of the animal-plays involve great physical skill and mental acumen. The drinking ofpaiwarie has in these latter days turned the macquari game into a regular orgy. Indeed, except mere children's games, the Warau shield- game is "the only one not accom- panied by drinking." The Waraus, the author suggests, " have never risen to the level of a good drink," but it is interesting to know that "the energy, emulation, and excitement shown by the Waraus, in their liquorless game, are at least equal to those shown by the paiwarie-filled game-players of other tribes."

Accepting the unity of the American race as proved, and presuming that at the time of the first appearance of the Indian in the new world the stock counted but a few individuals,--Prof. Wilson argues great antiquity for the Red Man from his wide extension and large numbers (millions at the period of European dis- covery). The multiplicity of languages, the condition of civilization of the various tribes, the fixity of type, per- sistence of characteristic traits, variety of implements, the kitchen-middens (far older than any mounds), are other evidences of high antiquity. At least 2000 B.C. (probably much earlier) must be fixed upon for the appearance of the Red Race in America,--the immigra- tion (from Europe?) took place in the paleolithic period. Wortman (J. L.) The probable suc- cessors of certain North American primates. (Science, Lancaster, Pa., 1901, N. S., XII, 209-211.) Author holds that not only are the extinct North American forms and the living South American Cebid- similar, but "the one was the direct descendant of the other." Moreover, "had the con- ditions been favorable, and the southern barriers been sufficient to arrest further progress, we could believe that through stress of environment a much higher type of monkey, and possibly a man, might have been evolved in the Western Hemisphere in the manner so ingeni- ously suggested by Duncan."</page></plain_text>
