<plain_text><page sequence="1">GOD AND SINGULAR EXISTENCE Theologians have often claimed we are in error in our understand- ing of the concept of God. But few theologians have thought our misunderstanding so radical as that suggested by Paul Tillich. What Tillich challenges, in his Systematic Theology, is the traditional no- tion of Western theism that God is a unique, singular existing in- dividual. As Tillich puts it, "God is being-itself, not a being." u Is Tillich's claim that God is not a singular being meaningful? Clearly, to see how it can be, we need to know whether Tillich Js statement "God is being-itself" is meaningful, since apparently it is the truth of that statement which entails that "God is a being" is false. I will argue that there is an important sense in which Tillich Js explication of "being-itself" cannot be made intelligible. Furthermore, it will be shown that Tillich himself often treats "being-itself" as a singular existing individual - precisely that, in other words, which he wishes to deny God is. For these reasons I will conclude that Til- lich's denial that God is a being must be regarded as gratuitous, and that there is retained in Tillich's theology a distinct sense in which God is understood as a singular individual. I 1. The argument Tillich gives for denying that God can be a being is essentially this. If something is a being, then according to Tillich, it is a member of the class of "the totality of beings." 2 But something which is a member of that class is subject to "the cate- gories of finitude." 3 Therefore, it follows that if something is a being, it must be a finite being. 1 Paul Tillich, Systematic Theology (3 vols.; Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1951-63), I, p. 237.

See also ST I, p. 163. 2 ST I, p. 205.</page><page sequence="2">128 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION When Tillich considers something as "subject to the categories of finitude" he means, at least, that it exists as an object with physical extension and location in space. God, of course, is not a physical object; nor is he finite, for consistent with classical theology, Tillich agrees that God transcends the categories under which physical ob- jects fall. That is, God transcends "the world." Thus, Tillich reasons, if we refer to God as a being, we have made the mistake of thinking him to be some perhaps unique but nonetheless ultimately finite object. Tillich's argument rests on the equivalence he sets up between "a being" and membership in the class of the "totality of beings," from the latter of which is entailed the logically necessary finitude of anything that is "a being." Unfortunately, Tillich 's reasons why membership in the class of "the totality of beings" necessarily en- tails that each and every member of that class must be a finite being remain somewhat obscure. Traditionally, of course, it has been thought possible to include God as a member of that class and still deny his finitude by claiming him to be a unique member. For Tillich, however, this is quite impossible. While the following certainly does not explain Tillich 's reasoning, it does, I think, indicate the kind of worry he has in mind. If some- thing is a member of the class of the totality of beings and, by de- finition, falls under the categories of space and substance, Tillich believes this means that its existence becomes a matter for empirical investigation. In the case of "God," however, this is impossible. The existence of God, Tillich argues, is not "within the context of finite things which are open to scientific research." 4 Since God does not fall under those categories applicable to physical objects, to think one might investigate his existence empirically is simply to commit a form of category mistake. That is, when Tillich says "God has never been found" 5 among those objects which "exist," he is meaning not that we've looked around and failed, but rather that it is inconceivable, given a proper understanding of the con- cept "God," that we should do such a thing as conduct an empirical 3 ST I, p. 235: "If God is a being, he is subject to the categories of finitude, especially to space and substance/' 4 Paul Tillich.

Tillich's conclusion, there- fore, is that such "confusions in the doctrine of God... could be avoided if God were understood first of all as being-itself ." 6 For "God transcends every being and also the totality of beings - the world." 7 The problem of referring to God as a being, then, is Tillich's belief that in so doing we must identify God as we would a finite, spatio-temporal object. But then the criteria for his existence are the physicist's criteria, which is absurd since God transcends the world. Hence, God cannot be a being. 2. Tillich's solution to this problem in divine reference is the suggestion that we think of God not as a being but as "being-it- self." For if God is identified with "being-itself" then we can refer to God in such a way that he does not become subject to the cate- gories of finitude. There are substantial difficulties, however, which lie in Tillich's account of what "being-itself" is. Tillich characterizes his theology as an analysis of what he some- what loosely terms "the question of God." Now what this analysis leads to is something we may call " 'being-itself or 'power of being' or 'ultimate concern' (in the sense of that about which one is ulti- mately concerned) ." 8 That is, Tillich regards the terms "God," "being-itself," power of being," etc. as interchangeable.9 But, Til- lich continues, "such names are not the names of a being but of a quality of being." 10 That is. they are not, strictly speaking, "names" at all but descriptions which constitute a single attribute of some- thing. However, what they are an attribute of turns out to be "everything that is." n By his account of "being-itself," Tillich evidently means to suggest that "being-itself" is in some sense a property of everything. "Being- itself" is the most universal and fundamental predicate, part of the nature of everything. However, if being-itself is not a being but 6 ST I, p. 235. 7 ST I, p. 237, my emphasis. 8 Paul Tillich, The Meaning and Justiiication ot Religious Symbols, in Sidney Hook, ed.r Religious Experience and Truth (New York: New York University Press, 1961), p. 7. 9 Cf. also ST I, pp. 235-6. 10 "The Meaning and Justification of Religious Symbols/5 p. 7. 11 Ibid.</page><page sequence="4">130 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION that which is "common to all/'12 and God is being-it-self, then God must be that which is "common to all." Thus, if Tillich's concept of being-itself makes sense, then it must make sense to think that God could be a quality or property common to everything. I will return to this later. As I have indicated, the term "being" is used by Tillich as a predicable term, and in the expression "God is being-itself" it is used that way. "Being-itself" is the predicate "being" applied to God not in the concrete but in its abstract form. Furthermore, Tillich argues, "being-itself" is the one predicate that can be applied to God which literally tells us what the nature of God is.13 At the same time, this unusual predicate is unlike other, ordinary predicates (such as ".. is wise" or "...is blue") in one important respect. It is absolutely unrestricted in its range of applicability. For Tillich, "being" is not simply an attribute of God; it is an attribute of "everything that is." Unlike even very general predicates such as "...is alive" or "...is an animal," which can still sensibly be applied only to certain classes of things, "being" has no such limitation of entities to which it can be meaningfully applied. Indeed, it must be applied to everything, Tillich maintains, because it is only in virtue of something's participation in "being" that we can entertain a thought of it at all. "Being" is "something which is always thought implicitly, and sometimes explicitly, if something is said to be." u Thus, everything there is must exemplify the property of which the term "being" - the same being as that in the predicate "being-itself" - is in some sense an appropriate description. Exactly what the term "being" describes is a matter which Til- lich has some degree of difficulty in making explicit. But there are two features in his account of this common attribute of everything which seem clear enough. First, "being" is utterly universal. When, for example, Tillich refers to it as the "power of being in everything that has being" 15 he is claiming the existence of some quality which must be universally shared. Second, "being" is in some way the most basic predicate, part of everything's intrinsic nature. As Tillich 12 Paul Tillich, "The Two Types of Philosophy of Religion," in Theology of Culture, ed. by Robert C. Kimball, A Galaxy Book (New York: Oxford University Press, 1964), p. 13. 13 Cf. ST I, p. 239. 14 ST 1, p. 163. 15 Ibid.</page><page sequence="5">GOD AND SINGULAR EXISTENCE 131 puts it, "being" is "the power inherent in everything." 16 For these two reasons Tillich sometimes refers to "being" as "the basic trans- cendentale." It remains to be seen how this universal predicate can be informa- tive in making some literal determination about the nature of God - if indeed the predicate can be regarded as informative at all. For that which everything shares, including God, must certainly be the sparest, most general property imaginable. In fact, it would seem that something which is possessed, quite automatically, by everything from, e.g., sand to God himself could not possibly con- stitute the particular nature of anything. Tillich explains that the criterion by which something can be said to possess "being" is that a concept can be formed of it: "everything which can be conceptualized must have being." 17 Further- more, everything which has being must also possess some form: for "there is no being without form." 18 However, the predicate "being" in no way determines what form any concept refers to. It does not tell us what kind of thing it is we have conceptualized. It does not tell us, for example, that the "being" we are referring to is the being of an animal or of something blue. Rather, "being," so understood, simply tells us that something has some form or other - that it possesses a certain nature, as yet unspecified, presumably to be specified by some further predicate. The predicate simply tells us, in other words, that it is possible for us to have a certain concept, that a given thing of which we are thinking can sensibly be brought before our consciousness. How "being" tells us this remains somewhat mysterious. But more important, in the case of "God," where "being" is the only pre- dicate which can have a literal application - i.e., no other predicate is available to make any further determination about God's nature - how "being" tells us what the nature of God is becomes inscrutable. Since "being," on Tillich's own account, makes no determination about the kind of thing a particular conception is, at best it tells us merely that the notion of "God" can be conceived - though nothing at all about what that conception is. Now it is worthwile to observe that Tillich himself admits that 16 ST I, p. 236, my emphasis. 17 ST I, p. 179. 18 Ibid.</page><page sequence="6">132 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION "being," as an abstraction, is "the emptiest of all concepts." 19 For as the basic transcendentale, "being" precisely transcends all genera; it transcends all predicates which determine something's particular nature. Tillich believes it is a necessary concept because it is that with- out which the thought of any particular thing could not take place. On the other hand, if being-itself becomes the presupposition of any conceptual act simply because it is, by definition, the property every- thing we conceive must have, that necessity appears quite trivial. 3. What are we to make of this? I have pointed out that when Tillich denies God is a particular being, it is because he believes that "X is a (particular) being" entails that "X is a finite being" (subject to the categories of substance, spatiality, etc.) And it is just those categories which Tillich, along with classical theology, denies are applicable to God. The problem, however, is that in his desire to avoid identifying God with a particular being, in the sense just described, Tillich ultimately ends up identifying God with a property commonly predicable of all being. Now certainly when classical theologians denied that God is finite, they were not also denying that God is a singular individual. Indeed, the "perfections" of God point out in what way God must be a unique individual. In Tillich's theology, however, the questions of God's finitude and God's singularity have become muddled. That is, when Tillich denies God is a being what he is intending to deny is only that God is finite - i.e., that God can be thought of as what is called a being "among others" or a being "beside others." 20 The confusion arises because Tillich conflates these. But denying that God is a being "among others" and denying that God is "a" being simpliciter are two distinct things. From the latter, but not the former, it follows that God is not a singular individual. From the former (God is not a being among others) it follows that God is not a finite being. But I do not think this follows from the denial that God is a being simpliciter because I am not sure it is really clear what follows from that, other than Tillich's idea that God, as being-itself, could be a property. However, that idea, as I will suggest, is incorrigible. As far as I can see, from the denial that God is a being simpliciter it might just as easily follow that there is no God, in which case Tillich's concept of being-itself has been wasted. 19 ST II, p. 11. 20 ST I, pp. 172, 235; ST II, p. 23.</page><page sequence="7">GOD AND SINGULAR EXISTENCE 133 In any event, from the denial that God is a finite being it need not follow that there is no sense at all in which God could be thought of as a singular individual. I think Tillich simply has not seen this because he links the denial of God's finitude to the claim that "God is being-it-self." As "being-itself," however, God is identified with an obscure, logically non-determining transcendental attribute, shared by everything of which some concept can be formed. But that is incoherent, God cannot sensibly be a property common- ly possessed by everything. What could it mean to say the God whom we worship is an attribute of everything? How could the God whom Tillich himself speaks of as the single creator of the world be an attribute of the world which he creates? In short, if God is "the power of being [which] must transcend every being that participates in it," 21 then what sense does it make to say that God is also identical with a property inherently possessed by every being? The answer seems to be that it is not clear how it could make any sense at all. 4. Finally, since this transcendental attribute, common to every entity, cannot constitute the particular nature of any subject, then it cannot tell us anything about the nature of God. It cannot, in other words, be the answer to the "question of God" Tillich Js analysis is supposed to lead us to. For an analysis which leads to that which is predicable of anything and everything could not (logically could not) permit us to know what God is, if God is that which must transcend anything and everything. Yet "God is being-itself" is the only statement Tillich allows to literally inform us about God's nature, so obviously there is some way Tillich thinks the predicate "being-itself" specifies something. It is just that, however, which Tillich not only fails to do but logi- cally prohibits himself from doing. Thus, while Tillich both makes and affirms many statements about God's nature in the traditional language of the Church, unfortunately this does little to clarify what telling us that God is "being-itself" tells us. If the only answer to "the question of God" is an answer which cannot be informative of anything about which the question asks, then the question, as well as the answer, must be regarded as un- 21 ST I, p. 231.</page><page sequence="8">134 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION intelligible. Further, since this universal but non-determining predicate is what Tillich means when he identifies God as "being-itself," then Tillich's statement "God is being-itself" turns out to be an incom- plete expression. For if "God" refers in no sense to a singular existing individual, then "God" cannot be a subject of which some pre- dicative - even this most uninformative one - is true. That is, "God is being-itself" means nothing more than "Something or other is..." But that is an incomplete expression. For the dots are meant to hold a place for some further specifying predicate. But since it is just that which Tillich does not permit, the particular subject can never be identified. When Tillich himself must finally say that "being-itself" is the being which "means 'not being anything special' " 22 because "it means being everything," 23 one has the distinct impression that at least Tillich's explanation of being-itself is incomplete. One wants to say: then being-itself can be just anything at all. ii If we were to simply leave matters here, not only would this view of God itself be unintelligible, but it would also - as it turns out - be inconsistent with certain other important features of Tillich's theology which clearly indicate that there must be a residual sense in which Tillich does allow that God is a singular existing individual, despite his claim that God is not a being. In defense of this I will offer one preliminary remark and three specific arguments. 1. There are some indications Tillich was not entirely satis- fied with his account of "being-itself," and that he believed there needed to be a way it could be understood as not the emptiest but "the most meaningful of all concepts." M Tillich describes this as the experience of a "power of being which resists nonbeing." 25 Now insofar as being-itself could be understood as a power - not in the sense of a property intrinsic to all entities, but in the sense of that which actually gives to all things their power to be - then "being" 22 ST I, p. 188. 23 Ibid. 24 ST II, p. 11. 25 Ibid.</page><page sequence="9">GOD AND SINGULAR EXISTENCE 135 would strictly refer to the divine power which alone has the "power to conquer nonbeing." It should be made clear that Tillich in no way consistently marks some special sense of "being" applicable only to God. In fact, his own account requires that the term be used univocally of God and finite beings alike. So consistency is not one of Tillich's virtues. Nevertheless, there are times when Tillich hints at a distinction be- tween two kinds of being: (a) the "being" possessed by finite things - a being by "participation," and (b) pure being or being-it- self (the being of God) .26 In sense (a) being is apparently "limited by" or "mixed with" nonbeing. It is the being every finite thing has by participating in being-itself, but which, nevertheless, is not "pure." In sense (b) being is that power by which God is said to be " 'by himself' "; by( which God "possesses 'aseity.' " 27 For "being-itself does not partici- pate in nonbeing." 28 Thus when Tillich makes the claim that "God is being-itself" he may not simply be meaning that God is the being predicable of everything, but that God is the inexhaustible source of the being which everything has. This is the claim, for example, that Aquinas had made when he said "God exists in everything by power inasmuch as everything is subject to his power." 29 That is, it is only in virtue of being subject to God's power that anything can have its own "power to conquer nonbeing." Thus, the power of being which everything "shares," may not, finally, be a power we possess; rather, it is something we have only by participating in being-itself, in which case wTe must have it derivatively. But then "being" is primarily predicable only of God, who is that from which all being derives. Now while suggesting that it is possible to interpret Tillich as employing equivocal senses of "being," I think it is by no means necessary to interpret Tillich this way. For there are just as many reasons to regard him as having only one sense of "being" which must be applied univocally to everything, not the least of which is the fact that Tillich calls "being" a power inherent in everything. What these remarks do indicate, however, is that Tillich seems 26 ST I, p. 189. Cf. also ST I, p. 235. 27 ST I, p. 236. 28 Ibid., my emphasis. 29 Thomas Aquinas Summa Theologiae la. Q. 8, art 3, reply [Blackfriars].</page><page sequence="10">136 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION willing to assign God the singularity required in order to make God understandable as the single source ultimately responsible for a property of "being" which is also (however paradoxically) in some sense intrinsic to everything. 2. It is quite clear that Tillich makes many dogmatic claims about God, more or less in the language of the "traditional theism" he sometimes seems so bent on rejecting. For example: God transcends... the world. God participates in everything that is; he has community with it. God is spirit. God is infinite. God is creative. God has created the world, he is creative in the present moment, and he will creatively fulfil his telos. God creates man.30 Tillich also finds it intelligible to speak of God as "living" or refer to God as "Lord" or "Father." Thus, despite the fact that Tillich denies God can be a being, in many dogmatic assertions Tillich himself treats God as a singular individual. For in all of these statements, the subject term "God" is used as a logically proper name. That is, it names some particular individual about whom something is being asserted. What brings out the sense in which "God" is used as a logically proper name most clearly are occasions when Tillich uses the term "God" in direct address: "Almighty God! We raise our hearts to thee in praise and thanks... We thank thee that we have being... We are gratefully aware of thy presence..."31 Here, the singular per- sonal pronoun is used as a substitute for "God." But this is only possible if God is the individual to which "thee" can sensibly refer. Now Tillich qualifies the traditional utterances he makes about God by calling them "symbolic." But how is this relevant? If the issue were whether God should literally be called a person, the qualification would be relevant since Tillich clearly resists the 30 Respectively, ST I, p. 237, 245, 249, 252, 253, 256. 31 Paul Tillich, "In everything Give Thanks," The Eternal Now (London: SCM Press, 1963), p. 157.</page><page sequence="11">GOD AND SINGULAR EXISTENCE 137 anthropomorphism that God is no more than "a heavenly, com- pletely perfect person who resides above the world and mankind." 32 The issue here, however, is quite distinct - for it is the more funda- mental question of whether Tillich treats God as a singular; indi- vidual in any sense. And calling dogmatic statements about God "symbolic" simply does not alter that question. For Tillich has nowhere shown how it is possible to make any number of true symbolic statements in which the term "God" is used as the name of a singular individual, even though the assumption that God is a singular being is false. The fact is that most of Tillich 's "symbolic" statements about God would be clearly unintelligible unless it could be assumed that they were about some individual. In many symbolic statements, for example, a metaphor, which could only be used of a singular being, is used as a substitute for the term "God": "From the point of view of the creator, the purpose of creation is the exercise of his creativity...."33 Now if Tillich did not mean to allow that God is an individual in any sense, it would make no sense to even qua- lify the statement as "symbolic": for there would be nothing for which the term "creator" could function as a symbol. That is, there would be nothing to which the "symbolic" term could refer about which the assertion of its creativity is being made. Tillich's dog- matic claims about God thus commit him to the view that God is a singular individual.34 3. We have seen that what entails that God is not a being is the identification of God with "being-itself." At the same time, however, Tillich is not at all uncomfortable using the term "being- itself" as an irreducible singular subject. Tillich has no objection to treating "being-itself" as if it named some individual when he pro- claims "there is of course that being which is beyond essence and existence, which... we call God - or, if you prefer, 'being-itself',"35 32 ST I, p. 245. 33 ST I, p. 263, my emphasis. 34 Tillich explicitly states that a symbol for an individual can be understood as a symbol for God when he says than in "the image of a highest being... we have a symbol for that which is not symbolic in the idea of God - namely, 'Being-itself'."

Mackenzie Brown, ed., Ultimate Concern, Harper Colophon Books (New York: Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1965), p. 45, my emphasis.</page><page sequence="12">138 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION or when he informs us that being-itself has "qualities"36 and "mani- festations." 37 In short, Tillich is not uncomfortable using "being- itself" as an irreducible abstract proper name when he makes it the singular subject of statements in which something is predicated about whatever is denoted by "being-itself." Consider the following remarks: Being-itself is beyond finitude and infinity; otherwise it would be conditioned by something other than itself... . Being-itself infinitely transcends every finite being. Being-itself manifests itself to finite being in the infinite drive of the finite beyond itself.38 In each of these statements Tillich gives himself the syntactical warrant for talking about being-itself as if it existed as a singular individual, in spite of the fact that he has denied it could be. Now it should be pointed out that the use of an abstract singular expression as the subject of a sentence does not necessarily imply that it is being used as a logically proper name. For example, when one says "Wisdom is a feature of some men," it can be argued that "wisdom" is not the name of any single entity over against the various instances in which it is true of something on the grounds that it is possible to replace this "name" (nominalization) by the concrete predicate from which it is derived. Proof of this is the fact that the sentence can equally read as: "Some men are wise." But a sentence in which this is not possible - a sentence in which such a nominalization of a predicate is used as an irreducible abstract proper name - commits one to the view that there is some single entity which it names beyond the instances in which it can be pre- dicated of something.39 What I am suggesting, then, is that in statements such as the ones cited, "being-itself" is used as an irreducible proper name. In the statement "Being-itself infinitely transcends every finite being," for example, there does not seem to be any obvious way to read out "being-itself" as the singular subject of a transitive verb by re- placing it with a predicate that is used of some other subject. 36 ST I, p. 44. 37 ST 1, p. 207. 38 Respectively, ST I, p. 237 (my emphasis), 237, 191. 69 Ct.

Thus, his own usage commits Tillich to a position in which "being- itself" must be regarded as the "name" of some single individual. 4. The preceding two points have indicated that Tillich often treats God as an individual. My last point urges that his own ana- lysis of God in terms of the polar concepts of "individuality" and "participation" logically binds him to do so. First, a word about what a "polar" concept is and then how Tillich uses them. In general, a "polar" concept is simply a concept which would not be intelligible without implying a relation to an opposite with which it is contrasted. For example, when we use the predicate "...is alive" of something, this makes sense because we are able to contrast that thing with other things to which it is possible to apply the predicate ".. is dead." The concept of "being alive," in other words, would not be meaningful without the possibility of elsewhere employing its polar opposite. Tillich's use of the concepts of "individuality" and "riarticipation" is similar in the sense that they contrast with one another. What is different is that they are not mutually exclusive as "dead" and "alive" are. That is, it would not, according to Tillich, be possible to speak of something as an individual without also implying that it can be an individual only because of its participation with other beings.40 Now both of these concepts must be asserted of God equally- the grammatical fact Tillich sometimes characterizes as an "ines- capable inner tension" within the idea of God. Thus, while we have seen Tillich appear to deny that God is a being, his objection, in fact, is to representing God as only (exclusively) an individual. This is the mistake of "ordinary theism." For that view has empha- sized only one side of the polarity of individuality and participation: it has represented God solely as an absolute individual. However, Tillich denies it is meaningful to do this. Tillich's point is that the only sense in which it is meaningful to speak of God as the abso- lute individual is that in which it is equally meaningful to speak 40 ST I, p. 174 ff and 244 ff.</page><page sequence="14">140 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION of God as the "absolute participant."41 "The one term cannot be applied without the other." 42 What Tillich is anxious about is that in emphasizing God as an absolute individual, we have forgotten that "God is the principle of participation as well as the principle of individualization. The divine life participates in every life as its ground and aim. God participates in everything that is; he has community with it; he shares in its destiny."43 Tillich thinks it is wrong to regard God only as an individual because he identifies absolute individualization as a form of metaphysical "solitude."44 From the standpoint of God's creativity, however - i.e., God's creation of the world and his parti- cipation in it - the notion of a God who remains in absolute solitude is inconceivable. But if it is impossible to speak of God as an individual being with- out implying that God is also the being which participates in every- thing, then it should be equally clear that it is impossible to speak of God as the "absolute participant" without, at the same time, implying that God is also an individual. For these "polar" concepts work just that way: viz., one cannot be meaningfully used with- out the other. We can conclude, then, that in Tillich's view, God or "being- itself," at least in a residual sense is a singular individual: This is called a "residual" sense only because Tillich often seems pre- occupied with showing what he believes goes wrong when the pole of "individuality" in the concept of God is emphasized to exclude any ground for God's "participation" in the world. Never- theless, it is Tillich himself who makes "individuality" logically part of his concept of God. That is, being-itself necessarily has this "double characteristic." 45 Individuality, then, must be seen not merely as the polar opposite of participation but also as its presupposition: for "the more individ- ualized a being is, the more it is able to participate." 46 Thus, while Tillich is concerned that God's "participation" in the world is a 41 ST I, p. 244.
