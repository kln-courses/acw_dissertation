DICKEY WITH FOUR PHOTOGRAPHS BY THE AUTHOR O BSERVATION of the tender age at which mockingbirds (Mimus poly- glottos) attain a varied and "imitative" song has led the author into a train of thought and to a tentative hypothesis that falls admittedly in the class of sheer speculation. As such, however, it has interested me, and a brief note in that connection is therefore submitted to CONDOR readers. Its intent is purely suggestive. If it serves no other purpose, it may help to check the loose finality with which the mimetic character of this bird's song is pop- ularly ascribed to pure and simple mockery. If the anthropomorphic attitude is steadfastly set aside, there remains a serious doubt in my mind as to whether this loose, popular acceptation is scientifically tenable. On October 14, 1921, A. J. van Rossem collected an immature male West- ern Mockingbird which had just completed the post-juvenal moult (no. J 1452, collection of Donald R. Dickey). When taken, it was successfully "imitating" the notes of the Sparrow Hawk, Killdeer, ahd Cactus Wren. The rendition of these calls, together with the more characteristic mockingbird interludes, was so fluent and skillful as to convince the listener that he was hearing an old performer. The very few months which had actually elapsed since this young- ster first saw light would seem to form all too short a period for the purely imitative acquisition of so varied a repertoire. May not generations of usage have made this ability an inherent rather than a mimetic characteristic ? Disregard for a moment the original manner in which the vocal versatility of the species was evolved, for in any event that is lost to us in the unrecorded past. Is it folly to suggest that the "imitative" portion of this particular in- dividual's repertoire was as inherent and hereditary in his breast as were the true mockingbird phrases? There is a strong suspicion in my mind that if this bird had been transplanted as a nestling to a favorable habitat on which the note of Sparrow Hawk, or Killdeer, or Cactus Wren, had never fallen, he would yet have greeted approaching maturity with "imitations " of their songs. In other words, may this not be a case of parallel ability and adventi- tious similarity rather than actual and individual mimicry "But," observers will say, "we have actually heard the cries of unre- lated species taken up and repeated by mockingbirds!" True, but is this not</page><page sequence="2">154 THE CONDOR Vol. XXIV the result of stimulus rather than tutelage,-induced parallelism, rather than true mimesis? We have all heard bird notes that resembled those of insects which were vocal at the same time and place, but we do not suggest that one learned from the other!

Admit that the insect vocalization might activate the Grasshopper Sparrow, the weed might activate the rattler,-then, by the same token, the Killdeer might activate, but not teach, the mockingbird.

Experience with cage birds may be urged against this perhaps fanciful hypothesis, for "teachers" are employed, I believe, to develop the maximum purity of tone and variety of song in "roller" canaries.

In sum- ming up, then, no claim is made that the perfection of a mocker's so-called "imitation" is attained without examples to copy-without oral assistance- but the suggestion is made that the basic phrases of a mockingbird's vocabu- A'P? ~ k- A!
