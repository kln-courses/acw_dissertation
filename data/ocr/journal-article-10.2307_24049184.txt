Several paintings from Panjikant show a gate surrounded with various symbols which identify it with the Zoroastrian Hell (fig. 18):27 a grinning lion below, smoke on both sides, a cat and a dragon on top, snake scales inside, contrasting with the gate of Paradise framed with jewels and containing the figure of a beautiful girl. A character clearly modeled on Vais'ravana guards the gate, with one significant deviation from the Hindu prototype: instead of trampling over the yaksa he stands in front of him. This reminds us of Yima, the Iranian mas ter of Hell, whose soul is invoked in order to prevent underground demons surfacing on the earth. Though this cannot be proved, one can guess that the Sogdians borrowed Vaisravana in order to depict Yima, or at least to fulfill a simi lar function. I have tried here to demonstrate that Sogdiana, which contrary to Bactria was never a Buddhist Fig. 15.

Formerly I described the hair rather as dishevelled and interpreted it as an allusion to the concept of the In dian wind god Vayu dwelling in Siva's hair (Grenet 1995, p. 43), but this concept seems to be present only in subtle speculations involving Väyu's identification with Soma. The hair of the wind god Wäd, who is actually dishevelled, is arranged differently as in the images under discussion (Tanabe 1991-1992, compare fig. 6 with figs. 5 and 7). 11.

Marshak (in Marshak and Raspopova 2003, p. 50), though admitting that "the external similarity of the object under discussion with a codex is obvious," holds to his previous inter pretation as a sedan chair; but the image speaks for itself. There are other eloquent example of the apti tude of Sogdian artists to original creation directly informed by Zoroastrian religious texts: see e.g. the "group portrait" of the Amesa Spentas holding the symbols of Resurrection (Grenet 1996), and the cross ing to Paradise on the Cinwad bridge, shown in great detail on a Sogdian sarcophagus from China (Grenet, Riboud, and Yang Junkai 2004). In both cases the im ages owe nothing or little to India. Bibliography Alram and Lo Muzio 2006 Μ. Alram and C. Lo Muzio. "A New Coin Type of the Khalaj?"
