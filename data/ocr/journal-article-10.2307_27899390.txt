AREFORMER of Greek religion from within, whose activity may have coincided with the first emergence of the Christian Apollonius op Tyana.

And both in ancient and in modern times Apollonius of 1 The hand which appears in the original has been omitted because of its in artistic effect.</page><page sequence="2">I?2 THE MONIST. Tyana has been made the subject of parallels which were probably never thought of by the author of his extant Life. The first of these parallels was by Hierocles, Proconsul of Bithynia under Dio cletian; in which the attempt seems to have been made to show that the marvels attributed to Apollonius were better authenticated than those attributed to Christ. We do not possess this work it self ; but we have the reply of Eusebius, Bishop of Caesarea and ecclesiastical historian, written after the triumph of the new faith. The most elaborate modern parallel is that of F. C. Baur, first pub lished in 1832.1 Baur here attempts to show, not only that there are resemblances between the Life of Apollonius by Philostratus and the Gospels, but that Philostratus deliberately modelled his Apollonius of Tyana. A contorniate, and unquestionably authentic.2 hero on the type set forth by the Evangelists. Though he was fol lowed in this view by Zeller, it is now generally rejected; so that there is no need to enter into controversy on the subject. It re mains, however, none the less interesting to try to determine the character of the reforming activity of Apollonius himself. Was his predominant aim to conduct the world along the path of intensified supernaturalism, or was it to promote the growth of a more rational 1 Republished by Zeller with two essays on related subjects under the general title, Drei Abhandlungen zur Geschichte der alten Philosophie und ihres Ver h?ltnisses zum Christenthum, Leipzig, 1876. 2 The medal shows on the obverse the philosopher's head, and on the reverse a victor on a quadriga with a palm in one hand and a whip in the other.

The materials for judging are contained in the Life of Apollo nius written by Philostratus early in the third century, and in the extant letters ascribed to him, some of which Philostratus evidently knew. Whether any of these are genuine, it is impossible to be certain ; and in any case the biography of Philostratus is clearly a romance. For the composition of it, the writer professes to have used the memoirs of Damis, a disciple of Apollonius ; but he tells us that, as these were wanting in literary form, he has freely worked them up. Baur argues that the introduction of "Damis the As syrian" is simply a literary device. The obvious anachronism by which Philostratus represents the Babylon visited by Apollonius as identical with the Babylon of Herodotus, he also holds to be in tentional. It is not, he thinks, put before the reader for serious belief, but only to bring out the ideal attitude of a Greek philoso pher confronted with Oriental ostentation. There is much to be said for this view. Philostratus, who was an accomplished man of letters, has nowhere the air of disclaiming credit for the skill of presentation shown in his narrative, while occasionally he dis claims belief in the stories narrated. He was, besides, an original art-critic, as is evident from the descriptions of real or imaginary pictures in another of his works ; and he puts into the mouth of Apollonius aesthetic theories which he can scarcely have meant us to believe were not his own. He did not, of course, for a moment suppose that he was drawing up the documents of a new religion, and hence had no motive for concealing his methods. It was only necessary that they should not be obtruded. We have before us a highly mature work of literary art by an individual author who comes forward in his own name. If we cannot be sure in detail about the facts at the ground of the romance, we are saved from the labor of trying to extricate them from stratum on stratum of superimposed redactions. We know at least what type of reformer Philostratus conceived Apollonius to have been. That Apollonius was a real person born at Tyana, there is no reason to doubt ; nor is there any uncertainty about the general</page><page sequence="4">164 THE MONIST. character of his life and teaching. He was in manner of life a Neo Pythagorean ascetic, and taught what would now be described as a spiritualistic philosophy. The one mode of reforming activity ascribed to him with absolute consistency is a vigorous campaign against animal sacrifices. Superhuman powers, especially those of prophetic insight and of clairvoyance, were attributed to him by common report. Dio Cassius,1 as well as Philostratus, relates that he saw in a vision the slaying of Domitian. The fact that he had a quarrel with a Stoic philosopher named Euphrates, who is known as a historical personage,2 is clear, though its causes can only be conjectured from the account of Philostratus. For the rest, there is no ground for supposing that Philostratus deviated in the gen eral spirit of his representation from the authentic type of his hero; and he must have had sources of information open to him for the details, with whatever freedom he may have treated them. Other Lives of Apollonius, now lost, are known to have existed. In the "Epistles of Apollonius/' some of which, as has been mentioned, Philostratus had before him, the type is already indi vidualised. A few points from these may be given as a preliminary to the more detailed biographical account which will follow.8 The style of the most of them, it may be observed, is of the laconic brevity attributed by Philostratus to all the genuine letters of Apol lonius. Two on the subject of sacrifices, addressed to the sacer dotal bodies at Olympia and at Delphi, may be quoted in full. "The gods need not sacrifices. What then might one gratify them by doing? By obtaining wisdom, as I think, and by benefiting worthy men to the extent of one's power. These things are dear to the gods; those are of the godless."4 "Priests defile altars with blood; then some wonder whence cities are unfortunate, while 1 Lxvii. 18.

Heraclitus was wise, but not even he persuaded the Ephesians not to wash out mud with mud."1 The contrariety dwelt on between virtue and riches2 may be passed over as a well-known philosophic commonplace ; but the way in which love of family and country is brought into union with the widest cosmopolitanism seems to offer something distinc tive of the philosopher who, having travelled over the known world, is said to have been always pleased when addressed by the name of his birthplace. While it is well, he declares, to think all the earth a fatherland and all men brothers and friends, as being chil dren of God, of one nature ; there being the same community of reason and of passions to each and all, barbarian or Greek : yet neither men nor even irrational animals can lose the memory of their home and native seat or find anything to replace it.3 Men need cities next after the gods; and after the gods cities are to be honored and their interests to be placed foremost by every rational being.4 While he accepts (or is made to accept) as an honor the charge that his Pythagorean philosophy seeks to attain insight into the future by revelations from the gods?only given, as he con tends, to those who are pure in life?he also claims for the Pytha goreans, as Iamblichus did afterwards, the idea of a demonstrable religion.5 Against the credulity of the time, we find the reproof ad dressed to the Milesians that, while Tha?es is called their father, they in their folly accuse a philosopher who predicts an earthquake of causing it.6 A distinctive point again is the protest against the exaggerated cynical strain in Stoicism. In an imaginary dialogue, Euphrates is made to reproach Apollonius with relieving pains and sufferings of the body (which are no evil, according to the rigor 1 Ep. 27 : ro?? h AeaQo?? lepevatv. 2 See especially Ep. 35 : 'Aperr/ Kai xpyuara nap ' r)filv ?XkrjAo?? evavri?rara, fieiov uEvov y?p t? trepov avi-ei r? erepov, aigav?/iEvov ?? /lleio?. ir?? ovv ?war?v ?ficp?repa irepl r?v avr?v yev?c&amp;at ; ttAt/v el fir) r? t?v ?vorjruv A?yu, irap' ol?

His answer is that the same charge might be brought against the god of healing.1 Of actual miracles nothing is said; and one who could utter the fine gnomic saying, "To lie is unfree (char acteristic of the unfree), truth is noble (characteristic of a noble nature)," cannot well2 have been a counterfeiter of miraculous powers. A piece of practical advice that may be regarded as a refinement upon this occurs in a letter to a sophist on literary com position : "Since the absolutely best mode of speech is hard to determine, speak in your own character rather than try to imitate what is best?or what you suppose to be best?if you have it not by nature."3 One letter obviously different in style from the others4 is never theless interesting as bearing the mark of the period though not of the individual ideas of Apollonius. At the end there is an expression of Stoic pantheism, which, in the transitional phase of the time, was often presented in fusion or confusion with Platonism. Every thing done or suffered in appearance by the individual is to be re ferred to the one first essence (wpuTrj ov&lt;rta)b as its cause, both ac tive and passive. The teaching of Apollonius himself, so far as we can judge, though not without Stoic elements, laid stress rather on the transcendence of the supreme divinity. In the earlier part of the letter, what is supposed to be the Platonic or Pythagorean doctrine of immortality is asserted. Death and birth alike are only appearance. There is alternation between the visible and tangible of nature (^vo-cw?) and the invisible and intangible of essence (ovo-ta?), but in reality nothing is created or destroyed. The process is conceived as taking place by condensation and rarefac tion of matter; the former being the phenomenon of birth and growth, the latter of death. As may be seen, there is here no strictly defined immateriality of the soul, which is either identified 1 Ep. 8 : roir? ttov Kai ~f&gt;o? rbv 'Agk/s/ttiov koiv?v t? b/k/y/ia. 2 Ep. 83 : ipev?eGOai ?v?/.EvO?pov, ?/.r/??ia yevva?ov.

There seems to be nothing here specially characteristic of Apollo nius ; but it is clear that in the speculation of the time the Platonic metaphysic was in danger of being swamped in a kind of eclectic animism. The metaphysical advance to a definitely formulated immaterialism as regards the soul itself had to wait for the Neo Platonic development. Neo-Platonism was in some respects a re turn from a religious to a more scientific interest in Plato ; whose critique of materialism had not hitherto been carried through so rigorously in point of expression that the idea of incorporeal mind and soul could not again be lost. With this later development we are not at present concerned ; and in the teaching of Apollonius himself, as presented by Philo stratus, there is abundant interest on the side both of thought and of practice. For the phase to which he belongs, if unoriginal metaphysically, was in other ways marked by advances that proved the still enduring vitality of the ancient culture. It was not indeed by intrinsic decay that that culture disappeared, but by the inva sion of alien forces. In the third century it still seemed possible to preserve with modifications the inherited type. The method which commended itself to the minds that were still in the ascend ant was that of conservative reform. The imperial monarchy, which no one now dreamed of abolishing, was to be made the cen tre of institutions as republican as possible in spirit. The ancient religions were to be preserved in some form of union under the ethical direction of philosophy. Oriental cults, severely opposed in the second century, were in the third regarded with more favor if only their underlying community with those of Greece and Rome could be brought into view. The movement found its precursors, both political and religious, in philosophers of the first century ; among whom, as we shall see, Philostratus makes it his special aim to assign the place of honor to Apollonius. In more than one respect the philosopher of Tyana was a hero better adapted to the needs of the time than men whose activity had been more charac teristic of their own age. Speculative minds were now decisively</page><page sequence="8">THE MONIST. turning away from Stoicism and seeking a more transcendental doctrine ; and Apollonius had been a Pythagorean. The imprac ticable character of much of the Stoic resistance to monarchy during the first age of the empire was also recognised ; and, while no philosophy would have been listened to that did not repudiate the language of political absolutism, the need was felt of one which laid little stress on the external form of government. This need too was supplied by a Platonising Pythagoreanism which, while it had no more sympathy than the other doctrines with Oriental king ship, assigned a high place among constitutions to a monarchy according to law. To us it is visible that the facts of the situation were making for a formal despotism, a monarchy by divine right, sanctioned by the theocratic Church, now rapidly growing under the surface of ancient life ; but this at the time was seen or sus pected by few. A still noble civilisation, lowered, as was con fessed, in type though extended in range, but accompanied by many advances and possibilities of advance both administrative and spiritual, seemed to thinking men worth preserving against disruptive forces whether from without or from within. * * How far Philostratus was from insisting on the Oriental affin ities of his hero may be seen at the opening of his first book where he begins with an apology for them. Some, it appears, re fused Apollonius a place among philosophers precisely on the ground that he was said to have put forward his doctrine and dis cipline as revelations from the gods. Philostratus therefore sets himself to show that, in spite of all that can be urged on that ground, he was a sane and philosophical cultivator of true wisdom as understood among the Greeks. Earlier philosophers also were believed to have been enlightened by divine revelations ; and not only Pythagoras himself, but Democritus and Plato and others, had frequented Eastern and Egyptian sages and priests : yet they were not suspected of "magic." His "daemonic sign" is not brought as an accusation against Socrates. Anaxagoras made meteorological predictions ; and these are looked upon as instances of his wisdom. Why then should similar predictions of the future</page><page sequence="9">APOLLONIUS OF TYANA. 169 by Apollonius be ascribed to magical arts? Since, however, he is decried as a magician, and is not generally known in his true char acter, I have tried, says Philostratus, to bring together the facts from all accessible sources. The memoirs of Damis, the disciple and companion of Apollo nius, he proceeds to explain, were made known to the Empress Julia Domna (the wife of Septimius Severus) by a relation of Da mis, and were committed by her to Philostratus, who was a mem ber of her literary circle.1 Damis, being an Assyrian by birth, was not a skilled writer;2 but Philostratus has put into shape the mate rials supplied by him. These, we are to suppose, furnish the groundwork of the narrative. The story begins with some legends about the birth of Apollo nius, agreeably and romantically told. Before his birth he was announced to his mother by "Proteus, the Egyptian god," as an incarnation of himself. "The country people say that he was a son of Zeus, but he calls himself the son of Apollonius."3 At the age of fourteen he was taken by his father to be instructed by a distinguished rhetorician at Tarsus. Disliking the luxury of the city, he was permitted to migrate to the neighboring ^Egae, where there was a temple of Asclepius. He gave attention to all the philosophies, but attached himself to that of Pythagoras. His Pythagorean teacher did not live according to the principles he taught; but Apollonius, while not ceasing to love his preceptor, aimed at practising the Pythagorean life in all its austerity. Be ginning, as he said, like physicians, with discipline of the body, he gave up animal food, both as impure and as coarsening to the intellect. Wine also he gave up, not indeed as impure, but be cause it makes turbid the aether in the soul. He wore linen gar ments, rejecting those made from the skins or clothing of animals; went barefoot ; let his hair grow long; and took up his abode in the temple. There, Philostrates relates, the god used to appear in person. Apollonius, with his approval, blames the offering be forehand of costly sacrifices, which seem to him to be in intention 2 i. 19. 3i. 6,</page><page sequence="10">170 THE MONIST. bribes ; and bids the priest dismiss a wealthy suppliant, who is a wrongdoer, with his gifts. The gods, he observes, are most just, and will not consent to be bought off in this way. To another evil-minded suitor, he declines the office of mediator, telling him that the gods welcome the good without intermediaries.1 When he had come of age, he returned to Tyana, having made the tem ple at JEgae, says his biographer, a Lyceum and an Academy; for it resounded with all philosophy. At home, he reformed a debauched elder brother ; and when he received his patrimony, distributed most of it among his poor relations, reserving only a small portion for himself. Going be yond the famous precept of Pythagoras, that a man should be faithful to his wife, he resolved on a life of chaste celibacy, and kept his resolution even in youth. According to the Pythagorean rule, he submitted to the probation of five years' silence. During this time, which he passed partly in Pamphylia and partly in Cili cia, he was able to calm factions about games by mere signs. This, says Philostratus, was not so difficult ; for people who quarrel about dancers and horses are easily made ashamed of themselves. It was less easy to quell a tumult caused by a famine. This Apol lonius did at Aspendus in Pamphylia, where the people were going to burn the prefect, though he had taken refuge by a statue of the Emperor. And at that time, which was in the reign of Tibe rius, the Emperor's statues were more terrible and more inviolable than those of the Olympian Zeus. The prefect, on being ques tioned by signs, protested his innocence, and accused certain powerful citizens, who were refusing to sell corn and keeping it back to export at a profit. To them Apollonius addressed a note threatening expulsion from Earth, who is the mother of all, for she is just, but whom they, being unjust, have made the mother of themselves alone. In fear of this threat they yielded and filled the market-place with corn. Having completed his probation, Apollonius visited the great 1 i. 12 (i) : " t-voTrjodv fie " '?tyrj " r? 6e?." ?

He found the people there not only wanting in mental culture, but luxurious and effeminate ; and, to judge from the re port of Philostratus, seems to have liked that "cradle of the Church" no better than Julian did afterwards. Philostratus here excuses himself for relating myths connected with the temple of Apollo Daphnaeus. His purpose, he remarks, is not to mytholo gise,1 but to explain how Apollonius came to utter the wish that the god would turn the "semi-barbarous and uncultivated" inhab itants, with their want of all seriousness, into trees, so that thus they might give forth some sound worth listening to. Visiting the temples, he sought to bring back the Hellenic rites to their primi tive form : when the rites were alien, he tried to discover their original meaning and to get them corrected in accordance with it. His mode of exposition was not disputatious but magisterial, and this at least gave him some influence with the men of Antioch.2 From Antioch he set out with two attendants to visit the Brah mans of India, and, in the course of his journey, the Magi of Baby lon and Susa. At Nineveh, Damis, a native of the place, asks and obtains leave to become his companion. Among the Arabians. Apollonius acquires the knowledge they have of the speech of ani mais. Proceeding on his journey, he encounters a satrap of King Vardanes, the "Mede," who has lately recovered the empire, anc whose officials are known as the King's "Eyes" and "Ears.' Still, as in the days of Aristophanes, these Oriental titles seem adapted to produce an effect of th? grotesque and to form part of the traditional picture of Western Asiatic despotism. We need riot try to refer the whole account to the age of Apollonius, though chronologically the Parthian king Bardanes corresponds to the ap proximate date. The general representation is sufficiently con formable to the revival of the Persian monarchy under the Sas sanidae in the time of Philostratus himself, decked out with circum stances from the historical records of the ancient empire. The narrative is obviously written with a view to contrasting the sim 1 i. 16 (2) : ovx vTr?p jLLvdoAoyta? ravra. 2 ?. 17 (2) : KOL ?7V GTp (f)EV ?? kaVTOV ?v0p?)7TOV? ?/jLOvaoT?rov?.</page><page sequence="12">172 THE MONIST. plicity and independence of the philosopher with the combination of despotism, luxury, and elaborate mechanical art that had dis tinguished the old civilisations of those regions. Nor is the con ception, taken broadly, untrue. The difference of attitude here and in the description of the Indian journey which follows is notable. The Greeks by the time of Philostratus had accumulated some knowledge of India ; and, vague as this must have been, it is evident that they had already detected the profoundly philosophical character of the Indian intellect. Thus we are told nothing of what Apollonius was able to learn from the Magi ;1 whereas in the ac count of his stay in India there is abundance of philosophical in terchange of thought. A relatively high but unspeculative religion such as Zoroastrianism or Judaism seems never to have appealed to the Greek mind as did even merely general reports on the tenets of the Brahmans and afterwards of the Buddhists. Among the decorations of the royal palace at Babylon, we are told, figures of Greek legend were to be seen, Orpheus appearing frequently. Perhaps it is his tiara and his Oriental dress that they are pleased with there : it is not the charm of his music and song. The capture of Athens was represented, and the Per sian victory at Thermopylae, "and things still more Medic, rivers diverted from their course, and the bridging of the sea, and how Athos was cut through."2 Apollonius refuses to do obeisance to the golden image of the King. The King, who knows him already by repute, is pleased to hear of his coming and sends for him. Being about to sacrifice a white horse to the Sun, he asks Apollo nius to accompany him, but the Pythagorean philosopher replies : "You, O King, sacrifice in your own manner, and give me leave to sacrifice in mine." Then, having thrown frankincense on the flame, and uttered a prayer to the god, he departs, so as to have no share in an offering of blood.3 When the King invites him to join in hunting the animals which the barbarians preserve in their parks or "paradises," he reminds him that he could not even be 1 Questioned by Damis (i. 26), he says that they are oo&lt;f&gt;o? fi?v, ?TJC ov navra. 2i. 25. 3i. 31</page><page sequence="13">APOLLONIUS OF TYANA. 173 present at his sacrifices, and expresses disapproval of the pleasure taken in the hunting of wild animals kept for sport.1 In accordance with the general spirit of the picture, he is represented as neither dazzled by the regal magnificence nor impressed by material mar vels such as the tunnel under the Euphrates and the walls of Ecba tana. The King, when he takes leave, provides him with the means of continuing his journey to India ; and Apollonius describes him to his companions as an excellent man and worthy of a better fate than to rule over barbarians. Damis says that in crossing the Indian Caucasus he saw the fetters of Prometheus hanging from the rocks, though it was not easy to tell of what material they were composed. Apollonius frightened off a hobgoblin appearing by moonlight. Then, after these and other strange stories, there follows a remarkable disqui sition on the inwardness of the divine.2 Apollonius questions Damis about the effect on his mind of ascending so high a moun tain-range. Damis thinks that he ought to be wiser, passing over such a lofty and trackless spot: "For," said he, looking up at the summit, "you hear from our guide that the barbarians make it to be the house of the gods." Moreover, sages like Anaxagoras and Tha?es are said to have contemplated the heavens from just such elevations. "Yet," he confesses, "I, having ascended the loftiest height of all, shall go down no wiser than I was before." "Nor did they," replies Apollonius, "merely by such prospects, which display only bluer skies and larger stars and the sun rising from the night?sights visible also to shepherds and goatherds : but how the divinity cares for the human race, and how it delights in being served by it, and what is virtue and what justice and temperance, neither will Athos show those that climb it nor Olympus admired of the poets, unless the soul see through them, which, if it take hold of them pure and undefiled, darts farther than this Caucasus." Indian nomads having furnished the wayfarers with palm-wine and honey, Damis thinks Apollonius can have no objection to tast M. 38 : Kai ?A?G? ovx f?v dqpioiq ?e?acaviofikvoig Kai irap? rrjv tyvav ttjv ?avr?v ?E?OVAQfl?VOL? klUTidEodai. 2ii. 5.</page><page sequence="14">174 THE MONIST. ing this wine, as it is not made from the grape. Apollonius proves to him that it is really wine, just as coins of bronze are no less money than coins of silver or gold. Moreover Bacchus, whose mountain of Nysa is close at hand, will not be angry with him for not drinking wine at all ; but, if he refuses that which comes from the vine and yet drinks that which is made from dates, the god will be angry and think his gift disdained. And other wine, as well as that from grapes, intoxicates, as may be seen in the case of the Indians who drink it. This, however, has been said only to excuse himself, since he is bound by a vow. To his companions he does not wish to forbid wine, nor even flesh.1 They meet a boy riding on an elephant, and Damis wonders at his skill in managing such a huge beast. Apollonius by ques tioning brings out that the credit is due not so much to the boy's skill as to the self-restraint of the animal. Philostratus goes on himself to discuss the various accounts of the elephant, one of them by the Libyan King Juba. The general conclusion is that elephants are second only to man in practical sagacity. King Vardanes has sent a letter to the satrap placed over the Indus, requesting him to conduct Apollonius on his way. He sup plies him with the means of navigating the river, and gives him a letter to his own king. Here Philostratus takes occasion to com pare the Indus with the Nile, expressing scepticism in both cases as to the snow which is said to lie upon the mountains and to aug ment the stream by melting.2 At Taxila was the king's palace. The dress of the Indians is of linen and of "byssus," which comes from a plant. Visiting the temple before the city-walls, the travellers find representations with metallic materials on brazen tablets. These were comparable for expression to the works of the best Greek painters.8 The defeat of Porus and the clemency of Alexander were among the subjects represented. In a dialogue on painting and imitative art generally,4 Apollonius draws the attention of Damis to the shapes seen in the clouds, which appear to us like 1 ii. 7. 2ii. 18 (2). ii. 20 (2). Mi. 22.</page><page sequence="15">APOLLONIUS OF TYANA. 175 centaurs and other forms of living things, known and unknown. He educes the conclusion that, while such shapes are casual so far as external nature is concerned, there is yet an imitative faculty man ifested in our seeing them. This faculty is in us. For man is naturally imitative, even when he has not acquired the power of drawing with the hand ; and it is this natural imitative faculty, spontaneously exercising itself, that makes us see such shapes. Nor can the faculty be absent in those who merely view pictures, at least if they are to take pleasure in them. To make possible the pleasure in artistic representations, there must be an active power of supplying something from ourselves. This is shown in the case of paintings in black and white. Draw correctly the features of an Indian in white, and he will appear to the fancy as dark ; the color being filled in from past experience. So likewise in viewing the picture by Timomachus of the madness of Ajax : he who is to regard it with admiration must bring to it some image of Ajax and some notion of the whole sequence of events of which his madness formed part. The figures on brass seen in the temple are to be classed, Apollonius proceeds, not under the head of mere metal-working (xaAKcvTi/oy), but as products of some art intermediate between that and painting in the special sense. It is an art, he concludes, most like that of Hephaestus in Homer's description of the shield of Achilles. The king, whose name is Phraotes, invites Apollonius to stay for three days. Describing the construction of the city as viewed by the company, and in particular the temple of the Sun, Philo stratus takes occasion to note the "symbolical manner" in which the statue of the god was fashioned,?a manner, he remarks, com mon to the sacred art of all the barbarians.1 The Greek sage ad mired the modesty in the ordering of the palace as compared with the luxury of Babylon. In conversing with the king, Apollonius finds him to be a true philosopher. Phraotes, having dismissed the interpreter, requests Apollonius in Greek to let him join him at a banquet. On being asked why he puts his invitation in this form, 1 ii. 24.</page><page sequence="16">176 THE MONIST. he replies that it is because he regards wisdom as more kingly than his own rank.1 At the banquet Apollonius asks him how he ac quired Greek and came to be possessed of philosophy. The king smiling returns : "As the people of old times inquired of those who came to their coasts whether they were robbers, because that mode of life, though hard, was common, so you Greeks seem to inquire of all who come in contact with you whether they are phi losophers ; so much do you think philosophy, though the divinest thing that can fall to the lot of men, to be the affair of every one. And indeed I hear that most of those who profess philosophy among you are in fact robbers ; the reason being that, while you have laws to punish coiners of false money and such people, you have no law for trying those who claim to be philosophers and for excluding pretenders." 2 He then proceeds to explain that in India there are few professional philosophers, and that these are carefully tested be fore they are allowed to enter upon the philosophic life. First their ancestors for three generations back must have done nothing disgraceful ; this being ascertained from public records. In the next place the candidates, on offering themselves at the age of eighteen, are examined in respect both of their moral and intellec tual fitness. The examiners3 make use especially of the indications of physiognomy. For where philosophy is held in high honor, as in India, it is most necessary that those who profess it should be subjected to every kind of test. Next Phraotes relates how he himself came to receive a philosophical education. His grand father was king before him ; but his father, having been dispos sessed during his minority, was sent for refuge to a foreign king. This king, who had a better realm than his own hereditary one, would have adopted him ; but he preferred, as he said, not to con tend with fortune, and obtained leave to devote himself to philos ophy, so that he might bear his ills more easily. He afterwards married the king's daughter, and brought up his son Phraotes to 1 ii. 27 (1) : t? y?p ?aatXiKCJTEpov oo(f&gt;ia lxu 2 ii. 29. 3 Described (ii. 30) as acxpoi re Kai Qvoiko? ?v?pe?.</page><page sequence="17">APOLLONIUS OF TYANA. 177 follow the philosophic life. To this end, he taught him Greek. The sages in consequence readily received him as a pupil at twelve, though this was earlier than the usual age; for they regard a knowledge of Greek as a preparation for training in philosophy.1 Lastly, Phraotes relates how he came to be restored to his king dom. Apollonius then asks him if the sages he has spoken of did not become subject to Alexander and appear before him to expound their physical philosophy. The King replies that Alexander indeed came in contact with some who profess wisdom of a kind, but who are really a race of warriors. The genuine philosophers of India are those who dwell between the Hyphasis and the Ganges, and to their country his expedition did not extend. Had he gone on, he could never have taken their tower, which, without preparation, they are able to defend by superhuman means.2 The next day at dawn the King comes to the chamber of Apol lonius and rallies him on his water-drinking. Those who do not drink wine, he says, do not sleep well. Apollonius replying that they sleep more quietly than those who go to bed drunk, the King protests against the sophistry, and explains that his meaning was that those who drink wine in moderation sleep better than those who drink none at all. This leads to an argument in form. Apollo nius contends that even moderate wine-drinkers, while not excited to hallucination, are yet liable to be affected by pleasing illusions, and that these too are troubling to the soul and sometimes prevent sleep. They that drink no wine at all remain always equable, neither elated by good fortune nor dejected by bad. Moreover, it is only to the soul untroubled with wine that true divinations come in dreams. Phraotes, having heard the argument, asks Apollonius if he will make him one of his company ; but he puts the question by with the remark that it is good for kings to be conversant mod erately with philosophy, but that a too exact and overstrained de votion to it would seem unbecoming and pedantic in their station.8 At the end of the visit, Phraotes sends Apollonius and his Mi. 31. Here and later the question occurs, Is it possible that anything was known or conjectured as to the affinity between Greek and Sanskrit ? 2ii. 33. 3ii. 37.</page><page sequence="18">i78 THE MONIST. companions on their journey with new provisions and a letter to Iarchas, "the eldest of the sages." They arrive at the plain in which Porus is said to have fought with Alexander. Beyond the Hyphasis they come upon thirty altars inscribed by the Macedonian conqueror to his father Ammon, his brother Hercules, and the other gods. There is also a stele, they record, marking the place where the expedition stopped. This, Philostratus conjectures, was erected not by Alexander himself but by those beyond the Hypha sis, pluming themselves on his not having been able to go further. The journey to the remoter regions is accompanied by more and more marvels, zoological and other, which however are related not without occasional touches of scepticism. At last we reach the Tower of the Sages ; whom the Indians fear more than the King, because the King himself has to consult them about everything that is to be said or done.1 A young man sent to meet Apollonius ad dresses him in Greek ; at which the travellers are not surprised, since all in the neighboring village speak Greek. He brings a mes sage from the sages inviting?or rather commanding2?him to come. In the form of expression Apollonius recognises something Pythagorean. Traces were still apparent of the rout of Bacchus, who with Hercules had once made an unsuccessful assault on the tower. The images of the gods were like the most ancient of those among the Greeks, and the rites observed were Hellenic. Apollonius him self, says Philostratus, has described the Brahmans. "They dwell upon the earth and not on it, and are fortified without walls, and possess nothing save the possessions of all men."8 Out of this the biographer, on the authority of Damis, constructs an account of the Brahmans according to which they raise themselves in the air when they choose?not for the sake of vainglory, but to be nearer the Sun-god, to whom they pray?and are furnished with everything as a spontaneous gift of the earth. Perhaps the con 1 iii. io (2). 2 iii. 12 : keaevovoi y?p avTOL. 3iii. 15 (1) : el?ov 'Iv?ov? Bpaxp?va? oiKovvra? ?ir? rjj? yrj? kovk kir' avTij?, Kai aru X'lotu?

Iarchas addresses Apollonius in Greek, and gives proof that he has the minutest knowledge of his whole history. Going in choral procession to the temple, the Brahmans chanted an ode like the paean of Sophocles which is sung at Athens to Asclepius. After the service of the gods, in which Apollonius had taken part, he asks Iarchas if the Brahmans, knowing all things else, "know them selves. " Iarchas instantly replies that it is in consequence of know ing first themselves that they know all things. "What then," asks Apollonius, "do you think yourselves to be?" "Gods," he an swered; and, being asked why, "Because," he said, "we are good men." In answer to the question, what they think about the soul, he replied, "We hold the doctrine that Pythagoras handed down to you, and we to the Egyptians." Apollonius then asks whether, as Pythagoras declared himself to have been Euphorbus, Iarchas too can say that before he came into this body he was one of the Trojans or Achaeans or some one else. Iarchas thereupon makes the observation that the Greeks are too much pre-occupied with the Trojan war and its heroes, and neglect the greater number of more divine men whom their own land and the land of the Egyp tians and that of the Indians bore. Then he says that he too will declare who he was. He proceeds to relate the history of an an cient Indian king named Ganges, who was the son of the River god. In that he founded cities instead of destroying them, and drove back an invasion of the Scythians from beyond Caucasus instead of bringing the yoke of slavery upon another city,1 this king was superior to Achilles. More of his deeds would Iarchas record if he did not shrink from praising himself. For he, at the age of four, revealed his identity by discovering seven swords embedded in the earth by King Ganges, and now sought for to fulfil a command of the gods. He then asks Apollonius if he also knows who he was formerly. Apollonius replies that he does, but that his position was an inglorious one. He was the steersman of an Egyptian ship. 1 iii. 20 (3) : Kai ravff vir?p ywatK??, fjv e?k?? fiTjff ?Kovaav avripizdodai.</page><page sequence="20">i8o THE MONIST. In that capacity, however, he once performed a just deed in refus ing to betray his ship to Phoenician pirates. This leads to a ques tion about the use of the word "justice," afterwards more fully dis cussed when Apollonius visits Egypt. Iarchas raises the problem by his criticism that the Greeks seem to think the absence of in justice equivalent to justice, whereas a positive conception is needed.1 During the visit of Apollonius to the dwelling of the sages, the King entered. He was not a philosopher like Phraotes, but came arrayed more in the fashion of the Medes, and full of pomp. While the sages themselves ate sparingly, abundance was provided for the King ; though it is not lawful for him to partake of the flesh of animals in their presence. He approaches with profound respect the sages who keep their seats. For the repast, self-moving tripods come in, and there are automata to serve as cup-bearers. Apollo nius asks Iarchas why he sees precisely eighteen Brahmans pres ent, since eighteen is neither a "square number" nor any other of those that are in repute. Iarchas replies : "Neither are we slaves to number nor number to us."2 Sometimes they are more, and sometimes fewer, according as there are more or fewer of sufficient wisdom and virtue to be chosen. Then he goes on to blame the Greek democratic mode of appointing to offices by lot, and the fix ing of ruling bodies in the Greek cities at a particular number. The king interrupts the conversation by asking questions about the Greeks, of whom, however, he has a mean opinion ; imagining, for example, that the Athenians had been enslaved by Xerxes. Apol lonius corrects this impression. Xerxes, he maintains, was unfor tunate in not having died as well as been defeated at the hands of the Greeks, who in that case would have instituted games in his honor, thinking as they do that it is a praise to themselves to praise those whom they have vanquished. The King explains that he had got his false opinion from the Egyptians, who abuse the Greeks as borrowers of everything from themselves, and as a race of law 1 iii. 25. 2 Hi. 30 (2) oi)&amp; fjfie?? ?pi8p&lt;f ?ovleiofiev ovt* ?pid/j?? yu?v.</page><page sequence="21">APOLLONIUS OF TYANA. l8l less cheats. He invites Apollonius to be his guest, but the invita tion is declined. Iarchas and his associates, questioned by Apollonius as to their views on the constitution of the world, reply that they hold it to consist of elements (ck o-roixetW). These are the four elements of water and air and earth and fire, together with ether as the fifth. No element came into being before the others, but all exist to gether as parts of the living whole. This is at once male and female, and is held in unison by love of itself. The parts of the world are governed by the mind that is in it. As bearing an anal ogy to this government of the fabric by mind, Iarchas describes a merchant ship such as the Egyptians send to India. In the vessel of the world, the first place is to be assigned to God the begetter of this animated universe (0co&gt; ycvcropt tovSc tov ?uov) ; the next to the gods who preside over the parts. Of such deities, following the poets, we may admit many, of sky and sea and springs and earth and under the earth. The place beneath the earth, however, since they sing of it as an abode of horror and destruction, does not, if it exists, belong properly to the world.1 As an illustration of the powers of the sages, some extraordi nary cures are related. A woman comes and explains how her son is possessed by a dissembling and lying demon. One of the Brah mans gives her a formula of exorcism addressed to the demon.2 A cripple, and a blind man, and a man with his hand paralysed are healed, and recipes are given to effect other cures. According to his report, Damis was himself present at the dialectical discussions. The study of astrology and divination and sacrifices was pursued only by Apollonius with Iarchas. Philo stratus mentions works of Apollonius on these subjects ; but re marks that in his own opinion astrological prediction, with all such divination, is beyond the scope of human nature : whether any one has attained to it he does not profess to know. The work of Apol lonius on Sacrifices is in so many hands, and is so well and char acteristically composed, that exposition of it is unnecessary.8 1 "i. 34. 35 2 iii. 38. 8 iii. 41 (2).</page><page sequence="22">l82 THE MONIST. Since Damis has given an account of a conversation on the strange animals and so forth of India, Philostratus, while declining to commit himself to the truth of the stories, will not wholly pass the subject by.1 For the rest, the account of the Indian journey ends, as it begins, with enough of the marvellous. Philostratus was on the whole content to put into literary form the travellers' tales he knew ; hinting sometimes to the less credulous his uncer tainty as to what grains of truth might be found in the more extra ordinary of them. After a stay of four months, Apollonius leaves the Brahmans. A letter is given as from him in which he is made to say that he has received from them the power of going through the sky (8t? tov ovpavov iropeveaOai) and of conversing with them at a distance as if they were present.2 He and his companions return to the region of the Indus, then put to sea, and sail up the Euphrates to Baby lon. Returning to the Roman Empire, they go to Antioch ; but, finding it as insolently indifferent as ever to Hellenic culture,8 they put to sea again at Seleucia, and sail thence to Cyprus. From Cyprus they proceed to Ionia, where Apollonius is held in much honor. When he came to Ephesus, we are told,4 even the artisans left their work to follow him. He delivered a discourse to the Ephe sians in favor of a voluntary community of goods; teaching by the example of a sparrow that came to call the others to join him in feasting on the corn spilt by a boy carrying a basket. He foresaw a threatening pestilence, but, as they did not heed his warnings, he went to the other parts of Ionia; continuing everywhere his re forming activity and his salutary discourses.5 A discourse at Smyrna is given6 in which he exhorts the Smyr naeans to make themselves an object of pride even more than the 1 iii. 45 (i) : Kai y?p K?p?o? ely pfire iuoteveiv fiyr' ?iuoT?v ir?aiv. 2 iii. 51. 3 iii. 58 : T7j?

For although it is the fairest of all cities that are under the sun, and possesses the sea, and has the springs of the west wind, yet it is better for it to be crowned with men than with porticoes and paintings and greater abundance of gold. Build ings are seen only in that part of the earth where they are ; but good men are seen everywhere and spoken of everywhere, and render the city they have sprung from as wide as the extent of land they penetrate. Cities that are fair externally are indeed like the Phidian image of Zeus at Olympia : but those that have men that reach every part of the world are like the Homeric Zeus, who is suggested to thought in various forms, and as moving through the heaven, and so is a more wonderful piece of work than the seated statue of ivory visible to the eye. Discussing politics with the Smyrnseans, he told them that a rightly ordered city has need of concord in variance.1 That is to say, each must make it his am bition to be better than the rest in something. The ancient Spar tans were wrong in their exclusive devotion to military affairs. Each ought to do what he knows best and can do best. If one gains distinction by becoming a popular leader, another by wisdom, another by amassing wealth for the common good, and so forth, then the whole city will stand firm. This he illustrates by the ex ample of a ship with its division of employment. The plague having actually fallen upon Ephesus, the Ephe sians sent an embassy to Apollonius. He was there on the instant -as Pythagoras was at Thurium and Metapontum at the same time-and stayed the plague by destroying a demon in the guise of an old beggar-man, revealed afterwards as a monstrous beast.2 He decided on a voyage to Greece, but first visited the tomb of Achilles in the Troad. When they were afterwards sailing the Euboic Sea, Damis questioned him about his visit, and Apollonius recounted his conversation with the shade of the hero, which dis appeared with a glimmer at cockcrow.8 Arriving at the Piraeus at the time of the Eleusinian mysteries, he was joined on his way to 1 iv. 8 (i) : ofiovoia oTaaua ovaij . 2 iv.

Athens by ten young men who were about to set sail to Ionia to see him. He offers himself for initiation in the mysteries ; but the hierophant raises objection to him as an enchanter and as "not pure in respect of divine things." Made aware of the popular dis approval, he changes his tone ; but Apollonius now declines ini tiation till another time ; mentioning the name of the successor to the office, who, as he foresees, will initiate him. At Athens, in deference to the devotional spirit of the place, he first discoursed about sacrifices, thus refuting the calumnious and ignorant asser tion of the hierophant.1 A youth who interrupts a discourse of his with inane laughter he finds to be under demoniacal possession. The demon, being commanded to go out of him and to give a sign of his departure, says that he will throw down a statue on his way. This he does to the astonishment of the audience. The youth afterwards followed the philosophic mode of life.2 Hearing of the frivolities with which the Athenians were now accustomed to cele brate the Dionysia, Apollonius rebuked them by reminding them of the exploits of their ancestors and of their legendary connection with Boreas, the most masculine of the winds. Another abuse which he arrested at Athens was the introduction of gladiatorial exhibitions,?which were going on, Philostratus tells us, at Corinth in his own day. In a journey to Thessaly, Apollonius visited the tomb of Leo nidas, which he all but embraced.3 When his companions were disputing which was the highest mountain in Greece, he ascended the height where the Spartans had been overwhelmed by the Per sian arrows, and said that those who died there for liberty had equalled it to ta and raised it above many an Olympus. In the account of his residence at Corinth we come upon the original of the story of Keats's Lamia.* This occurrence, says Philostratus, was already well known, but only in general outline, and as having taken place in central Greece. He has given the details for the first time from the record of Damis. At Olympia, receiving an in 1 iv. 19 : ri? y?p ?V ?rr&amp;ij r? ?at/i?fiia [ir} na?ap?v elvat t?v QiAoootyovvTa, ?tto? ol &amp;eo? depanevr?oi ; 2?V. 20. 8 iv. 23 : fiovovov TrepLe?akev. *iv. 25.</page><page sequence="25">APOLLONIUS OF TYANA. 185 vitation to Sparta from a Lacedaemonian embassy which he ob served to be full of luxury, Apollonius wrote to the ephors on the subject and brought about a restoration of the ancient manners. A conceited youth submitted to him a long panegyric on Zeus. The philosopher asked him if he had ever written in praise of his own father. He replied that he should have liked to do so, but found that he could not do it adequately. "Then/' replied Apollonius, irritated as he was apt to be by vulgar pretence,1 "If you do not think you can fitly praise your father whom you know, do you not see that, in undertaking to praise the father of gods and men and the fashioner of all that is around us and above us, you have en tered upon a task beyond human powers ? " One incident of his visit to Sparta may be quoted for the light it throws on his general attitude as a reformer. A young man who was a descendant of Callicratidas, the Spartan admiral at Argi nusae, had an action brought against him because he had adopted a sea-faring life for gain, and because he took no part in public affairs. Apollonius succeeded in convincing him that in this he was derogating both from his ancestral traditions and from those of Sparta. He accordingly gave up his mercantile pursuits, and at the intercession of Apollonius was acquitted by the ephors. Super ficially this may seem inconsistent with the discourse at Smyrna, but in reality it is part of the same general ideal. In that ideal, local diversity is included. Thus at Athens, as we shall afterwards find, Apollonius will allow no disrespect towards the sea-faring tra dition; whereas here he reminds the descendant of Callicratidas that the Spartans lost their military power when they took to the sea.2 The humanitarian tendency which the reforming movement combined with its regard for antique ideals becomes evident when we are told expressly that Apollonius treated the slaves of his com panions as a part of his philosophic community.3 Passing over 1 iv. 30 (3) : ?vaxsp?va? ovv ?

The philosophic cloak, says Philostratus, was proceeded against in the law-courts as a disguise of diviners. Not to mention other cases, Musonius, a man second only to Apollonius, was im prisoned on account of his philosophy and came near losing his life. Before Apollonius and his company reach the gates, a cer tain Philolaus of Citium tries to deter them from proceeding. To Apollonius this seems a divinely-ordained test to separate the stronger disciples from the weaker (whom, however, he does not blame); and, in fact, out of thirty-four, only eight remain with him, the rest making various excuses for their flight at once from Nero and from philosophy. Of those who remained was the young man whom he had rescued from the transformed serpent. He stigmatises the reigning tyranny as one so grievous that under it men are not permitted to be wise.1 His discourses being all public, no accusations were made against him for a time. He did not seek out men of position, but welcomed them if they came, and discoursed to them exactly as to the common people.2 At Corinth a Cynic philosopher named Demetrius had attached him self to him as Antisthenes did to Socrates. This man now came to Rome and brought suspicion on him of responsibility for the vio lent attacks he himself proceeded to make on Nero. A public pro test against luxury delivered on a feast-day in a gymnasium which the Emperor was opening in person led to his expulsion from Rome by Nero's minister Tigellinus, who henceforth kept a close watch on Apollonius. His opportunity came at last when there was an epidemic of colds and the temples were full of people mak ing supplication for the Emperor because he had a sore throat and the "divine voice" was hoarse. Apollonius, bursting with indigna tion though he was at the folly of the multitude, did not chide any one, but tried to calm a disciple by telling him to "pardon the gods, if they delight in buffoons." This saying being reported to Tigellinus, he had him arrested under the lex majestatis.

A maiden who was about to be mar ried had died or appeared to have died, and was being carried to the grave amid the lamentations of all Rome ; for she was of a con sular family. Apollonius, meeting the funeral procession, com manded them to set down the bier, and, saying something inaud ible, restored the maiden to life; who then, like Alcestis brought back by Hercules, returned to her father's house. Whether he detected a spark of vitality that had escaped the notice of the physi cians, or renewed the life that was extinct, Philostratus acknowl edges to be beyond his own judgment, as it was beyond the judg ment of those who were present.2 The next voyage of Apollonius was to the region of the Baetis in Spain. Philostratus here tells some anecdotes to illustrate the greater or less civilisation of the surrounding country. When a courier came to Gades to announce the triple victory of Nero at Olympia, the people there understood what was meant; but those of the neighboring cities, who knew nothing about the Greek games, got the notion that the Emperor had been victorious in war and had taken captive certain "Olympians."3 A tragic actor came to Hispalis. Where the people retained less of the antique barbar ism in their manners, they were pleased with tragedy as a new thing; but here the mask, and the lofty elevation of the actor, and the portentous robes, and the resonant voice, terrified them till they fled as from a demon.4 Apollonius was sought out by the prefect of the province. The subject of their conversations is unknown ; but Damis conjectures that they plotted against Nero; for, when the prefect took his leave, the last words of Apollonius were, "Farewell, and remember Vindex." Philostratus reminds the reader that it was Vindex who first stirred up the peoples of the West against the Emperor when he was making his progress 1 iv. 44 (4) : " x&amp;Pu" tyv " oi ?ovAec ov y?p Kpe'iTruv $j vit9 ifiov ?pxeo&amp;cu." 2 iv. 45. 3 v. 8. 4 v. 9.</page><page sequence="28">i88 THE MONIST. through Achaia ; and mentions that he addressed to his soldiers an oration such as one inspired by the noblest philosophy might breathe forth against a tyrant.1 Apollonius and his companions proceed by way of Africa to Sicily. Hearing of the flight of Nero and the death of Vindex, Apollonius in an oracular utterance predicts the brevity of the reigns of the next three emperors (Galba, Otho, and Vitellius). Such predictions Apollonius made, his biographer insists, not as an enchanter, but so moved by a divine impulsion as to know what the fates had in store. Enchanters or magicians (ol yoiyrc?), "whom," says Philostratus, "I regard as the most wretched of men," proclaim that by juggling artifice and by barbarian sacrifices they can change the purpose of the fates; and many of them, when judicially accused, have confessed that this is the nature of their wisdom. Apollonius, on the other hand, followed the decrees of the fates, and foretold what would come to pass of necessity. So far was he from all juggling that when he saw the automata in India he praised the ingenuity of the contrivances but did not care to learn the details of their mechanism.2 At Catana, the story is told that Typho is bound there, and that from him arises the fire of ^Etna. Apollonius takes this occa sion to lead his disciples to a more "physical" view of volcanic eruptions. He begins with a paradox on the fables of iEsop ; that they are to be preferred to those of the poets, in respect of wisdom, precisely because they are not told with such coloring as to give the impression that they are literally true. The didactic purpose in them is thus made obvious ; whereas the poets leave it to the intelligence of their readers to discover the truth. He himself re lates a story about JEsop and Hermes, told to him as a child by his mother ; the point of the story being that the god had suggested to iEsop a line of invention that was at least his own, if it was humble. As for the myth about the contention of giants with gods for the possession of heaven, this is madness to say or to think.8 1 v. io (2) : A?yov... ,?v ?/c ir?vv yewaia?

The cause of these outbursts of flame from volcanoes is in reality a mixture of bitumen and sulphur blown upon by subterranean winds in the crevices of the earth. Revisiting Athens, Apollonius is initiated into the mysteries, as he had foreseen. The winter he spends in visiting the Greek tem ples. He projects a voyage to Egypt in the spring, and, going down to the Piraeus, finds a ship. The owner refuses to let him go on board, because, as he is conveying a cargo of images of the gods, he is afraid to admit sea-faring company, which is usually bad. Apollonius reminds him?since he appears to be an Athenian ?that the gods themselves when they went on board the ships and took part with Athens against the barbarians, had no fear of con tamination from disorderly sailors. He also censures the traffic in images.1 At Rhodes he tells a newly-rich and uneducated youth who is building a fine house and collecting paintings and statues for it that he does not seem to possess the house, but the house to pos sess him.2 Coming to Alexandria, he is treated with great rever ence. Here an example was seen of his marvellous powers. Twelve men condemned for robbery were being led to execution. He per ceived that one of them was innocent, and told the executioners to place this man last ; meanwhile prolonging his speech so as to gain time, contrary to his custom of brief utterance. When eight had been decapitated, a horseman rode up with a reprieve for the pris oner on whose behalf Apollonius had interceded; his innocence having since been established.3 We are told of a dispute in the temple with an Egyptian priest regarding animal sacrifices, and of a discourse reproving the Alex andrians for the sanguinary quarrels that arose from their devotion to the contests of the hippodrome. At this point of the narrative, Vespasian arrives in Alexandria from Judaea, aiming now at the Empire. The philosophers Dion and Euphrates bid the people rejoice. For, says Philostratus, the last fifty years had been a period of tyrannies so harsh that even the reign of Claudius, though 1V. 20. 2 V. 22 (2). 8v. 24.</page><page sequence="30">I go THE MONIST. he was better than the emperors before and after, had seemed to give no respite.1 Apollonius was equally glad, but did not care to obtrude himself. Vespasian, however, sought him out, and first set forth to him alone his reasons for seeking the empire ; though he had commended to him his fellow-philosophers also as advisers. Apollonius heartily approves of his purpose ; and, to his astonish ment, tells him that he is destined to rebuild the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus at Rome. He did not yet know that the temple had been burned down ; but it was afterwards found that this was the case, and that the conflagration had been manifested to Apollonius sooner than if it had taken place in Egypt.2 The day after the private interview with Apollonius, the other philosophers are called in. Vespasian formally explains to them the motives of his action ; describing the tyranny to which the Ro man world has been subject from the reign of Tiberius, and point ing out that if Vitellius is allowed to rule, Nero will have come to life again. "You have learned how not to govern," said Apollo nius, "from those who governed badly: let us now consider how a good ruler ought to act."8 Euphrates, however, who has become jealous of the special attention paid to Apollonius, makes a long speech in Stoic phraseology ; first remarking that it is premature to consider how one is to proceed in a certain course of action be fore it has been decided whether that is the right course. In the end he approves of the resolution of Vespasian to march against Vitellius, but advises that, if he is victorious, he should restore to the Romans the democratic form of government under which they were most prosperous, and gain for himself the glory of having be gun an era of freedom. Dion partly agrees and partly disagrees with the advice of Euphrates. He agrees in particular that Ves pasian would have done better to let the Jews separate if they 1 v. 27- Tacitus also dated the beginning of improvement from the reign of Vespasian, to whose personal example he ascribes some influence in the return from excessive luxury to a simpler mode of living : "Nisi forte rebus cunctis inest quidam velut orbis, ut quem ad modum temporum vices, ita morum vertantur; nec omnia apud priores meliora, sed nostra quoque aetas multa laudis et artium imitanda posteris tulit."

Instead of spending his force in bringing them to subjection, and thus doing all that was in his power to preserve the empire for Nero, he ought to have straightway attacked him. At the same time he approves of the enterprise against Vitellius. A democracy, if inferior to an aristocracy (of Platonic type), is to be preferred to tyrannies and oligarchies ; but he fears lest the Ro man people, tamed as they now are by a series of tyrannies, should find the transition to liberty as unbearable as that from darkness to sudden light. Let Vespasian, however, put the question to the vote, and if the people choose democracy, grant it. In that case he will win fame universal and unparalleled. If, on the other hand, they choose monarchy, who should be emperor but himself? Apol lonius demonstrates at length the impracticability of all this. To him personally the form of political government is indifferent, since he lives under the gods ; but he does not think that the human flock ought to be left to perish for want of a just and prudent pas tor. As one man pre-eminent in virtue, when he becomes ruler in a democracy, makes that polity seem identical with the form of government in which the one best man rules ; so the government of one, when it keeps steadily in view the good of the common wealth, is in effect a democracy.1 At Vespasian's request Apollo nius, premising that the art of government is not a thing that can be taught, goes on to lay down some general maxims for the exer cise of kingly power. The king is himself to be ruled by the law. Vespasian personally is advised not to let his sons take for granted that the empire will fall to them as his heirs, but to teach them to regard it as the prize of virtue. He is not to go too fast in repress ing the pleasures to which the people have become accustomed : they must be brought to temperance by degrees. Governors of provinces should know the language of the provinces they are sent to govern. The disadvantage of not observing this rule he illus trates from the failure in the administration of justice when he was in the P?loponn?se ; the Roman governor, who did not know Greek, 1 v. 35 (4).</page><page sequence="32">192 THE MONIST. being at the mercy of those who had an interest in deceiving him. Euphrates allows that further discussion would be idle, since the course to be taken has already been resolved on; but, with an allusion glancing at Apollonius, gives the future emperor the part ing advice to embrace the philosophy that is according to nature, and to have nothing to do with that which professes itself inspired by the gods, liable as such claims are to be the source of decep tion.1 Vespasian perceives his animus : and, when Euphrates after wards hands him an epistle full of requests of presents for himself and his friends, he reads it aloud; thus giving Apollonius the opportunity of retorting on Euphrates by contrasting his readiness to ask for gifts from the emperor with his counsel to establish a democracy. This, Philostratus tells us, is what he has been able to learn about the origin of the difference between the two philosophers. With Dion, Apollonius was always on good terms, though he thought Dion's philosophy too rhetorical. Euphrates, according to the story, was afterwards in favor under Domitian. When Ves pasian as emperor revoked the liberty granted by Nero to Greece, Apollonius did not care to see him again ; though he approved of his good administration generally. In connection with the story of the philosopher at Alexandria, a strange tale is recounted of his detecting the soul of King Amasis in a tame lion.2 He left Alex andria on a journey to ^Ethiopia, accompanied by ten disciples out of the number that had again gathered round him since the dis persal under the persecution of Nero.8 On the borderland between Egypt and ^Ethiopia a primitive system of barter was practised. This Apollonius praised for its moral superiority over the habits of commercial bargaining among the Greeks.4 An Egyptian youth named Timasio, who had overcome a temptation similar to that of Hippolytus, guided the company to the celebrated statue of Memnon. Apollonius praises him for his 1 v. 37 (x) : QitoooQiav ??, ? ?aaiAev, tovt? y?p aoitz?v irpooeipfjaeraL, rrjv jll?v Kar ? &lt;f&gt;vatv hnaivov Ka? ?oTr??ov, vrjv ?? i?eoKAvre?v (jt?oKovoav napairov' KaTaipEv??fievot y?p rov i?eiov noAA?

In consequence of a trick of Euphrates, who has sent his disciple, Thrasybulus of Naucratis, to prepossess them against Apollonius, they put off re ceiving him for some time. At length, after negotiations through Damis, who detects the trick, they consent to receive him, though still resenting his reported preference of the Indian wisdom to their own. The eldest and chief of them, who is called Thespesio, delivers a long address, in which he seeks to place the aims of himself and his associates above those of the Indians ; advising Apollonius to have no care about automata or wonder-working, but to choose rather the wisdom that goes with toil and simplicity of life. In his peroration, he reminds him of the pictures he must have seen of the Hercules of Prodicus. As in the Choice of Hercules Vice stands on one side luxuriously adorned, and Virtue poorly clad on the other ; so let Apollonius think of himself as placed between the alluring wisdom of the Indians and the rugged discipline of the Egyptian Gymnosophists. Apollonius explains that he has not come thus late to make his choice between two philosophies. Sur rounded as he was in his youth by the teaching of all the schools, he of his own accord adopted the Pythagorean discipline, in spite of the austerity which from the first it did not conceal.2 Among the rewards it promises to its votaries is to appear more pleasing to the gods though sacrificing little than do those who pour forth to them the blood of bulls. The doctrine of Plato regarding the soul, divinely taught by him at Athens, Apollonius perceived not to have won general acceptance among the Athenians. He there fore sought out a city or nation in which one person should not say 1v?. 4. 2 Special stress is laid on the virtue of chastity. The Pythagorean philosophy is represented as addressing the neophyte : mv ?^po?taiuv ^rr^?vra? alo&amp;ufiat, ?apa &amp;p? tari poi, K,a&amp; ?v ootyia? bira?o? ?lktj (j&gt;?pei r1 avrov?

First, accordingly, he looked to the Egyp tians; but his teacher told him that the original fathers of this wisdom were the Indians. For the rest, he addresses to the Gym nosophists an apology on behalf of the arts and graces of life and the adornment of temples ; pointing out that Apollo does not dis dain to clothe his oracles in verse, and that self-moving tripods are introduced by Homer at the banquets of the gods. Nor has any accusation yet been laid in heaven against Hephaestus for corrupt ing matter by his art. Every art will have a care for ornament ; because the very being of arts was invented for the sake of orna ment.1 The speech of Apollonius made a powerful impression on all, and especially on Nilus, the youngest of the Egyptians. Thespesio, though black, might be seen to blush. This, of course, is a remi niscence of Thrasymachus in the Republic, as it is likewise when we are told that he becomes reconciled with Apollonius. Requested by Nilus and Thespesio, Apollonius recounts his adventures. He and his companions are courteously entertained by Nilus at a re past. Nilus desires to become his companion ; and, to show that this is no rash impulse on his part, relates his history. His father had sailed to the Indian coast, and had told him what he had heard about the sages in India. Informed by him also that the Gym nosophists were a colony from thence, he gave up his patrimony and joined them. He found them wise indeed, but not like the Indians ; and had he not met with Apollonius, he would himself have sailed to India like his father. The eager and ingenuous Nilus also proposes that he shall try to persuade his elders of the inferiority of their wisdom : but this Apollonius discountenances ; receiving him on condition that he will not make an attempt which would be of no avail. Apollonius pays a visit to Thespesio, and asks him to instruct him in the Egyptian wisdom, so that he may communicate it to 1 vi. Ii (17) : K?Gfiov y?p kmpeTJjoeTaL rk^yn n?oa, ort Kai avr? t? E?vai r?xya? vir?p K?apov Evpqrcu.</page><page sequence="35">APOLLONIUS OF TYANA. others, as he has communicated that which he received from the Indians. Thespesio signifies his readiness to answer questions. Apollonius begins by asking why the Egyptians represent the gods for the most part so absurdly; their sacred images being apparently made in honor of irrational animals rather than of divine beings. Thespesio parries this attack on zo?morphism by a similar ques tion about the anthropomorphism of the Greeks. Did your Phidias and your Praxiteles ascend into heaven and copy the forms of the gods? And if it was not imitation that produced their art, what then could it be? An artist of more wisdom, answers Apollonius, namely, imagination.1 He who conceives the form of Zeus must see him in his mind's eye accompanied by the heaven and the sea sons and the stars : the fashioner of a statue of Athena must think of armies, and of wisdom in counsel, and of the arts, and of how she sprang from the head of Zeus. Thespesio, on his part, con tends that the Egyptians display more reverence to the gods in not audaciously trying to realise some conception of their forms, but using only symbol and suggestion. Apollonius replies that there is nothing to call forth reverence in the image of a dog or an ibis or a goat. If, as Thespesio says, that is regarded with more rev erence which is only suggested to the mind, then the Egyptians should have had temples and rites indeed, but no images at all ; leaving the mental representation entirely to the worshipper. "But you," he says in concluding, "have taken away from the gods both visible beauty and the beauty of suggestion."3 "There was a cer tain Athenian named Socrates," is the retort of Thespesio, "an old man of no intelligence like ourselves, who used to swear by the dog and by the goose and by the plane-tree." "Not that he thought them gods," returns Apollonius, "but so that he might not swear by the gods." Thespesio, as if changing the subject, inquires about the scourging of boys at Sparta. Do the Greeks endure such a cus tom? And did Apollonius not reform it when he was occupying 1 vi. 19 (3) : (ftavraoia ra?rr* eipyaoaro, ootyarkpa fiLfiijCEo? ?rjfiLovpy??. 2 vi. 19 (5) : v/lle?? ?' ?tyrfprjO'&amp;e tov? i?eov?

Apollonius replies that it would have been madness to contend against a religious custom such as this. The scourging is performed in accordance with an oracle directing that the altars shall be sprinkled with an offering of human blood to the Scythian Artemis. This no doubt was originally a requirement of human sacrifice ; but the Spartans, by subtly interpreting it, have at once evaded the obligation of put ting a human victim to death and turned a rite which they could not get rid of into an exercise in fortitude. Thespesio, however, skilfully presses the point ; ending with the remark that he has been speaking not against the Lacedaemonians but against Apollo nius. If we thus rigorously investigate customary rites the origin of which reaches back to a grey antiquity beyond knowledge, and cross-examine divinities as to their reasons for delighting in them, not the Eleusinian nor the Samothracian nor any other mysteries will be safe. We can always ask "Why this and not that ?" and take offence at one thing or another. In these matters at any rate, if not in all, the Pythagorean silence is good. Apollonius accord ingly, relinquishing further argument on behalf of the Spartans, consents to go on to another topic, and proposes that they shall discuss the nature of justice.1 Such a subject of discourse, Thespesio agrees, is suitable both for professional philosophers and for others. Apollonius then re calls the comment of the Indian sages on his notion that when, being in a former body, he had refused to betray his ship to pirates, he had performed an act of justice. They laughed at this use of the word, holding that justice involves something more than the absence of injustice. Rightly, answers Thespesio, for no virtue consists in a mere negation. And we must not expect to find men publicly rewarded for practising justice. In the cases of Socrates and of Aristides we rather find the opposite. No doubt it will seem absurd : but as a matter of fact Justice, being appointed by Zeus and the Destinies to prevent men from injuring one another, takes no measures to prevent herself from being injured. Imagine, vi. 20.</page><page sequence="37">APOLLONIUS OF TYANA. I97 however, that when Aristides returned from his apportionment of tribute among the allies of Athens, the proposal had been made by two orators to confer the crown upon him for his justice; and that one had assigned as the reason his returning no richer than he went, and the other his observance of due proportion to the capa city of each allied State, and his refraining from all excessive de mands : would not Aristides himself have protested against the first orator for the inadequacy of his reason, and recognised that the second was aiming at the true mark? And indeed, in main taining due proportion, he had regard to the advantage both of Athens and of the islands ; as was seen afterwards when the Athe nians, by imposing heavier burdens, brought about the revolt of their* tributaries and the loss of their empire. He, then, is just who both acts justly himself and so orders things that others shall not act unjustly. And from this diffusive virtue?which is better than oaths taken on sacrifices1?will spring both other virtues and in particular those of the judge and of the legislator, which come peculiarly within the province of justice.2 To this account of the just man Apollonius assents. After some further discourse, he informs Thespesio of his intention to go in quest of the sources of the Nile. In the account of so remote a journey the geography and zoology as usual become mixed with the marvellous, though they are not wholly fictitious. We are told of the Androphagi and the Pygmies, who are of ^Ethiopian race, and extend as far as to the ^Ethiopie Sea, into which no one volun tarily sails. We also hear of cataracts haunted by daemons ; and there is a curious story about the taming of a satyr in one of the villages by Apollonius. On his return, he signified his approval of the conduct of Titus after he had taken Jerusalem, in refusing to accept a crown from neighboring nations.8 Titus, now associated with his father in the 1 vi. 21 (7) : ?ui?oei fiev y?p tol?g?e ttoaa^? ?iKai?repov f) oi mr? r?v to/ilcjv ?/llvvvte?. 2 It is noteworthy that the place here assigned to justice as a positive virtue coincides with that which it occupies in Dante's description of the spirits in the heaven of Jupiter, who are those of men that bore rule on earth. 3 vi. 29 : fJLTj y?p avro? ravr' eipy?o&amp;ai, i?e?) ?' bpyr/v Qyvavri eni?e?tJK?vai r?? ?avrov Xe?pa?.</page><page sequence="38">THE MONIST. government, invited him to Argos, and consulted him as to his future behavior as a ruler. Apollonius says that he will send him his companion Demetrius the Cynic as a free-spoken counsellor ; and Titus, though the name of the Cynic is at first disagreeable to him, assents with a good grace.1 He is also said to have consulted Apollonius in private on his destiny. Apollonius, says Philostratus at this point, made many more journeys, but only to countries he already knew. He remained always like himself; and this is for the sage even more difficult than to know himself. Before proceeding to the account of his acts and sufferings under Domitian, the biographer brings together a few miscellaneous anecdotes. One of these throws interesting light on popular beliefs in the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire. The cities on the left of the Hellespont, it is recorded,2 being once troubled with earthquakes, certain Egyptians and Chal daeans were collecting money for a sacrifice, estimated at the price of ten talents, to Earth and Poseidon, and declared that they would not perform the sacrifice till the money was paid down. Apollo nius drove them away for their greed, and by due rites quieted the earth. Since those who adopt the philosophic life are best proved by their attitude to tyrannies, the behavior of Apollonius in face of Domitian has now to be compared with that of elder philosophers when confronted with tyrannies in their time. Philostratus pro ceeds to make the comparison in set form ; maintaining the thesis that Apollonius showed his superiority to all others, high-minded as they had undoubtedly proved themselves. It is not his purpose to depreciate the rest, but it is his duty to show the greatness of his hero.8 Some of the sayings of Apollonius against the Emperor having been recorded, we are told that he fell under suspicion through his correspondence with Nerva and his associates Orfitus and Rufus. When proceedings against them were begun, he addressed to the statue of Domitian the words: "Fool, how little you know of the vi. 31. 2 vi. 41. 3 vii. I, 2.</page><page sequence="39">APOLLONIUS OF TYANA. I99 Fates and Necessity ! He who is destined to reign after you, should you kill him, will come to life again."1 This was brought to Domitian's ears by means of Euphrates. Foreknowing that the Emperor had decided on his arrest, Apollonius anticipated the summons by setting out with Damis for Italy. They arrive at Puteoli, and there fall in with Demetrius, who leads them to the seat of "the ancient Cicero," where they can converse privately. Demetrius tells Apollonius that he is to be accused of sacrificing a boy to get divinations for the conspirators; and that further charges against him are his dress and his manner of life and the worship that is said to be paid to him by certain people. He then tries to dissuade him from staying to brave the anger of a tyrant who will be unmoved by the most just defence, and who is undis tracted by that devotion to the Muses which, when Nero was sing ing and playing on the lyre, gave the world some respite. Damis, who till now has been unaware of the purpose of his master in coming, seconds the argument of Demetrius. Apollonius holds this timorous counsel excusable on the part of Damis, who is an Assyrian and has lived in the neighborhood of the Medes, where tyrannies are adored ; but as for Demetrius, he does not know how he will make his apology to philosophy. He himself intends to remain ; and in justification he sets forth the arguments that this is the only course worthy of his character. Of despotisms he allows that that is the most dangerous kind which, like the tyranny of Domitian, proceeds under forms of law. All the more, however, is he bound to appear and answer the charge ag?inst him : to flee from a legal trial would have the appearance of self-condemnation. And whither shall he flee? It must be beyond the limits of the Roman Empire. Shall he then seek refuge with men who know him already ; to whom he will have to acknowledge that he has left his friends to be destroyed by an accusation which he has not dared to face himself? Perhaps Demetrius will tell him to go among those who do not know him. But here too, as he makes impressively clear, starting from the use of the word by Euripides 1 vii. 9 (1).</page><page sequence="40">200 THE MONIST. in the Orestes, the power called conscience (o-vvco-i?) will follow him, and will allow him no peace whether awake or asleep.1 At the end of this address, Damis recovers courage, and Demetrius, far from continuing his opposition, cannot sufficiently express his admira tion of Apollonius. The pr fectus pr torio at that time, the narrative continues, was Aelianus, who had been acquainted with Apollonius in Egypt. As a diversion in his favor before he arrives, he argues to the Em peror that the "chattering sophists," having nothing to enjoy in life, deliberately try to draw death upon themselves at the hands of those who bear the sword. Perceiving this, Nero could not be brought by Demetrius to give him the death he desired, but let him go, not as pardoning him but out of contempt.2 On the arrival of Apollonius as a prisoner, Aelian uses his authority to submit him to examination in secret. When they are alone, he gives ex pression to his friendly feeling, but explains the necessity of pro ceeding with caution. Apollonius asks him what he is accused of. Aelian repeats the heads of accusation already mentioned ; inform ing him that the most serious charge is precisely that which he himself knows must be false, but which the Emperor is most dis posed to believe true : namely, that Apollonius slew an Arcadian boy for sacrifice to encourage Nerva in aspiring to the empire ; the offering being made at night by the waning moon.8 In answering the charge, however, let Apollonius avoid a contemptuous attitude. The interview being at an end, Aelian calls in the guards, and, with simulated anger, consigns him to custody among those who are awaiting their trial. In prison, he is derided by a military tribune, who tells him that he knows what he is accused of if Apollonius does not. He is accused of being worshipped by men and thinking himself worthy 1 vii. 14 (8-10). This passage is of high interest philosophically, as showing how fully the ethical conception of conscience had already been brought into view. The psychological conception of consciousness (sometimes expressed by the same word) was not so completely formulated till the Neo-Platonic period, with its more definite direction to abstract thought. 2 vii. 16. 3 vii. 20.</page><page sequence="41">APOLLONIUS OF TYANA. 20I of equal honors with the gods.1 As a test, let them go outside the walls, and he will try to cut off the head of Apollonius with his sword. If he succeeds, Apollonius is innocent of the claim to di vinity. If he is terror-stricken and the sword falls from his hand, that is a proof at once of the divinity of Apollonius and of his guilt. Here the histories are given of some of the other prisoners, who are deploring their fate. The philosopher, in accordance with his professional character, calls them together and addresses to them a consolatory discourse which gives them fortitude and hope. Telling them first not to despair before their cases are decided, he proceeds in a more elevated strain. During the whole of our life, the body is the prison of the soul ; and those who dwell in palaces are more under this bondage than those whom they put in bonds. Nor is a savage mode of life a protection. The Scythian tribes are no freer than we are ; but are surrounded with hardships by rivers impassable save when frozen over by the cold of winter, and shrink even within the shelter of their wagon-huts. And, if it is not pue rile to recur to the fables of the poets,2 one might tell of gods who are said to have been bound in chains, both in heaven and on earth. Think finally of the many wise and blessed men who have suffered at the hands both of licentious peoples and tyrannies, and resolve not to be surpassed by them in courage. The next day, an emissary of Domitian comes in the guise of a much-dejected prisoner, but Apollonius sees his purpose of en trapping him, and discourses to his fellow-prisoners only of his travels. On the evening of the fifth day, one from Aelian brings him the message that he is to be led before the Emperor on the morrow ; renewing the advice not to be contemptuous, and describ ing Domitian^ appearance and manner of speaking. The fact that Apollonius had come forward to undergo danger on behalf of others, Philostratus here remarks, made a favorable impression even on those who before were prejudiced against him. While he is being led under guard to the Emperor's presence, he rallies his 1 vii. 21 (i): r? y?p izpooKWEla^ai ae vir? r?v ?v&amp;p?Tro?v ?ia?e?TiijKev ??

Damis?who in genuously confesses how terrified he is?is not admitted ; and Do mitian insists that the philosopher shall defend himself alone from the charges, and not Nerva, Rufus, and Orfitus, who are already condemned. Apollonius, nevertheless, declares them innocent, and protests against the injustice of assuming their guilt before their trial. Domitian, now telling him that as regards his defence he may take what course he likes, has his beard and his hair shorn, and puts him in fetters such as are reserved for the worst criminals. A letter attributed to Apollonius in which he supplicatingly en treats the Emperor to release him from his bonds, Philostratus pronounces to be spurious.1 When Apollonius has been lodged in his new dungeon for two days, a Syracusan who is "the eye and tongue of Domitian,'' visits him under the pretence that he is a well-wisher and has gained access to him by payment. After much feigned commiseration he reveals his drift ; hinting that Apollonius can easily obtain his re lease by giving information about the supposed conspiracy against the Emperor. The Syracusan having gone away without result, Apollonius tells Damis that he was once that Pytho of Byzantium who came from Philip on a mission to the Greeks, and whom De mosthenes withstood at Athens. He also predicts that they will suffer nothing more than they have suffered already ; and, to show that his submitting to bondage is voluntary, frees his leg from the fetter and then replaces it.2 These things, says Philostratus, the more foolish sort ascribe to magic ; against the efficacy of which he again takes up the argu ment. Successful events attributed to charms or sacrifices may be more rationally explained by chance coincidence. Nothing, however, will persuade those who have recourse to such arts that success does not result from performance of the prescribed rites, while failure is to be attributed to the omission of some detail the importance of which was overlooked. Others, he adds, have ridi 1 vii. 35. This letter is not among the extant epistles. 2 vii. 38.</page><page sequence="43">APOLLONIUS OF TYANA. 203 culed the art at large ; but if the young will follow his advice, they will have nothing to do with things of the kind, even in sport.1 As is evident, he would willingly have ascribed the superhuman powers he conceived Apollonius to have possessed to some deeper knowl edge of natural causation. Imperfect as the science of the time was, and credulous as opinion was becoming, philosophic culture repudiated in theory the anti-natural conception of miracle. Apollonius is at last set free from his bonds, and conducted back to his former prison. His fellow-prisoners welcome him on his return, and he devotes himself unceasingly to giving them counsel. Damis he now sends to Dicaearchia (Puteoli) to expect with Demetrius his appearance after he has made his defence. When the philosopher is brought to the imperial judgment seat to be tried, Domitian is to be figured as vexed with the laws because they invented courts of justice.2 The court was decked out as for a festival oration, and all the illustrious were present. Apollonius, on entering, so disregarded the monarch as not even to glance at him. The accuser therefore crying out to him to "look towards the god of all men," he raised his eyes to the ceiling : thus indicating, says the biographer, that he was looking to Zeus; and thinking him who was impiously flattered worse than the flatterer.3 He had prepared an oration in case this should be necessary ; but Domitian merely put to him four brief interrogatories. Those he triumphantly answers, and the Emperor acquits him amid ap plause ; telling him, however, to remain so that he may converse with him in private. Apollonius thanks him ; but adds a stern reproof. "Through the wretches who surround you," he exclaims, "cities are destroyed, the islands are filled with exiles, the conti nent with groans, the armies with cowardice, and the senate with suspicion." Then he suddenly disappears from among them.4 1 vii. 39 (3): ?fio? ff ?none?av^o) fiq?' ?neivoi? ?fiiXetv tov? v?ov?, 'iva (irj?? Traisen r? roiavf ?-di?otvro. 2 viii. i : ?varvKovG?ai ??

Since Apollonius composed a speech which he was not allowed to deliver, Philostratus thinks that this too ought to be set before the reader. What he gives is an elaborate defence in which the philosopher repudiates all magical arts and all claims to divinity, except so far as good men may be said to participate in the divine. His life, pure from blood-sacrifice and other pollutions, brings him nearer to the gods, and the lightness of his diet enables him to form presages and hence to be of service to men. In turning men's souls from their vices he is of use to their rulers also, who find them more governable. This being so, if the people did think him a god, the deception would be a gain to the master of the flock.1 They did not think him a god, however, but only held the ancient opinion that by virtue men can participate in the divinity. A man who has something of divine order in his own soul can by wisdom draw away the souls of others from over-vehement desires of pleasure or wealth. For such an one, it is perhaps not impossible to with hold them from contact with murders; "but to wash them clean," adds the Pythagorean, "is possible neither for me nor for God the Maker of all."2 He is made to refer to some of the wonders rec orded in the biography ; but he disclaims the possession of power to keep a dying friend in life or to recover him from the dead. Had it been in his power to do either, he would have done it.3 In the part of his apology referring to the accusation of having said that if the Fates have determined that a certain man shall reign, then, though the Emperor kill him, he will come to life again, Apollo nius points out that such assertions are of the hyperbolical kind adapted to produce conviction in those who find things that are put consistently with the appearance of reason incredible.4 The implied view is obviously that of the Stoic determinism. If the predetermined event is infallible, its conditions are in reality equally 1 viii. 7 (21): ?gt' el /cai &amp;e?v rjyovvr?

Let the Emperor remember how ephemeral is good fortune, and put an end to the oppressions through which he has been made hateful to all, as all things have been made hateful to him. When Apollonius, as has been related, strangely disappeared,1 the tyrant did not break out into a rage, as most expected, but rather gave signs of trouble. This having taken place at Rome before noon, Apollonius appeared in the afternoon of the same day at Puteoli to Damis and Demetrius, as he had promised. He came to them when they were beginning to despair of ever seeing him again ; and convinced them by having a tangible body that he had not returned from the shades. After he has slept, he tells them that he is about to sail for Greece. Demetrius is afraid that he will not be sufficiently hidden there : to which he replies that, if all the earth belongs to the tyrant, they that die in the open day have a better part than they that live in concealment.2 To those in Greece who asked him how he had escaped, he merely said that his de fence had been successful. Hence when many coming from Italy related what had really happened, he was almost worshipped; being regarded as divine especially because he had in no way boasted of the marvellous mode of his escape. Of this residence in Greece one singular adventure is related. Apollonius desired to visit the cave of Trophonius at Lebadea in Bceotia. The priests refused to admit him ; making excuses to him personally but alleging to the people as their ground his being a sorcerer. He went, however, in the evening with his companions and forced his way in. In this he did what was so pleasing to the god that Trophonius appeared to the priests and rebuked them. To the inquiry of Apollonius, what philosophy he regarded as the 1 viii. 8 : ?aifi?vi?v re kov pa?iov elireiv rp?trov. 2 viii. 14.</page><page sequence="46">2o6 THE MONIST. best and purest, he replied by allowing him to carry off a book con taining the Pythagorean precepts. This book, says Philostratus, is now at Antium ; and his own opinion is that it was brought with some of the epistles of Apollonius to the Emperor Hadrian, and left in the palace there.1 A concourse of disciples from Ionia joined with those of Hellas to surround the philosopher ; and rhetoric lay neglected as an art that can teach only language. He kept his disciples away from the forensic orators (to?? ?yopaiov?) ; having always been hostile to them, and now, since he had seen the Roman prisons, regarding them and their money-making art as more responsible for the state of things there than the tyrant himself.2 About this time a crown (o-t &lt;?avo?) was seen around the sun obscuring its rays. The portent was fulfilled when Stephanus plotted the death of. Domitian, then fresh from the murder of Fla vius Clemens. Stephanus, says Philostratus, being the freedman of his wife?who was, like Clemens himself, a relation of Domitian, though not his sister, as Philostratus has it?avenged his death by attacking the tyrant with a spirit equal to that of the most freeborn Athenians. He proceeds to give an account of the tyrannicide, which, as we see, he approves in entire consistency with classical ethics. While this was taking place in Rome, Apollonius?having returned to Ionia after a stay of two years in Greece?was speak ing at Ephesus. Interrupting his discourse, which had gradually become troubled, he stepped forward three or four paces and cried out, "Strike the tyrant, strike!" Then he told his audience that Domitian had been slain at that hour ; and this vision of his from the gods was afterwards confirmed circumstantially.8 Near the end of Nerva's brief reign (96-98) he disappeared from among men, in some way that is not precisely known ; for he sent Damis away when the expected time approached, on the pre 1 viii. 19, 20. 2 viii. 22.

Damis does not even tell his age, which some make to have been eighty, some over ninety, and others more than a hundred. Ac cording to Philostratus, his statues in the temple at Tyana showed him to have possessed in a pre-eminent degree the charm which is sometimes found to accompany old age. Several legends are re lated of the manner in which he was called from earth.1 He always taught the immortality of the soul, but did not encourage the in dulgence of curiosity about its future. To a disputatious youth who, even after his departure, continued to argue against immor tality, he appeared in a vision and delivered an oracle. If the verses2 are by Apollonius, he would seem to have anticipated the attitude of Kant at the conclusion of his Tr?ume eines Geistersehers. Philostratus lastly tells us that he has found no tomb or cenotaph of Apollonius anywhere, but that everywhere he has met with mar vellous stories. The effect of the work of Philostratus on cultivated opinion was decisive. Apollonius was henceforth recognised as at least a philosopher and perhaps something more. Not that the marvels related produced this effect. No school was led by them to call itself after the name of Apollonius, and no one appealed to his wonder-working as evidence of the truth of the doctrines attributed to him. The feeling seems to have been?and, as we shall see, an adherent of the new religion was not entirely exempt from it? that here was undoubtedly a genuine moral and religious teacher. When, however, the struggle between Christianity and the estab lished polytheism reached its critical point, it occurred to one ad vocate of the old religion to select the Life of Apollonius as con taining wonders better authenticated than those appealed to by the Christians. The argument of Hierocles, so far as it can be gathered from Eusebius, was this: "You proclaim Jesus a god on account of a few prodigies recorded by your evangelists. We have writers of more education than yours and with more care for truth, who re viii. 30. 2 viii. 31 (3).</page><page sequence="48">2o8 THE MONIST. late similar wonders of Apollonius; and yet we, showing more solid judgment, do not make him a god on account of them, but only regard him as a man found pleasing to the gods." This is practically all that Eusebius tells us about the contents of the work written by Hierocles under the title Philalethes. Everything else in the book, he asserts, has been urged by others and has been already replied to. The parallel between Apollonius and Christ is all that is new, and this only will be taken up. What seems espe cially to have stung the father of ecclesiastical history is the taunt of Hierocles about the "heedlessness and lightness" (ciocia Kal Kov&lt;f&gt;?T7]s) of Christian belief, to which he recurs again and again. A brief analysis of his argument will not be uninstructive. He will waive, he tells us, such points as this,?that the com ing of Christ alone was foretold by the wise men of the Hebrews under divine inspiration, and that to this day devils are cast out by the power of his name, as the writer can testify from experience.1 Of the biographers referred to by Hierocles?namely, Maximus of iEgae, Damis the Assyrian, and Philostratus the Athenian?it will be sufficient to consider the last. From his trustworthiness, that of the rest may be judged. Accordingly the method of Eusebius is to examine in succession the eight books of Philostratus, point ing out in each the inconsistencies and incredibilities of the narra tive. I have no objection, he says, to placing Apollonius as high as any one likes among philosophers. But when his biographer, be he Damis the Assyrian, or Philostratus, or any one else, repre sents him, under cover of Pythagoreanism, as going beyond the bounds of philosophy, then he is really made out to be an ass in a lion's skin, a juggling quack instead of a philosopher. There are limits set to human powers which no man may transgress; though a higher being may condescend to the conditions of human nature. Was Apollonius then a divine being? If so, let the biographer preserve consistency through the whole narrative. He is said to have been announced to his mother before his birth as an incarna lAdversus Hieroclem, 4 : ela?ri Kai vvv rq? ?v&amp;?ov ?w?[xeu? rrjv apErrjv ?ici?eln vvrat fiox&amp;ypov? riva?

Whence did the writer get this? It cannot have been from a disciple who joined him long after in Nineveh.1 In one place he is made to describe himself as knowing all languages with out learning them. Yet he is said to have acquired the Attic mode of speech by discipline and attention, and not by nature, and to have been taken by his father to a rhetorician at Tarsus. Many things related of him, Eusebius allows, are credible as belonging to the history of a wise and good man. It is the attempt to ascribe to him a nature more than human that gives ground for blaming both the author and the subject of the biography. Passing from the first to the second book, Eusebius points out inconsistencies in the account of the journey to India and the meet ing with King Phraotes. He then dwells on the marvellous tales about India related in the third book. Behold, he exclaims, the incredibilities in which "Philalethes" glories; preferring Philo stratus to our divine evangelists not only as a man of highest edu cation but as careful about truth!2 Iarchas, the chief teacher among the Brahmans, is represented as sitting, in the manner of a satrap rather than of a philosopher, on a more elevated and more adorned seat than his fellows. This outward distinction by the marks of tyrannic privilege was a fitting mode of doing honor to the teacher of divine philosophy.8 The account by Philostratus of the vegetative growth like wool that enables the philosophers to dispense with clothing made from materials furnished by animals seems to require that we should think of them as laboring at the loom,?unless we are to suppose that this substance of its own accord changes into their sacred raiment.4 That Apollonius praised the automatic mechanisms of the sages is inconsistent with his not caring to know of them in detail or to emulate them.5 Not till the return of Apollonius from India does the biogra pher, in the fourth book, make him begin his wonderful works. Yet, had he been of a diviner nature than that of man, one would 1 Adversus Hieroclem, 8.

Eusebius then scornfully comments on the account of his destroy ing the plague of Ephesus. The story about the ghost of Achilles, he proceeds, is also full of absurdities and inconsistencies. The ghost appears at dead of night and disappears at cockcrow ; cir cumstances which would be appropriate enough in the case of evil demons, but are out of place when related of the soul of a hero. The "heedlessness" of the writer in his accounts of the casting out of a demon from a young man, and of the chasing away of the lamia, does not need much elaboration of proof ; for this, as they say, is a casting out of demons by demons.1 The raising of a maiden from death to a second life is most incredible, and to Phil ostratus himself seems a marvel to be explained away.2 Had such a wonder really been performed by Apollonius at Rome, it would hardly have escaped the attention of the Emperor and of all his subordinates, and especially of the philosopher Euphrates who at that time was there, and who would not have failed afterwards to include this among his accusations of magic. In his interviews with Vespasian, this steersman of an Egyp tian ship?for such Apollonius told the Indian sage that he had been in a former life?gives himself the airs of a god and of a king maker. He commends Euphrates to Vespasian ; and afterwards, when he is at variance with him, speaks of him to Domitian as the worst of men. How does Philostratus reconcile this with the pre science he attributes to his hero? Evidently, if the wonders re lated by the writer actually took place, Apollonius performed them by the aid of a demon. Had the superhuman insight he displays on some occasions been of a divine character, he would have dis played it always, and would never have needed to inquire about anything. The fact that he foreknows some things and not others is best explained by the theory of demoniac assistance.8 As was 1 Adversus Hieroclem, 30 : ?a'i/Lt,ova? y?p aitikavvu aXku ?Xkov) y Qaot, ?ai/iovi. 2Ibid. : ?moT?TC?Tov Kai avr? ???av r?

From the accusation of magic that was brought against Apol lonius his biographer is anxious to defend him. The incident in the dungeon, however, by which Damis is said to have been first convinced of his superhuman powers, if true, plainly confirms the charge. The explanation here suggested by Eusebius is that an impression made on the imagination of Damis by his master's asso ciate demon (wo rov irap&amp;pov Saifiovos) caused him to see the fetter apparently removed and then replaced.1 Apollonius, it is here evident, did not know the future ; for he prepared a long defence which, in the event, was not needed. Moreover, if we examine that defence, we shall find a sufficient justification of the charge of magic by merely comparing his own definition of a sorcerer as a professor of false wisdom (i/^vooo-o^os) with the things recorded of him by Philostratus. In what he says to Domitian about the words he had uttered on Necessity, he evades the true charge that he had predicted his end ; and is thus placed before us as a flatterer and a liar and anything rather than a philosopher. Perhaps, however, the falsehood comes from his biographers. In that case, where are the "men of highest education" of "Philalethes"? The splen dor of the truth has convicted them as plainly liars and uneducated men and jugglers.2 Lastly, says Eusebius, arriving at the culmination, Philostra tus, having thrown doubt on the place and manner of his departure from life, will have it that Apollonius went to heaven bodily, ac companied by an unexpected song of maiden voices.3 Selecting now, as an example of his false doctrine,4 the utter ances attributed to him on the certainty of fate, Eusebius ends with some commonplace libertarian declamation:5 remarking finally that, should any still think fit to place Apollonius among philoso phers, he does not object, if only they will clear him of the false 1 Adversus Hieroclem, 39. 2Adversus Hieroclem, 43 : ipevorag kvapy??

We may go on now to consider briefly an interesting problem raised by the reforming activity of the phi losopher or prophet of Tyana. Eusebius does not suggest that Philostratus himself had either a hostile or a friendly intention with regard to Christianity. Yet it seems likely that, living when he did, he had some slight bias one way or the other. One passage might be adduced in support of the former view. The declaration of Apollonius, that not even the supreme Deity can wash away the stain of murder, if it were found in Julian, could safely be set down as pointed against the Christian ecclesiastical doctrine. To Philostratus, however, it probably appeared as simply a re-affirmation of the higher ethical view, at once poetic and philosophic, against the imaginations of the multitude that by prayers or ceremonies the necessary expia tion to be undergone by the soul itself?perhaps in a series of lives ?can be dispensed with. This idea of an inflexible moral order, not to be derived from arbitrary volitions, severe or indulgent, was an important part of the Hellenic conception of an ethically re formed religion ; but, to bring it into relief, no contrast was needed except that which Plato had drawn between the philosophic thinker on religion and the popular " medicine-man." The aim of Philo stratus, in spite of his introduction of marvels, was to make it quite clear that Apollonius was not this kind of person ; and indeed the position about sacrifices which by universal consent was his ought to be of itself sufficient to prove that he was not. While there is thus nothing to show hostility to Christianity on the part of Philostratus, there is some slight evidence of a not unfriendly intention. The Syrian emperors of the third century, for whom he wrote, were themselves favorably disposed to the new religion. And in representing Apollonius as accused of perpetrat ing a ritual murder, may he not have meant to hint at the absurd</page><page sequence="53">APOLLONIUS OF TYANA. 213 ity of the vulgar accusations against the Christians? This seems at least possible. That Christianity should become the exclusive religion of the State he would certainly not have desired. What he hoped for was, we may judge, a system of toleration accom panied by ethical reform of the local cults wherever such reform might be needed. Of Christianity itself he probably knew little. He was not one of those who had caught a glimpse of the theo cratic aims of the Church.1 Indeed Themistius the Peripatetic, and Ammianus Marcellinus the military historian, had scarcely ap preciated those aims in the latter part of the fourth century. Even after the victory of Christianity they seem to have still cherished dreams of a mutual toleration; taking the ground natural to sensible men of the world imbued with secular culture who saw the general agreement of all the organised doctrines, philosophic or religious, on practical morals'. They could hardly have imagined that what must have seemed to men of their type so moderate and obvious a solution would have to wait, not for its triumph but for a mere be ginning of its effective recognition, to the time of Locke. The r?gime of "religious liberty," desirable as it must always have seemed to statesmen who were not bigots, has not always been practicable for governments sincerely anxious to uphold free dom of opinion. The repression of the rising Christian Church in the second century was probably, in its inception, a policy similar to the legislation of modern States against the reactionary con spiracies fomented by Catholic organisation in its death-struggle ; though the exact degree of knowledge of those who attempted it, and the degree of harshness in the methods used, may be forever impossible to discern through the cloud of ecclesiastical legend. 1 In spite of its defective information on the detail of Jewish antiquities, there is evidence in the fifth book of his Histories that Tacitus had gained some real insight into the spirit of intolerant theocracy which, at once dislodged and liberated by the destruction of Jerusalem, was shaping for itself a new embodiment in the incipient Catholic hierarchy. See especially c. 5. On the support furnished by theocracy to monarchy, compare what he says about the Hasmonaean kings, "qui mobilitate vulgi expulsi, resumpta per arma dominatione fugas civium, urbium eversiones, fratrum coniugum parentum neces aliaque solita regibus ausi super stitionem fovebant, quia honor sacerdotii firmamentum potential adsumebatur" (Hist. v. 8).</page><page sequence="54">214 THE MONIST. An attempt to show how a more clearly conceived policy of the kind, aided instead of thwarted by accident, might have been suc cessful in throwing Christianity back on the East, has been made by M. Renouvier in his Uchronie. According to M. Renouvier's hypothetical reconstruction of history, the official Stoicism retains the direction of opinion ; the extra-legal power of the Emperor is gradually reduced with a view to the restoration of the Republic ; slavery is brought to an end by legislation under the continued Stoical influence, instead of being left, as it actually was, to be slowly extinguished in the Middle Ages through economical causes unassisted by directing ideas. The process of return from the type of society initiated by the Caesarean revolution being thus accel erated, Europe about the ninth century is a little in advance of what actually became its condition in the nineteenth. The empire of the West has in the meantime been resolved into a system of national republics in friendly alliance. The Christian propaganda is re-admitted when the force of the Catholic idea has spent itself in the East in mutual massacre and abortive crusading. Thus, in the hypothetical reconstruction, formal toleration of all sects, reli gious or philosophic, becomes at length the official system, as it is in the actual modern world after a far more wasteful struggle. It is tempting to take this sketch as a basis and to make mod ifications in it by giving a more definite part than M. Renouvier does to the Neo-Pythagorean and Neo-Platonic movements. To bring about, for example, the abolition of the customs of animal sacrifice and of divination by inspection of victims, the ideas of a reformer like Apollonius were necessary; Stoicism having some what derogated from its philosophical character by defending the official religion as a whole. Again, to an idealist the Neo-Platonic metaphysics ought to seem an advance on the Stoic materialism. And indeed it seems clear that, in the absence of Christianity, Neo Platonism and not Stoicism would finally have assumed the direc tion of opinion in the Empire. Had this been the course of events, Graeco-Roman civilisation would have preserved its organic con tinuity, and the barbarian attack would doubtless have been thrown off. In the latter part of the second century the conservative</page><page sequence="55">APOLLONIUS OF TYANA. patriotism of Celsus foresaw that, as things were, the latent civil war kept up by the imperium in imperio of the Church would be fatal; that, unless the Christians could be persuaded to yield the required allegiance to the State, the whole fabric would sooner or later go down under the shock of invasion. He did not indeed foresee the recovery ; but expressed the apprehension that the reli gion of the Christians itself, as well as true philosophy, would be submerged in universal chaos. This, as we know, did not in the end come about ; though the prospect might seem near being real ised in the dark centuries of the West between the end of antiquity and the beginning of new life in the Middle Age. What then would have been the result if the break-up had been averted? Would Western civilisation have assumed a fixed form analogous to those of the East though superior,?combining, let us say, the political order of China with the higher speculative thought of India and with a legal system that recognises rights as well as duties, but never developing new forms of freedom or new lines of art and thought? Or would there have been such accelerated progress as M. Renouvier has imagined? A progressive movement might be conceived as starting from interaction between the Roman Empire and the free but undis ciplined tribes of the North, when these, kept at length within their own boundaries, settled down to a life of comparative peace and began to draw their higher culture, as they would have done, from the old civilisation of Europe. We might then suppose an ethnic republic arising in the North?say, in Scandinavia?and, by offering to the South a new type for imitation instead of the city republic of the past, leading to a system of independent national States. As the imperial absolutism, according to the hypothesis, remains unconsecrated by a new hierocracy, we should naturally suppose a transition from the monarchical to the republican form less violent than the French Revolution. Thus we should come round to M. Renouvier's result in a different manner. It would be easy to fill in details and, by selecting factors with a view to the required product, to show how every distinctive element in modern civilisation might have been evolved.</page><page sequence="56">2l6 THE MONIST. M. Renouvier himself, however, at the conclusion of his "apoc ryphal sketch," has sufficiently indicated at once the possibilities and the limitations of this kind of reconstruction ; and the scientific interest of any such attempt cannot, of course, be in its positive result?since the result is necessarily unverifiable?though it may suggest new ways of looking at the actual process of history. We are led to see that in the complexity of real circumstances factors intervene which from time to time make continuous progress im possible.1 Perhaps it is irrational even to desire that there should have been continuous progress ; as Heraclitus thought Homer irra tional for giving utterance to the aspiration "that strife might be destroyed from among gods and men " ; since this would mean the destruction of the cosmic harmony itself. It is still possible to apply the teleological idea in Kant's sense to the historical pro cess. That is to say, we may use it as a "regulative idea" to in terpret history as it was ; though we may not use it to inform us as to what history in general must have been. Taking it in the first sense, and using the terms of post-Kantian metaphysics, we might regard the pseudo-synthesis of Athanasius and Augustine and the rest, itself entirely without human value, as the obstacle posited by the world-soul in order to rise more explicitly to the idea of spirit ual freedom. This is not of course to deny that there are gleams of borrowed light in their Kingdom of Darkness; but it is to deny the too anthropomorphic teleology of Comte, with its insistence that the Catholic ideal, as one expression of the "human provi dence," must have been a progressive phase in the history of hu manity.2 The immanent reason in things, being cosmic and not simply human, works in the affairs of man also through pauses like night and winter. Such seasons, we know, bear the germs of the future ; and the 1 A recent example of this kind is the overgrowth of industrialism throughout the civilised world. It is remarkable that two poets so unlike in many respects as Wordsworth and Shelley foresaw the imminent evil of plutocracy in the early years of the nineteenth century. 2 Comte predicted results almost purely beneficent from modern industrialism; though it must be allowed that his disciples have no more love for the present hypertrophy of commerce than other philosophers.</page><page sequence="57">apollonius of tyana. 217 future is more than simply a return to a vanished past. To histo rical Christianity may be assigned on one side the merit of partially appropriating the idealistic metaphysic which was the legacy of Hellenic thought ; and, on the other side, of preserving, in the documents to which it appealed for its authoritative dogma, ele ments of ethical culture which, when cleared of their dogmatic superstructure, could be seen to contain something emotionally unique. In the Hebrew prophets there is a more ardent, though not a purer and certainly not a nobler, morality than that of classical antiquity even in its final stage ; and the teaching of the Gospel has become, when disassociated from a creed which was always extra neous to it, the inspiration of a more impassioned, though not of a wider, philanthropy. The first modern to bring out clearly the per manent ethical value of the Christian as well as of the Hebrew documents was Spinoza, who was enabled to do it by having dis carded more systematically than any one before him the whole framework of rabbinical and ecclesiastical dogma. Since, however, the problem of making a new synthesis of the elements of ethical and intellectual culture still remains, there seems to be some advan tage in returning for inspiration to more than one source. The movement of moral and religious reform from within the Hellenic world failed, owing to the circumstances of the time, as much through its merits as through any shortcomings that may be as cribed to it. Its philosophical idea of divine justice, as we have seen, was opposed to the doctrine of vicarious punishment distilled by Christian theology from the lower paganism. And for a time the original Christian teaching, such as Biblical critics now suppose it to have been, failed more tragically than the Hellenic movement. Graeco-Roman civilisation indeed was broken up ; and the Chris tian Church conquered : but, on the other hand, the genuine Hel lenism has been easier to rediscover than the teaching of Jesus, which, in its association with the ecclesiastical system, became distorted almost if not quite beyond recognition. In the endeavor after restoration, may not the "Hebraist" and the "Hellenist," in the true sense of both terms, regard themselves as co-operating to a common result? London, England. T.
