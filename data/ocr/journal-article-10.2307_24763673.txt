<plain_text><page sequence="1">A RELIGIONS APPROACH TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BIBLICAL TRADITION J.S. CUMPSTY The title requires seme explication. The dcxnestic or "in tradition" approach to the Biblical tradition when it is concerned with development at all might examine the unfolding of a progressive revelation, the stages in both ohronos and kairos (but particularly the latter) in which religious truths were made known to man by God. A ccmparative history of religions approach to the development of the tradition might concern itself more with the ohronos of the process particularly if it were concerned to unravel the mutual interaction of religious traditions and to retrace the paths by which religious ideas, ccming to birth in one culture, became available to another. By a "religions" approach we have in mind one vrtiich concerns itself not with the question "where did this symbol ccme frcm?" but rather with the question "why, in the whole market place of ideas, did this particular symbol beccme important to this particular people at this particular mcment in time?" This approach seeks to relate belief to experience. It in no way denies the revealed nature of religious truth, but it is concerned less with the sources of the symbol than with the experiential process vdiich rendered the symbol both credible and significant. We presume in this paper that which we have argued elsewhere (1) that religion of whatever type is basically concerned with the nature of the ultimately real and how one belongs to it; and that as socio-cultural experience changes so will the sensed nature of the ultimately real and therefore one's mode of belonging to it, and that herein lies the credibility and significance or otherwise of symbols. A "religions" approach is offered today because we found it fruitful in seeking to explain the symbols of the Biblical tradition to someone whose background lay in the Indian rather than the Mosaic family of religions and because that experience suggested that it might provide the best framework for presenting the Biblical tradition, even domestically, in an age of rapid change in which symbols tend to lose msaning and in an era in which the question of credibility is ever present. 13</page><page sequence="2">14 The approach is not of course new. It is, for example, a strong thread in Walther Eichrodt's (2) theology of the Old Testament and is enshrined in Heinrich Ott's (3) opinion, which we may summarize as : "a theology of revelation presupposes two parties, the revealer and the one addressed who is nan in his concrete reality". Perhaps our emphasis on experience is even greater than Ott's; yet the approach by its very concern with the concrete situation - with the legitimating experience rather than with the symbol legitimated - locates revelation in a providential history and lays emphasis on a living God rather than on a collection of timeless authoritative propositions. One could also hope that the approach might overcome the tendency of the classroom lecturer to sum up almost two millennia of a people's history, rather less than 10% of which was spent as a free and united people in their own land, in a few stories of how the little man of faith triumphed over the "big baddie". Prior to c1650 B.C.E. we find Israel's ancestors in Mesopotamia presumably espousing their particular form of what we have elsewhere called "nature religion". (4) By "nature religion" we mean that type of religion in which the universe of experience is viewed as monistic, and the world-out there is real and it (or significant parts of it) is regarded as divine, i.e. it is innianentist in the strongest sense of the word. Time is necessarily cyclical and the religion is therefore texture rather than goal orientated and tends to be a behaviour (right relationship) rather than a belief pattern. Fran there to the inception of Christianity it is possible to discern four distinctive periods of experience each culminating in a mcment of symbolic consolidation, which symbols are then carried forward to interpret and be challenged by the experience of the proceeding period as the tradition moves towards becoming a religion of "secular world affirmation", (5) falters and then moves on again as the consequences of each step are worked through. THE SEEDS OF TRANSCENDENCE (The Migration; Abraham to Sinai) It has been noted by students of African religious history, Sundkler (6) and Hodgson (7) amongst them, that early converts to Christianity were from groups that were either geographically or culturally migrant. If we ask why these groups were prepared to accept the Christian faith with its central symbol of transcendence which conflicts so strongly with their own previous tradition, the reason is not far to seek. While acknowledging the kaleidoscopic potential for rearrangement of any cultural disturbance we believe that there is a tendency to locate the ultimately real where one's hope is.</page><page sequence="3">15 If one affirms the status quo one becomes immanentist. If, on the other hand, one cannot for seme reason affirm the present experience and one is not locked into it, then one moves towards transcendence; symbolized spatially and temporally as the divine being above and greater than this present experience to be fully knewn in seme future eschaton. The particular symbols may of course portray the recovery of seme lost and idealized past. The form of nature religion embraced in Mesopotamia by Israel's ancestors was a this-worldly, pessimistic, conflicted monism; the present experience was largely unacceptable but they were locked in and without future hope. Migration opened up the possibility of a this-worldly acceptable future, sowing the seeds of transcendence and changing the religion to one of premise and fulfilment. Whether Israel's monotheism owed its emphasis upon one deity to the Mesopotamian practice of covenanting with an appropriate deity in the pantheon (much as a peasant catholic might develop a devotion to a particular saint which overshadows other beliefs and practices) which in migration became the only significant deity; or whether the principal emphasis was the harmonious monism of Egypt vrtiich Akhenaten had dared to make explicit in the single symbol of the solar disc, may never be clear. We are certain, however, that the sense of transcendence which legitimates the turning of monism into monotheism was a product of generations of geographical and cultural migration. The profound corporate experience of the exodus and the genius of Moses provided the occasion and the instrument for the symbolic consolidation of this religious development but the deep change in the sensed nature of reality which legitimated the new symbols was surely forged over generations. A sense of transcendence which was rooted to the degree suggested by prohibition of images in an image-filled world had the necessary corollary of a move to a profounder, because necessary, sense of the personal in the Deity. In a monistic world, the forces in the closed system of cause and effect may be conceptualized as personal or as impersonal but they are largely mechanistic; if the right button is pressed at A the right effect will occur at B, or if ill fortune occurs the diviner's task is to discover the reason and the means of restoring the harmony. In a dualist world view in which the Creator is wholly other than the creation no such mechanistic connection can exist and volition is the only possible conceptualization of the relation between the Divine and His creation necessitating an emphasis on personality. With this move we pass from what Frankfort calls a mythopoeic world view to what he calls the "Myth of the will of God". The religion has beccnte goal orientated and necessarily corporate because</page><page sequence="4">16 it looks for a Kingdom not moksha or enlightenment. The failure to meet norms becomes sin rather than foolishness and knowledge of the divine is understood as revelation rather than as the wisdom of distilled experience. The ultimately real can no longer be related to by entering into the rhythms of nature, that is by relating to an immediate which is itself related to all that lies beyond, but the relation necessarily becomes one of covenant, of volitional agreement. So in the consolidation of the symbols of transcendence, the covenant nation is bom: its side of the covenant agreement is the performance of a divine law, while the Deity's side is the provision of a land and a blessed future; and in this development the foundations for a revealed tradition are laid. FOOTING THE SYMBOLS (The Heroic Period; Wilderness -co Qnpire) The history of Israel frcm the Wilderness days to the empire of David and Solanon may be described as the heroic period in which took place the struggle to bring to fruition the national and very material expectations of the Sinai covenant. This is the struggle which is symbolized in the little man of faith (be it Gideon, Samson or the young David) overccming the mighty, and which in the end succeeded in an inpressive degree and served above all to root the symbols of transcendence, covenant, future fulfilment, sin and charisma deep in the consciousness of Israel, and to forge a number of consequential symbols such as symbolic tabernacling and the licenced prophetic voice raised in criticism of the secular state. In the irrmediate post-heroic period, that is late in David's reign and throughout Solomon's, we get that moment of fulfilment in which culture, in particular literacy, flowers and with it the second point of symbolic consolidation represented by the material in the J source and the history of the throne succession. FLOWERING OF TRANSCENDENCE (The National Decline and Spiritual Development; Division to Exile) The period frcm the division of the Kingdom to the Exile is one of national decline and spiritual development in which mcments of sudden, short-lived and badly handled prosperity interspersed with mcments of collapse and despair lead to the flowering of the symbols of transcendence in the hands of the prophets. There is, of course, in this post-climactic period, at one level, a stagnant sense which brought the temptation to return to nature religion, in this case the Ba'al cult and its corollary, a sacral form of monarchy.</page><page sequence="5">17 It is at this point that the deep-rootedness of the symbols of transcendence becomes apparent, for hope in a historic salvation in continuity with the present order is maintained in the teeth of the evidence for three and a half centuries. The manner in which the historic salvation is conceived matures but it remains in historic continuity. In the maturing process the once and future king, the messianic greater David, remains a human figure; the hoped for kingdom becomes less one of dominion and more one of peace, prosperity and social justice as represented by Micah's picture of a man sitting under his own fig tree and his own vine eating the produce thereof. The process moves from there via Isaiah of Jerusalem's understanding that good will come of the suffering because God is sovereign over history and nations; through Jeremiah's incredible understanding of the prospect of captivity in Babylon, as an act of God's love to a people who need a new exodus and new covenant based on forgiveness and a changed heart, if the conditional and the unconditional, the demand and acceptance of the covenant tradition are to be reconciled; to the climax of Isaiah of Babylon's presentation of the privilege of suffering service in which the servant who has sinned and suffered and cried for vindication must learn to turn the other cheek even when suffering though sinless. Ihe events of 721 followed by the fall of Jerusalem which destroyed the old symbols of divine presence and favour, the temple and monarchy also brought to an end the period of prophetic reinterpretation of the symbols of transcendence and gave rise to an intense period of symbolic consolidation in which the locus of divine tabernacling shifted to a scripture, in particular to a Law, and the move towards that balance between behaviour and belief, texture and goal which characterizes modern Judaism had begun. FALTERING OF TRANSCENDENCE (The National Persecution; Cyrus to Caesar) The period from the Exile to the inception of Christianity is marked by almost continual national persecution of varying degrees of intensity - Babylonians, Persians, Ptolemies, Seleucids, then a brief respite under the Maccabees which itself turned sour and finally the Romans, ending in the events of 70 C.E. The hope of an historical salvation, which had survived 721 and even 586 briefly, became untenable and the symbol of transcendence faltered and with it the voice of prophecy. The tradition had two alternatives and both were utilized. It could give up the symbols of transcendence altogether and</page><page sequence="6">18 seek to return to a type of nature religion with its cyclical time, there being nothing new under the sun, and that form of religious knowledge arising in the intellectual distillation of the universal experience of mankind vtfiich we find in the Wisdom literature. We say "seek to return" for even Koheleth who moves closest to it cannot return to being a contented nature religionist for the seeds of transcendence had been sown and he regards the cycles of nature, grand as they are, with bitterness of spirit. It is here perhaps that the tradition of Israel canes closest to the experience which gave rise to withdrawal religions (8) cradled in India. It is interesting to note that seen in this way Job remains in the prophetic tradition. Ranove chapter 28, the hymn to wisdcm, and the prologue which owes more to apocalyptic than to wisdcm and one has a book in viiich nature rather than history beccmes the attest of the trustworthiness of God but in which, unlike Koheleth, nature is not viewed for itself but as pointing beyond itself to its creator, and as such premises an historical vindication. The other possibility, rather than letting go of the future and confronting the unpratiising present, is to let go of this world and maintain a hope in a future which is no longer in historic continuity with the untenable present but exists in radical discontinuity frcm it. Either God will intervene in history to rule it through a messianic figure who is necessarily more than human and represents the divine breaking in; or there will be an end to this era and a new one created for the righteous and perhaps also for the evil who, as justice demands, must have their deserts. This apocalyptic tradition opens up new possibilities in the Hebrew tradition for man beyond the ravages of time and death but in doing so presses transcendence until it has nothing to transcend, for this world ceases to belong to the ultimately real and is far frcm that prophetic orthodoxy which pictures God approving the works of His hands. History ceases to reveal the character of the divine. It could not anyway for the radical monotheism of e.g. Isaiah dissolves into a temporary conflicted dualism in which history only serves to manifest God's power not his character. Since revelation remains the form of religious knowledge in this ultra-transcendence and history has ceased to be its vehicle, the Voice of God beccmes personified much as the Wisdcm of God does in the Wisdcm tradition. The tradition therefore stands poised awaiting the symbols which will heal the fragmentation between the recognition of a grand but unfulfilling nature, an affirmation of history which no longer seems credible and an historically discontinuous future hope which has lost religious touch with the present.</page><page sequence="7">19 Alongside this faltering of the symbols of transcendence with their providential sense of history went other consequential problems and opportunities. We have noted that with a transcendent view of the ultimately real there is the need to belong to it via a volitional covenant. This can exist in two forms or seme blend of them. It can take the indirect and corporate, i.e. the catholic, form in which the Divine is seen to have established a bridgehead in the world, an institution which belongs to Him, and in belonging to which the individual belongs to God. In this case the elect nation, later the Church, is the institution into which one is bom or initiated and maintained by symbols of belonging and restoration; circumcision, food laws, atonement, etc. which are largely matters of behaviour. On the other hand the relationship can take the direct and individual, i.e. the protestant, form in which the individual relates to God directly by faith or obedience. Faith as trust tends to become a matter of right belief concerning which there can be greater certainty, and obedience tends to become a matter of works, i.e. observance of a law, rather than the spirit of righteousness. The Eighth Century had isolated, through Amos, Isaiah and Hosea, the ingredients of the Divine character of righteousness: sovereignty and love. We noted Jeremiah's struggle to hold together the conditional and unconditional, the demand and acceptance elements of the covenant tradition. In this post exilic period, as Eichrodt notes, the tradition is silent on the love of God; trust and obedience, the responses to sovereignty and righteousness are stressed. With the decline in the credibility of a historic salvation there is a decline in the credibility of the elect nation as the link with God, much as nctninalism destroyed the credibility of the Church as an ark sailing to salvation and created the need for the individual symbol of belonging, "justification by faith alone". It is no longer simply the Israelite who belongs to God but the righteous Israelite or even the righteous man. Because the sense of transcendence had necessitated a highly personal view of God, the notion of individual responsibility to God and therefore of sin had always been present yet the corporate mode of belonging predaninated. New however, vrtiile the wisdom tradition tended to return to "foolishness" rather than sin, the heightened transcendence of the apocalyptic tradition, together with the weakening of the corporate symbol of belonging, pressed the emphasis towards the individual mode of belonging through "righteousness", cashed as doing the works of the law, although in minority movements such as that of Qumran the corporate mode of belonging is still to be found, an Israel within Israel. On the heretical fringe the Wisdcm of Solomon flirts with the idea of immortal souls, that is, with drawing the transcendence gap not between God</page><page sequence="8">20 and all the rest of the creation including man, but within man himself, placing the soul on the Godward side and the body on that of the creation, replacing the covenantal question of the relation of man to God with an ontological question concerning the relation of body and soul, spirit and matter. In the main stream the tension between demand and acceptance, between the conditional and the unconditional in the covenant tradition had heightened. Judaism attempted to resolve it in anthropomorphic fashion by the analogy of the good parent who is neither too demanding nor too accepting, but this not only loses the impetus of the radicalized demand and acceptance but requires that the parents sometimes pretend not to see, a fiction that cannot be extended to God, which results in an interpretation of acceptance as a failure to care. At this point the path divides.We will follow the Christian path but one could equally well examine the symbolic consolidation represented by the Talmud. The period of symbolic consolidation represented by the inception of Christianity resolved the conflicts which we have observed and drew together the gains in each of the traditions in its own particular way. The cross served a number of related purposes. It placed the Divine character of love, self-sacrificial love, firmly in the centre. It radicalized the demand and the acceptance;in that the figure on the cross was human, it set the standard for human righteousness; in that He was Divine it proclaimed the unlimited extent of God's loving acceptance of man while he is yet a sinner; and in externalizing the cost to God of His caring it made it possible for a St Paul to proclaim "you are accepted, believe it" not "believe and you will be accepted" without it being possible to conclude that God did not care vhat standard man achieved. Finally there emerges the image of God as a Father taking the last costly step of parenthood in letting the child go to make his cwn mistakes with all the inherent risks for both parties, and to enter into the voluntary relationship of friend or parent rather than of child. The symbol of the resurrection affirms, over against that of immortal souls, the eternal possibilities in the whole creation not just in a part of man, for it returns the transcendence gap to the orthodox position. It also draws together the prophetic tradition and the gains of the apocalyptic view, for it contains elements of continuity and of transformation. It is the Carpenter of Nazareth who is raised, but He is now beyond the limitations imposed by space and time. The symbol of the Ascension and its obverse, Incarnation, draw together what Moses had symbolically separated - Creator and creation in a relationship which gives eternal significance to the creation without destroying its secularity</page><page sequence="9">21 One can be thoroughly world-affirming without losing a goal orientation which goes beyond the limitation of time and space; and without having to judge this world as though it were the final conclusion of all things. Incarnation, extended and universalized in a Church, retains the possibility of an indirect belonging which gives the individual the sense of being held by God when he cannot hold onto Him, while the united but radicalized demand and acceptance enlivens the individual belonging at a level which goes beyond even that of parent and child, and in the process prevents the power of the corporate entity frcm becoming corrupting. Moses in pointing to a God vrtio was to be known in historical activity was perhaps the first sociologist of religion, in seeking to trace the relationship between experience, type of religion, i.e. ontology, the nature of the religious object, and the node of belonging. We do not believe that we have been unfaithful to that tradition in an age when the communication of religion frcm faith to faith is bedevilled with the lack of credibility in the symbols employed. We propose that there is a role for science of religion, not only in academia, but within the domestic enclaves of any religion, particularly in the secular world affirming religions of the Mosaic family.
