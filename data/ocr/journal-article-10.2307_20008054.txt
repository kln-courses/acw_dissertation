TIDWELL HOLY ARGUMENT: SOME REFLECTIONS ON THE JEWISH PIETY OF ARGUMENT, PROCESS THEOLOGY AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION Argument is the very life-blood of philosophy and, hence, prima facie one might expect that distinctive phenomenon of the Jewish religious tradition, 'holy argument', to be of special interest to philosophers, particularly philosophers of religion. However, there is little to suggest that those engaged in the philosophical approach to religion are even aware that such a phenomenon as a piety of argument exists. But it does. In the philosophical field rational argument conducted according to the established rules of logic is the fundamental tool in the pursuit of truth and understanding or for the clarification of problems, ideas and concepts; in Judaism, rational, legal argument pursued according to recognized principles and processes is the most highly commended path to encounter and engagement with God. Moreover, within this same religious tradition, 'holy argument' embraces not only argument about God, about His nature (theology), His ways (theodicy) and His will (halakhah), but also argument with God, putting God on trial and taking Him to task as One who is Himself bound and judged by that same Torah that Israel is obligated to obey. The high value placed upon study and the exercise of the intellect in the Jewish tradition is well known; it is not only a mitzvah and an act of worship1 but a form of imitatio Dei,2 for God Himself engages in the study of Torah.3 But the mode of study inJudaism and the form in which the intellect is exercised is characteristically that of argument and debate, the quintessential activity of philosophy and philosophers. 'Holy argument', and especially that form of it which engages in argument 1 On study as worship see B. T. Viviano, Study as Worship. Aboth and the New Testament (Brill, Leiden, I973). S. Zeitlin, Studies in the Early History of Judaism, vol. I (Ktav), 'An Historical Study of the First Canonisation of the Hebrew Liturgy', pp. 2I-2 (= Jewish Quarterly Review 36 (1946), pp. 217-I 8) states that tefillah in certain contexts in the Pentateuch and the Prophets signifies 'study'. 2 Torah study thus goes along with graciousness, compassion (Deut. I3), clothing the naked (Gen. 3:21), visiting the sick (Gen i8:i), comforting mourners (Gen. 25:6) and Sabbath observance as activities and qualities wherein humans imitate God.

TIDWELL with God, has a long history withinJudaism and its religious antecedents. Its roots lie in the religion of ancient Israel where it can be traced back to at least the ninth or tenth centuries B.C.E. We first encounter this phenomenon in Genesis i8:22-23 where Abraham argues with God over the fate of the inhabitants of Sodom.' But the golden age for 'contending with God' was the era of the classical prophets from the eighth to the sixth centuries B.C.E. Among the various forms and genres employed by the prophets for the proclamation of their message was the ribh or lawsuit in which God summons Israel to court to argue a case with Him.5 One of the earliest and clearest examples of this genre is Micah 6: I-3. Legal language pervades this short pericope - 'plead your case', 'controversy' and 'contend'6 (all translating the Hebrew rabh) and 'answer' ("aneh). This device is frequent in the prophets and it portrays God, either as plaintiff or accused7 engaging in the cut and thrust of legal argument with His people, Israel. Outside the canon of the Prophets in Tanakh but written possibly towards the end of the era of the pre-exilic prophets is the most widely known and famous of all biblical arguments with God, the book ofJob. Job is a difficult book to analyse and understand; its literary structure and evolution are complex. For example, is the folk-tale of the prose prologue and epilogue an integral part of the original composition or a later addition in the interests of ' orthodoxy'? Or, again, what exactly do the speeches of Elihu contribute to the argument and what is the function of the speeches of Yahweh in the development of the debate? Job's own arguments over the vexed question of innocent suffering seem to represent a passionate and sustained attack on self-assured but naive and dogmatic traditional theodicy and yet, in the end, Job appears to abandon reason and yields submissively to what might be seen as a truculent and irrational display of divine omnipotence. A lot of ink has been spent trying to explain the denouement of the Joban drama8 and we must return to this issue later in this paper. However, for the present, let it simply be said thatJob stands as the fullest and most sustained argument 4 This passage of the Pentateuch is widely attributed to the so-called J stratum of Genesis, a crystallization of ancient traditions in writing probably from the time of David or Solomon. So, among others, G. von Rad, Genesis (SCM OT Library, London, I96I), p. Igg, and R. A. Speiser, Genesis, (Anchor Bible I (Doubleday, New York, I964), p. I 30. 5 For the ribh in the prophets see Isa. I: 2ff., 3: 13-15; Jer. 2:4-9; Micah I: 2-7; Hosea 4: I-4. G. E. Wright, The Old Testament against its Environment (SCM), describes the heavenly rfbh as 'the conceptual setting of Israel's classical prophecy'. Two foundational studies of the prophetic law-suit which examine the genre in some detail are: B. Gemser, 'The Rib - or Controversy - Pattern in Hebrew Mentality', in M. Noth and D. W.

Among the many ways in which the early rabbis reshaped and transformed second Temple Judaism after the disaster of 70 C.E., one basic way was through their commitment to Torah as the foundation of Jewish religious life and as the central symbol of Jewish faith.10 However, these rabbis, who drew this new Torah ontology out of the earlier tradition and gave to it that centrality inJewish religious life formerly held by the Temple, were heirs of the Pharisaic tradition of the dual Torah; for them; as for 'main stream' Judaism since then, Torah consists of Written and Oral Torah, torah shebiktav and torah shebe'al pe.1' In a nutshell, Written Torah is Scripture (Tanakh, but especially the Pentateuch or chumash) while Oral Torah is the interpretation of Written Torah,12 the means by which the divine will enshrined in Scripture is kept relevant and contemporary within the chang ing circumstances of life in every generation through the development of halakhah, that is to say through halakhic debate. During the first two centuries C.E. one great issue which the rabbis debated was whether knowl edge or practice of Torah was the greater virtue, and the debate was finally settled in the academy of Lydda, I 33 C.E., with the adoption of the principle that 'study is the greater because it leads to deeds' ;13 a man cannot practise Torah if he does not know and understand Torah. On this principle study became the ideal religious activity for the pious Jew and Judaism became a highly intellectual religious tradition. The rabbis themselves were not, of course, 'ministers of religion' but 'scholar-saints' and men of charisma; but the charisma for which they were revered and respected was brilliance of intellect,14 a charisma manifested particularly in their ability to engage in disciplined and mind-stretching rational argument concerning the meaning and contemporary application of Torah. Thus the classical literature of 9 I have in mind the works of such as A. Cohen, Cohn-Sherbok, Fackenheim, Maybaum, and Rubenstein. The Holocaust debate is related to the whole tradition ofJewish protest against God in I., Sherwin, 'The Impotence of Explanation and the European Holocaust', Tradition 12, 2 (I972), pp. 99-i67 and 'Wiesel's Midrash' in A. Rosenfeld and I. Greeberg (eds), Confronting the Holocaust (Indiana University Press, I978). As extended arguments with God these are all epitomized in 'Yossel Rakover's Appeal to God' in A. H. Friedlander, Out of the Darkness (UAHC, I968), pp. 396-7. See especially J. Neusner, Torah. From Scroll to Symbol in Formative Judaism (Fortress Press, i983). 1 Cf. Kidd 40b; Shab 3ia; Shmot Rabbah xvii, 7, 'It is written "Write thou these words..." (Ex 34:27) ... what the Holy One, Blessed be He, meant was, "Write thou Torah, .Avi'im and retuvim and they shall be in writing (shebiktav), but halakot, midrash, haggadot, mishnah and talmud shall be by mouth (be'al peh) "'. 12 Kidd 49b, 'What is Torah? It is the interpretation (midrash) of Torah'. 1 Kidd 4ob. According to Neusner ('Two Pictures of the Pharisess: Philosophical Circle of Eating Club', Anglican Theological Review 67, 4 (i982), p. 538, n. I5) the 'Judaism of the study of Torah' is characteristic of the Amoraic rather than the Tannaitic era. 14 J. Neusner, There We Sat Down (Ktav, I972), p. 77.</page><page sequence="4">480 N. L. TIDWELL rabbinic Judaism - Midrash, Mishnah and Talmud15 - are not, as many Christians unfamiliar with the Jewish tradition so often think, codes of law, the literature of legalism, but records of debates. As debates they record arguments and opinions on all sides of an issue, including minority opinions. The debates, moreover, are essentially open-ended and an essential element of the Jewish tradition. In the terminology of the Jewish tradition itself the classical literature comprises books of halakhot (case-law debates) not books of pesakhim (decisions).16 They are legal debates in the realm of case-law which provide the foundation for further debate as circumstances and cases may require. This is Oral Torah, and its study, which the rabbis elevated to the highest level of religious activities, required and promotes a rigorous training of the mind in a disciplined process of reasoning. Knowledge for the rabbis was very much more knowing-how than knowing-that; it was the mastering of a process of reasoning and argument not a remembering of 'facts' or 'laws'; the ideal scholar was the 'amora', not the tanna'. If you had been among the disciples (talmidim) of Yochanan ben Zakkai it would have been good to be like Eliezer, 'a cemented cistern that loses not a drop', to have a good memory and a retentive mind, but it would have been far better to be like Elazar, 'a spring flowing with ever-sustained vigour', an acutely analytical mind bubbling over with new ideas and arguments (Avot 2.II). Elazar epitomized the ideal end-product of rabbinic discipleship17 and it is interesting to take note of the teaching and learning strategies which nurtured the mind of such a scholar. It is a well-known principle in modern education that teaching, learning and assessment methods should all serve common objectives and, in the light of this,the mode of learning and training of the mind that took place in a rabbinic academy (yeshiva) possibly right from the first century but certainly from the early second century C.E. iS particularly significant. The pattern of training was (and still is in traditional yeshivot) interactive; the learning unit was triangular or triadic; it required the interaction of three persons: the rabbi, the student (talmad) and his 'companion' or 'associate' (chaver).i8 The minds of the student and his associate were trained through engagement in vociferous oral argument over some part of the tradition which ultimately crystallized in the Talmud. Those who are familiar with Barbra Streisand's Yentl will be able to recall vivid images of this activity in the Yeshiva of Lublin about a century ago. They will also recall the role of the rabbi in this process. He was the assessor of the 15 These are the three classical forms in which the oral tradition may be found. Halakhah and Haggadah describe the content of that tradition. 16 Codes appear much later (twelfth to sixteenth centuries) in the history ofJudaism. They were not generally well-received precisely because their form changed the nature of the tradition from recorded debate and citation of authorities to simple recommended decisions (posekim). Even Shulchan Arukh needed Bet rosef as its forerunner to gain the acceptance of scholars. 1 See Avot I, 6; 4, I5, I8. 18 Rabbinic studentship/discipleship involved both limmed Torah and shimmesh rabbi, academic learn ing and learning a way of life. What some students got up to in order to learn the most intimate details of the rabbinic life did not always win them the approval of their tutors!</page><page sequence="5">HOLY ARGUMENT 48I students' progress and he assessed his students by himself engaging with them in Talmudic argument. The rigorous training and expansion of the mind through the disciplined logic of intricate rational argument in the sphere of Oral Torah was the heart and soul of rabbinic pedagogy. Nothing better illustrates the sacred value set upon reason and argument - and the democratic process - than the well known story of Rabbi Eliezer, recorded in the Talmud Bava Metzia' 59b. The situation is one in which R. Eliezer represents the minority opinion on a rather obscure issue of cleanness. The story goes: On that day R. Eliezer brought forward every imaginable argument, but they did not accept them. Said he to them: 'If the halakhah agrees with me, let this carob tree prove it!' Thereupon the carob-tree was torn a hundred cubits out of its place - other affirm, four hundred cubits. 'No proof can be brought from a carob-tree', they retorted. Again he said to them: 'If the halakhah agrees with me, let the stream of water prove it!' Whereupon the stream of water flowed backwards.' No proof can be brought from a stream of water', they rejoined. Again he urged. 'If the halakhah agrees with me, let the walls of the schoolhouse prove it,' whereupon the walls inclined to fall. But R. Joshua rebuked them, saying: 'When scholars are engaged in halakhic dispute, what have ye to interfere?' Hence they did not fall, in honour of R. Joshua, nor did they resume the upright, in honour of R. Eliezer; and they are still standing thus inclined. Again he said to them: 'If the halakhah agrees with me, let it be proved from Heaven!' Whereupon a Heavenly Voice cried out: 'Why do you dispute with R. Eliezer, seeing that in all matters the halakhah agrees with him!' But R. Joshua arose and exclaimed: 'It is not in heaven'. What did he mean by this? Said R. Jeremiah: That the Torah had already been given at Mount Sinai; we pay no attention to a Heavenly Voice, because Thou hast long since written in the Torah at Mount Sinai, After the majority must one incline. R. Nathan met Elijah and asked him: What did the Holy One, Blessed be He, do in that hour? He laughed (with joy), he replied, saying, 'My sons have defeated Me, My sons have defeated Me.' The essence of this delightful story is the clear insistence of' the Sages' that nothing can determine the outcome of an halakhic debate except sound reasoning and the majority opinion. The acceptance of reasoned argument alone as the guide to the interpretation of Torah involves, as the story shows, the rejection of all irrational or unreasoned means of establishing what is right; miracles, in the Christian tradition long regarded as the ultimate proof of religious claims,19 are of no account in rabbinic debate and even a 'Heavenly Voice' (Bat Qol) is to be ignored if its interjection denies or contradicts fundamental principles of the halakhic process. The story recognizes that, by the very nature of debate, more than one opinion on an issue will emerge but, to enable 'deeds' to follow from 'study', the practical Scriptural rule20 that the majority opinion prevails is adopted. In the story 19 One thinks particularly or works such as Paley's Evidences of Christianity. On the rejection of proof by miracles in the story of R. Eliezer see Louis Jacobs, A Tree of Life (Oxford University Press, I984), pp. 26-7. 20 Ex. 23:2. Other examples of the application of this rule are given in Hyam Maccoby's The Day God Laughed (Robson Books, I987), pp. III-I2. Additional reasons for adopting this rule are discussed in Encyclopaedia J7udaica, Vol. i I, 'Majority Opinion', cols, 864-6.</page><page sequence="6">482 N. L. TIDWELL of Eliezer it is the uncompromising commitment of the sages to rational methodology, combined with practical good sense, which delights the Holy One and, in His own words, 'defeats' Him. There is a whole Judaic theology, anthropology and piety enshrined in that story, and the piety is the chasidut of argument. Argument continued and continues to be a characteristic mode ofJewish spirituality in the realm of halakhah but argument with God in the realm of theology is distinctively associated with the birth of Eastern European Chasidism in the eighteenth century. Chasidism today occupies that place on the spectrum of varieties of Judaism once occupied by its bitterest opponents.21 In its origins Chasidism owed more to the Jewish mystical and pietistic tradition than to the then contemporary form of Talmudic tradition, but from the second generation of its history it came to embrace and also to revitalize the somewhat sterile Talmudic tradition of its day. In this process Chasidism developed argument with God as one of its distinctive expressions and modes of spirituality.22 A representative sample of Chasidic 'Con troversies with God' is provided in Louis Newman's A Hasidic Anthology and, in the examples cited by Newman, it is theological rather than halakhic issues that are the subject of argument, although, typically, the theology is grounded in questions of an halakhic kind. The following tale from Tiferet Maharal is offered by Newman (23- i) as 'a particularly fine story': A terrible famine once occurred in Ukraine and the poor could buy no bread. Ten rabbis assembled at the house of the 'Spoler Grandfather' for a session of the Rabbinical Court. The Spoler said to them: 'I have a case in judgement against the Lord. According to Rabbinical law, a master who buys aJewish serf for a designated time (six years or up to the Jubilee year) must support not only him but also his family. Now the Lord bought us in Egypt as his serfs, since he says: 'For to me are the sons of Israel serfs', and the prophet Ezekiel declared that even in Exile, Israel is the slave of God. Therefore, 0 Lord, I ask that Thou abide by the Law and support thy serfs with their families. The ten judges rendered judgement in favour of the Spoler Rabbi. This story which puts God on trial takes us right back to Micah 6: I-323 but also anticipates the law-suit against God conducted by a group of Rabbis in one of Hitler's Death Camps, as narrated in Elie Wiesel's Gates of the Forest.24 TheseJewish trials of God examine serious existential issues of religious belief from within a context of belief and often, paradoxically, affirm belief even when God is found guilty - Elie Wiesel's rabbis in the death camp pronounce God guilty and immediately begin ma'ariv, evening prayer! Of this more 21 H. Wouk, This is My God (Collins, I972), p. 275. 22 The paradigm figure in this respect was Levi Yitzhak of Berditchev, cf. S. Dresner, Levi Yitzhak of Berditchev (Hartman House, I974). 23 L. I. Newman, A Hasidic Anthology (Aronson, I988), draws attention to this connection (p. 23, n. 3) although it should be noted that in Micah God is the plaintiff and not the accused. 24 Holt, Rhinehart and Winston (I966), p. I97.</page><page sequence="7">HOLY ARGUMENT 483 later, but at this point it may be appropriate to recall that philosophers of religion also bring God, His existence, nature and ways, to the bar of reason (albeit in a very different atmosphere and context from that of pious Jews) and so might be persuaded to give sympathetic approbation to Jewish holy argument and to the high value which the Jewish tradition sets upon reason ing.25 Argument is, at least, a way of dealing with God that the philosopher of religion can understand and feel at home with. Moreover, if he will listen sympathetically toJews engaged in debate with God, there is much that he might learn from the Jewish tradition of argument. For example, a dip into the records of Chasidic arguments with God will soon reveal that there may be found a rich treasury of material for the discussion of the concept of God, material that has much more direct relevance to and engages much more directly with the actual life of the believer than the abstract hypothetical issues of philosophical debate. The Chasidic material has more existential content than the material which the philosopher of religion traditionally handles. In contemporary courses on the philosophy of religion, for example, discussion and analysis of the concept of 'God' is of somewhat greater significance than the traditional arguments for the existence of God,26 for what is the point of enquiring into the existence of God if the very concept 'God' makes no sense? Now the debate about the concept of God is con cerned with the attributes of God, with what can be predicated of such a Being as God. It enquires whether the attributes of that 'being than which no greater can be conceived' are self-consistent and consistent with one another.27 For the believer, however, there is a twofold problem with the way philosophers define 'God' and his attributes. Firstly the Being of whom certain attributes are predicated is, as Pascal put it, 'the God of the Philosophers, not the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob'.28 The Philosopher's God is a metaphysical abstraction whom the believer cannot recognize as the God whom s/he believes s/he has encountered and continues to encounter 'between man and man', in daily life, in prayer and in worship. 25 From the side ofJudaism it has to be admitted that until the present century philosophical thought has been regarded with suspicion by the mainstream tradition. The rabbinic attitude is reflected in Bav Kam 82b. In fact, in Jewish history before Emancipation, the fortunes of those who sought to bring philosophical insights into the service of the faith are epitomized by (a) the total neglect of first-century Philo for around IGoo years, (b) the twelfth-century Maimonidean Controversy, and (c) the excommuni cation of Benedikt Spinoza in the seventeenth century. Notably, all three figures belong to times when Judaism was more than usually open to the world beyond the voluntary ghetto. See A. S. Halkin, 'The Attitude of NormativeJudaism to Philosophy', Perspectives in Jewish Learning, vol. 4, ed. M. A. Friedman (Chicago, I972), pp. I-Io. 26 Cf. R. Luhman, The Searchfor Understanding. A Course in Philosophy and Religion (Westcliff High School for Boys, 1992), p. 27. 27 Ibid. p. 30. 28 One of the major weaknesses of a philosophical approach to a religious tradition is its inevitable elitism. In the case of a Jewish religious philosopher this elitism is particularly marked in Maimonides' Guide. See the concluding Kafka-like castle image. Pt. III, chap. li. For a penetrating criticism of Maimonides' 'philosopher's God' see J. Haberman, Maimonides and Aquinas. A Contemporary Appraisal (Ktav, I979), and D. J. Silver, Maimonidean Criticism and the Maimonidean Controversy (Brill, I965).</page><page sequence="8">484 N. L. TIDWELL Pascal's God of the Patriarchs is, on the other hand, precisely the God of Jewish tradition, The God of Tanakh and Talmud, and the God with whom Jews have argued down the centuries. Secondly, it is problematical for the believer that the attributes of the Philosopher's God are also abstract metaphysical concepts - omnipotence, omniscience, immutability - which frankly have no meaningful place in the vocabulary of the believer. To Homo religiosus the philosophical discussion of such attributes seems like a game with words, semantic juggling, that does not touch his life at any depth beyond a certain refined area of his intellect. In the Chasidic arguments with God, on the other hand, the divine attributes whose reciprocal consistency is in question are moral attributes, the qualities of a God who is morally active in the world and in the lives of men and women. The Chasidim do not ask hypothetical questions such as 'Could God create a stone too heavy for Him to be able to lift?'29 but questions that arise from the human experience of injustice, persecution, hunger, suffering. They ask such questions as: if God is just can He be at the same time and in the same circumstances compassionate and longsuffering? To be fair these are the questions which the philosopher of religion in his way is also asking but he asks them in such a manner that the link between the questions and the life of the believer is severed or lost; the issues become divorced from life and are taken off to be examined in some academic ivory tower where they have only academic interest but no moral or existential poignancy. Language is another issue central to the concerns of a philosophy of religion. As long ago as the twelfth century Maimonides in his Guide for the Perplexed recognized that language was the fundamental problem of a phil osophy of religion. In common with almost all philosophers he was highly critical of the anthropomorphic language of the ordinary believer and of the whole Jewish tradition to which he was heir. But the ancient rabbis, who elevated holy argument to the highest category on the scale of piety, were not so naive as to think that the language they and Scripture used described God as He is in Himself; they knew that 'Torah is in the language of men'. 30 However they held firmly and, I believe, rightly to the conviction that anthropomorphic, or what S. Shulman has called 'metaphoric', language was best suited to talk about God as He is known in relation to men. They understood, as she puts it, that 'the concrete, specific image, the irredeemably personal utterances, the language of intimate, immediate ex perience; these ways of speaking are all at least as sophisticated, as cognitively illuminating and often more transfixing than the discourse of formal theology and philosophy'. 31 29 Luhman, op. cit. p. 28. 30 Shab I 7a; and TJ Sanh 64b; also Maimonides, Guide, Pt. I, chap. xxvi. According to R. Sh. 27a and Makk 22b God affirms: 'Not I in my high realm but you with your human needs fix the form, the measure, the time and the mode of expression (my italics) for that which is divine'. 31 S. Shulman, 'God in Words', Manna, No. 35 (Spring, I992), p. 25.</page><page sequence="9">HOLY ARGUMENT 485 The anthropomorphic or metaphoric language of the rabbinic tradition is part and parcel of a characteristically rabbinic theology of paradox. The ology in the formal sense of the systematic formulation of doctrine is not a characteristic enterprise within the Jewish tradition. Judaism has beliefs, obviously, but a very broad range of interpretation of those beliefs is possible and actual among Jews both historically and contemporarily.32 The idea of 'heresy' is really alien to the Jewish tradition. However, when the rabbis did theologize they delighted in paradox as the only adequate way to express theological truths. They disliked either/or categorical formulations and preferred both/and modes of expression.33 They set side by side apparently contradictory ideas and affirmed both in paradoxical tension. In this respect their theological thinking is as open-ended as their halakhic debate. Paradox - and a less narrow view of the nature of religious language than has been customary in British philosophy - is a fairly typical feature of a dynamic biblical theology and is associated today especially with Process Theology.34 Philosophers of religion may be surprised to discover how much Process Theology there is in Jewish thought about God and His relation to the world.35 This 'Process' element is particularly marked in that expression of Jewish faith which is distinguished for its arguments with God, the Chasidic tradition. For example, Chasidism doctrinally advocates a Process Theology kind of 'panentheistic' Judaism.36 Especially fascinating in this regard is its concept of zimzum, the idea that to create the Universe God voluntarily underwent a 'divine contraction'; similarly the Chasidic image of the Universe as the 'garment' with which God clothes himself,37 and the conviction that God needs the Universe and man as much as they need Him, are ideas that would be very much at home in a Process Theology where God 32 Theology has gained prominence in Judaism in the present century through such works as Louis Jacobs's A Jewish Theology, (Darton, Longman and Todd, I 973), and K. Kohler's Jewish Theology (Ktav, I968) (Macmillan, I9I8). However, both authors stress the historical, individual and non-dogmatic nature ofJewish theology. The response to earlier attempts to produce a set of Principles (Ikkarim) of Faith that might prove universally acceptable to world-wide Jewry underlines the very flexible attitude to doctrine within Judaism and the great variety of opinion as to what might constitute a Jewish 'creed'. Despite the ant ma'amin form, Maimonides' I 3 Principles in the Authorised Daily Prayer Book do not function as an official standard of orthodoxy in any variety of Judaism. 33 The most well-known example of rabbinic paradox is Avot 3, I 9, 'Everything is foreseen, yet freedom of choice is given; and the world is judged by grace, yet all is according to the amount of work'. 34 There is a fine article on Process Theology by David Pailin in A. Richardson and J. Bowden, A New Dictionary of Theology (SCM, I 983), replacing the older article by Norman Pittenger, A dictionary of Christian Theology (SCM, I969), pp. 275-7. The seminal works in Process Theology are A. N. Whitehead, Process and Reality (I 929), J. B. Cobb, A Christian Natural Theology (1 966) and S. Ogden, The Reality of God (i 967). See also J. B. Cobb and D. R. Griffiths, Process Theology. An Introductory Exposition (I976). 3 On rabbinic thought and Process Theology, see especially P. Ochs, 'Rabbinic Text Process The ology', Jfournal of Jewish Thought and Philosophy' i, I (I99I), pp. I4I-77. In this respect, amongst other features, the notion of the dipolar nature of God and the concept of God as 'at once supremely relative and supremely absolute' (Ogden, op. cit. p. 48) could be describing certain aspects of the rabbinic understanding of God equally as much as they describe aspects of the understanding of God in Process Theology. 36 Encyclopaedia Judaica, vol. 7, 'Hasidism', col. I404. 3 R. A. Stewart, Rabbinic Theology, refers to the rabbinic idea that God fills the Universe as the soul fills the body, citing Lev R. iv, 8 and Ber ioa.</page><page sequence="10">486 N. L. TIDWELL both affects and is affected by the Universe. Equally too the Process theo logian would welcome the Chasidic teaching that God cannot redeem the Universe without the active cooperation of man. These notions, which find their expression most vividly in the piety of argument with God, involve as radical a transformation in the traditional philosophical conceptions of God and His attributes as Process Theology does - for example, that God is not immutable or omniscience in the traditional absolute sense. The vital role of argument, including argument with God, in the Jewish tradition is beyond doubt, but exactly how does argument work as a way of piety and a form of spirituality? Here we enter the realm of speculation where, perhaps, some basic ideas about philosophizing might provide a starting point for the examination of this question. One book introducing students to philosophy remarks that: Philosophy is thinking that goes to the edge of scepticism, and success here is of lesser importance than that people try, for in the struggle with wide-ranging and open ended questions our minds are exercised rigorously and our conceptual horizons widened beyond measure.38 In this simple statement of the nature and objectives of philosophical think ing two notions seem to me to be particularly significant. Firstly, is the idea that it is the very process of reasoning that matters and not a successful outcome to that process. Within Jewish argument with God isn't this some thing like what is implied by the behaviour of the rabbis in Elie Wiesel's story of the Death Camps? They find God guilty -which ought to spell the rejection of God - but the process of putting God to trial serves to confirm and deepen their commitment and they pass at once into corporate prayer. In the very process of argument they have drawn closer to the One whom they ultimately adjudge guilty. This is the typical pattern of Chasidic ar gument with God. The issues debated are often beyond rational resolution but the process of debating them is what is of value. There is a drawing near to God in the very process of argument that is of far greater importance than the logical implications of the verdict arrived at. This thought brings us to the second significant notion in the quotation from Peter Mullen's Beginning Philosophy. This is the notion of philosophical thinking pushing the mind to its limits - 'thinking that goes to the edge' - and expanding the horizons of the mind 'beyond measure'. To operate 'at the limits', many would say, is to be engaged in a religious exercise, for the limits are the place where fundamentally religious questions arise and religious responses occur. When the human mind is stretched to its limits one may stand either or both at the 'edge of scepticism' and in the border-land of faith. Jewish holy argument most frequently has a practical purpose - the de velopment of halakhah - but there are times when argument, particularly argument with God, is enjoyed for its own sake and for the sheer intellectual 38 Peter Mullen, Beginning Philosophy (Edward Arnold, I 977), p. vii.</page><page sequence="11">HOLY ARGUMENT 487 joy and ecstasy which it brings.39 Even in the realm of halakhah debate need have no immediate practical value, hence a fair proportion of the Mishnah is devoted to matters concerning the then obsolete Temple Service -Judah HaNasi's Mishnah was compiled almost a century and a half after the Temple had been destroyed and its services had ceased. Now the sublime satisfaction and sometimes ecstatic intellectual stimulus of disciplined argu ment undertaken for its own sake share much in common with other 'peak experiences' and ways to an 'altered state of consciousness'. Rigorous and rationally controlled argument can produce a state of mind that is not too distant from religious and mystical states of consciousness. It can stir emotions which, in the right circumstances, can easily pass into religious or mystical feeling states. Indeed, deep concentration is of the essence of the mystical process and concentration on the niceties of holy argument has been aptly described by Hyam Maccoby as a 'mysticism of the intellect'. 40 Ar guing with God does not exactly press thinking 'to the edge of scepticism' but it does press reason to its limits in an attempt to transport the mind to the highest levels of intellectual, moral and spiritual awareness. In this respect it is an activity parallel to some extent with serious philosophical thinking and enquiry. Furthermore, in Judaism the power of reason is what constitutes the 'image of God' in which man is made; thus, the greater a person exercises the power of rational thought and argument the more like God s/he becomes and the closer to God s/he draws. Although the Book ofJob is probably the most widely known example of holy argument within both the Jewish and Christian traditions, it illustrates a rather different type of religious experience from the mystical. In Job the argument culminates in a theophany stimulating a numinous experience and response, a religious experience more typical of the 'prophetic, worshipful' than the 'wisdom, contemplative' religiosity. The climax of the argument in the book occurs at that point where Job abases himself before his God, repents in dust and ashes, and confesses, 'I had heard of Thee by the hearing of the ear but now mine eyes see Thee' Gjob 42: I-6). What we appear to have here is a classic example of an experience of the Holy or numinous, but one which occurs as the climax of an extended debate and a vigorous and sustained protest, culminating in a theophany. There are interesting parallels here with the Bhagavad Gita where similarly an extended debate reaches a climax in an awesome theophany. However, different though the climactic experience in Job may be, the book reflects features that are characteristic of holy argument in general. The issues debated inJob are acutely existential Cf. Hyam Maccoby, op. cit., pp. ii 6-1s7 for examples of 'Arguing for Pleasure'. This may also be one reason why Avot recommends the study of 'the laws concerning the sacrifices of birds and the purification of women' as being 'ordinances of moment' (Avot iii, 23), the one (kinnin) being obsolete after 70 C.E. And the other (niddah) having no relevance for men who alone were obligated to study. 40 op. cit., p. I 29. He explains this concept as religious experience arising from the strenuous exercise of the mind.</page><page sequence="12">488 N. L. TIDWELL imponderables to which there is no finally satisfactory intellectual solution. So too are the issues in all holy arguments which debate the irreconcilable tension between apparently contradictory divine attributes such as justice and mercy, love and righteousness. The attempt to argue these questions pushes reason and thought 'to the edge' and stretches the mind to and beyond its accustomed limits. It is there where reason has exhausted itself that divine disclosure occurs, the sense of the presence of God is felt, and, as Elie Wiesel painfully recognized, a protest becomes a prayer and angry complaint against the deity, railing against God, becomes an affirmation of Him. Holy argument offers no theoretical or rational solutions to the problems it debates; it simply affirms the reality of both poles of a con tradiction: God is just and innocent suffering occurs; God is good yet evil exists; God is righteous yet He is merciful. Job ultimately ('aharon) finds his go'el, I9.25, beyond the limits of his reasoned arguments and protestations but could he have discovered Him without going through the process of argument in the first place? Philosophical thinking and holy argument, of course, have different starting points. Philosophical thinking about God does not presuppose faith but holy argument does. This presupposition, however, does not invalidate the process of argument itself. No human thinking or reasoning is entirely presuppositionless. Even philosophical thinking does not begin with a tabula rasa. The rationality of holy argument we might, perhaps, call existential rationality, a pattern of reasoning which arises from and functions within a particular way of looking at the world that is shaped by life's experiences. But again, every philosopher has his own perspective on life which is shaped by more than logic and his own thinking is thinking from the standpoint of his own particular perspective. Be that as it may, the Jewish tradition as a whole affirms that religious faith flourishes through argument, or, as Rabbi Lionel Blue puts it in his delightfully entertaining popular sketch ofJudaism, To Heaven with Scribes and Pharisees (Longman, Darton and Todd, I 975, p. 79) 'holy argument is the greatest path to God in Jewish experience'.
