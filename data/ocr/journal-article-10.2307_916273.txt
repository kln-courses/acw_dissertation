<plain_text><page sequence="1">312 THE MUSICAL TIMES-APRIL I 1928 PHASES OF IMPRESSION AND EXPRESSION By MRS. FRANK LIEBICH Expressions are shaped by the dynamics of impressions. Both are vibrational; one being in- trinsic, the other extrinsic. Unsought impressions are, as often as not, more richly laden with suggestions than those that are sought. A sudden glimpse of unsuspected beauty will sometimes awaken a hidden need for just that particular manifestation, bringing to birth a rhythmic current of thought and expression. The creative power of an artist is quickened by the magnetic touch on ear or eye of beauty that comes in contact with his sense of sight or hearing. Imagination will furnish still greater incentives to creative expression. But the finest factors are dulled and hindered if the impelling power is uncontrolled. Thought then becomes clogged, and is finally rendered inert. Any hindrances to expression become magnified when music is the subject of the creative process. The work of a composer who cannot clarify his thought or who is unable to sift and condense his expression has little chance of winning fame. It is the productions in which expression has transcended impression that either await or have achieved immortality. A drastic repudiation of extraneous matter is essential in a composition if the composer's expression of his impressions is to receive answering echoes in the minds of his hearers. Thus only can he impart to each and all some share in his aural experiences condensed and brought within measurable distance of the ideal that had presented itself to his mind. Trois cris de flite disent mieux la vie Que toutes les paroles de HeIsiode, said a French poet. And it is just because of this frequent conciseness of beauty of phrase and by reason of the immeasurable power possessed by the art of insinuating itself into the labyrinths of the human personality, that music can cast such diverse impressions on to the minds and hearts of a vast audience. Each listener re-creates in his own image what he has heard; hence the wide divergence of taste, of understanding, of apprecia- tion: each and all varying with the individual knowledge, the sensitiveness, the responsive power of the various personalities upon whom the impression of a creative artist's work is made. Asked to describe his impressions of a first hearing of a great musical work, an ordinary listener or even a cultured amateur might well feel non- plussed. His impressions of the big, sonorous expanses of sound, severally named either symphony, symphonic poem, overture, or concerto, that played on his auditive faculties for the space of an hour or more, would be, to an inexperienced listener, as difficult to put into words as it would be to describe a wave of the sea-and to attempt to define a wave is to succeed only in immobilising a constantly shifting impression. A professorial analysis of a symphony, sonata, or other musical work in the study or class-room will enable a student to dissect the production and reduce its various fragmentary parts to the rules of musical composition. At a concert he will become aware that the work he had parcelled out and analysed is a living organism of which he can have continually diversified impressions, it being the outcome of its creator's expression of his most sentient impressions and knowledge of the com- bined power and individuality of the various orchestral instruments and of the ordered beauty of harmonic sound. A symphony, song, or instru- mental solo plays on the mind and acts on the intelligence of each listener according to the knowledge and culture he brings to bear upon it. Thus there is some reason for recognising that there must be an elite in art, an aristocracy of creative and instrumental artists and of cognoscenti, as well as a mixed crowd of lay folk of very varying knowledge and unequal receptive power. Individual expression has not always had its part in music. The melody of the ancient Greeks was choral. That of the liturgy was equally impersonal. It was in the first attempts at opera that personal expression was given full scope, Monteverdi in his operas being the pioneer in the matter of musical presentment of sentiment and passion. His individual use of the dominant seventh was a kind of lever that helped to throw down barriers and thus opened out hitherto unrealised opportunities for the use of sentiment and the consequent expression of feeling and passion. In the immediate present, human emotion in music is giving way to an abstract sense of the beauty of pure sound. Timbre, which up till now has played a subordinate part, is as important as rhythm, melody, and harmony. Tone has its own intrinsic value as expression. The prismatic web of sound appertaining to each single note like unto the scintillation of a jewel possesses its own far-reaching resonant expression. Its appeal to a listener now no longer appertains to pictorial or emotional impressions but to more intellectual appraisements of the sheer beauty of vibrating tone. Atonality and the fine shading of pure sound being an analysis of the elements of music is simply the older methods carried to their furthest and most logical conclusion. In many of Malipiero's symphonic and pianoforte compositions, in Bart6k's last Quartet, the beauty of the iridescent mists of overtones of sound rival any sunset afterglow. Impression and expression in a modern work are derived from the harmonics of richly-constructed chords and combinations of chords resembling the beauty of suggestion and meaning of well-chosen words and sentences in prose or poem. Modern music, however, needs close intimacy if it is to leave a lasting impression on the mind. Familiarity will breed respect. It was once said by a wise French critic that there are no shooting-stars in music's firmament. And indeed all is related or interrelated. Only a wide extensive knowledge of</page><page sequence="2">THE MUSICAL TIMES-APRIL 1 1928 313 the past of music can help to an appreciation of the present. Throughout its history genius calls to genius like deep unto deep. Each great musical composer has had his own individual impressions of his predecessors. But in order to earn his own right to succession each one has had to formulate his own individual impressions of the wide domain of sound, and shape them into continuously varying beauty and individuality of expression. It is a hard taskmaster who would expect the big public to keep in touch with the rapid trend of modem music. The expression of the advance guard of any art can only be for the educated few. Close on fifty years ago Debussy published his ' Belle au Bois Dormant,' and his 'Pelleas' has seen twenty years of life. The French master's subjective tone-painting, his anthropomorphic con- ception of nature, is now somewhat stale and old-fashioned. Had he lived and kept his health be would doubtless have been the first to realise this, and he might easily have surpassed both his early and his latest works. But there is still a vast untutored public to whom his music must seem the latest expression of modernity. And it is well that there are grades of listeners. In the vast domain of music there is scope and opportunity for them all. Genius will always find its own niche in the Temple of Fame. The minority will recognise it from the first by its distinctive mind, its responsive intellection, its individual expression of the most varied and delicate impressions of the world of unending sound. In music as in every other art impressions are for all and every; expression for the gifted few.</page></plain_text>
