Vol. xii, fascicles 89-90, columns 1-320.) Stuttgart: Hiersemann, 1981-2. N.p. The fascicles reviewed here contain the articles headed by words compounded with Gotter, Gottes, and Gott. The quality is on the whole very high, but there is some unevenness in coverage. Thus, for example, divine kingship in the Orient and Egypt features in three articles, the view of God or gods in the same areas not at all (despite a cross-reference to it at Vol. xi, col. 1002). The main part of fascicles 85-6 is occupied by two overlapping articles on Gotterbild (659-828) by Hermann Funke and Gotzen dienstdienst (828-95) by Jean-Claude Fredouille. The longer article, on representations of gods (chiefly statues), is arranged not chrono logically but by topics, and is packed with snippets of curious information each supplied with its reference. The sources are</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 613 literary rather than archaeological. The main emphasis is on Graeco-Roman paganism and Christianity with a comparatively short section in between on national peculiarities. Topics covered include ancient theories on the origin of images of gods, their outer appearance, use, treatment and behaviour, images of important persons including rulers, attitudes to divine images, pagan and Christian polemic, Christian destruction of pagan images and Christian attitudes to Christian images. The article Gotzendienst covers more systematically and in strict chronological order the topic of pagan, Jewish, and Christian attitudes to idol worship (including the worship of pagan gods whether represented by images or not). To the material cited in these articles can now be added the fragment of highly rhetorical Latin polemic against idols published from a Cologne manuscript by Bernhard Bischoff, AnecdotaAnecdota Latina (Stuttgart, 1984), pp. 6-9. The article Gold (895-930) by Hans-Jiirgen Horn deals with gold in the history of ideas (in particular as a symbol of riches, viewed with suspicion or contrasted with true riches; of glory, associated with gods, God or rulers; of luxury and hence the object of polemic; and of purity as being refined). The practical use of gold is discussed only incidentally. GoldeneGoldene Regel (930-40) is by Albrecht Dihle, who published a book on the subject in 1962. He sees this rule, which appears in negative and positive forms ('do not do to others what you would not have done to yourself' and 'do as you would be done by') as having developed out of a primitive concept of the need for equi librium and hence for retribution as a result of the ability to imagine oneself in the position of the object of one's actions, and as belong ing to the category of popular ethical maxims, which are foreign to the ethical theory of Greek philosophy but were regarded with interest by philosophers, in particular the Stoics, as products of an original naturally implanted human moral awareness. The golden rule does not appear in the canonical books of the Old Testament but is common in later Jewish and in Christian writings. Dihle makes a firm distinction between the golden rule and the law of love, and, emphasizing this contrast, attempts to interpret Luke 6: 31 as a statement, not a precept, while regarding Matt. 7: 12 as non dominical. God God has been given no article of his own but only four columns composed by the editors explaining how and why he has been subdivided under various contributions headed by compound words and why even so some gaps have been left (e.g. no articles on Gotter,Gotter, Gotteseigenschaften, Gottesgemeinschaft, Gottgleichheit). One of the most striking omissions is the fact that the articles on</page><page sequence="3">614 REVIEWS GottesbegriffGottesbegriff and Gottesvorstellung are incomplete, lacking any discussion of Oriental or Egyptian religion, of Judaism and of Christianity (except to state the incompatibility of the latter with Graeco-Roman views). The editors refer the reader to handbooks on the history of doctrine to remedy this lack and also to supply the missing patristic section of the article Gottessohn (943). It is to be hoped, however, that supplements may appear later at least for the omitted sections of Gottesvorstellung. Since the remaining articles from the end of fascicle 86 to the beginning of fascicle 91 are all concerned with ideas about God (or gods) or about persons, institutions or concepts related to God (gods), they will be reviewed according to their subject matter rather than in alphabetical order. As the most obvious substitute for an entry on God himself the reader turns first to the pair of articles by the late Heinrich Dorrie on Gottesbegriff (Vol. xi, 944-51) and Gottesvorstellung (Vol. xii, 81-154). As has just been mentioned, both these are confined to the Graeco-Roman sphere with only brief final remarks on the contrast with Christian views. In the first article it is emphasized that Greek and Roman antiquity produced no theology or definition of God, since divinity was regarded as transcending human comprehension (the only exception being the Stoics, who made the divine synonymous with nature and the causative forces working in the natural world). Instead there was a variety of views about God or the gods, as expounded in the second article. The latter is an interestingly written and readable account by an authority in full command of his subject, concentrating (with emphasis on the limitations of the material) particularly on Greek and Roman religion of the pre-Classical and Classical periods and on lines of development towards a more elevated view of divine nature. The sections on ancient philosophy deal with the attitudes of philo sophers towards the traditional gods of popular belief (120-5) and give a general account of the development of views concerning a transcendent divinity (141-50). Considering the amount of space devoted elsewhere to less important subjects one might regret that so little detail and documentation is provided on the views of indi vidual philosophers and their schools. Various points of interest for comparison with Jewish and Christian ideas emerge in the course of the account. The following is a selection: in Greek religion, apart from that of Apollo, there is no professional class of priests or teachers responsible for expounding beliefs about the gods (85, 108, 125); the Greek cult of heroes was inherited by the Christian martyrs (98); the gods of popular belief have not always existed, have not created the world, are not all-powerful, cannot prolong</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 615 human life beyond the limit determined by fate, and are rather partners of men, each exercising patronage over his own sphere, than upholders of any universal order (90, 100, 141); in philo sophical (Platonist) thought the highest being cannot stand in relation to the world (except in Plutarch, 144), and cannot be identified with the creator of the realm of becoming (142 f.), the philosophical understanding of different levels of being with the Logos acting as mediator is incompatible with the (orthodox) Christian view of God (145; much could be added, however, on its influence on patristic thought as well as on that of heretics). In the final section (150-4) the conclusion is given that, despite agreement with pagan philosophy in the use of terminology about God, the Jewish and Christian belief in God as creator of heaven and earth is irreconcilably opposed to both popular and philosophical view points in Graeco-Roman paganism. In the article Gottesbeweis (951-77) by Hans-Jiirgen Horn the Graeco-Roman section is based on individual philosophical texts which give arguments concerning the existence or nature of God and includes material one might have expected to find under GottesbegriffGottesbegriff as well as overlapping matter. The short Jewish section is mainly on Philo, the Christian section on Rom. 1: 20, Acts 14 and 17, and then on general topics (the question whether and how God can be known, proofs of God's existence from human consensus and from the evidence of his works). Only Augustine has a section to himself. The arrangement of the article is such that the continuity of Jewish and Christian apologetic (both admittedly influenced by Greek philosophy) on the possibility of recognizing the creator from his creation is not brought to the reader's attention. The Gnostics (who rejected this approach) remain unmentioned. The subject of Gotteserkenntnis, touched on in the three articles just described, was dealt with under the heading Gnosis I (reviewed in in JfTS, ns, xxxv (1984), 534-5). Another related heading is Gottes schauschauschau (Visio beatified) by A. H. Armstrong (vol. xii, 1-19). This article concentrates on the vision of God as the final goal of man, realized after death. Since this concept is central in Neoplatonism and in Christianity, Armstrong discusses it first with reference to Plotinus and later Neoplatonism with a brief review of the ante cedents in earlier Platonism and then with reference to patristic thought and the problems that arise when it is combined with a Trinitarian view of God and Christian eschatology. Despite the fact that it has been translated out of English into German this is one of the more readable contributions (but 'des Euchites' (16) is an error for 'der Euchiten' and 'Mt. 11, 2' (10) for 'Mt. 11, 27'; it would be worth adding John 17,3 to the influential Νew Τestament texts here).</page><page sequence="5">616 REVIEWS The article Gottesnamen (Gottesepitheta) is divided into four sections, of which II ('nichtchristlich') and III ('neutestamentlich patristisch') are postponed by means of references to the supple ments. The first section ('allgemein') by Burkhard Gladigow (1202-38) gives a general discussion from an anthropological viewpoint of the use of divine names and epithets with reference to Greek and Roman religion and to the Old Testament. Section IV ('christlich-volkstumlich') by C. Detlef G. Miiller (1238-78) consists of a collection of popular Christian material drawn from liturgies, magical spells, and exorcisms, apocryphal acts of apostles, homilies, and the like, and making frequent use of Coptic and Syriac as well as Greek and Latin texts. There are subsections on God, the Τrinity, and the individual persons of the Τrinity. Under the headings Gottermutter and Gottesmutter are cross references to Erde, Gottesgebarerin, and Kybele and to Gottes gebareringebarerin and Maria. The article prepared by the late Ethelbert Stauffer on this subject was not printed, but a related essay entitled 'Antike Madonnenreligionen' discussing a wide range of archaeo logical material has appeared in Aufstieg und Niedergang der romischenromischen Welt, ed. H. Temporini and W. Haase, ii. 17. 3 (Berlin, 1984), pp. 1425-99. Gottesgebarerin by the late Theodor Klauser (1071-i 103) is intended to cover only the history of the title Θεοτόκος Θεοτόκος (other aspects, in particular iconographic details, being postponed for the article Maria). In fact the article takes a wider approach than just an account of the use of this term (which is treated very fully in Lampe's Patristic Greek Lexicon, s.v.), and includes also description of the diffusion of the veneration of Mary, her festivals and churches dedicated to her. In the brief pagan section at the end (1095-9) it is concluded that Isis is the only 'Gottesmutter' of the Roman empire to have played a role com parable with that later taken by Mary. The excision of Gottermutter/ Gottesmutter Gottesmutter is to be regretted, since such articles might have offered material of wider interest than just the question of possible antecedents for the veneration of Mary (for example the inclusion of a female principle in the godhead as in many Gnostic systems, or the role of the mother of the divine (or divinely ordained) ruler). Mother goddesses are not given any detailed consideration in the article Gottesvorstellung. Unlike the articles just discussed Gottessohn by Carsten Colpe (vol. xii, 19-58) gives a full coverage of pre-Christian material but omits the patristic period. The introductory section defines the subject over against Gotteskindschaft (more general dependence of men on God) and Gottmensch (human beings with divine qualities) as the sonship of a human being who is linked more closely with the</page><page sequence="6">REVIEWS 617 deity (by conception, adoption, personal relationship, etc.) than is possible for men in general. Sons of gods within divine genealogies are excluded. The first section deals with the king as son of god in Egypt Egypt (where he is regarded as physically begotten by a god or by the previous ruler identified with Osiris) and in Mesopotamia (where the detailed interpretation of the underlying ideas is more complex), the second section (Greek and Hellenistic) with sons of Zeus (Dionysus, Heracles, Asclepius), with stories of the divine paternity of godlike men, with heroes as demigods and as ancestors of aristocratic families or of whole peoples, and with the use of 'son of god' as a title for Hellenistic rulers. There follow an Old Testa ment section starting with remarks on the very wide signification of the Hebrew and Aramaic words 'ben' and 'bar' and continuing with the Davidic king (interpretations of 2 Sam. 7: 14-16, Ps. 89: 27 f.; 2: 7; 110: 3), the whole people of Israel and individuals designated as son(s) of God, a section on Hellenistic Judaism including dis cussion of Philo (the κόσμος νοητός, which is identical with the Logos, as God's first son), Wisdom literature and Joseph and Aseneth, a Rabbinic section, and a concluding summary on the great variety of concepts of divine sonship (39-41). The detailed and concise Christian section includes reflection on the possibility that a general application of the designation 'son of God' to Jesus developed into a view of him as the only son of God under the influence of Jesus' own use of the address 'abba' to God in prayer and perhaps also of the awareness of his family of their descent from David (41 ff.), discussion of the sonship concept in the early community in connection with the heavenly voice at the baptism (Mark 1: 11), with the concept of eschatological kingship, with the resurrection, with the righteous suffering servant, with the son of man concept, and with the concept of pre-existence (43-6), sub sections on Paul (including Christians as sons of God), the Gospels and Acts, Hebrews (particularly fully discussed), and other New Testament writings and Apostolic Fathers (46-52), critical con sideration of theories that early Christology was influenced by a 'Gnostic redeemer' concept, by 'Hellenistic mythology', by the emperor cult, by the mystery religions, or by the kind of expectation of a divine child that is expressed in Virgil's fourth Eclogue (52-6), and finally a very brief survey of Christological developments in the early Church (56-7; Platonism is seen as a medium of new inter pretation of the figure of Christ rather than as a source of significant new motifs). The article Gotteskindschaft by Gerhard Delling (1159-85) concentrates on the patristic period with brief introductory sections on the Hellenistic, Jewish, and New Testament background. The</page><page sequence="7">618 REVIEWS subject is the characterization of the relationship of believers to God by terms such as 'children' or 'sons'. The sections on individual Church fathers illustrate such ideas as: God sent his son that we might become sons; he is son by nature, we become sons by grace and adoption, which takes place at baptism through the gift of the spirit. This sonship is sometimes linked with deification on the basis of Ps. 82: 6. Such views differ from pagan ideas of human beings in general as sons of Zeus and Jewish ideas of the people of Israel as God's son(s), but the position of the converted proselyte to Judaism may be compared with that of the Christian (1164) and the idea that Christians are sons because of the Logos within them (quoted from Athanasius, 1172) is similar to the Stoic view (illustrated from Epictetus, 1160-1; cf. the article Gottesvorstel lung,lung, 1359־)· The article Gottmensch occupies over two hundred columns and is divided between three authors, who take differing views of what is meant by the heading. Willy Schottroff is responsible for the first subdivision (Alter Orient u. Judentum, 155-234) and examines in detail and with generous documentation the divinization of rulers, sages, and 'heroes' in Mesopotamia and Egypt with consideration of the forms of expression, the underlying ideas and the lines of development. Whereas the Oriental sections might look like an expansion of the equivalent parts of the article Gottessohn, the Old Testament section has a different emphasis, since kings are dis missed briefly in the introductory paragraph (211-12) and the main part concentrates on prophets as men of God. There is no separate section on later Judaism, but later views on Elijah and Moses are included. In the second subdivision (Griechisch-romische Antike undund Urchristentum by Hans Dieter Betz, 234-312) 'Gottmensch' is taken to mean θείος άνήρ, a man with divine gifts, and is illustrated at length by examples of seers, prophets, mystagogues, miracle workers, poets, philosophers, and lawgivers, whose lives came to be surrounded by legendary features (much material is provided by the ancient biographical literature, but philosophical views on 'divine manhood' are also included). In the New Testament section various types of Christology are discussed, the two which receive most detailed attention being 'the pre-existent god-man redeemer' and the 'θείος άνήρ-Christology'. The approach here is very different from that of the corresponding section under Gottessohn, where the Old Testament background is kept closely in view and the sug gestion of influence from a Hellenistic θείος άνήρ concept regarded critically (53-4; such influence is implied though not explicitly affirmed in the Gottmensch article). Gnostic views, which might perhaps more usefully have been included in this subdivision, are</page><page sequence="8">REVIEWS 619 postponed to a later section (336-9) in Gottmensch III (Patristik) by Alois Grillmeier (312-66). This latter gives a discussion of Christo logical doctrine up to the seventh century, considering first the special terminology used to designate the combination of divinity and manhood in Christ (θεάνθρωπος, etc.) and then the historical development. It is noted that θείος άνηρ is not used of Christ (318 f.). The sections on terminology might give rise to the misconception that two nouns can be linked by a hyphen in Greek and Latin of the Patristic period. This is not the case (and whether word division was used or not in a written text was a question of aesthetics or of the level of education of its scribe—literary texts were written without word division). Thus in the passage quoted from Rufinus' transla tion of Origen, De principiis ii. 6. 3, the hyphen (which appears already in Koetschau's edition) between deus and homo should be removed and homo understood as in apposition to deus (314-15, repeated 354). What Origen's Greek read here is by no means certain (Lampe, Patristic Lexicon, art. θεάνθρωπος is misleading on this too). In comparison with Gottmensch the article Gottesgnadentum (Gottkonigtum)(Gottkonigtum) byj. RufusFears(! 103-59) illustrates the advantage of having a clearly defined subject treated by a single author. The general problems are kept clearly in view and there are useful remarks on the influence of one area on another (e.g. 1112, 1117, 1119, 1122, 1126, 1137). The coverage includes divine and god given kingship in Egypt and Mesopotamia, Israel, Greece (Homeric kings, charismatic leaders in the Classical period, Hellenistic rulers, 'theology of victory'), Rome (republican magistrates, charismatic leaders, emperors, with full illustration using evidence from coinage, panegyrics, etc.), early Christian attitudes (taking over from Hellenistic Judaism the rejection of emperor worship com bined with acceptance of the god-given nature of kingship), the Christian emperors in the fourth century (with pagan attitudes towards them) and in the fifth and following centuries (particularly interesting on the continuation of pagan practices and terminology implying the divinity of the emperor, n 50 ff.). GottesfreundGottesfreund by Kurt Treu (1043-60) discusses the concept of friendship between human beings and god(s), familiar as a kind of patronage of individuals or groups by the anthropomorphic gods of Homeric epic, but approached only with reservations (which are shown for example in a preference for θεοφιλής or φίλος θεώ rather than φίλος θεού) after the development of a more rational or philo sophical view of God. Such reservations are apparent also in Jewish and Christian writers, for whom Abraham and Moses in particular are friends of God, but also occasionally all wise men, all Christians or particular individuals such as martyrs and ascetics.</page><page sequence="9">620 REVIEWS GottesfurchtigerGottesfurchtiger by Marcel Simon (1060-70) is concerned with the disputed interpretation of the terms θεοοφΐis, σφόμΐνοι τον θΐόν, and φοβοΰμίνοι τον θΐόν (Latin metuentes), favouring the view that they can refer to a category of pagan sympathizers to Judaism who have not taken the step of becoming proselytes. The question of the regulations observed by such sympathizers is also considered. GottesbundGottesbund by the late Annie Jaubert (977-96) gives a concise discussion of the concept of covenant in Judaism, the New Testament and the early Church (Hebrew berit, Greek διαθήκη, and Latin testamentum, the latter encouraging the interpretation as 'testament' and used also of the writings of the Old and New Testament). The last section is on the sons of the covenant in the Syrian Church. GottesstaatGottesstaat (Civitas Dei) by Klaus Thraede (vol. xii, 58-81) takes its title from Augustine's City of God. The background in Stoic and Platonist philosophy, the Bible and Jewish and Christian thought to Augustine's concept of the heavenly and earthly cities (or citizen ship) is described and the development of Augustine's own views is outlined. GottesfeindGottesfeind by Wolfgang Speyer (996-1043) is concerned with enemies of gods/God both divine or demonic and human, ranging from myths of the conquest of demonic powers by a younger generation of heavenly gods, or of the fall of the devil and his angels, through tendencies to label malefactors or enemies of one's own state or religious group as enemies of the gods, to the punishments visited upon such enemies and the possibility of release from divine enmity. The division within each section is according to topics rather than chronological. The material is related to various other topics included in the lexicon and references to these are given in the course of the article and in the bibliography. GotteslasterungGotteslasterung by Helmut Merkel (1185-201) includes both blasphemy itself and other behaviour or attitudes that could be labelled as such. There is a section on the trial of Jesus and the charge against him of blasphemy, a capital offence in Judaism, which received discussion and definition from the Rabbis (1190-3). To the section on blasphemy among Christians (1197-8) should be added the fact that this might be demanded of them under persecu tion (e.g. Mart. Polyc. 9). C. P. Hammond Bammel C. P.
