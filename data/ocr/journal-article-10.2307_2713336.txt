<plain_text><page sequence="1">Thorstein Veblen and the Rhetoric of Authority CLARE VIRGINIA EBY University of Connecticut "Skepticism is the beginning of science." -Thorstein Veblen "'WHATEVER IS, IS WRONG.'" THAT SENTIMENT, THE FULCRUM OF Veblen's most famous book, mocks the "enlightened" faith in progress and order that he never tired of challenging. Serving his two main and, as many see them, competing roles as social scientist and social critic, "whatever is, is wrong" might well be Veblen's motto. To the Darwin- ian social scientist whose only certainty is that things will change, "whatever is, is wrong" is an analytic concept describing the inevitabil- ity of cultural lag. As he says several pages before dropping his bomb, "institutions are products of the past process, are adapted to past circumstances, and are therefore never in full accord with the require- ments of the present."' But to the social critic and master satirist, "whatever is, is wrong" is a weapon for attack and a shield under which to duck for cover. Veblen's motto suggests the passionate engagement of his Olympian detachment. A reassessment of Thorstein Veblen as both social scientist and social critic is under way. His methodological essays collected as The Place of Science in Modern Civilization were reissued in paperback in 1990 with Warren Samuels's introduction, which positioned Veblen in the vanguard of writers who have "concern[ed themselves] with the Clare Virginia Eby, an assistant professor of English at the University of Connecticut, is finishing a book on Veblen and Dreiser.

Last year, Thorstein Veblen and His Critics, 1891-1963-the first of Rick Tilman's projected three-volume study of Veblen-was published by Princeton University Press. Another traditional area for Veblen appreciation, literary criticism, shows signs of revival with several new interdisciplinary studies, including three books that prom- ise to reshape the field. Howard Horwitz's By the Law of Nature, Mark Seltzer's Bodies and Machines, and Martha Banta's Taylored Lives all use Veblen in ways that move well beyond the literary critic's obliga- tory nod to "conspicuous consumption" in twentieth-century novels. Another indication of a Veblen revival is that the International Thorstein Veblen Association held its first conference at the New School for Social Research in February 1994.2 This renewed interest in Veblen is itself part of a larger pattern. Tilman's Thorstein Veblen and His Critics demonstrates that apprecia- tion of Veblen has always run in cycles and documents the remarkable range of issues readers have found to praise or censure. Although Tilman finds the responses to Veblen-however contradictory-to be consistent, he concludes that "no consensus now exists on the value or even the meaning of Veblen's work."3 If some scholars have found Veblen easy to dismiss because of the impossibility of achieving a consensus on numerous important points about him-everything from his relationship to Marx to just how much he is pulling our legs-others value Veblen precisely for his being so protean. This uncertainty about how or where to place Veblen reveals a fault line in the scholarship. While the most astute interpreters-including John P. Diggins and the preeminent Veblen scholar, Joseph Dorfman- insist that he is both a detached social scientist and an engaged social critic, most studies focus on one mask of this Janus-faced writer to the virtual exclusion of the other. Hence, one body of Veblen scholarship- including the work of Diggins and Dorfman, as well as important studies by Leonard Dente, Lev Dobriansky, and Stanley Daugert- assesses the validity of his methodology and conclusions, seeks to define his position in economic history, or positions him relative to other social theorists. Another group of scholars-including Daniel Aaron, David Noble, and Theodor Adorno-seems more interested in Veblen's values than in his validity and emphasizes rhetorical analysis as a key to his work. Most scholars, even many who insist on his complexity, define him primarily as a social theorist or as a satirical</page><page sequence="3">VEBLEN'S RHETORIC OF AUTHORITY 141 social critic. In an irony that perhaps only Veblen himself could fully appreciate, some of his aficionados end up diminishing his accomplish- ments either by erring on the side of humorlessness or by so reveling in the humor that they cannot see how serious his jokes are.4 However tempting Veblen makes invidious comparisons, it is not necessary to choose between the two scholarly approaches. We need them both because Veblen wanted to analyze the status quo just as much as he wanted to sabotage it. Both the scientific and the satiric Veblen are interested in the fundamental issue of authority: on what basis do society's powerful institutions rest and with what authority can one challenge these institutions? The seeming conflict between the two Veblens-a conflict I believe he intentionally played up-has been instrumental in shifting attention away from the real unresolved question: how does Veblen establish his own authority? Here lies a fault line within Veblen himself, and examining it can help bridge the two scholarly approaches. Just as "whatever is, is wrong" is both an analytic concept and a satirical weapon, Veblen's authority as a scientist constitutes his authority as a critic, and vice versa. It does not suffice to say, as David Riesman claims in his provocative study, that Veblen "used sarcasm which he pretended was science," because the two sides of Veblen justify one another.5 Veblen establishes his professional credentials as a scholar and scientist by challenging existing authori- ties, and he simultaneously defends the engagement of satire on the grounds of the detachment of science. He thus cashes in on the prevailing scientism of his era while negotiating a way around the alleged value-neutrality of positivism. In today's tempestuous academic climate, with conservatives charg- ing that "tenured radicals" have stormed the ivory tower, the attempts of the never-tenured Veblen to legitimate himself deserve reconsidera- tion. The Veblenian riddle is how to establish oneself as an outsider with credentials, as a "radical with authority," to use Diggins's apt phrase. Although my concern here is with how Veblen negotiates this impasse, his dilemma should be familiar to intellectuals of many stripes who adopt a confrontational stance toward their cultures. Consider Giles Gunn's call to arms issued in 1992: "The essential challenge [for the American cultural critic] is to develop a voice that is attentive, answerable, and, as much as possible, unassimilable." Veblen's pre- dicament is precisely how to develop an unassimilable yet authoritative voice. His works mav be instructive to others who wish to be</page><page sequence="4">142 AMERICAN QUARTERLY "authoritatively antiauthoritative," to adopt a phrase recently coined by Susan Sniader Lanser. Lanser's formulation of the dilemma facing women writers who need a critical and persuasive narrative voice could be extended to other confrontational intellectuals such as Veblen: "mount[ing] an authoritative critique" of authoritative texts "necessi- tates standing in the very ground one is attempting to deconstruct."6 Earlier in the century, authoritatively antiauthoritative voices had their own distinctive enunciations, as the writings of public intellectu- als such as Theodore Dreiser and H. L. Mencken make clear. Contem- porary readers who relished Veblen's books frequently testified to the authority of his insubordination. Max Lerner, for instance, described him as a model for defiance: For many of the generation that came to maturity between the War and the crash Veblen was more than a thinker. He was, like Marx and Nietzsche, a symbol by which men measured their rejection of the values of the established order.... [H]is role was not directive but chiefly disillusioning.7 To reckon Veblen's authority by the number of readers who learned from him to reject the status quo is to situate him within the intellectual crisis facing his generation. Like many of his distinguished pragmatist and progressive contem- poraries, from William James to Charles Beard, Veblen's project is both a call for recognition as an intellectual and a reaction against profes- sionalism. While Veblen's own authority was enhanced by the decline of the amateur intellectual and the rise of the specialist, the establish- ment of the American research university and the development of doctoral programs, and the prestige of science, he declined such badges of professionalization as membership in academic societies, and he demonstrated scant sense of collegiality. When belatedly given an offer to stand as a candidate for the presidency of the American Economic Association on the condition that he join the association and deliver an address, Veblen declined.8 As Veblen's writings reveal an interesting case study in the construc- tion of intellectual authority-to some extent paralleling his contempo- raries' experiences, to some extent confirming only Veblen's recalci- trance-they also pertain to programmatic and philosophical questions central to the social sciences in general. In the first three quarters of the nineteenth century, as Thomas Haskell has demonstrated, American social scientists defined their work as inquiry combined with reform.</page><page sequence="5">VEBLEN'S RHETORIC OF AUTHORITY 143 But this ideal presupposed interpretive agreement about the facts under inquiry. Beginning as early as the 1880s, "it became obvious that the social problem was not fundamentally one of access to facts but of their interpretation."9 Conflicting interpretations undermined the very notion of fact. In the twentieth century, the axes on which social theory are graphed have been variously defined and vigorously contested, whether called description and evaluation, empiricism and speculation, or-in Jurgen Habermas's terms-analysis and interpretation. Social theorists un- comfortable with positivist stances often call for painstaking identifica- tion of the junctures between analysis and interpretation. Max Weber, for instance, urges in an essay which is shot through with an agonized sense of intellectual responsibility that a fundamental imperative of scientific freedom is that . . . it should be constantly made clear to the readers (and-again we say it-above all to one's self!) exactly at which point the scientific investigator becomes silent and the evaluating and acting person begins to speak.'0 In practice, the layperson can testify alongside the social scientist about how difficult it is to distinguish between analysis and interpretation. It is where the two axes of social theory join that Veblen locates his work. On the surface, he could protest as eagerly as Weber that the social scientist must distinguish sharply between empirical fact and interpretive judgment. Veblen would also no doubt endorse Charles S. Peirce's common sense definition of science: "it does not consist so much in knowing, nor even in 'organized knowledge,' as it does in diligent inquiry into truth for truth's sake, without any sort of axe to grind."1 But just below the surface, Veblen's value judgments infiltrate his empiricism, and he sharpens his axe with the facts. Whether Veblen fools himself with his objective stance is impossible to decide with empirical certainty, but I would speculate that he was well aware that his interpretations were as relative as those he debunked. Because Veblen tortuously constructs his own professional identity as a detached scholar and scientist over the course of his writings and hides many unresolved tensions behind the persona, examining how he legitimates his own authority will bring the fault lines to the surface. Specifically, Veblen is most deeply engaged while extolling the virtues of detachment, for instance in his comments on how "scientifically" to reform economic theory, in his celebrations of the scholar's "idle</page><page sequence="6">144 AMERICAN QUARTERLY curiosity" and of outsiders everywhere, in his attacks on academia and institutionalized Christianity, and in his praise for the "constructive" skepticism of engineers and intellectual Jews. These fault lines reveal how much of a vested interest Veblen has in his well-known detach- ment. Telling the Truth Veblen's assumption of the authoritative mantle of objectivity associ- ated with Darwinian science unites him with others of his generation even as it emphasizes his idiosyncracies. During the entire span of Veblen's career, the prestige of science was frequently invoked. In Pragmatism (1907), William James declares, "never were as many men of a decidedly empiricist proclivity in existence as there are at the present day. Our children, one may say, are almost born scientific." James's friend and colleague, Charles Peirce, had explained the appeal of science thirty years earlier in "The Fixation of Belief": only ''scientific investigation" could ease doubt by bringing one's opinions in line with facts. Still, in 1934, Charles Beard would insist that "the empirical or scientific method" was "the only method that can be employed in obtaining accurate knowledge."'12 These prominent scholars were, like Veblen, involved in reconstruct- ing their disciplines and redefining intellectual authority. As Thomas L. Haskell explains, Progressive Era intellectuals tended to be "extrava- gantly enthusiastic about the virtues of expertise." A prominent cadre of emerging experts, social scientists who wanted to fight the tide of adulating economic individualism, turned to "institutional exemplars of disinterestedness," which increasingly meant the research universities, to constitute their authority.'3 But while Veblen shared the hope of many liberal contemporaries that "science" purged of the values of the marketplace could restrain the flight into waste and craved intellectual recognition as much as his more sanguine peers, he was loath to use science to shore up American values. The need to analyze the connec- tive tissue of the body politic ran too deeply. Dorothy Ross, who describes the transformation of social thought into social science from the "crisis . . . of intellectual authority" characteristic of the Gilded Age to the emerging professionalization of the early twentieth century, illuminates Veblen's uniqueness. The Origins of American Social Science is in one sense Veblenian in spirit,</page><page sequence="7">VEBLEN'S RHETORIC OF AUTHORITY 145 for it aims to document the historical development of the social sciences while simultaneously advancing an authoritative critique of them. Particularly relevant to Veblen's project are two of Ross's criticisms: that American social science tends to be ahistorical and that it underwrites claims of American exceptionalism. After Gilded Age intellectuals responded to the disorienting prospects of socialism and the entrance of America into history by claiming professional authority based on their alignment with science, their Progressive heirs reconsti- tuted the social sciences based on liberal principles and historiography. Veblen, however, stood on the sidelines as, in Ross's words, "the great exception to this liberal revisionism, for he retained his Gilded Age socialism, and claimed for it the warrant not of ethics, but of positivist science." Veblen, in other words, stood out during his generation as more scientific and also as more critical. Unlike his contemporaries who would use science to reconstitute American exceptionalism, Veblen used science to unmask it.'4 Science for Veblen means both analytic ideal and satirical weapon. In "The Place of Science in Modern Civilization" (1906), he explains the imperative to identify his work as scientific. In a decentered world, the modem scientific method seems to enjoy a limited sort of absolut- ism: On any large question... the final appeal is by common consent taken to the scientist. The solution offered in the name of science is decisive so long as it is not set aside by a still more searching scientific inquiry. Veblen, who extols methodology over conclusions, comes close to endorsing theory for its own sake. It is as a citizen of the land of "pure theory" that he pronounces his judgments. The "cult of science," he admits, appears almost "idolatrou[s]." A related essay explains why the scientist's approach carries such authority: A modern science has to do with the facts as they come to hand, not with putative phenomena warily led out from a primordial metaphysical postulate. ... To meet the needs of science therefore, . . . modern concepts ... must be defined by observation rather than by ratiocination. Because the "modern" scientific point of view allegedly observes facts free of foregone conclusions, it allows one to see what has previously been invisible. For Veblen, modem is approximately synonymous with Darwinian.</page><page sequence="8">146 AMERICAN QUARTERLY As Eric Foner puts it in his new introduction to Social Darwinism in American Thought, Darwin "becomes a major point of self-definition and self-justification for intellectuals at a time when, through the rise of social science, their role in American society was becoming institution- alized." Much of Veblen's work latches onto the Darwinian demand for a transformation in what scientists observe and how they observe it. As Veblen says, "the question now . . . is not how things stabilise [sic] themselves in a 'static state,' but how they endlessly grow and change." Hence Veblen champions genetic inquiries that show how things came to be rather than how they will always remain. But the great man does not escape the logic of his own theory; as Veblen says, Darwin's "voice may even be taken as only one of the noises which the wheels of civilisation [sic] make when they go round."''6 The central lesson Veblen derives from Darwin is that truth must be continually redefined. Veblen legitimates himself by claiming access to a more inclusive truth than his orthodox competitors in the social sciences offer. The Veblen canon is remarkable for the width of field covered and for the number of disciplinary boundaries crossed-ranging through political economy, anthropology, psychology, sociology, history, political sci- ence, and philosophy-but it claims an unusual depth of insight, as well as breadth. It participates in what Morton White calls the turn-of-the- century social scientific "revolt against formalism," which challenges the empiricism of Bentham and Mill for not being empirical enough.'7 Veblen's claim that he observes more (and more accurately) than his predecessors facilitates both detached scientific analysis and engaged social criticism. Veblen supports his analysis by summoning what he idiosyncratically defines as "fact." No word is more loaded in his writings. "No unprejudiced inquiry into the facts can content itself with anything short of plain speech," Veblen says, a claim that helps him to mask his assaults in the cloak of objectivity. In the preface to his first book, he explains the novelty of his conclusions on the grounds of his reliance on "everyday life" and "homely facts" rather than on "recon- dite sources." A similar disclaimer prepares the reader of his last monograph for "workday facts" which will contradict "received theo- ries" and "recondite information." But these "obvious facts" Veblen is so fond of "have commonly been overlooked because they are too obvious to be seen except with the naked eye." Orthodox economists have been-to use Mark Twain's phrase-looking through glass eyes, darkly. Veblen's remark about how difficult it is to observe accurately</page><page sequence="9">VEBLEN'S RHETORIC OF AUTHORITY 147 the capitalistic order is characteristic: capitalism is "so intimate a fact ... that we have some difficulty in seeing it.""8 The alignment of "fact" with commonplace words that allegedly signify reality is also typical of Veblen. He accuses orthodox econo- mists of distorting reality by their "tissue[s] of metaphors" and prefers using what he calls "downright expressions in a scientific discussion." In one of the few times Veblen deigns to respond directly to a critic of his work, he accuses John Cummings of not understanding the plain meaning of words: "a deprecation of the use of everyday words in their everyday meaning," not any idiosyncratic usage on Veblen's part, prohibits the critic of Leisure Class from comprehending it. This resort to presumably true meanings of words, an assault on scientific lan- guage and professionalism, is instrumental in defending satire on the grounds of science. As Veblen says in the frequently savage Absentee Ownership (1923), "it is an unhappy circumstance that all this plain speaking . . . unavoidably has an air of finding fault."'9 One of Veblen's most characteristic rhetorical strategies, this re- course to fact to defend cultural confrontation shows how completely he merges science with satire and how the alignment vindicates his position. He insinuates that we need him to free us from the myopic vision of orthodox pseudo-scientists who neither see what is in front of their noses nor use words correctly. He contrasts their anachronistic notion of truth (absolute, rigid, normalized) with his version of truth (indeterminant, changing, actual) to make a scientific virtue of cultural criticism. The modern postulate of ceaseless and cumulative change invalidates entrenched wisdom wherever Veblen sees it serving the "vested interests": in business, in the leisure class, or in government. Veblen's use of constantly shifting "facts" for self-authorization is striking given his notoriously odd selections of facts.20 It is one of Veblen's deeper satires that he couches his work under the rubric of science to attack other scientists. Ever the champion of thrift, Veblen finds plenty of materials for constructing his own social theory from the wreckage of "self-contained systems" of received economic wisdom. His self-authorization becomes most patent where the critique is the sharpest. The entanglement of science and criticism is particu- larly evident when Veblen attacks these "balanced and compendious" theories of received economic wisdom on the grounds of the truth they offer and seeks to demonstrate how they have made many facts invisible. The only truths visible through the rose-colored lenses of</page><page sequence="10">148 AMERICAN QUARTERLY economic orthodoxy, he argues, are normalized and naturalized ideals to which facts rarely correspond. He cites, for instance, ritual incanta- tions such as "'ordinary' profits" and "'adequate demand"' which are bandied about in economic theory as if they actually corresponded not only to fact but also to an everlasting norm. These truths are merely hypothetical and ideologically motivated. Harmonious, beautiful schemes of "normal" and "natural" activities are upheld, and then the "ideal of conduct is made to serve as a canon of truth."2 Crucial to Veblen's argument is that his competitors have confused their ideal truths with real facts. The problem lies not only in conclusions drawn. Veblen charges that the dominant scientific method itself is a form of self-deception. Orthodox economists begin with their deductive, a priori truths and then "authenticate" them by a highly selective sort of inductive reasoning, which "neatly avoid[s]" any "inconvenient facts." They exclude from consideration any "untoward" or "undesirable" facts such as anything "wasteful, disserviceable, or futile." The goal of classical and neoclassical economic theory, Veblen charges, "is how to explain the facts away: how theoretically to neutralize them so that they will not have to appear in the theory." It is not just that orthodox economists do not tell the whole truth, or even that they are hostile to the truth, but that their methodology coerces foregone-and therefore false-conclusions from facts. Veblen labels their "scheme[s]" orders of "coercive normal- ity." One of Veblen's finest examples of the fallen state of science invokes the muse of satire: hedonistically "natural" categories of such taxonomic force ... run through the facts of any given economic situation, . . . so that, e.g., a gang of Aleutian Islanders slushing about in the wrack and surf with rakes and magical incantations for the capture of shell-fish are held, in point of taxonomic reality, to be engaged on a feat of hedonistic equilibration in rent, wages, and interest.22 Veblen sabotages tyrannical norms by making them laughable. Veblen slyly challenges entrenched economic theory on its ultimate ground of authority: its access to truth. He turns authority against itself by demonstrating that the more entrenched, the less accurate (even, Veblen's most compliant readers will say, the more ludicrous) any institutionalized version of truth becomes. All theories are obsolete insofar as they derive from past experience; anything established must</page><page sequence="11">VEBLEN'S RHETORIC OF AUTHORITY 149 be behind the times. "Whatever is, is wrong." Telling the truth means accepting the principle of ceaseless change, resisting moralistic expla- nations of phenomena, and observing things that have been invisible to others. Veblen attempts to convince readers that, while eternal and unchanging truth is illusory, his own descriptions of reality are the most complete and accurate versions available. What others call truth is, at best, wishful thinking; at worst, it is a tyrannical norm. This radical relativism may seem an awkward way of establishing one's authority, but-as Thomas Haskell suggests in the introduction to The Authority of Experts, a volume appropriately dedicated to Veblen- to hold that expert opinion is but a moment in the ... stream of conversation of the initiated and to hold that it does not imperfectly mirror Reality but actually constitutes the only "reality" mankind can ever know, is to take a position that may ultimately enhance the authority of experts.23 Theoretical systems that refuse closure or prophecy-Veblenian hall- marks-would by this line of logic be preferable to anything balanced or compendious. Veblen implicitly promotes his own theories in all their self-conscious novelty. Whatever Is Sacred Is Especially Wrong Here lies one Veblenian fault line. Indignant claims for objectivity are most likely to accompany stinging indictments. The prestige of science rescues belligerent attacks by throwing out the promise of "objectivity." Peter Novick offers a wise observation in his study of the founding myth of the American historical profession that, from a slightly different perspective, applies to Veblen: the objectivity question is far from being "merely" a philosophical question. It is an enormously charged emotional issue: one in which the stakes are very high, much higher than in any disputes over substantive interpretations. For American historians, the myth of objectivity has underwritten a belief that historical facts "are prior to and independent of interpreta- tion." The historian's putative access to these facts is his badge of professionalization, the foundation of his authority. Although the objectivity myth is also a founding one for Veblen's social theory, there is a real difference between his use of it and that of the pre-World War</page><page sequence="12">150 AMERICAN QUARTERLY I historians whom Novick describes as constructing consensual inter- pretations of the Civil War based on "scientific" tenets of racism.24 It is inconceivable that these historians consciously deployed the objectivity ideal to dupe themselves and their readers. It seems equally inconceiv- able that Veblen deployed it without self-consciousness. To put it most simply, the Veblenian difference is the use of the objectivity myth to subvert hegemonic views. Veblen's invocation of the coolness of objectivity in order to pass off volatile, emotional interpretations is especially evident in his treatment of one of the master authorities against which he defines himself professionally: institutionalized religion. Because it is such an en- trenched authority, the Church is an especially appealing target for Veblen. He reads Christian teachings as the definitive textbook in which the social scientist can study the operation of institutionalized schemes of repression. Because it blinds its believers into mistaking culturally specific fabrications for absolute truth, Christianity becomes, in Veblen's hands, hostile to reality in general and to his enterprise in particular. Veblen's persona, of course, insists on his agnosticism. He once remarked that a "devout scientist" was as rare as a "white blackbird." Although two of the most provocative treatments of Veblen character- ize him as a moralist,25 little attention has been paid to the extent that analysis of religious authority saturates his writing. Veblen's critique of Christianity exemplifies how cultural criticism and social science underwrite each other and how the entanglement of these two perspec- tives serves the greater cause of validating his own social theory. Veblen inherited from the Gilded Age the perception that scientific and religious authorities were competitors in the battle to define the truth. The Higher Learning in America (1918) opens with Veblen's argument that every society has enjoyed a distinctive body of esoteric knowledge, presided over by some "select body of adepts or special- ists," whether shamans, priests, or scientists. This knowledge "makes up the substantial core of the civilization." He who has access to this knowledge possesses power and prestige. The scientist's increasing status in the modern age occurs not only because he alone intimately understands technology but also because he counters priestly authority: modern science comes into the field under the cloak of technology and gradually encroaches on the domain of authentic theory previously held by</page><page sequence="13">VEBLEN'S RHETORIC OF AUTHORITY 151 other, higher, nobler, more profound, more spiritual, more intangible concep- tions of knowledge. Veblen defends the idea that the scientist's gain is the priest's loss on one of his favorite grounds: technological evolution. As he explains in The Theory of Business Enterprise (1904), the chief characteristic of modem technology, the machine process, demands a transformation of habits of thought: The machine throws out anthropomorphic habits of thought.... The machine process gives no insight into questions of good and evil.... Its scheme of knowledge and of inference is based on the laws of material causation, not on those of immemorial custom, authenticity, or authoritative enactment.... The characteristically modern science does not inquire about prime causes, design in nature, . . . or eschatological consequences.26 The machine process makes traditional religious habits of thought and schemes of valuation obsolete while placing a premium on scientific reckonings. Veblen uses this secularizing trend to argue that religious and scientific authorities are fundamentally incompatible. Good religion makes poor science: "in the institutional scheme of the civilised [sic] nations the beginning of wisdom is the fear of God; whereas in the technology of physics and chemistry the beginning of wisdom is to forget Him." He repeatedly contrasts what he calls "scientific" with "homiletical" use of data; the former is a matter of "fact," the latter of "faith."27 The invidious comparison implicitly aligns faith with fal- sity-whether the untruth be of the self-deluded or the externally imposed variety. Veblen pointedly uses the opposition he sets up between science and religion to counter authority invested in both persons and institutions. In a review of John Bates Clark's The Essentials of Economic Theory, Veblen attempts to invalidate the ideas of the man who taught him economics at Carleton College. Clark cannot, charges Veblen, construct ''economic theory" because he is a "spokesman for the competitive system." Although the partisanship Veblen accuses Clark of is primarily political, the critique enters the moral realm when he elaborates in a footnote: What would be the scientific rating of the work of a botanist who should spend his energy in devising ways and means to neutralize the ecological</page><page sequence="14">152 AMERICAN QUARTERLY variability of plants, or of a physiologist who conceived it the end of his scientific endeavors to . . . denounce the imitative coloring of the Viceroy butterfly? What scientific interest would attach to the matter if Mr. Loeb, e.g., should devote a few score pages to canvassing the moral responsibilities incurred by him in his parental relation to his parthenogenetically developed sea-urchin eggs?28 As Clark loses his scientific credibility in his unseemly concern over morality, Veblen reestablishes his authority-at his former teacher's expense-by absorbing satire into science. Veblen's hostility to moralizing also serves to distinguish him from his immediate precursors and many of his contemporaries. As David Hollinger demonstrates, the late nineteenth-century scientist was seen as the "complete Victorian"-selfless, humble, diligent, self-contained, and above all, moral. It was not only that science was seen as requiring a noble character but also that "the actual doing of scientific work could produce . . . a refined moral sensibility." Hollinger points out that, long after many Victorian beliefs were packed away with other quaint bric- a-brac and sent to the cultural attics, notions of the moral efficacy of science persist.29 Veblen reformulates this myth for his own ends. He keeps the idea of the purity of the scientist but locates that purity in the defiance of, not in the submission to, morality. Veblen's rejection of the moral scientist paradigm throws an interest- ing light on the way he saturates his critique of orthodox economic theory with religious metaphors. As he says, "the so-called 'sciences' associated with these pragmatic disciplines, such as jurisprudence, political science, and the like, are a taxonomy of credenda." He finds economic theory especially prone to contaminate its scientific basis by excessive devotion to its articles of faith. Economists who would shore up a "natural law" do so, after all, in the interest of "spiritual stability" and for the sake of "spirituarli legitimat[ion]." He likewise mocks the "dogma of 'overproduction."' "Whether describing Adam Smith's legacy as "devout optimism" or the self-fulfilling nature of John Bates Clark's theories as "afford[ing] a basis for those who believe in the old order . . . to confirm in the faith those who already believe in the old order," Veblen uses the language of religion to invalidate the authority of orthodox economic theory.30 But, as is often the case with obsessively reiterated metaphorical patterns, Veblen's religious images are not only symbolic. He means quite literally that such an "'accomplished fact"' as invested wealth is</page><page sequence="15">VEBLEN'S RHETORIC OF AUTHORITY 153 treated by economists as "institutionally sacred." In his most apocalyp- tic book, Veblen places his own faith in the engineers because of their willingness to enact "shocking infractions of the sacred realities" of business as usual. Invested wealth and other economic "facts" that serve the vested interests function like sacred dogmas in that people worship them, fear to question them, and assume-like devout com- mentators on natural disasters-that the greater good is being served in mysterious ways. Faith in business, like faith in God, once "accepted and assimilated as real, though perhaps not as actual," predetermines one's conclusions.31 Veblen uses the truism that it is impossible to question the authenticity of any belief from within a circle of faith to assail the secular status quo. In a notorious note at the end of chapter 11 of Absentee Ownership, Veblen takes the alignment of Christian morals with the competitive system even further. Published two years before Bruce Barton's The Man Nobody Knows and four years before Sinclair Lewis's Elmer Gantry, Veblen's analysis of the salesmanship of salvation shows "how truly business-as-usual articulates with the business of the Kingdom of Heaven." For sheer diabolical wit, Veblen is at his finest in his analysis of "this fabrication of vendible imponderables in the nth dimension."32 He recommends that secular salesmen take note of how Christians have perfected the businesslike art of promising everything-even salva- tion-and delivering nothing. This seven-page note, in small print and complete with two footnotes of its own, also draws attention to Veblen's own authority. Like Alexander Pope in The Dunciad and Jonathan Swift in the "Voyage to Laputa," Veblen plays serious games with the paraphernalia of aca- demic authority. Nowhere is Daniel Aaron's comment that Veblen uses the form of the academic monograph for his own ends better illustrated than in his outrageous footnotes.33 Veblen attacks authority most vitriolically in footnotes, as seen in this damnation of salvation, and in the comment about Viceroy butterflies and Loeb's sea urchins cited earlier. Another typically Veblenian use of footnotes, to cite his own earlier work, also plays consequential games with scholarly authority. His obsessive footnoting of his own work is a reminder of the self- interest and vanities of scholarship. Veblen's footnotes display his mastery of and his contempt for scholarly writing techniques, while they cordon off especially polemical material by excluding it from the text proper.34</page><page sequence="16">154 AMERICAN QUARTERLY This partitioning off of volatile material is a classic Veblen ploy. He also uses this strategy to justify his savage attacks on religion by refusing to consider its very ground of authenticity: morality. Indeed, Veblen makes the exclusion of morality the very ground of his authority as a scientist to criticize all institutions, whether economic, political, or religious. As he says, modem science cannot help but derange behav- iors that institutions have made to seem "habitual"; it is the business of scientists to examine the nature of the conventions under which men live, the institutions of society,-customs, usages, traditions, conventions, canons of conduct, stan- dards of life, of taste, of morality and religion, law and order. He invokes the same sort of logic to protect his claim that "whatever is, is wrong." Veblen audaciously denies that the words "wrong" or "right" convey any judgment: "They are applied simply from the (morally colourless [sic]) evolutionary standpoint."35 Veblen rules out the traditional moral ground throughout his work, but the tendency becomes especially notable in his analyses of religious institutions. In the attack on the salesmanship of salvation in Absentee Ownership, for instance, he insists that he is only considering the "workday factors" of religion-and these in a "detached and objective" manner, "leaving all due sanctimony on one side for the time being, without thereby questioning the need and merit of such sanctimony as an ordinary means of grace." Again, in the essay on "Christian Morals and the Competitive System," Veblen declares that he can entertain "no question . . . as to the intrinsic merit, the eternal validity, of either."36 Only because he poses as just a scientist looking scientifically can Veblen exclude the moral from discussions of morality. Veblen's strategy of ruling out the moral ground while attacking Christianity is at least as obsessive as the assaults themselves. It underwrites his attack on religion in Leisure Class, where he examines only "tangible, external features of devout observances." Conveniently remembering that he is an economist, Veblen points out that "the moral, as well as the devotional value of the life of faith lies outside of the scope of the present inquiry." In a condemnation of the Church's condemnation of illegitimate births, Veblen analyzes the evolution of the idea of sin on the grounds of economics and biology while outrageously ruling out questions of morality. Illegitimate babies do not, he explains in another explosive footnote,</page><page sequence="17">VEBLEN'S RHETORIC OF AUTHORITY 155 lend themselves to that routine of sacramental excise from which the clerics of Holy Church derive a substantial portion of their livelihood. On these, and perhaps on other grounds, illegitimate births have had the fortune to become sinful. ... Such births may be rated as an undesigned triumph of the hormones over the proprieties. Even in the introduction to the medieval Icelandic saga he painstak- ingly translated into English, Veblen cannot resist critiquing the Church: "The mediaeval [sic] Church in Iceland stands out . . . as a corporation of bigoted adventurers for the capitalizing of graft and blackmail and the profitable compounding of felonious crimes and vices." He follows this barb by reaffirming the virtue of the Church in such a way as to consign it permanently to Hell: "It is of course not intended to question that this . . . Church . . . remained a faithful daughter of Rome and doubtless holy as usual."37 Veblen is quick to provide "scientific" reasons for disputing the Church's authority and for excluding moral reckoning. His theory of cultural lag identifies religion as one of the most reactionary forces impeding human development, and he characterizes devoutness itself as an evolutionary throwback. Despite his loaded and at times belliger- ent implications, Veblen declares repeatedly that he is only interested in the institutional aspects of religion and the habits of thought they foster. He cannot stomach the claim of Christianity to permanent and universal truth. He baldly states his especial opposition to religion in Absentee Ownership: while institutions are "always archaic ... in some degree," the more removed from daily life they are, the more out of date they are bound to be. Consequently politics is "always more archaic" than more pragmatic arenas of human behavior, and religion "even more archaic" than politics. Religion is a reactionary force in Veblen's scheme of cultural evolution, its "fashions" "notoriously" slow to change. It exemplifies what Veblen calls "imbecile institution[s]. "38 Veblen's critique of Christianity epitomizes his attack on authorita- tive institutions in order to vindicate his own position. Perhaps the most astounding aspect of his cultural criticism is how, on the ground of the sovereignty of science, he claims moral neutrality. With such value- laden interpretations draped in the garb of "mere" observation, Veblen thumbs his nose at two authorities: Christianity and positivist science.</page><page sequence="18">156 AMERICAN QUARTERLY Courting the Margins Veblen has just as much of a vested interest in his alleged detachment when it comes to his fascination with what lies outside the margins of the accepted social order. His invocation of science cannot be separated from its usefulness in vindicating perspectives that challenge the status quo. As Veblen was one of the first to point out, it is the nature of beliefs (of economists, of the devout, of businessmen) to seem "natu- ral" and, therefore, to pass unquestioned. But, he asserts from his Olympian heights, it takes an "outsider" to see his culture clearly, and an economist, he says, has no choice but to look "in perspective from the outside." Veblen stakes out his territory in opposition to the tendency of American culture to co-opt its intellectuals and to marginalize those who are critical. Declaring independence from mainstream values, Veblen defends his life's work in Leisure Class: "Any given ground of distinction will seem insubstantial to any one who habitually apprehends the facts . . . from a different point of view."39 This habitual difference constitutes Veblen's signature. It is probably also the most familiar aspect of the Veblen legend. Scholars have characterized him as ''alien twice over," ''citizen of nowhere by nature," "visitor from Mars," an "unacclimated alien," and "village iconoclast," and they have noted his "intellectual orphanhood" and "automatic reaction against anything given." Dos Passos's brilliant sketch of Veblen likewise highlights his "constitutional inability to say yes." Joseph Dorfman is the most authoritative of many readers not only to cite but also to endorse Veblen's legendary aloofness: The "man from Mars" vantage point . . . is an especially valuable aid to insight in times of unusually rapid and far-reaching social and economic change.... Indeed, it is reasonable to query whether the particular kind of original, fundamental speculations offered us by Veblen would have been possible had he sprung from the mainstream of our society. Such characterizations may distance us from Veblen today, when rampant skepticism about the possibility of standing outside of one's culture renders the desirability of such a stance a moot point.4" Regardless of one's views on the nature, extent, or meaning of Veblen's alienation, that his writings advance this myth of himself is beyond dispute. Subsequent endorsement of the legend-constituting the closest thing there is to a consensus on Veblen-confirms his</page><page sequence="19">VEBLEN'S RHETORIC OF AUTHORITY 157 authority as he liked to define it. Discreditation by agents of the status quo is a key aspect of Veblen's credentials. His writings reveal two pronounced strategies for cultivating the view of himself as an alien. One is his construction of the myth of what he liked to call idle curiosity, the keynote of "disinterested" research and the hallmark of the scientist-scholar. The second is the establishment of a network of private heroes, figures ahead of their times with whom he covertly aligns himself. Veblen places a premium on iconoclasm and romanti- cizes the virtues of conducting intellectual work on the margins. The conflict between his praise for detachment and his romanticization of it reveals another fault line. Idle curiosity is one of only three "instincts" that Veblen champions. The other two favored instincts, workmanship and the parental bent (not simply procreation but, in Dente's apt phrase, the manifestation of "social sympathy"), Veblen could not lay much claim to possessing. Idle curiosity, however, is his terrain. One need not go so far as Riesman, who charges Veblen with celebrating idle curiosity to counter charges of his laziness, to see that Veblen's passion for this supremely scientific trait is hardly detached. His most concise definition of idle curiosity occurs on several pages of his favorite among his books, The Instinct of Workmanship and the State of the Industrial Arts (1914). Distinct from workmanship, which is what motivates us to make things, idle curiosity makes us "want to know things, when graver interests do not engross [our] attention." It is the impulse to attain and increase knowledge for its own sake. Veblen associates idle curiosity with play, youth, and of course with the "higher range of intelligence.' Many scholars who have rightly noted that idle curiosity, workman- ship, and the parental bent form Veblen's sacred "trinity" see the three "instincts" as aspects of a master pattern, frequently defined as workmanship. Aligning these three instincts makes sense insofar as the point is to show their difference from counterproductive traits such as predation, exploit, and ceremonialism. But in one important sense, idle curiosity remains qualitatively different from the other two instincts that Veblen favors. While the parental bent and workmanship encour- age people to work together, idle curiosity isolates the person manifest- ing it. Neither utilitarian nor teleological, idle curiosity has been underrated by both social scientists and the common man: "Sporadic individuals who are endowed with this supererogatory gift largely in excess of the common run . .. are accounted dreamers, or in extreme</page><page sequence="20">158 AMERICAN QUARTERLY cases their more sensible neighbours [sic] may even rate them as of unsound mind." Veblen defends scholars and scientists just as he defends his heroic engineers from the ungracious perception that they constitute "a somewhat fantastic brotherhood of over-specialized cranks."42 On the surface, this may not seem unique. As Thomas Haskell notes, many American intellectuals from 1850 until 1930 defined themselves professionally as opponents to the pervasive values of the marketplace. But even these confrontational intellectuals cultivated a sense of scholarly community. Peirce's formulation is one of the best known: "We individually cannot reasonably hope to attain the ultimate philoso- phy which we pursue; we can only seek it, therefore, in the community of philosophers." In one of Peirce's most gorgeous phrases, he stresses that cooperation epitomizes the scientific method: the idea of science is to pile the ground before the foot of the outworks of truth with the carcasses of this generation, and perhaps of others to come after it, until some future generation, by treading on them, can storm the citadel. The Peircean ideal of community was, according to Daniel Wilson, central to the reconstruction of American philosophy from 1860 to 1930. Even the individualistic William James, notes Wilson, felt that "truth could not be pragmatically validated in the long run unless it was ultimately consistent with the experiences of others." Peter Novick also emphasizes the importance of community and describes pre-World War I historians as so connected "by ties of friendship, patronage, or sycophancy" that they avoided controversy at all costs. Thomas Haskell-who treats the development of modem historical, economic, and sociological disciplines-generalizes that a twentieth-century professional's claim to authority hinges on his membership in a "community of peers." Haskell continues, "neither Peirce nor anyone else would argue that mere conformity can earn a person high standing in the community-but neither, certainly, can idiosyncracy."43 Veblen is that someone else. He shares his generation's faith in intellectual work but idiosyncratically denies the grounds of its merit so as to reconstitute authority in his own terms. The Veblenian difference is that he does not retreat into a professional community but into intellectual isolation. Idle curiosity, manifested in scientists and in engineers, keeps them outside of the mainstream.</page><page sequence="21">VEBLEN'S RHETORIC OF AUTHORITY 159 Special pleading for outsiders everywhere runs throughout Veblen's books. (At one point, his disgust with the vested interests leads him to define "outsiders" as all "citizens of the Republic.") At times, the special pleading for idle curiosity overlaps with the romantic defense of artists' creativity. It is a small step from saying that "science creates nothing but theories" to saying that idle curiosity is an autonomous ''creative factor" which must be allowed to express itself unchecked. Further suggesting its creative powers, Veblen insinuates that idle curiosity is related to the impulse to make myths and construct other narratives. Although not motivated by pragmatic considerations, idle curiosity, like aesthetic productions, "counts up finally ... into the most substantial cultural achievement of the race."44 Veblen also defends idle curiosity as the force driving technology, and therefore the evolution of human culture, forward. The lower levels of thought-which he variously calls worldly wisdom, matter-of-fact generalizations, or pragmatic knowledge-remain fairly stable over time. It is "on the higher levels of speculative generalization" where idle curiosity operates that the impressive mutations in the development of thought have taken place.... [In contrast] the matter-of-fact generalisations [sic] have met with relatively few adventures and have afforded little scope for intellectual initiative and profoundly picturesque speculation. These "impressive mutations" will only emerge from a freely ranging mind. It is precisely because idle curiosity is in the vanguard of the social evolutionary process that those who manifest it are resisted. Yet the discoveries of idle curiosity will eventually be turned to useful ends by the lower levels of intelligence, such as the matter-of-fact "worldly wisdom." Veblen implies that to restrain idle curiosity is to impede technological and scientific progress. Idle curiosity sanctions his plea, therefore, for absolute intellectual freedom on the grounds of maximiz- ing social good. As he argues in Higher Learning, "intellectual initiative ... [cannot] be reduced to any known terms of subordination, obedience, or authoritative direction... . A free hand is the first and abiding requisite of scholarly and scientific work." This plea to emancipate idle curiosity underwrites Veblen's suggestion that social control should be given over to the chief recipients of the instinct: the engineers, scientists, and the right economists.45 Veblen's insistence that idle curiosity must be set free empowers, in</page><page sequence="22">160 AMERICAN QUARTERLY turn, his cultural critique. One of the most characteristic attributes of the practitioners of idle curiosity is their skepticism about received wisdom; indeed, says Veblen, "skepticism is the beginning of science." Although he describes the engineers' skepticism as "constructive,"46 his own skepticism is destructive of "whatever is." Veblen shows exactly what idle curiosity can do in his two most speculative books, The Higher Learning in America (1918) and Engineers and the Price System (1921). In these works, Veblen celebrates his own version of learning while enacting subversive criticism. By imagining the unimaginable, Higher Learning and Engineers comprise sly tributes to, and exemplars of, idle curiosity. The rhetorical strategies of these two books are remarkably similar, especially in the conclusions. Higher Learning and Engineers feature Veblenian heroes drawn in quick, broad, and often imprecise strokes: independent scholar-scientists and engineers. Both offer radical programs for re- forming bloated and counterproductive institutions ruled by predatory business principles. Each book provides what is in effect a blueprint for revolution only to retreat in the final pages to protestations that, in the words of Higher Learning, "this inquiry is nowise concerned to reform" and that its "heroic remedy" is "bound to fail." He takes the same evasive stance in Engineers; his "purpose [is] . . . to show, in an objective way, that under existing circumstances there need be no fear, and no hope, of an effectual revolutionary overturn in America" along the lines he has just sketched.47 Idle curiosity sanctions proposing reforms, but it also necessitates disavowing them. Veblen ends his satirical analysis of academia by stating, "now, all this speculation as to what might happen has, of course, little else than a speculative value." He ends Engineers by similarly affirming idle curiosity: "little more than a speculative interest" has been motivating him.48 Idle curiosity is essential to Veblen's intellectual authority because its "curious" nature permits skepticism while its "idle" quality eludes responsibility. Ending both books by running for cover under idle curiosity, he is able both to sabotage the system and to deny that he is making any proposals for change on the grounds that he is pursuing a merely "speculative" inquiry. The complaints are legion that Veblen (unlike the pragmatists and other progressives) fails to develop constructive plans for change. These complaints betray either misunderstanding or rejection of Veblen's</page><page sequence="23">VEBLEN'S RHETORIC OF AUTHORITY 161 agenda. He does not believe that knowledge should be conceived of as a tool. Instrumentalism proceeds from the assumption that knowledge should serve the human community. But Veblen, who tries not to belong to any community, aspires to being a nonparticipant observer.49 Veblen's myth of idle curiosity reveals its own fault lines. It barely escapes contamination (if, indeed, it does escape) from a term that Veblen himself makes noxious: the idea of leisure. Several scholars have questioned, and I think justly, whether Veblen's ornately and self- consciously academic style and form do not advertise the leisured origins of his writing. Because Veblen champions the workday facts of technology and opposes leisure to productivity, he seems to shift the ground when he explains the glorious freedom of idle curiosity on the basis of "its excursions [being] not so immediately and harshly checked by material facts." Veblen seems aware of the shiftiness when, in Higher Learning, he hedges around the question of leisure and affirms that the idleness of idle curiosity is neither "aimless [nor] indolent ... nothing like dissipation . . . nor is it 'idle' in any other sense than that it is extra-economic."5" Nevertheless, it is hard to accept Veblen, of all people, denying any economic significance to something he considers so important. A second and possibly more serious fault line is that, despite Veblen's attacks on his distinguished colleagues and his constitutional sympathy for the "common men" underdogs, idle curiosity smacks of intellectual elitism. He admits that "the common man does not eagerly pursue the quest of the idle curiosity, and neither its guidance nor its award of fact is mandatory to him."'" The general population is more likely to see a "man from Mars" as a freak than a prophet. The combination of Veblen's anti-intellectualism manifested in some of his attacks on distinguished colleagues with the tendency toward intellec- tual elitism implicit in idle curiosity suggests an unresolved tension in his thinking. The exclusion of the common man from the circle of noble outsiders who manifest idle curiosity becomes clearer in the genealogy of heroes Veblen constructs. They seem less a community of intellectuals than a secret society. Although it is rare for Veblen to praise anyone, when he does commend another writer, the self-projection is dazzling. The trait that all of his heroes share, besides incisive intelligence, is that they transcend the commonplaces of their day. They are men who do not fit in. Veblen defends intellectuals who were too "scientific" for their</page><page sequence="24">162 AMERICAN QUARTERLY times and whose findings, therefore, were rejected by defenders of the status quo. The basic pattern of Veblen's commendation can be discerned even in his characterization of an economist whose work he only partially endorses, Gustav Schmoller. In his review of Grundriss der allgemeinen Volkswirtschaftslehre, Veblen extols Schmoller for inaugurating a new branch of historical economics. Insofar as Schmoller was an "icono- clast" who "protest[ed] against the aims and ideals then [in the 1860s] in vogue," Veblen has nothing but praise for him. Insinuating advertise- ments for his own work, Veblen makes clear that Schmoller's recalci- trance leads to scientific advance. The German's work comes in for recommendation for being like Veblen's: resistant to "classificatory statements of uniformity or of normality," "chiefly critical" of his colleagues, and drawing upon a vast range of "commonplace" details from fields as diverse as psychology and ethnography. Veblen praises Schmoller also for excluding moral considerations asking "how and why" rather than how things "ought to be" and for purging himself of ideology and bowing to "no economic, political, or cultural creed." For these reasons, Veblen declares the German's work "constructive," "scientific," and theoretical. Although "a work of the first magnitude," Grundriss der allgemeinen Volkswirtschaftslehre disappoints Veblen once its author arrives at the discussion of his contemporary scene. As Schmoller stoops to consider policy and "sav[ing]" modern society, he becomes less scientist than preacher.52 David Hume receives less equivocal praise and resembles Veblen even more closely-in the few pages devoted to eulogizing him in "The Preconceptions of Economic Science: I." Veblen bills Hume as a consummate outsider. A keynote of the sketch of Hume is the trait Veblen says characterizes the beginning of science: skepticism. Hume "was gifted with an alert, though somewhat histrionic skepticism touching everything that was well received." Hume's reputation during his lifetime confirms Veblen's myth of the skeptical scientist as misunderstood prophet: although he "out Britishes the British," "the skeptic of the type of Hume has never been in good repute with those who stand closest to the accepted religious truths." Particularly interest- ing, given Veblen's notorious difficulties with his colleagues, is the suggestion that while Hume's contemporaries judged him standoffish if not hostile, they rejected him rather than vice versa. Hume's gift or plague was being in advance of his time, "too modem to be wholly</page><page sequence="25">VEBLEN'S RHETORIC OF AUTHORITY 163 intelligible to those of his contemporaries who are more nearly abreast of their time."53 This claim for Hume's extravagant modernity is noteworthy since Veblen so assertively labels his own work as "mod- ern" science. Veblen places Hume in the vanguard of scientific inquiry, aligns him with the progressive drift of idle curiosity, while offering a trans-historical explanation for why skeptical prophets might not be recognized in their own time. In his characterization of his greatest competitor, Marx, Veblen focuses on discrediting hostile critics. Veblen's Marx towers mightily over everyone except Veblen himself. Given Marx's facility for forging a science out of social criticism, it is no wonder that Veblen reads Marx the way Veblen himself wants to be read. He lays out a model defense for Marx that could acquit himself as well. The intellectual peons who carp that Marx offers no proof for his labor theory of value fail to see "a self-satisfied superior's playful mystification of those readers (critics) whose limited powers do not enable them to see that his proposition is self-evident." The critics judge Marxist theory against the status quo and "piously" believe to have refuted it, "whereas, of course, they have for the most part not touched it." Veblen compliments him in the highest terms he knows: all hostile criticism has proven "inconclusive" because Marx is more radical than has been understood. The goal: confound your critics by staying so far ahead of your time that no one can catch you. Veblen describes Marx as such a trailblazer that one must follow him on his own terms, or not at all: It is . . . not by an itemised [sic] scrutiny of the details of doctrine and by tracing their pedigree . .. that a fair conception of Marx. .. may be reached, but rather by following him from his own point of departure out into the ramifications of his theory. Veblen's self-projection extends even to the attribution of his own trademark, "oracular obscurity," to Marx.54 Veblen's most enthusiastic celebration of intellectual outsiders oc- curs in his remarkable essay opposing Zionism where, as has often been noted, he projects himself unabashedly. Veblen's praise for the Jewish "pathfinders and iconoclasts, in science, scholarship, and insti- tutional change and growth" seems as sincere as it is self-serving. So is the insistence that although "it will not do to say that none but renegade Jews count effectually in the modern sciences," renegades are espe- cially likely to make scientific discoveries. The essay is notable, too,</page><page sequence="26">164 AMERICAN QUARTERLY for containing Veblen's most direct suggestion that idle curiosity (here called simply the "skeptical frame of mind") is more important than its companion instinct, workmanship.55 "The Intellectual Pre-Eminence of the Jews in Modem Europe" is a classic of Veblen rhetoric in that the ostensible subject is the pretext for a long digression containing the real agenda; he is less concerned here with Zionism than with explaining why the best scholars and scientists do not, by definition, fit into their culture. The cardinal virtue of his intellectual Jews is their actual and intellectual homelessness. These "wanderer[s] in the intellectual no-man's land" are superb scholars because of their alienation. Indeed, argues Veblen, only when the gifted Jew escapes from the cultural environment created and fed by the particular genius of his own people, only when he falls into the alien lines of gentile inquiry and becomes a naturalised [sic], though hyphenate, citizen in the gentile republic of learning, [does he come] into his own as a creative leader in the world's intellectual enterprise. Veblen's scholarly heroes have the edge of alienation. They will always be able to question, and even to confront, the culture surrounding them because they have no allegiance to it. Aliens in a strange land, Veblen's intellectuals cultivate the supreme knowledge that even the truths they were weaned on are relative and culture specific. The Jew realizes "the scheme of traditions and conventional verities handed down within the pale of his own people are matters of habit handed down by tradition, that they have only such force as belongs to matters of habit and convention." Veblen fancies that scholarly Jews are the ultimate skeptics. They are, like Veblen, "skeptic[s] by force of circumstances over which [they have] no control." Perhaps this is why they can resist the sin of proselytizing: "the Chosen People have quite characteristi- cally never been addicted to missionary enterprise." Veblen would have us believe that intellectual Jews' total devotion to idle curiosity frees them, as it does him, from the arrogance of impressing upon the heathen an unwelcome final answer.56 Unlike the dreaded neoclassical economists or Christians, the Jews do not coerce. It is clear from his portraits of Schmoller to the Jews that for Veblen, recalcitrance is the precondition for brilliance. It is equally clear that, for all of Veblen's protestations about the goal of "eliminat[ing] all bias of personality from the technique or the results of science or scholar- ship," his discussions of idle curiosity and heroic intellectuals are more</page><page sequence="27">VEBLEN'S RHETORIC OF AUTHORITY 165 committed than detached. Veblen's partiality is especially clear in Higher Learning, the book that should theoretically be most informed by the calming influence of idle curiosity but that, in fact, shows Veblen at his most enraged and engaged. Veblen's claim to Jacques Loeb that the argument of the book was "entirely impersonal" is contradicted on page after page. Sometimes he assumes a relatively high moral ground, as in the comment that those who have "too pronounced an addiction to scientific or scholarly pursuits" are unlikely to be awarded tenure; he also stoops very low to note, for instance, the characteristic physiog- nomy of the academic executive: "A flabby habit of body, hypertrophy of the abdomen, varicose veins, particularly of the facial tissues, a blear eye and a colouration [sic] suggestive of bile and apoplexy." In his most temperamental book, Higher Learning, Veblen presents himself as an outsider to academia although insider knowledge is necessary to understand-much less, to construct-his analysis. As Veblen puts it, his "addiction to the pursuit of knowledge is too ingrained" to let him go with the grain.5 He locks himself out of the ivory tower and throws away the key. The skepticism that permits Veblen's social criticism and forces him to set up shop outside of the institutions of higher learning makes him, he claims, a better scientist. He suggests the explosive possibilities of going against the academic grain in a critique of marginal utility theory, the premises of which "are not to be called in question without questioning the existing law and order." Questioning existing laws is precisely what Veblen wants to do. To his credit, Veblen encouraged his own students to question his premises. Wesley C. Mitchell character- ized taking a class under Veblen as like "employing vivisection without an anaesthetic" and noted that he demanded critical analysis from his students-including criticism of the teacher's methodology. Veblen's pedagogy is consistent with his belief that "by its own nature the [modem scientific] inquiry cannot reach a final term. . . . [T]he outcome of any serious research can only be to make two questions grow where one question grew before."5' Conclusion Confrontational intellectuals today make a scholarly virtue out of declaring their position in relation to the object of study and stating the values that inform their work with a directness that would startle, if not</page><page sequence="28">166 AMERICAN QUARTERLY alarm, Thorstein Veblen. It is doubtful that a scholar today could adopt Veblen's rhetoric of authority and get away with it. The question of accountability is troubling; Veblen's artful dodges are intended to elude responsibility for the harpoons he throws. His stance of detachment facilitates his cultural criticism while making it difficult to criticize Veblen. Nevertheless, his posture is instructive. Affirming idle curiosity while delivering trenchant social criticism may strike others, as it strikes me, as the ideal of intellectual work. Veblen's "scientific" observations are often incisive; many have stood the test of time. Yet idle curiosity leaves plenty of room for the chance discovery, for play, for creativity for whatever makes a scholar a unique individual and not only a methodological machine. Veblen's integrity is heartening, however dismaying it is that his sense of intellectual honor caused him to isolate himself. Because Veblen's authority is more purely a rhetorical construction than that of his peers intellectuals who joined professional associa- tions and whose authority was determined largely by their institutional or personal affiliations several contrasting examples may clarify Veblen's uniqueness. A number of his contemporaries shared his commitment to assailing the status quo, both in and out of academia, and issued comparable criticisms. But none, to my knowledge, adopts a comparable rhetorical strategy. They are straightforward, they do not try to hide their values, they are confident even if after one has read Veblen they seem a bit mild. Rhetorically, William James marks a sharp contrast. Where Veblen is twisted, difficult, and often unpleasant to read, James seems relaxed, clear, and genial. Yet the substance of James's critique of academic philosophy closely parallels Veblen's assault on economic theory. The philosophy professor, says James, teaches of a universe entirely distinct from the one you left behind you in the street.... The world of concrete personal experiences to which the street belongs is multitudinous beyond imagination, tangled, muddy, painful and perplexed. The world to which your philosophy-professor introduces you is simple, clean and noble. The contradictions of real life are absent from it. Its architecture is classic.... It is a kind of marble temple shining on a hill. Like James, Charles Peirce called for the reconstruction of philosophy. Again, one can see the congruity with Veblen's argument in "The Fixation of Belief," where, in the name of the scientific method, Peirce</page><page sequence="29">VEBLEN'S RHETORIC OF AUTHORITY 167 attacks a priori reasoning and reasoning from authority. The substantive agreement with Veblen is even clearer in Peirce's attack on traditional logicians, "slumbering through ages of intellectual activity, listlessly disregarding the enginery of modern thought," who follow a "chimeri- cal scheme.... They simply mirror a philosophy which was exploded a hundred years ago." John Dewey, similarly, makes the Veblenian point that the looseness of terms like "society" and "community" create ambiguity: They have both a eulogistic and a normative sense, and a descriptive sense; a meaning de jure and a meaning de facto .... The conception of society is then made so "ideal" as to be of no use, having no reference to facts. One can imagine Veblen agreeing wholeheartedly with Charles Beard that "written history that was cold, factual, and apparently undisturbed by the passions of the time served best the cause of those who did not want to be disturbed." And, certainly, with Max Weber: If the professional thinker has an immediate obligation at all, it is to keep a cool head in the face of the ideals prevailing at the time, even those which are associated with the throne, and if necessary, "to swim against the stream."59 These social theorists are surely, like Veblen, warriors against "what- ever is." Despite their substantive parallels to Veblen, they betray none of his distinctive rhetorical maneuvers; there is no jockeying to appear detached, no attempt to elude responsibility for judgment, and no satire lurking behind science. They seem confident in their authority as professionals. They do not speak in the Veblen voice, so cool and yet so defiant. As much as he cultivates objectivity and detachment, Veblen's style is certainly a personal one. Veblen is a unique social analyst because he conveys his ideas in an unconventional rhetoric that defies a separation of the ideas from the words as he uses them. Advancing detached, empirical observation and engaged, often satirical interpretation, Veblen's works exist truly, to adopt Wolf Lepenies's phrase for the rise of sociology, "between literature and science." Lepenies's comment on Thomas Mann's irony applies nicely to Veblen's: "engagement is ingeniously combined with detachment." Veblen's works, indeed, bear almost as much resemblance to the productions of contemporary literary figures as to those of social scientists. His rhetoric of authority finds a close parallel in the work of</page><page sequence="30">168 AMERICAN QUARTERLY the literary naturalists who conceived of their tasks as both scientifi- cally analyzing and criticizing society-particularly Theodore Dreiser. In one of his literary manifestos, for instance, Dreiser argues that he is only doing his job by objectively telling the truth, even though (or especially because) facts challenge the normalized versions of reality favored by hypocritical moralists to keep the masses in line.60 Like Veblen, Dreiser's rhetoric of authority is both confrontational and grounded in "factual" observation. The ground Veblen shares with this literary artist attests to the fact that his mind resists confinement, not only to a particular academic discipline but also to such a broad epistemological division as that presumed to exist between literature and science. He was one of the great generalists of his period, which may well account for the lack of consensus about him; his works are so wide ranging as to encourage everyone to see a different Veblen.

Dowd (Ithaca, N.Y., 1958) that there are "at least two Veblens, the economist and the artist" (2). In The Bard of Savagery: Thorstein Veblen and Modern Social Theory (New York, 1978), vii, xi, John P. Diggins complains of the single-mindedness of most Veblen scholarship, "focused on a single aspect of his thought to the neglect of other dimensions," and insists on Veblen as satirist as well as social theorist. The title of Diggins's book derives from another characterization of Veblen' s recalcitrance: "the impersonality of a pure scientist joins forces with the bard of savagery" (Perry Miller, "Introduction" to American Thought: Civil War to World War I [New York, 1954], xlix).

Dente's book is very useful but its humorlessness at times compro- mises its credibility; see, for instance, Dente's response to a Veblenian disclaimer which he takes at face value (20). Two of the most probing studies of Veblen' s rhetoric illustrate the other side of the coin.

In the preface to his translation of the Laxaedala Saga (New York, 1925), xii-xiii, Veblen reveals another aspect of his commitment to downright expressions by complaining of the difficulty he had translating idiomatic speech. 20. It also shows Veblen going beyond an attack on the excesses of the academic establishment to manifest a strain of anti-intellectualism problematic given Veblen's worshipping at the altar of methodology. One need not go to Higher Learning for evidence of Veblen's anti-intellectualism. It informs most of his attacks on the "sterility" of neoclassical economics, which he characterizes as becoming deadened by being cut off from common sense. See, for instance, Veblen, "Why Is Economics Not an Evolutionary Science," POSMC, 69; and Veblen, "Fisher's Capital," 148. 21.

Aaron, in Men of Good Hope, 213, 238, ranks as one of the Veblen scholars to have penetrated the furthest into the mask of objectivity and detachment. Aaron makes a strong case that Veblen's real significance is as "moralist, rhetorician, and satirist." He locates the "deep and abiding moral animus" and notes that many of Veblen's distinctions are</page><page sequence="33">VEBLEN'S RHETORIC OF AUTHORITY 171 more ethical than scientific. Aaron's characterization of Veblen as a "splenetic prophet" is apt. In "The Sacred and the Profane," 76, 101, David Noble takes the idea of a moralistic Veblen even further. Noble's Veblen is a "major Puritan prophet who first had to demonstrate that the seventeenth-century puritans had failed to destroy profane civilization" before he could advance his own work as a "puritan jeremiad," foretelling the damned from the saved.

I, to support Veblen's declaration that "the heroic role of the captain of industry is that of a deliverer from an excess of business management. It is a casting out of business men by the chief of business men." See Business Enterprise, 48-49 and note.

The only serious challenge against this core element of the Veblen legend has come</page><page sequence="34">172 AMERICAN QUARTERLY from Adorno and other Frankfort intellectuals; see, for instance, Adorno, "Veblen's Attack." Dorothy Ross, who in Origins follows the consensus in declaring Veblen "the only true outsider" of the turn-of-the-century "creative social scientists," offers a reasonable explanation: "Veblen . . . was relatively unique among social scientists in adapting from anthropology . . . its stance of the alien observer" (204, 154). 41.

For further discussion of Veblen's ideas on idle curiosity besides what is covered in single-author books devoted to him, see Norman Kaplan, "Idle Curiosity," Thorstein Veblen, ed. Dowd, 39-55; and Alan W. Dyer's "Veblen on Scientific Creativity: The Influence of Charles S. Peirce," Journal of Economic Issues 20 (Mar. 1986): 21-41. Dyer, who sees idle curiosity deriving from Peirce's theory of abductive reasoning, is especially helpful in explaining the creative dimensions of idle curiosity. 42. Myron W.

Veblen, Engineers, 51; Veblen, "Place of Science," 17-19; Veblen, Instinct, 85- 87.

He calls for giving the engineers free rein throughout Engineers; see esp. 83. Although Veblen cites William James and other exponents of Pragmatism and is undoubtedly influenced by them, usually when he refers to "pragmatism" it is in the layperson's sense and does not point to the philosophical school.

He is "asked" to answer the question, "Who do you speak for?" and it is an answer to this question which, in the interests of research, he avoids. Consequently, the observer remains marginal to the society or organization or segments of them which he studies.... Being both a participant and an observer is "the strategy of having one's cake and eating it too."</page><page sequence="35">VEBLEN'S RHETORIC OF AUTHORITY 173 50.
