<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Yoruba Master Drummer M any African music studies have concentrated on musical instruments and musicological analysis, but little attention has been given to music education in Africa, or to musicians themselves. An examination of the ways in which traditional Yoruba musicians are trained might en- hance our understanding of interrelated aspects of this culture, and of the forces that influence both the general music education of the populace and the specialized educa- tion of the professional musician. This paper will focus on the master drummer and the knowledge and skills expected of him.1 Music in traditional Yoruba culture is all-pervasive. With- out it, the people cannot properly create poetry, record history, educate children, celebrate at festivals, praise or abuse, entertain, marry or even die. Some music training ARCADE GALLERY 28 OLD BOND STREET LONDON WIX 3HD 01-493 1879 Mask. Kru, Liberia is provided everyone as a natural consequence of being a member of society. A child growing up in this culture, or- ganized around the extended family with its strong kinship ties, is cared for and influenced by many relatives, not just by his nuclear family. These are his instructors in music and in other aspects of his culture. From the moment of birth, the infant is exposed to strong musical stimuli. Songs are sung in the home to accompany work or to praise or abuse someone. Cradle songs are sung to babies when they are on their mothers' backs; these are accompanied by a simple dance step, providing a physical manifestation of rhythm. A baby attends a festival or a musical event on his mother's back or on the back of another woman; her burden will not prevent the mother from danc- ing and participating in the music. The infant is thereby subjected from the earliest age to vocal and instrumental music in addition to the movement that accompanies it. Small children also make their own instruments and form their own bands to accompany games or to imitate the adults. Smith indicates that this is a typical West African activity, and that it is the beginning of ensemble practice. The games themselves, including instruments and songs, increase the children's awareness of rhythm (Smith 1962: 75-77). As soon as the child is old enough, he is encouraged to sing and imitate simple dance movements. Smith says that most West African children are encouraged to dance as soon as they can walk. By the age of five, they have learned the primary elements of festival dances, and by six they are able to dance with adolescents with accurate rhythm, dance patterns and songs. About the same time, children begin to learn the choral responses to the songs adults inter- sperse in folk tales told in the evening, as well as the hand- clapping rhythms that accompany them. Most of the learning situations mentioned above are in- formal, providing an opportunity for the child to learn by imitating, observing and listening. Their purpose is to help the child understand his own culture and learn to find his place in it. The folk tales contain morals which point out important values of society. Other songs relate tribal, family and individual histories. Religious music tells of the divini- ties, tribal ancestors, and types of prayers and supplications. As the child absorbs the messages of all of these songs, he learns what it means to become a full participant in society. All Yoruba children must learn these songs and dances, even if they do so at different rates. Everyone becomes at least an adequate enough singer and dancer to participate in cultural life. The Western idea of an exceptional talent is relevant only when a child is already in line to become a 48</page><page sequence="2">master musician by virtue of his birth, or in rare instances when a child not in this line is so gifted that his family will send him to study with a master musician. It is noteworthy that in traditional Yoruba society there are no such formal institutions as the "bush schools" mentioned by Smith (1962:78-79) for the teaching of music or any other aspect of the culture. The only resemblance to formal institutional- ized training is that associated with professional musicians. Even in that case, it is certainly far removed from the West- ern concept of school. There are basically two categories of musicians in tradi- tional Yoruba society: amateurs and professionals. The master drummer is one of the few who belong in the latter category. Other so-called master musicians, such as lead singers, dancers and other instrumentalists, have not had, by and large, the same degree of intensive professional train- ing as that required of the master drummer. They may even have other occupations, although their musical training has made them extremely skilled and more accomplished than their amateur counterparts. The master drummer, on the other hand, with the excep- tion of those few who have been unusually influenced by Western lifestyles, is a professional musician in the truest sense. Music for him is a consummate life-long occupation, and his training is an intensive, continuous process which produces in adulthood a musician possessing skills and knowledge of a degree and breadth impossible to over- estimate. The vast majority of master drummers are born into drumming families and have fathers who are master drum- mers. These families are often referred to collectively as the House of Ayan. Ayan is the Yoruba drum deity whose name the members of these families usually incorporate into their own, such as Ayaniji, Ayanwunmi and Ayanwola. The best master drummers by Yoruba standards come from the House of Ayan for the simple reason that only they can receive the continual daily exposure to the rich musical heritage of the drummer's family. The children learn the details of the worship of Ayan, which gives them a sense of belonging to a very special traditional family whose origin is with the deity. An outsider has little chance to acquire such intimacy with the drummer's culture. The profession is restricted to males, and it is assumed that sons of master drummers will also become master drummers unless, upon reaching adulthood, they decide or realize that their inclina- tions and talents are not sufficient to reach the very high degree of competency required. But at least until adulthood, all boys of the House of Ayan receive training to prepare them for this profession. There can be only one person with the title of master drummer within a family, and only when he dies will the most senior son take his place. In actual practice, the sons, upon becoming adults, will substitute for the father and even form ensembles of their juniors. These players will recognize the son as their leader, but will still refer to him as "the son of the master drummer." The system is open to outside talents. An exceptionally gifted child from outside the House of Ayan may be appren- ticed to a master drummer. He will receive the same tech- nical training as a male born into the drumming family, but it would be difficult, if not impossible, for him to absorb all of the cultural, especially religious, knowledge that would be picked up naturally by the son of a master drummer. If the outsider succeeds in attaining this title, his emphasis will be PRIMITIVE AND ANCIENT ART 32 E 57 ST. N.Y. 10022 49</page><page sequence="3">on the technical side, while a master drummer from the House of Ayan will emphasize matters of traditional impor- tance, such as how to please the gods and his elders, and how to communicate more to his listeners than the message his drum speaks. His aim is to touch their hearts and move them, and it is this quality in his art that is judged to be the most important, for his technical skill is assumed to be near perfect. Sowande, stressing the importance of the evocative nature of sound which might be used to achieve the drum- mer's desired results, says: ". .. if he happens to be a Yoruba, he would refer to those terrible vocal forms handed to him by his forefather, such as the Asan, the Ogede, or the Ofo, patterns of Pure Sound . . . through the medium of Sound, he could evoke and handle Psychic Forces of tre- mendous potencies, which his will could then direct as it suited his purposes. He knew this, not as a theory, but as ex- perienced fact" (1967:256). These are some of the things that the drummer of the House of Ayan knows intuitively but which the outsider does not fully grasp. For the first few years of his life, the son of a master drummer is exposed to the same type of cultural experiences, including music, as any other child. The more specific and specialized aspects of his musical training require more direct techniques of instruction, although much of that is still informal, and none of it is as rigidly institutionalized as in the West. For the Yoruba music "student," this type of learning takes place at performances by his father's en- semble. There, even a small child is given a drum and told to play a certain simple part, thereby receiving very direct Museum of Afnrican Art WASHINGTON, D.C.

His father will demonstrate the rhythm he is to drum, and will correct him during the performance if it is not right. The young son of a master drummer will first be given the drum called kannango, the smallest and easiest to play. Thieme states (1969:89) that although the kannango can be found in ensembles today, it is no longer used much for solo drumming, and its primary function is, in fact, as a learning instrument. Because it is a tension drum, the begin- ner can learn the basics of changing pitches, which he will need eventually for the iya'lu drum, and he can also learn something about accompanying the other drummers of the ensemble. It does not require much pressure to change the pitch on the kannango, so a small child can easily handle it. When the child has satisfied his elders that he has learned these techniques, he will then be taught how to use the same drum to play stopped, muted and left-hand strokes, all ele- ments of a more advanced technique. He will then progress to one of the omele drums and then through the others, the gudugudu being the last and hardest to master. The gudu- gudu playing technique requires very difficult wrist action.3 The boy is now learning through active participation. He will be expected to master progressively more and more intricate rhythm patterns as well as more difficult tech- niques. At the same time, he is developing his memory for the monumental task of retaining the vast body of cultural information that is to be communicated through his drum- ming. It is assumed by the community that these children of the House of Ayan will succeed and be talented. No one fails. Even those who later discover that they are not inclined to be master drummers and thus follow other professions are still considered far more skilled musicians than those outside the drumming family, and anyone hearing a name with "Ayan" incorporated into it will know immediately that this person is an excellent drummer. The Yoruba musician's idea of practice reflects his method of training; that is, there is no formalized rehearsal. Much polishing and perfecting of skills is accomplished in actual performances. Boys or even adults may go off by themselves to practice on their instruments, but this is not designated as such, and no time or place is appointed for it. There are so many musical events that there is hardly a chance for these drummers to get out of "practice." They improve constantly within the structure of their everyday lives. The only occasion that may come close to the Western idea of rehearsal is when one of the ensemble members might simply say, "Let us play" when they are all in the compound, and for no particular event. Even then they will say that they are playing to get the feel of the drums, to test them and make sure that they are tuned and sound right. The greatest single motivation for a Yoruba child to do well at his drumming is social: he wants to perform and behave as society expects him. There is a proverb, Wa t'egbe, which means, "You will be equal to your equals." This is a minimum desire, not to be out of place with his peers. For those children sensitive in the understanding of cultural behavior, it is said, Eni t'o ba mowo we a ba'gba jeun, or "He who knows how to wash his hands will eat with the elders." These exceptional children will be allowed some special privileges, such as entrance to an event not normally open to children. The master drummer-to-be is not often motivated by verbal praise and encouragement, for some adults fear this 50</page><page sequence="4">Vol "I E44t oAav*ir- would spoil him. Hence he receives plenty of criticism and ridicule4 from elder master drummers, from uncles who are said to be particularly severe and critical in this respect, and from members of the extended family who are older than the student. They are all entitled to correct and instruct him. The object of this criticism is, on the one hand, to nudge the boy into social and professional conformity, and on the other, to motivate him to reach higher levels of excel- lence in performance without losing his modesty and respect for others. What encouragement and positive reinforcement he does receive is social, dependent on his behaving and playing according to expectation. There is no formal examination process during the boy's music education. Any drummer may test him, simply by listening to him during a performance and correcting him, perhaps asking the misplayed pattern to be played again some time later. A drummer never really finishes his train- ing or graduates in the Western sense. He is always being tested by older drummers, and as he himself grows older, he will continually test his juniors. Thus an unbroken line of constant teaching, learning, practicing and testing is sus- tained in the House of Ayan. A master drummer knows if he is successful, and to what degree, by the general demand for him, by how often he is invited to play, and by the status of those who invite him. The people evaluate him primarily on the correctness of his language and his memorization of names and other details, on how well he makes them dance, and on how his music touches them personally. The actual music is the least im- portant factor in their assessment. The scope of the knowledge stored in a master drummer's head would be staggering to the Western accomplished mu- sician, who is usually expected only to master to near per- fection his own instrument and repertoire. The Yoruba mas- ter drummer is not only a virtuoso on his own lead drum, but he has also mastered the others in his ensemble. He may also know how to play other drums in other ensembles. In addition, he is a composer, the ensemble conductor, a poet, a historian, a repository of religious knowledge, a philoso- pher, the coordinator of dance and song in some music, and a psychologist par excellence. Before attempting to delineate the areas of knowledge which the master drummer is expected to master, it is im- portant to point out that the Yoruba would probably reject any attempt to categorize that knowledge. This is under- standable, since all of its aspects are intricately interwoven and interdependent. As Sowande (1967:256) stresses, the many aspects of Yoruba music which we delight in picking apart and studying are taken for granted by the Yoruba as being merely means to the end. The desired results include the emotional, physical and mental responses of his listeners. With this warning in mind, and for lack of a better alterna- tive to describe the scope and function of the master drum- mer's knowledge, the subsequent discussion deals with two major categories: the master drummer's knowledge of music and of his instruments, and his knowledge of his culture. His musical knowledge encompasses rhythm, melody, harmony and playing techniques. It is enough to say here that there are many types and styles of Yoruba music, each Western Bangwa, Cameroon Royal Guardian Figure Wood, Nails, String Headpiece. 23" high Donald Morris Gallery, Inc. 20082 Livernois * Detroit* (313) 341-8575 51</page><page sequence="5">suited for a particular situation. The master drummer must learn solo music for his drum, the part his drum plays in ensemble music, and the part of each instrument in the ensemble. Since polyphony is an important ingredient of ensemble music, these instruments are often playing their own distinct rhythms and cross rhythms. The master drum- mer is aware of all of them as he plays his own part, so that he may improvise beyond it. This is further complicated, or better, enhanced, by the fact that all of the drums can and may be "talking" as well as playing. The intimate rela- tionship between spoken Yoruba, which is a tonal language, and music is the essence of Yoruba music. Because of this relationship, whereby single drums and combinations of drums can be made to imitate Yoruba intonation, virtually anything spoken can be drummed. All Yoruba music com- municates meaning to the listeners. Every melody, even if not consciously verbalized by the listener, was originally conceived as spoken Yoruba. Small children hear snatches of folk melodies in conversation, especially in spoken prov- erbs which are often made into songs. The master drum- mer, then, is also a master linguist. The master drummer naturally has to have a thorough functional knowledge of his ensemble. Yoruba musicians categorize instruments into groups thought of as families. Each family has a head instrument which is played by the master musician of that group. There are at least ten drum families, the drums of each forming an ensemble, although with many different combinations of drums used to form varied ensembles, the number is probably much higher MAPRIK BASKETRY MASK NEW GUINEA 18 1/2" XODOX PODaIX PRIMITIVE OBJECTS OF ETHNOGRAPHIC SIGNIFICANCE TEN EAST COTA STREET SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA 93101 (805) 962-5526 (Thieme 1969:3). The dundun drum set is interesting to use as an example because it is so versatile, being suitable (hence almost always required) to play almost all tradi- tional music, whether religious or secular. Other ensembles and sets tend to be more specialized and play primarily for a particular religious cult or secular function. The master drummer's drum in the dundun set is called iya-ilu or iya'lu, literally "mother drum." This double mem- brane, hourglass-shaped tension drum is the most versatile in reproducing speech. As it is held under the left arm by a strap over the shoulder, the tension thongs attached to both heads are squeezed and pulled by the left hand to vary the pitch, while the drum head is struck by a curved stick held in the right hand. In this way, spoken Yoruba, includ- ing its glides, can be reproduced on this drum alone. Another important and absolutely necessary drum in the dundun ensemble is the gudugudu, a single membrane, bowl-shaped drum struck with leather straps. Some Yoruba call it the "father drum." Its seniority is indicated in the proverb quoted by Thieme: "A igun ko ni l'ai d'agba; Gudu- gudu ki sojagba dundun." This translates as "Size (or stat- ure) is not a measure of seniority; Gudugudu is the eldest (i.e. of older lineage or senior in rank) of the dundun family." The rest of the dundun drums are sometimes referred to collectively as omele or the "children of the House" (Thieme 1969:24). Compared to the master drummer's versatile iya'lu, the other ensemble drums are limited in speaking because of their construction, and their roles in the ensembles are thus restricted. Yoruba has four tones and two glides (1969:29), but the omele may "speak" only a two-tone sentence, or two drums may share a sentence. For example, in "Royal Ballad for His Highness, the Timi of Ede," played by the palace dundun ensemble, the gudugudu repeats continually the sentences, Bo tan ma tun roko ("When it is all eaten up, I will go back to the farm to get some more") and Baba ma jiyan tan ("Father, do not eat up the pounded yam even though it is possible to go to the farm to get more"). These sentences are played on only two tones. At the same time, isaju omele and ikehin omele, identical small omele tension drums, are each tuned to one of the pitches required for the first sentence above. They then share the sentence in the following way: the isaju omele plays Bo tan and tu and the ikehin omele plays ma and roko in the proper order, rhythm and tones (Bankole 1968, Tape II). In the same composition, the kerikeri, another drum similar to iya'lu dundun but with a string around its waist to fix the pitch, plays the main or strongest beats of the piece on one tone, the lowest in the ensemble. The kannango, a small tension drum having a proportionately much longer waist than the iya'lu dundun, plays a purely rhythmic role and does not talk at all in this ballad. The iya'lu coordinates these drums, plays its own set part and deviates from it in order to improvise. The improvisation is both linguistic and musical. The total effect of this particular royal ballad is one of majesty, and the piece is designed primarily for listen- ing and not for dancing. There is also a royal dance called ele koto which has the same orchestration as the ballad except that the iya'lu dundun plays mainly to direct the royal dancer. The master drummer praises the dancer, dictates his exact steps and creates a beautifully coordinated effort between dancer and drummer. 52</page><page sequence="6">Although drums are made by full- time specialists, master drummers may give certain specifications to the drum- maker. The master drummer and others can put the parts of a drum together once the wood has been carved, although this is rarely done. Among the specifications he may give the drum-maker is the tonal range of his iya'lu. The range and qual- ity of the drum must match as closely as possible those of the master drum- mer's voice. A tenor master drummer will have a tenor iya'lu, and a bass will have an iya'lu with the lowest possible tones (the instrument, in general, has a tenor quality). A drum-maker often chooses a tree from the side of a well- travelled road from which to carve a drum, for such a tree will have heard much conversation, and will therefore make a drum that is especially good at talking (Bankole 1968, Tape I). The master drummer must also learn to repair and tune the drums. The iya'lu dundun has a standard tonal center or resting tone. Being the tone played when the strings are not touched, it must cor- respond to the center of the master drum- mer's vocal range. The drum is put out in the sun every day or two by the master drummer to keep the tonal center at the proper pitch. If neglected, the pitch would slowly lower. The strings also must be watched closely to see that the basic tension is right. These tasks are learned during childhood through obser- vation and constant exposure. The master drummer is the sole care- taker of his drum: he thinks of it as his own and keeps it in his house. This indi- vidual sense of possession may seem strange in a society in which communal ownership is a strong characteristic. Yet it is necessary in the drummer's case be- cause his instrument must reflect his own voice and thoughts and must be played only by him. The drum, in other words, is a unique extension of himself. As indicated earlier, drums are ad- dressed in human terms, with the use of "mother," "father" and "children" des- ignations. One reason may be that even the trees from which the drums are made, especially the iroko, are thought to be- have in human ways and to embody spirits, including that of Ayan (Ojo 1966a: 166). It is believed that they move around freely and talk, and they must not be cut down without first making special libations. The anthropomorphism associated with the drums appears to have some effect on their care and treat- ment. The traditional way of resting drums when they are neither in use nor set in the sun is to hang them in the house. This provides a relatively dry and undis- turbed storing place. Drums must never be dropped, thrown, stepped over, sat on, or used to curse someone. If a drum is ARTS E NOIRE3 U I E NOIRE 0 4 .. .......

Kofi Anyidoho accidentally dropped, it is a serious mat- ter; if done deliberately, it is a grave sin for which atonement must be made. The priests of the cult of Ayan decide the seriousness of the offense and decree what sacrifices need be made by the offender to Ayan. If a drum breaks, it is wrapped in white cloth and buried like a human being in a special ceremony. The gravity of the event will not be eased, nor will the person who broke the drum feel he can rest, until proper sacrificial restitution is made. (This also includes enough money to pay for a new drum.) If the offender refuses to behave cor- rectly, according to tradition, he is dealt with harshly. He might even be killed by Ayan (actually by the priests), not so much because of the broken drum, but because of his refusal to make proper atonement. However, the vengeance dealt out by Ayan is proportionate to the degree of wrong attitude shown by the offender. Other lesser offenses include stepping over or sitting on a drum, or doing anything that would not normally be done to a person. These things are not necessarily tabu but are considered very rude and unacceptable behavior. Master drummers also learn to protect themselves against enemies, particularly possible rival drummers. Specially pre- pared medicine, sometimes in the form of charms,5 is one kind of safeguard. Once protected by this medicine, they may use their drums to talk to their rivals or invoke the power of Ogun, the Yoruba god of iron, and drum out phrases which suggest that they can no longer be harmed by anyone. Ogun is present in the wor- ship of Ayan because of his protective quality. He is thought to give courage and confidence to the master drummer, an idea manifested in the construction of the sacred gudugudu drum. On the out- side bottom of the drum is an iron ring around which strings are strung. (This is only done to the gudugudu of a master drummer from the house of Ayan.) In the center of this iron piece is a sacrificial mark on which libations are made during Ayan worship. The libations may include kola nuts, palm wine and the blood of an animal. Then prayers to Ayan are offered. Music plays an indispensable role in Yoruba religion. Mbiti ( 1970:38) says, "African knowledge of God is expressed in proverbs, short statements, songs, prayers, names, myths, stores and reli- gious ceremonies." In Yoruba culture, all of these forms are musical, usually either sung or drummed. One of the greatest tasks of the master drummer, one which only he will attempt, is learn- ing the music of many cults. The de- tailed, intimate knowledge he must ac- quire in order to play the music of other religious cults exactly as tradition dic- tates usually comes from attending reli- gious events as a child and perhaps play- ing a simple part in the ensemble. Much religious music is sung, either a cappella or accompanied by instru- ments. According to Idowu (1962:1 1 3- 114), there may be incorporated into one religious ceremony the following: ".. invocatory song, a hymn of call to worship, a hymn of adoration, a hymn of prayer committing the worshippers to the care of the divinity, and a parting hymn, all set at intervals within the order of worship . . . Besides these hymns, lighter songs may occur during the ritual . How full or loud the instrumental accompaniment is will depend on the rank or status of the particular divinity concerned. On the occasion of an annual festival, however, the set order of wor- ship demands a full accompaniment of instruments." In addition, religious ceremonies usu- ally include ritual dancing accompanied by instruments. The dancing is extremely ordered and symbolic. Exact timing and placement of foot and hand movements are necessary to the success of the ritual and are therefore religious rather than musical requirements (Idowu 1962: 115). The master drummer functions as director of these timed movements, call- ing out the steps and patterns on his 54</page><page sequence="8">drum. Solo drumming also has a reli- gious function and may occur when a master drummer uses his iya'lu to per- sonally worship at a shrine and commu- nicate with the deity. In this regard, Thieme says (1969:26): "On occasion a solo drummer takes his iya'lu to the shrine and drums a combination of reli- gious praise, poetry and oriki, often with no audience being permitted. The occa- sion may be in the pre-dawn morning on the first day of the normal five-day worship-week for the particular orisa (deity)." Drumming plays a major part in the cult of the king-turned-divinity, Sango. The bata drum ensemble is essential here, although in rare instances if a town does not have a bata ensemble available, a dundun ensemble will play the same music. The dundun master drummer would be equipped and trained to play it, but the bata ensemble is greatly pre- AME EN DELIRE Ne le compare point Oh!

The iya'lu bata, or the lead bata drum, is a double membrane drum shaped like a truncated cone. It is joined in the ensemble by three drums, all of which are similar to the iya'lu bata ex- cept that they are of smaller graduated sizes. The second largest, omele abo iya'lu, is played by an assistant to the master drummer. They talk between the two of them, sharing parts of phrases. The omnele abo and omele ako are both played by one man and do not talk, but supply additional rhythms (Thieme 1969:173, 175). The most important elements in Sango music are, as always, what the drums say and the emotional responses that the music evokes in the participants. In gen- eral, the drums praise Sango and tell stories from his history as both man and divinity. Music ranges from the highly emotional and frenzied to the light and gay to solemn and calm drumming, all depending on which facet of Sango's personality and history the musicians are describing (Thieme 1969: 176-179). Although the Sango music goes on for hours, even days, the festival participants do not tire of it. It may sound monoto- nous to Western ears, but the content of the musical communication sustains in- terest. The Sango festival is just one of the dozens of festivals ranging from very religious to semi-religious in nature, each with different ensembles or sets of drums required, and each with a huge body of historical and religious texts which must be learned by the drummers. Music associated with royal palaces is full of historical references, and it is here that the master drummer can dem- onstrate his expertise as the culture's primary historian. The Oba was tradi- tionally thought to be the link between the people and their ancestors (Ojo 1967:196). Artists and craftsmen, in- cluding musicians, lived and worked within the Oba's palace. Ojo states (1966b:73) that "drummers, trumpeters and flutists were a distinct class of artists who resided for most of the day-time in the Afin" (palace). The drummers in- cluded in this group were all from the House of Ayan. This is still true today, although there are many master drum- mers who do not "live" in the palace. All of them, however, must go to the palace to participate in certain musical events. They go willingly, taking pride in being able to contribute their skills to the enhancement of that occasion. Lesser drummers within an ensemble whose individual roles may be quite simple and monotonous, still go to play with a humble attitude that theirs is an important contribution to the whole.

Although he no longer uses the drums for long distance com- munications, he does send messages from the palace gate to the Oba's chambers inside. In addition, the master drummer uses his great wealth of historical knowl- edge to drum the praise-name (oriki) and detailed history of anyone who visits the Oba, and of course of the Oba himself and all his ancestors. It is interesting to note, however, that before starting these praises, he first praises himself and his own ancestors. The following is one version of the story of Ayan, from whom all drummers of the House of Ayan are said to have descended (Thieme 1969:16-19). It has been translated from a solo iya'lu dun- dun piece drummed by a master drum- mer, and it contains the seeds of the rela- tionship between the drummers and the Oba: "A long time ago, Ayan, a lady musician, lived in Oyo. During one of the court celebrations the Alafin (king) invited all of the important drums in Oyoland to the palace to perform. The bata, bembe, and other drums were brought. Ayan had gone to the spiritual leaders to see how she could win the day at the palace. She was told to slaugh- ter two rams, the hides of which should Herbert Baker, Inc. in Los Angeles by appointment / 213-459-2727 the collections are also represented by Jack Glenn Gallery 2831 East Coast Highway Corona del Mar, California 92625 424 Fashion Valley San Diego, California 92110 AFRICAN ART Genevieve McMillan 96 Winthrop Street Harvard Square Cambridge Massachusetts 02138 (617) UN 4-0629 be used to make a drum which she should put around her shoulders and beat at the palace. It turned out to be a rainy day, and all of the drums that went early to the palace were drenched, and failed to impress the Alafin. Ayan showed up after the rain had stopped. When the Alafin noticed her, he invited her to play her drum. The little drum solo which Ayan beat that day has since been accepted by all drummers as the opening prayer to be played before any drum is sounded for any purpose. The Alafin was very impressed and commanded Ayan to live in his palace, and since that day, suc- ceeding generations of dundun drum- mers have always lived in palaces all over Yorubaland. And since that time, dundun players have been called the 'wife' of the Oba and are not requested to remove their hats in the palaces, which is a very special privilege" (Bankole 1968, Tape II). It is within this context of his relation- ship with the palace that the complex question of the master drummer's status may be understood. On the one hand, he has a very high position among mu- sicians. This is because he is likely to be senior in age and rank to the other drummers in his ensemble, and because he is thus considered the wisest among them. Within the palace he enjoys special privileges. Ojo cites one reason for the privileges given to drummer-historians and other wise men such as priests, heal- ers and artists: "So great and invaluable were the contributions of these learned men that the people claimed that the Oba can never exhibit traits of foolish- ness and ignorance because of the as- sured advice of the wise men within his court" (1967:205-206). On the other hand, the master drum- mer's function as a musical steward or servant to the Oba, and his absolute de- pendence on the king for his livelihood, give him a low status within Yoruba society in general. He is sometimes called alagbe, meaning "beggar," or literally, "one who shouts." If he is refused com- Continued on page 77</page><page sequence="10">Yoruba Master Drummer Continued from page 56 pensation by the Oba, he must drum for anyone who will give him money. The master drummer himself holds the same ambiguous concept of his position. He sees himself set above others by his age, wisdom and skills, and to some extent by his place in the palace, but he also regards himself as having a rather low rank economically and socially. The master drummer must also be a walking encyclopedia of traditional phi- losophy. Philosophy takes many forms in Yoruba culture, including proverbs, wise sayings, riddles and myths. Each of these is full of plays on words and figures of speech. The master drummer, then, must become a supreme linguist to mas- ter philosophy. Even when drumming oriki, he is never content to simply tell the praise-names but he must break them down and relate their origins. He must philosophize and moralize about them and, if they are to be really satisfactory to the listeners, he must give them his own personal flavor. Here he sponta- neously creates poetry. Below is a prov- erb which gives a hint of the subtlety and artfulness of the Yoruba language. For full enjoyment of most proverbs, it is necessary to hear them in Yoruba. The proverb often rhymes and juxtaposes sounds and rhythms for play on words: "lyan mu, ire yo; iyan ro, ire ru." Lit- erally, this means, "Famine is sharp, cricket is fat; famine is relieved, cricket is poor." It also suggests that when there is hunger the cricket appears fat and good to eat, but when there is plenty, no one wants to eat the cricket which now appears too thin to eat (Bowen 1858:65). To Echezona (1963:19) all Ibo poetry has melody and all melody has words. This is equally true of Yoruba poetry, with the addition that it can be sung or drummed. The importance of the corre- lation between speech and melodic line in any Yoruba music form cannot be overemphasized, and is another of the many factors that shape Yoruba drum- ming and singing. One of the non-musical roles which the master drummer must assume is that of psychologist. If he is to become the successful leader of his own drum en- semble, he must be able to manage the people in it, taking into account their personalities and backgrounds and co- ordinating them into a viable, smooth- running group of individuals as well as musicians. He learns this management from observing an older successful mas- ter drummer handle his group. The master drummer must also know how to properly behave in different situ- ations and with different people. Every Yoruba's upbringing prepares him to be- RESTORATION SCULPTURE OUR SPECIALTY we restore for museums collectors and dealers only Introducing custom bases in wood and lucite references on request by appointment (212) 98 2-4636 ROGER R. RICCO RESTORATION have in traditionally dictated ways. For example, no one may quote a proverb (verbally or drummed) in the presence of an elder unless his permission is very humbly asked first. To do so would indi- cate that that person thought he was wiser than the elder. It goes without say- ing in Yoruba culture that the older person, even if by only a year, is the wiser. When a child misbehaves, he is taken to an elder who will awe him with stories of his family's history, thus point- ing out this child's ignorance of such matters and the elder's superior knowl- edge. As an added bonus, the child learns a good deal of history. This situation applies to musicians as well as to every- one else. However, there is relatively more freedom in this regard in drum- ming than in speaking. Everyone in Yoruba society must learn to be exceedingly careful of what he says, how he says it, and to whom. This is as true for drum talk as for the spoken word. If, for instance, a drummer says something imprudent about someone on his drum, a good-natured person might respond at worst with crossness or abu- siveness towards the drummer. If, how- ever, the drummer is not so lucky, he may say the wrong thing to someone prepared in advance by medicine for cursing. Then some disaster could befall him. In Yoruba society songs are sung or drummed more to praise people than to abuse them, but in either case, the language is likely to be stronger than it would be if spoken. Drummers, like co- wives, occasionally engage in hostile ex- changes with their enemies or rival drum- mers. In doing so, they make use of humorous and subtle proverbs which enable them to express what could never be said directly. An example of a hostile proverb which might be used by a senior wife to the junior wife (who behaved as though she did not know her place) or by a drummer to his rival is, Laba laba fara re w'eiye, se'se eiye, or "If a butter- fly begins to think he's a bird, he will soon meet his fate." Other characteristics required of a master drummer are creativity and re- sourcefulness. The master drummer is free to improvise and talk in folk situa- tions, that is, where the dance steps are not of the set ritual type. In fact, most of his creative music is improvisational. His first responsibility is to make the dance go well. This means that he must set the rhythms of the ensemble players cor- rectly and establish a good rapport among the dancers. He must be flexible and sensitive to the emotions and moods of the dancers, changing his tempos when the atmosphere calls for it. For instance, if the dancer is responding well to the rhythm and talking of his drum, or shows the drummer that he is putting every effort into the dance to complement the drumming, the drummer will quicken the tempo and heighten the pitch of excite- ment, giving the dancer a chance to fur- ther show off his talent and skills. If the dancer does not show any particular effort, the master drummer will not bother to put more into his own music. Conversely, if the drummer continues to drum in an ordinary manner, the dancer will have no impetus for improvisation. It is a flexible performance, dependent for its success on the actions and feelings of all the participants. The master drummer's linguistic cre- ativity cannot be separated from his mu- sical ingenuity. He must find the right phrases and must manipulate words clev- erly to make an impression on his lis- teners. Even more than that, as a poet he searches for the combination of words, melody and imagery that will reach the hearts of his listeners. However, it must be pointed out that the master drummer's creative freedom as a composer is limited in three main areas. First, he is limited by the type of drum and the type of ensemble he mas- ters, and secondly, by the requirements of the dance which his music accompa- nies. Thirdly, like everybody else, he is under constant observation and examina- tion by his elders. Merriam (1965:460; 1964:161) right- ly states that music education "would Hand printed cloth and contemporary art from Nigeria. 166 Newbury Street Boston, Massachusetts 02116 (617) 267-5726 77</page><page sequence="11">seem to be of the utmost importance in assessing the means acceptable to the society in shaping the musician as well as throwing light upon educational prac- tices in general in any given society." This examination of the way in which the Yoruba master drummer receives his musical and cultural training under- scored several educational and cultural values such as the emphasis on both con- formity to certain norms as well as ex- perimentation; the need for specializa- tion and a broad cultural background; and the need, on the part of the musician, to combine the rigor required to master the technical aspects of music and the sensitivity and sensibility needed to move his listeners by his music. F 1. The principal source of the material of this paper was Ayo Bankole who was Visiting Professor of Music, School of Music, Ohio University, 1971-72. Judith Bush, then a graduate student in the African Studies Program, studied with him and had several interviews with him relative to the theme of this paper. On the basis of the interviews, Bankole's lectures, four taped talks of his (on Nigerian folk music broadcast by the Nigerian Broadcasting Cor- poration in 1968), and available literature on the subject, Ms. Bush wrote the paper. Sadek Samaan edited the manuscript. 2. These names respectively mean: the god of drum can protect; the child is born to the family because he wants to belong to the god of the drum; the god of drum has been elevated to a high position of authority (Thieme, 1969:29). 3. Undoubtedly techniques used in traditional music education among African peoples bear similarities as well as differences. For details see Jones (1959: 70-71) regarding the Ewe; Nadel (1942:301) regard- ing the Nupe; Tracey (1948:108, 119) regarding the Chopi; Kirby (1934:55) regarding different groups in South Africa; Smith (1962:83) regarding West Africa in general; Anning (1968). 4. Lambo, a leading Nigerian psychiatrist presently Deputy Director of W.H.O., described (1960:98- 101) the positive and negative factors involved in the socialization process of the Nigerian child. On the one hand, there are those forces which provide a deep sense of security, belonging and a minimum sense of frustration; on the other hand there are those cultural forces which stress suppression of individuality and autonomy. Lambo emphasized the formidable role of ridicule as a potent means of social control. See also Breetveld's conversation with Lambo (1972:63). 5. Another form of professional protection of Yoru- ba musicians is belonging to a guild-a traditional institution which has a natural place within a com- munal society. There is a guild for practically every type of professional musician. Guilds are organized locally and at times combine in larger area groups. They formulate policies which protect these musi- cians from "outsiders" (e.g. trained drummers from outside the House of Ayan) who might take advan- tage of them. The names of master drummers are known in the master drummer's guild which has some control over who plays there. Another func- tion of guilds is to settle disputes among musicians.
