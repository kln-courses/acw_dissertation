<plain_text><page sequence="1">VIOLENT immolations: species DISCOURSE, SACRIFICE, AND THE LURE OF TRANSCENDENCE IN d. h. Lawrence's the rainbow Gerald Doherty A thematics of sacrifice that regulates all its modes of relation ship is densely woven into the narrative fabric of The Rainbow—rang ing from quotidian economic transactions to the ethics and protocols governing sexual love and marriage. As a virtual norm of behavior toward oneself and toward others, the centrality of sacrifice remains unquestioned throughout the course of the novel. Yet because of the assumed transparency of sacrifice's meanings and values, criticism of The Rainbow has largely bypassed its subtle complexities: for sacrifice is both an external contract, geared to economic and social advancement, and, more profoundly, an internalized disposition, geared to transcending self-interested behavior and, in the process, to transforming the self. Because, as Slavoj Zizek suggests, sacrifice is constitutive of the status of man as a "being of language," it is foun dational for a cultural unconscious where the compulsion to sacrifice is an ethical norm; the psychoanalytical theory of socialization—"the emergence of the subject from the encounter of a presymbolic life substance of 'enjoyment' and the symbolic order ... far from be ing exceptional, is the story of everyone" (74).1 By bolstering those sacrificial structures that legitimate Homo sapiens' transcendence over the animal-body,2 culture separates the human subject from an MFS Modern Fiction Studies,Volume 57, number I, Spring 2011.

VIOLENT immolations: species DISCOURSE, SACRIFICE, AND THE LURE OF TRANSCENDENCE IN d. h. Lawrence's the rainbow Gerald Doherty</page><page sequence="2">48 Violent Immolations abjected animality. This animality is "the Kantian thing in itself" that must be purged before a subject can assume its proper place in the human community (Zizek 181).3 Sacrifice is not a fixed or monolithic concept, but a complex of Western theories and practices. Initially religious in orientation, it was later secularized in the form of ontological and ethical surrogate norms that were at once divorced from but still entangled in theologi cal roots.4 As such, sacrifice mirrors macrocosmically the evolution of the three generations of the Brangwen family in The Rainbow: the family members shift from a traditional agrarian to a money based economy, from an exclusively Christian to a broadly-based humanist culture, founded on the belief in the freedom, autonomy, and rationality of the individual self.5 With this context in mind, this essay tracks the catastrophic decline of a culture of sacrifice, less through a diminishing commitment to its ideology, which goes largely unchallenged, than through conflicts between this ideology and new processes of individuation, of separation from the original commu nity that undermines belief in divine participation in human affairs. Such processes become especially apparent in the second and third generations of Brangwens. Here the practice of sacrifice becomes fraught with violent friction and discord, for it locks into drives and aspirations (mainly erotic) unrealized in the first. But beyond its com monplace economic connotations that posit short-term renunciations for the sake of longer-term gains, what larger theological and ethical resonances does the concept of sacrifice generate? A traditional Western genealogy posits sacrifice as "a necessary passage through suffering and/or death ... on the way to a supreme moment of transcendent truth" (Keenan 1). The death here referred to is that of the animal-body, the primordial thing that haunts the self as its negative shadow, and that blocks the way to new birth. Pinpointing the basic contradiction that underwrites sacrifice, Georges Bataille articulates this tension as follows: "Insofar as he is spirit, it is man's misfortune to have the body of an animal and thus to be like a thing, but it is the glory of the human body to be the substratum of a spirit" (Theory 40). But, as Dennis Keenan also notes, one specific ideology (Christianity) dominated late-nineteenth and early-twentieth-century theories of sacrifice (10). This is particularly true of The Rainbow, which takes the Christocentric model of sacrifice as its norm—though it makes a radical break from this form as the novel progresses. Through a dialectic of guilt and expiation, the conquest of the animal darkness within is rewarded with the light-gift of revelation. From this ideal izing perspective, the sacrifice of the animal-body, for which Christ's crucifixion is the Western archetype, prefigures the resurrection of the tortured body, which the scheme of redemption transfigures and</page><page sequence="3">Doherty 49 glorifies. Through a dialectical subterfuge, sacrifice disguises itself. Its ritual violence is repressed to facilitate the conjunction of earthly and heavenly realms. In The Rainbow, this idealizing momentum is reserved for the first generation of Brangwens—the Tom/Lydia couple—whose immolation of the dark animal residue triggers their "transfiguration"—the shared luminescence of sanctified bodies that burns "on in their hearts" (91). Sacrifice works by confirming its own theological logic: healing those acute inner conflicts that dogged the earlier phase of their marriage, it refashions their lives on a newly divinized plane of existence. Reserved for the second and third generations, the dark un derside of the dialectic unmasks the lethal violence toward the animal-body that ritual sacrifice entails. Among twentieth-century theorists, Bataille lays bare this finite and mortal moment, its "sacred horror" elided by its endowment with an infinite purpose and goal ("Hegel" 23). Elisabeth Arnould articulates this quite well: Bataille "valorizes its sanguinary horror in order to denounce the dialectic idealization of a death nothing should domesticate" (87). A typically modernist démystification of a once-sacred ritual exposes its nega tivity as a death-event that reveals nothing but the dreadfulness of death itself. Though the term "sanguinary" does not apply to The Rainbow—virtually ail its sacrificial acts are symbolic—it pinpoints a dramatic declination in sacrificial efficacy after the first generation: the abrupt turning away from its power to regenerate and restore toward intimate engagements with destruction and death. Because of the catastrophic failure to appropriate death in a theological re configuration as resurrection, sacrifice displays all the ruthlessness of an immolatory violence, newly released from repression. At the core of Anna and Will's (second generation) and Ursula and Skrebensky's (third generation) sexuality lies a gendered performance—the venge ful annihilation of the (male) animal-body that resists or refuses the (female) drive to transcendence. Scapegoating her husband Will, for example, Anna immolates him symbolically in an auto-da-fé, as she dances his ritual death with her "unseen Lord" as her witness (170). Likewise with Ursula in the third generation: in their two moonlit sex encounters, her frustrated "rage" at Skrebensky's impotence vents itself in his sacrificial death and dismemberment. With her metallic hands and wrists working like "steel blades" (297), she tears his "burden[some]" body apart (296), before finally piercing it with a knife. In both generations, the negative, deathly side of the dialec tic triumphs over the idealizing drive to subsume and transcend it. What makes these scenes doubly strange is that their sacrificial drive to transcendence is rooted in erotic and not religious aspirations. Caught up in the desires its sacred alignments repudiate, sacrifice</page><page sequence="4">50 Violent Immolations enters the secular sphere while keeping its theological structures intact.6 In place of the traditional God, new cosmic divinities (moon, sun, stars) reveal not a superhuman truth but the all-too-human truth about sacrifice itself, its power to generate erotic frisson and excitation. Because, as Bataille claims, the world of death is "at the base of erotism," sacrifice is "in no way contrary to the ultimate uses of pleasure" ("Hegel" 23).7 No longer theologically transcendent (in touch with a god), sacrifice stages its own sadistic drive to subjugate and annihilate the animal-body. For both Lawrence and Bataille, erotic transcendence is a secu lar surrogate for a religious transcendence that no longer opens up uncharted new ways of being. As such, Eros fuels the sacrificial leap of transcendence into what Bataille calls "a realm beyond this world, where the rising light of day transfigures all things" ("Hegel" 21)—the same realm Lawrence more cautiously terms the "beyond" or "un known." Because, for Bataille, the "little death" of the orgasm is at once a loss and a liberation, it recreates a new ontological plenitude, a "new unity of being" between lovers that outstrips the limits of their former existences (Visions 251). Lawrence and Bataille, however, dif fer radically on the gendered dynamics of orgasmic transcendence. While, for Bataille, the female partner's "dissolution" merely paves the way for "fusion where both (partners) are mingled" (Surkis 20) (her loss initiates his climax), for Lawrence, simultaneity of the or gasm is crucial precisely because it adds a double-thrust to the leap into limitless being.8 Its prototype is Tom's lighting with Lydia "in one consummation," the "blazing" climax that burns out the opaque animal residue that blocked communication between them (90). Aligned to a sacrificial intent, the double-jouissance of the orgasm compels a divine intervention—a transfiguration beyond the separate capacity of either partner to induce or elicit. Should, however, the twinned flames of the orgasm fail to ignite (in the discourse of sexuality, metaphors play a constitutive role), the leap itself backfires, and the dialectic swings to the opposite extreme. Turning destructively back on itself, sacrifice exposes its nihilistic underpinnings as the agent of immolation and death. Such is the fate that overtakes the second (Anna and Will) and third (Ursula and Skrebensky) generation lovers whose initial bid for transcendence suffers a terminal defeat. Anna's dread of Will's rampant animality (she refuses to share his bed) is, for example, so extreme that she sacrifices his beastly potency to secure her own humanist identity as a free and autonomous being. Forcing Ursula to revert to a highly charged, adolescent autoerotism, Skrebensky's chronic impotency is the symbolic altar on which she sacrifices her destitute lover. In both instances, sacrifice reveals its "paradoxical mystery" as the "ultimate</page><page sequence="5">Doherty 51 act of cruelty" (Nietzsche, Beyond 63): disclosed in all its nonmean ing, death annihilates the sexual other on whom the aspiration to transcendence was grounded. The question of the animality at the core of the human inevitably foregrounds the identity of species—the rhetoric that negotiates the always-fragile fault line that separates human from nonhuman, para noically patrolling its borders. The historical threat to these borders came from two major sources, each of which fueled the modernist drive to demystify those long-standing cultural practices, such as animal sacrifice, that confirmed human power over nature. In the first, Charles Darwin's interontology inferred that the intellectual and cultural differences between human and animal were merely ones of degree, not of kind. Humans are not transcendental beings with a stake in divinity, but more highly evolved animals, securing mas tery through the sacrifice of other animals. In the second, Freud's alignment of the unconscious with animality—his suggestion that humanity's repression of its own animal instincts "created the hu man unconscious" (Rohman 23)—made the drawing of fixed bounds between them even more problematic. The animal lived on in the human, as its disturbed and disturbing (that is, neurotic) libidinal other.9 In both these contexts, species discourse functions either to buttress human identity by abjecting the animal or by pinpointing unsettling proximities, especially in the sphere of the sexual whose dynamics of arousal and climax link the species so closely together. In both cases, the human unfolds on the otherness of animal-being in the multiplicities and vulnerabilities of its existence. If, as Jacques Derrida puts it, the question of animality repre sents "the limit upon which all the great questions are formed and determined, as well as all the concepts that attempt to delimit what is 'proper to man'" (For What 63),10 then The Rainbow continually de stabilizes these limits, reopening the question of why the safeguarding of human identity requires the repeated sacrifice of the animal-body with all its sadistic resonances. Indeed symbolic violence toward the animal-body, geared to transcending its limits, stigmatizes virtually all of the novel's later erotic encounters. Challenging those other dominant discourses—familial, sexual, aesthetic—the discourse of species negotiates the intimate links between an intensifying violence, and the decline in sacrificial efficacy, now unloosed from its theologi cal moorings that at once constrained and disguised the brutality involved. Gathering rhetorical force as the novel progresses, it un derwrites the disintegrative dynamics that infiltrates erotic relations, shattering earlier Judeo-Christian assumptions about what constitutes self-transcendence. In one final climactic scenario—Ursula's encounter with the horse-group near Willey Water—species discourse takes over</page><page sequence="6">52 Violent Immolations the text, negotiating the power struggle between a feral animal energy that exerts its menacing force and a diminishing human energy that seeks ways to escape it (450-54). It is to the more detailed explora tion of these violent histories that I now turn our attention. In terms of power and authority, a traditional biblical hierarchy ranks man over woman and woman over animal—the same hierarchy, Derrida claims, that "dominates the humanist concept of subjectiv ity" and legitimates "carniferous sacrifice," the noncriminal putting to death of nonhuman beings to secure human social and cultural self-definition ("Eating Well" 114).11 This hierarchy also underwrites the preindustrial, as yet unnamed, Brangwen family lineage, engaged in agricultural activities at Marsh Farm over the centuries, as well as the first named generations who make their first tentative breaks with the traditional past. The gender distinctions between human males and females on the farm represent a fascinating mélange of biblical, humanist, and contemporary (that is, late Victorian) feminist attitudes, which species discourse refines and elucidates. On the lowest rung, animals live purely functional lives. Tamed, domesti cated, subjected to human needs and desires, their alien otherness is reduced to the zero substratum on which biological, cultural, and ontological distinctions are raised. At one level, for example, the Brangwen women accept the traditional authority of the men who secure their own difference from the animals by sacrificing them to provide food. Unlike the men, however, the women recognize the need for transcendence precisely because their husbands' closeness to animality poses a continual threat to their fragile cultural identity. At once expansive and repressive, culture opens up windows onto the unknown at the cost of repudiating the animal-body. Split off from those more primitive animal types the Marsh Farm husbands embody, men like the vicar and Lord William seem like a new species, who, dedicating their lives to abstract ideals (ecclesiastical, imperial) transform sacrifice itself into a heroic adventure—the "command of the further fields" (Lawrence, Rainbow 13) that disguises the murderous colonial violence involved. In this sacrificial idealization, distance screens out all but those glamorous feats, the "knowledge of far-off countries" that inspires the Brangwen women's dream of transcendence (13). The incidence of animal sacrifice on Marsh Farm is first recorded (it has no mention in the opening section) at the point where an individual name (Frank) is attached to a butcher, and a diminutive narrative grows out of his naming. Instead of taking the civilized path—going to school—Frank is instinctively drawn to the "trickle of dark blood" that flows from the "slaughter-house to the crew yard" (16). Latching on to its own negative pole, species discourse</page><page sequence="7">Doherty 53 foregrounds the sadistic horror of sacrifice that will haunt the rest of the novel, passing swiftly over the more legitimate consumer needs it fulfils for the neighborhood. Bound up with an essential secrecy, the slaughterhouse is hidden at the back of the farm; it represents the shame locus of unspeakable acts the novel neither records nor discusses. In a literal anticipation of the later interiorization of the hidden brute in the human, it presages those symbolic reenactments of sacrifice needed to secure human ascendency over the animal other. Put differently, this purely economic version of sacrifice, whose reward is the meat it supplies, prefigures man's theological suprem acy over animal-being, already sanctioned in Genesis. In an act of linguistic sublation, the disavowal of the living creature is achieved by its reinscription as "meat," at once objectifying and distancing it from its animal source.12 In a sharply gendered discrimination, three generations of Brangwen women with increasing ferocity seek to eradicate the brute animal-body in their male counterparts. Through a progressively disruptive discourse of species, sacrifice assumes its primordial role as a foundational act, negating the animal other, whether through the violence of ritual slaughter or through those more symbolic and spiritualized immolations that fuel the human desire for transcendence. Already the secret pathology of sacrifice is foreshadowed in Frank's subsequent fate: as "animalized human" (16),13 his growing "callousness" and his wild drinking bouts ensure his extradition from the text as a character unworthy of further con sideration (19). In The Rainbow, however, it is not the dynamics of quotidian farm life, but of human sexuality, that generates the crucial spe cies dilemma. This dynamic is based on the need to integrate the nonhuman other (the core of man's evolutionary inheritance) into a religious consciousness that seeks to repress and sublimate it. Because sexuality has its roots in a finite embodiment, shared with the animals, it represents a highly sensitized, conflictual site, poised between an animal instinct, vital to erotic excitation, and the drive for transcendence over mere animal lust. Subsumed under a more generalized rubric of the opaque animal darkness that, in the Tom/ Lydia relationship (first generation) disfigures Tom's interior life, the symbolic beast only once becomes species specific (as I will address below), and the drive for transcendence finally triumphs. Manifesting only its transformative, idealizing dimension, sacrifice sacrifices itself in a manner that sets it off from those bitterly contentious dramas that mark the second and third generations. Initially, a subtle blend of class, gender, and species discourses complicates the Tom/Lydia relationship, foreshadowing the final theo logical discourse that subsumes and resolves all of its differences.</page><page sequence="8">54 Violent Immolations A certain gentrified reticence, a self-conscious courtly restraint, distinguishes Lydia's sexuality, marking her difference from Tom's inarticulate and often chaotic responses. As one aspect of her Polish landowning background, a rigid speciesism identifies peasants with cattle, a confusion that makes Tom's visceral reflexes all the more difficult for her to comprehend, while it paradoxically constitutes her main attraction for him since she aristocratically transcends the humiliating species conflict he struggles to overcome. Indeed, on the eve of their "transfiguration," Lydia deploys species discourse cruelly to expose Tom's inhumanity—the lack of recognition of otherness that stigmatizes his sexual approach: you "come to me like your cattle, quickly, to forget me again" (89). Here, a species discourse that was previously latent emerges with a shattering force. Like "the Kantian thing in itself," Tom's beastly nature is the sign of his limita tion, his possession of an animal substratum that blinds him to her needs and desires. Precisely because the beastly escapes symbolic articulation—it configures the amorphous space that language can neither completely repress nor contain—it must be sacrificed to al low the transfiguring light of the big Other to shine through. What Tom most urgently needs, she implies, is the orgasmic burnout of the dark beast within, which only a more participatory and nuanced "coming together" ensures. Tom's new conception of "consumma tion" clearly has its roots in his fervent desire for transcendence, his aspiration to a "beyond" that Lydia already embodies: if "he could be destroyed, burnt away till he lit with her in one consummation, that were supreme" (90). As I already noted, the shared orgasm alone triggers the breakthrough into those unbounded states of existence, previously closed to the lovers. A theological logic rewards such a consummate sacrifice with a step up the ontological ladder—precisely the kind of promotion Tom and Lydia achieve. Endowed with an angelic intelligence that infuses their bodily forms, they break through the veils of the flesh that bind them to animal-being. If, as Lorraine Daston explains, such "intelligence" is primarily intuitive, "knowing all the conse quences of a premise immediately, in a flash of instantaneous and comprehensive cognition" (44), then Tom and Lydia's disembodied circuit of communication is of exactly this kind. No longer needing a material language to mediate senses that are already transparent, Tom telepathically realizes her meaning "without understanding" it (91). Such vital interlockings of the sex-sacrifice-species transcend ence triad mark the essential difference between this couple and the next two generations, where a modernist culture of immanence that identifies the unconscious with animal instinct unlocks the sadistic component of sacrifice that its (failed) theological idealizations can no longer contain.</page><page sequence="9">Doherty 55 In the second generation (Will and Anna), each term of the triad evolves in obedience to the pressures of new forms of secularization: the discourse of sacrificial transcendence bends and gives way to an emergent discourse of species that disrupts and, at least partly, dis empowers it. Challenging those theological alignments that governed the first generation's sexuality, new teleologies deflect them toward more immanent and immediate goals. Instead of generating idealizing systems that sublate the death event, sacrifice locks into its animal essence, the sadistic violence inherent in the immolatory ritual itself. Freed from theological appropriation, sexuality in turn becomes more openly erotic, embedded (in the second generation) in an aesthetic transcendence that substitutes for a divinely mediated one. Emerg ing as a powerful counterdiscourse, aesthetics challenges the grosser immanence of the discourse of animality—its fleshly intensities—with its own more subtle and civilized sublimations. The arrival of Will on the scene to court Anna shifts the discourse of species from its role of symbolizing the undifferentiated darkness within to a highly differentiated tropology that, for the first time, names specific animals to denote human gestures and facial expres sions. Embodying that intense insouciance Lawrence attributes to feral existence, Will is inhuman, instinctive, detached (like a cat [107] or an eagle [109]), a "mysterious animal" that lives vividly in "the darkness" (100). Clearly the transcendence of such an entrenched animality will be at once more conflict ridden and more sacrificially emasculating than in the first generation. From the start, the new discourse of aesthetics asserts its rhetorical power to regulate and contain animality through the practice of art that, as a theological surrogate, opens on to the unbounded, the infinite. In so far as a traditional aesthetics excludes animals from corporeal perfection—the ideal of beauty, as Kant declares, is "only to be sought in the human figure" (68)14—it proclaims its absolute superiority over the animals, elevating Homo sapiens above those inhuman drives that interfere with the practice of art. Sublimating the instinctual, art "erects a barrier between species," foregrounding the "object of desire" (the human perspective) rather than the "desire itself" (the animal per spective) (Wolfe 176).15Through his aesthetic idealism—his passion for wood carving and church architecture—Will attempts to secure his already fragile membership in that exclusive fraternity. As symbolic artifacts, both his phoenix carvings and his Creation of Eve take on significance from the sacrificial transcendence of the animal-body each artwork depicts. Corporeal rupture, rebirth, and renewal—the sacrificial structural paradigm—are the key motifs both of them share. In the first, the phoenix immolates itself in the flames before it rises again "on symmetrical wings" (108); in the second, from Adam's</page><page sequence="10">56 Violent Immolations ruptured side, Eve issues "like a flame ... in the throes and torture and ecstasy of her creation" (112-13). Through his practice of carv ing, Will sacrifices the turbulent animal within to the more refined truths and aspirations of art. As the index of a perfectly realized transcendence, never again repeated, the ecstatic honeymoon idyll achieves the near impos sible: the depiction of the raptures of erotic love without a single reference to the erotic body. Screening a massive ontological split, the suppression of species discourse marks the strategic exclusion of instinctual being, which must await its return until the idyll is over. Subsumed into a metaphysical "stillness ... inexhaustible, unchang ing, unexhausted," that anaesthetizes the senses, the lovers inhabit a discarnate, etherealized zone, "complete and beyond the touch of time or change" (135). In a dense metaphorical mix, Platonic and biblical discourses suspend biological being, which reincarnates only when noises from without draw the sensory world back into focus. One small detail, usually bypassed by critics, pinpoints the sacrificial foundation on which the transcendental extravaganza is raised: the symbolic immolation of a single bodily organ (the heart) by the flames of erotic love is a synecdoche for the total erotic body, consumed by the heat of desire: "their hearts had burned and were tempered by the inner reality" (135). Confirming the abyss that splits metaphysi cal rapture from the sense fields that ground it, the species divide is at its most extreme and the bond between human and animal sexuality radically fractured. Like "the Lord in two burning bushes that were not consumed," as the text ominously puts it, the lovers "should live kindled to one another" (140; emphasis added), as Tom and Lydia did—a transcendental aspiration that the violence of their first quarrel quickly dispels. Reasserting its rhetorical power, the discourse of animality subtends those rapid mood oscillations that conclude with Anna's symbolic emasculation of the brute beast that daily confronts her. From this point onward, species discourse assumes a progres sively dominating role, mediating those visceral, power-driven con flicts that tear the marriage apart. Within days of the honeymoon's end, the symbolic beast rears its head, at once as an insurgent counterforce to the metaphysical idyll that aspired to repress it, and as future victim of Anna's sacrificial regime geared to its final destruc tion. Already living "in a black violent underworld," Will is a "dark, inhuman thing caring nothing for humanity" (148). In this context, "thing" signifies less the pathological Kantian "thing in itself" that resists symbolization than the abject Bataillean object—the animal that loses its status as man's "fellow creature" and whose presence in himself he regards as a "defect" (Theory 39). Imposing a sharp</page><page sequence="11">Doherty 57 species logic on the emotional violence that often seems to lack any logical progress, each fracturing crisis between the couple coincides with Will's descent down the ontological ladder: the closer his identity with the nonhuman other, the more menacingly Anna perceives his "defect." Buttressing her own rationality, her compulsion to sacrifice him serves to sever the link with her own animality. In an increas ingly secular turn, her Cartesian belief in a disembodied intelligence, in the "omnipotence of the human mind" (161) (I think, therefore I am not an animal), fuels her fierce interrogations of Will's human status vis-à-vis the animality that incessantly threatens to overpower it. His dangerous transgression of species bounds (his essential "lack of stability" [155]) strengthens her Enlightenment conviction that it is "knowledge" that frees man from the animal-body, and that makes him "immortal" (161). Indeed, as their quarrel about the lamb figure in the local church window suggests (for Will, it is both a real lamb, and "the symbol of Christ" [150]), his easy species slippage between animal and human underwrites his rhetorical slippage be tween literal and figurative. Within the rhetorical domain, the animal figure is already a metaphor that through its transferential powers crosses those borders between unconscious and conscious, instinct and reason, flesh and spirit that Anna struggles to keep separate.16 Desiring to have it both ways, Will exploits both a referential logic (a lamb is a lamb) and a symbolic logic, which releases fresh sacrificial and Christ-like identifications with the term "lamb." At precisely the point where the discourse of animality overrides the cultural claims of the aesthetic, Will destroys the Creation of Eve carving, as if the procreative animal within made the human construction of artworks redundant (162). With Anna's naked dance, alone in her bedroom, species dis course emerges at its most explicit and challenging. In essence, the dance is less a fertility ritual (Anna is pregnant) than a subversive repudiation of embodied (read "sexual") existence, as its rhetoric of spiritual uplift confirms ("her soul rose in bliss," "exalt[ation]" [170], knowing "no man" [171]). Her ecstatic sacrifice of Will's body to her "Lord" secures her safe distance from the prowling beast whose species confusion confounds her settled humanist sense of identity. Watching from the doorway, Will telepathically intuits the raw vio lence of Anna's sacrificial intent: he realizes he is "at the stake. . . . burned alive ... the power of her in her dancing consumed him.... He waited obliterated" (171). As the immolatory scene catches fire, Anna, for the first time, perceives Will as species specific, as a ram pant "tiger" or "leopard" who "pulls her down" (171) and "devour[s] her at leisure" (172). From Anna's perspective, Will flouts the "car nophallogocentric" law (Derrida, "Eating Well" 11) that decrees that,</page><page sequence="12">58 Violent Immolations while humans may eat animals with impunity, they may not eat one another. In the end, the same species discourse that fuelled their marital conflicts now serves to resolve them. As the "lion lay down with the lamb in him" (Lawrence, Rainbow 177), Will sacrifices his own animality so that the lamb may continue to live. With Will's final domestication, species discourse gives way to a newly-emergent aesthetic, to a fresh drive to transcendence, no longer through art work, however, but through an architecture that seems to embody the secrets of the romantic sublime. As the site of symbolic sacrifice, performed on a daily basis, Lincoln Cathedral configures the missing link between nature and culture. The grand aesthetic artifact that transforms Will's sexuality incessantly risks regression to animality into a flexible instrument of transcendental surpassing. His "swooning consummation^]" (187) and "timeless ecstasfies]" (188) at once sacrifice and subsume the now-dormant beast in himself. Though Will's consummations take place in a cathedral, they are neither God-infused nor God-centered; rather the cathedral is the secular site of the Kantian sublime—the space of "the infinite, the absolute, the unbounded" that opens up vistas beyond the confines of the animal body (Carroll 143).17 The "far-off clinching and mating of arches" (Lawrence, Rainbow 188) are aesthetic surrogates for those more intimate matings of bodies that resuscitate the always-menacing inheritance from the animal past. Essentially autoerotic, Will's metaphysical orgasms are substitutes for the physical ones he and Anna should be having together. Since in Lawrence's erotic ontology, as I noted above, mutual orgasms alone carry the seal of transcendence, Will's singular sublimations are already doomed to dissolve. The tumultuous excess of the rhetoric, the profound instability of its mediations between architectural form and autoerotic frenzy, portend its ultimate disintegration. Will's subsequent disillusionment with the cathedral (its "doorway was no doorway" into the unknown [191]) signals its failure to resolve an impossible tension between the subhuman thing in himself and the superhuman transcendence the aesthetic object holds out. His terminal failure, as the text puts it, is "to become really articulate" (191)—to find artistic coordinates for that alien life substance in himself that resists symbolic assimila tion and, as such, is not subject to sacrifice: "some folded centres of darkness . . . would never develop and unfold whilst he was alive in the body" (195). Yet, to the end, the aesthetic still magnetizes the dream of tran scendence, as Will's final attempt to mediate between them reveals. Embodying the clash between two antagonist discourses (animality and the aesthetic), Will and Anna discover the unmediated pleasures</page><page sequence="13">Doherty 59 of the flesh without the sacrificial compulsion to curb or negate them. As the passive but receptive focus of his unimpeded desires, she overthrows those classic humanist constraints that previously regulated her marriage—"love, intimacy, responsibility" (218)—releas ing those biocentric animal energies rooted in the carnal substance itself. The sole beastly trope—he "wished he were a cat, to lick her with a rough, grating, lascivious tongue"—substantializes the flesh as a resistant, lubricious thing that needs no immolatory flames to etherealize or sublate it. Yet such forefronting of the discourse of animality crucially ignores the overarching aesthetic economy that reveals the libidinal quest to be just as culturally mediated as the cathedral ecstatics, though the sacred sites are no longer gothic arches, but the "Absolute Beauty" of Anna's body laid out on the bed. Privileging the specular over the tactile (the aesthetic hierarchy), her body is a fantasized tableau vivant, prepackaged, as it were, for visual consumption: '"To night I shall know the little hollow under her ankle, where the blue vein crosses'" (219). Keeping passion at a safe distance, the fetish istic dimension ("Absolute Beauty" was always "like a fetish to him" [220]) curbs the lust-driven animal flow of desire that precipitates climax without block or arrest.18 Self-controlled, visually lucid, and profoundly anti-orgasmic, Will's lovemaking is a perpetual foreplay: its "finality without end" (Carroll 139) is also the Kantian signifier of a beauty that feeds on the always-deferred dream of completion and closure.19 Because his fantasy of the "perfect place" is itself an illu sion ("it was not there"), in the Lacanian manner, it needs a continual substitution to supplement the lack it conceals. Thus the "passion of death" to which the text refers (220) is not the "little death" of the orgasm that triggers cathartic transcendence, but the "big death" of sheer immanence, of being trapped in a sexual cul-de-sac from which no transcendental exit is possible. As the climactic site of arousal, the anus, whose surpassing for Freud marked Homo erectus's separa tion from his animal past ("Civilization" 296), now configures an end that is merely a fantasized substitute for the end. Here the aesthetic transformation of its object is at its most ambiguous: through a meta phorical strategem, a newly vivid and fresh florescence disguises the process of organic decay and dissolution. Troped as a delicate flower—"a bud that blossomed into beauty"—the anus marks the site where aesthetic perception overcomes "shame" (220), not through accepting the organ's natural function, as animals do, but through cosmeticizing and glamorizing its image. Through this strategic denial of animal instinct, the erotic body suffers its final defeat. Securing Will's specific human identity, it sets him free to engage in public life, where universal, and not personal, truth heals the split in his</page><page sequence="14">60 Violent Immolations species-crossed self: "He wanted to be unanimous with the whole of purposive mankind" (221).20 With the emergence of the third generation of Brangwens, species discourse becomes more highly charged, disruptive, and interventional. Dismantling humanist self-definitions, identifying hu man with animal perception, it culminates in the wild horses vignette where powerful animal presences take over the narrative. In a further loosening of theological structures, a sadistic sacrificial substratum feeds into thwarted erotic impulses, unleashing an unbridled violence. Generating a new metaphorical rhetoric, the presence of the animal within discourse—its subversive unconscious—creates phantasmago ric lovemaking scenarios where the main protagonist, Ursula, lives out fantasies of a sacrificial destruction her cultural consciousness abhors. Unfettered by sacred proscription, free from moral constraint, the unconscious asserts its autonomy, its repressed sadism exposed in the extreme punishment Ursula inflicts on the animal-body. Before her encounters with Skrebensky, an aggressive discourse of animality undermines Ursula's drive for transcendence, compromis ing her aspirations to a spiritual intercourse with the divine. What the text calls her "dual life" (257) as an adolescent oscillates between a rarified otherworldliness and a licentious animal "lust" (247) that is its anarchic substratum: between highflown religious and secular fantasies (Jesus, Lancelot) and her "free, unabateable animal" nature (251).21 In a dense collocation of Lawrentian terms for autoerotic arousal, the body of the transfigured Jesus (her "perfect lover" [630]) is already ensnared in the web of the carnal, in that "solipsistic jouis sance" (Bersani 4) that "pander[s] to her own soft sensation," as she maddeningly "re-act[s] upon herself" (267).22 Such rupturing of a sacrificial economy—where, in the Lawrentian schema, only mutuality of response is efficacious—prefigures Ursula's ruptured love engage ments with Skrebensky, which have death (without transcendence) as their teleological goal. For the soldier Skrebensky, who shares the same Polish family background as Ursula's grandmother, Lydia, sacrifice is an uncom plicated ideology of action largely divorced from the sexual, through which he voluntarily offers his life to further imperial aims. His in vestment in a politics of immediacy already blinds him to a sacrificial ideology based on self-transformation, that forefronts the erotic as a mode of transcending the human. Twice applied to Skrebensky, the term "fixity" connotes the pure immanence of his sexuality, its commitment to the here and now of his struggle to survive Ursula's transcendental drive to destroy him (277, 281). As a prelude to their first moonlit encounter at Fred Brangwen's wedding, Ursula symbolically sacrifices the mythical "beast" that blocks her vision of a phantasmagoric light world beyond.</page><page sequence="15">Doherty 61 Immediately before the moon rises on the dancers, Ursula hurls herself like a "hound" on the "great beast" of the darkness with the intent to annihilate it (295). Such destruction of the obscure animal body is the overture to a dialectical drama that posits death as the passageway to a revelation of light. Reaching for "the flashing stars," she already anticipates that "leap from the known into the unknown" (295)—the birth of Eros that a sacrificial killing precipitates. From this point onwards, the discourse of species shifts ground from the destruction of the mythical beast to that of the human scapegoat, the dark animal-other embodied in the figure of Skrebensky himself. Bataille's Theory of Religion links the violence involved in the sacrificial "festival" to the transcendence of the animal "thing" that is its teleological purpose and goal (43). Unlike Bataille's narrative, however, which has an analytical structure, Lawrence's narrative exploits the modernist identification of animality with unconscious disruption.23 Trading in near-psychotic disjunctions, it slips between a human and nonhuman rhetoric, staging the sexual as sacrificial death and dismemberment. Engaging the animal energies embedded within its own language, a violently destabilized narrative conjoins ruthless sex with transcendence, enacting the catastrophic failure of both. A hallucinatory theater of sacrifice highlights the lethal struggle for dominance that compels both protagonists. As the first act in the sequence, Bataille proposes that "Sacrifice essentially turns its back on real relations": by separating himself from the "world of things", the sacrificer penetrates to the "sovereign world of the gods and myths" (Theory 44). This offers the clue to the sudden rupture, the mysterious break that propels Ursula out of the commonplace world of the dancers into a spectral myth making that splits her off both from Skrebensky and from her self-identity as a cultured and rational being. With the mise-en-scène of a sacrificial ritual already in place, a newly-risen moon—the paranoid surrogate for a benevolent god who rewards sacrifice with a truth revelation—looks "right into her," keeping an "overwhelming watch" on the unfolding of the destructive love drama. Unleashing her untamed, no longer repressed animal nature, and in an act of erotic abandonment, Ursula "offer[s] herself" to the lunar goddess, her "body opened wide like a quivering anemone" (296). Reviving the same solipsistic autoerotism that marked her fantasized engagements with the "Lord Jesus," she aspires to a transcendental "moon-consummation" (296), a sacrificial substitute for the one Skrebensky is unable to offer. Put differently, she sentences him to the type of "killing" that reveals the "deep meaning" of the death drama itself (Bataille, Theory 49). The great "wood-conflagration" (53) that brings the sacrificial ritual to its "festival" climax at once consumes the victim's body, and precipitates "a spectacular letting loose,"—a lethal desire for destruc</page><page sequence="16">62 Violent Immolations tion that overwhelms the participants (54). Uncannily close to the Bataillean one, the Lawrentian "great moon-conflagration" that burns with "whitish steely fires" stages the portentous auto-da-fé that signals Skrebensky's death warrant ("His heart grew smaller ... He knew he would die" [298]). Like "metal blades of destruction" (297), Ursula's "hands and wrists" are the sacrificial instruments of her violent urge to reduce him, "to tear him and make him into nothing" (98).24 With Skrebensky's symbolic annihilation as "victim," Ursula's return to "daytime consciousness" shows the quest for transcendence through the death of the other to be a nightmarish hallucination (299). In the Bataillean dialectic, such a return generates a "counter vailing prudence," the awakening "in anguish," that follows the reck less abandonment of the constraints of reason and culture (Theory 54). It parallels Will's earlier disillusionment on his discovery that the great cathedral was not an "absolute, containing all heaven and earth," but merely "a shapely heap of dead matter" (190). The "blis tering, transcendent night" from which Ursula awakens is revealed as a "nothingness" (299), as the collapse of those sacrificial idealizat ions, which for Nietzsche exposes the previously concealed truth of sacrifice as a "hatred of the human, and even more of the animal" (Genealogy 136). Though Ursula never reneges on her adolescent dream of transcendence, this recognition underwrites her subsequent need to shatter her humanist self by incorporating the nonhuman other that lies at its core. The first seismic shifts in Ursula's belief in a theocentric hierarchy that legitimates sacrifice coincides with the progressively disruptive discourse of animality that subtends virtually all her subsequent major encounters with herself and with others. The presence of the animal within compels her quest for those vital energies that ground the newly-emergent self in its making. At church next morning, for example, her rejection of the Genesis proclamation of human as cendency over "every beast in the field" (9.2)—the originary dictate that severs man from his animal roots—opens up a new freedom to engage her natural desires ("She felt she had now all licence" [302]). Much of the erotic drama that follows turns on the secret force of this recognition: no longer repressed or repudiated, the animal-body is the root of the orgasmic burnout that fuels those exorbitant visions of another existence.25 Though its sacred associations are muted, the sacrificial death/resurrection dialectic still haunts the scene of erotic transcendence. An intensifying discourse of species underwrites Ursula's inten sifying questioning of the limitations of her own subjectivity ("she did not know what she was" [405])—of that mobile fault line that separates human from nonhuman and determines what is proper to</page><page sequence="17">Doherty 63 both. To clarify her new skepticism (she is in her last year at college), a graphic textual image insinuates those nonhuman presences her previous self-knowledge excluded, those "monsters" that constitute the missing link between nature and culture, and that her pre Darwinian subjectivity blocked out of consciousness (Zizek 137). As the constitutive metaphor for her Enlightenment knowledge, based on "lucidity, illumination, and reason" (Lippit 76), Ursula's earlier self-definition—"a circle lighted by a lamp" (405)—now opens onto a menacing hinterland, an outer "darkness" haunted by the "grey shadow-shapes of wild beasts ... flashing at the door to come in."26 At the extreme limit of her conscious awareness, the "bristling" fig ures of "hyena" and "wolf" point up the nature of humanity's most intransigent and perplexing desires (406), of whose existence she was previously unaware. Posing a new vital problem, they question the nature of the nonhuman other that inhabits the human: is it flexible, adaptive, open to change and development, or is it fixed, locked into immanence as the Western philosophical tradition from Aristotle, through Descartes, on to Lacan and Levinas maintains?27 With Skrebensky's return from South Africa, these questions come to a head. "Fixity" is the key definitional term forthat circumscribed erotic domain into which Skrebensky seduces Ursula, which they inhabit together without self-difference in the manner animals are supposed to do. Now aligned to racial and imperial discourses with which it com petes, the discourse of animality negotiates the critical distinction the novel draws between human and nonhuman: between participation in an animal vitality without which human sexuality loses its vibrancy, or the regression to an animal immanence—the choice Skrebensky imposes on Ursula. In a manner typical of early-twentieth-century literature, Skrebensky's Africa is the discursive site of the primitive other, of an untamed animality, as yet to undergo the Enlightenment purging of its primordial residue.28 Unlike the English darkness, which is "soft and natural," African darkness reverberates with olfactory menace, the "smell of blood" that evokes cannibalistic rites that transgress the cultural law that dictates animals alone should be subject to sacrifice (413). Already on their first meeting, Skrebensky's horseman-like "animal desire" is aligned to a "dark, heavy fixity" for which Africa is the symbol (410), one that lacks those fine sensory and intellectual discriminations the West cultivates. In all of this, the discourse of animality colludes with the negative pole of its own dial ectic, which identifies animal instinct with a conditioned determinacy that precludes adaptation, transformation, or change. In species terms, Ursula and Skrebensky are clones of each oth er. Fused together in darkness, they inhabit identical inner domains,</page><page sequence="18">64 Violent Immolations the "eternal changeless place into which they had leapt together" (418). Here the animal is no longer a flexible, adaptable, biological force, but an interiorized image of fixity. In this context, Lacan's rel egation of the animal to the Imaginary—the purely specular sphere of the image, as opposed to the Symbolic, which language marks out as exclusively human29—helps clarify the intricate distinctions the narrative draws. In their animal-becoming, Ursula and Skrebensky not only become specular images of one another, they also perceive others as the kind of languageless animals they take each other to be.30 From their limited inner perspective, culture itself appears as a meretricious "civil pretence," cultivated by humans whose repudia tion of their own animality generates their social charades. Beneath the human mask, as Ursula perceives her professor, lies "a lurking, blood-sniffing creature with eyes peering out of the jungle darkness" (415), precisely the image his fabricated public persona represses. In Lawrence's evolutionary ontology, however, such a false type of becoming-animal (we shall shortly come to the true type) marks an atavistic regression, a fixation on a past phase of development already transcended, but which Homo sapiens must incorporate as part of himself in order to become fully human. What Lacan calls the "fascination of the sacrifice" (275)—the urgent need to confirm the big Other in the object of human desires—underwrites Ursula's compulsion to escape the claustrophobic, non-sacrificial space of enclosure that stifles her drive for transcendence. The interim before their final moonlit encounter finds the lov ers locked within urban confinements, the corralled-off spaces of their intimate love life in central London, Paris, and Rouen where, for the first time, Ursula is possessed by the "sense of the death" from which she desires to break free (Lawrence, Rainbow 423). A subtle species discourse subtends the fine discriminations the nar rative draws: between the undifferentiated, autotelic sexual plenum the lovers share with the animal world and an erotic transcendence that unveils those superhuman states of existence to which Ursula aspires. Through the same frenzied autoerotics that drove her earlier quest for release, Ursula now embraces the open stellar spaces (she runs naked at night on the South Downs), reaching up to the stars, which penetrate the "unfathomable darkness of her womb." Sacrificing Skrebensky's corporeal presence ("It was not him"), she takes off on a transcendental excursus whose reward is less a divine revelation of truth than a surrogate cosmic spectacular—the "molten" light of the rising sun, "sur[ging] forth" over the Downs (431). If Ursula "rock[s] and we[eps]," it is because the revelatory potential does not lie in Skrebensky, but in a fiery celestial body that each dawn renews its transcendence, and that has no need of her transcendence to complete it (431).</page><page sequence="19">Doherty 65 A sharpening of the sacrificial rupture that splits off human from nonhuman being stigmatizes the difference between the first and second moonlit encounters. As the unconscious of the language of sacrifice, here the symbolic cut is a savage death wound that shuts off the space of transcendence. Although reality effects are more intrusive (body gestures are more clearly defined and the sex act more starkly configured), the same sacrificial violence, beyond Ursula's conscious control, underwrites both descriptions: "metallic" voices and knives (444), a torrid moon conflagration, grotesque bodily mutilations, and a lethal blade thrust that climaxes the drama precipitate a traumatic return to the quotidian world. As a prelude to the action, Ursula al ready marks Skrebensky down as an empty rhetorical figure, a mere "personification" without the substantial potency she knows that he lacks (443), and that vindicates the death sentence she executes. Mutating into a mixed-species monster, half-woman, half-bird—the predatory "harpy" who cannibalizes his flesh (444)—she tears out his heart, and plunges a knife "into his already dead body" (445). The lost potential for ecstatic transcendence transmutes into the death throes that overcome both the lovers. From a modernist perspective, the catastrophic history I have just explored brings a formidable "hermeneutics of suspicion" (Ricoeur 34) to bear on a traditional culture of sacrifice whose negation of the animal-body is the vital hinge round which that same culture re volves. Unmasking the sadism that subtends theological idealizations of death, The Rainbow stages the difference between an inherited religious asceticism that willingly sacrifices the body and a modernist self-assertive erotics that materializes the flesh while paradoxically consuming it in the process. What a theocentric culture proclaims as the resurrectionary triumph over the death of the body returns as the triumph of death itself, stripped of its transcendental pretences. Either way, the animal-body is the metaphor for a tortured and tortu ous renunciation that blocks the fulfillment of erotic desire. The two ultimate episodes of The Rainbow starkly juxtapose the two ontological vectors I have established so far in this essay: the pure immanence of the horse-group that shatters Ursula's hu man identity opposed to the idealizing transcendence configured in her rainbow vision that concludes the novel. In the first—one of the most completely realized scenarios of "becoming animal" in modernist fiction31—species discourse swings to the positive pole of the dialec tic, projecting nonhuman energies, unloosed from the violent curbs and constraints to which humans subject them. No longer allegorical mirrors of anthropomorphic reflexes, the horses Ursula encounters on the deserted common possess a subtle self-consciousness of their own, focused entirely on the other-species intruder who violates their</page><page sequence="20">66 Violent Immolations territorial space. Putting forth their maximum will to power, they seek to master "something less powerful" than they themselves are (Nietzsche, Genealogy 58). Refuting, as it were, the Cartesian as sumption that animals are mere automata (they can react, but they cannot respond),32 they respond continually to the strange bipedal creature who appears in their midst. Through a telepathic communica tion that eludes verbal control or containment, their libidinal shock tactics—their aggressive shifts in posture and purpose—pass through and absorb Ursula's consciousness (the cue-phrase "she was aware" is repeated four times [452-53]). Dissolving individual essences, a transferential dynamic releases fresh energy flows between human and nonhuman that transform both in the process. Challenging the primacy of the verbal, an explosive zoo semiotics—thunderous hoof echoes, electric "flamings" and "flashings" (452)—open up uncanny new dimensions of interspecies communication. In the process, driving wind, rain, and "waving landscape" (451) unite with the horse-group to shut out the space of transcendence (even the "halo of lightning" that strikes comes not from the heavens, but from the incandescent "flash" of the hoof irons). Amid a multiplicity of other awarenesses, Ursula's is a diminishing trace in a chaos of elements that works toward her final extinction. In a remarkable sequence of cross-species transferences, Ursula becomes increasingly aware of the horse-group's threatening potency ("In a sort of lightning of knowledge their movement travelled through her"): the horses possess exactly those fluid, unmediated energies Skrebensky spectacularly lacked. Penetrating and possessing her consciousness, their violently frustrated instincts mirror those that marked her frustrated erotic engagements with him: "their haunches . . . pressing forever till they went mad, running against the walls of time, and never bursting free" (452). Deleuze and Guattari's rhet orical question—"Who has not known the violence of these animal sequences, which uproot one from humanity, if only for an instant?" (265)—cues directly into Ursula's responses, her intense visceral participation in a collective alignment of energies that shatters her individual sense of what it means to be human. In a radical inversion of the sacrificial norm that abjects animality, their spontaneous vital ity liquidates her human defenses ("she was dissolved like water"), as their "looming power" over her becomes absolute (453). Neither permanent, nor ever fully established, however, each "uprooting" has its own resolution, depending on the transferential intensities in volved. Though "becoming animal," as Deleuze and Guattari suggest, fractures the oedipal bond, liberating the subject from the cultural discourses that constitute her (Thousand 16), such freedom is limited by the finite transitory nature of each encounter. In Ursula's case,</page><page sequence="21">Doherty 67 the outcome has a double valency: while the horse-group encoun ter reduces her to the abjected condition of a languageless thing, it triggers a new mode of surpassing. In other words, she breaks through the frustrating constraints that stigmatized her earlier drive to transcendence.33 Following her escape from the horses, and in a traumatized state of unknowing, Ursula sinks to the lowest rung on the ontological ladder, the natural bedrock of existence that suspends all relation to otherness. Like "a stone, unconscious, unchanging, unchangeable" (454), she embodies the inorganic inertia of matter that brings the sinking process itself to an end. If, as Heidegger suggests, the stone is worldless (lacking openness to being, it differs in essence from human or animal), then Ursula too is worldless in exactly the manner Heidegger implies.34 Cut off from response or reaction, with neither "father nor mother nor lover. . . no[r] allocated place in the world of things," she occupies the opposite pole of the dialectic to which the lure of transcendence impelled her. Her traumatized inability to "cast off" her "flesh" (456) to recover her spirit is the catalyst for that same idealizing impulse that earlier caused her undoing. Reigniting her desire for an ultimate truth revelation, her visionary transfigu ration is in symbiotic conjunction with that of the "corrupt" mining landscape of Beldover itself. Precisely because it excludes the erotic, the first "faint iri descence" (458) of the rainbow revives the dream of an unearthly transcendence in a manner Skrebensky's earthbound body could not. Disembodied, other-worldly, uniting heaven and earth in a single luminous arc, the rainbow configures the idealizing momentum of sacrifice whose reward is a revelation of "truth." Screening out the destruction involved in the passage from darkness to light, it appro priates disfigurement and death for transcendence. Casting off their "horny covering of disintegration," rising from the dead in a "new germination," the coal miners reenact the same sacrificial death and resurrection drama as their prototype once initiated on Calvary.35 In the past, a critical consensus charged the end of The Rain bow with a peculiar inappropriateness, an essential absence or lack of connection with the events that preceded it.36 As the present es say indicates, exactly the opposite is true. As the last in a long line of sky phenomena (God, moon, stars, sun) that mediate Ursula's transcendental aspirations, the rainbow ending is, if anything, over determined. Freed from resistant mindsets and burdensome bodies (Skrebensky's), sacrifice at last displays its idealizing potential in action, its symbolic power to efface the lethal destruction that lies at its core. Transmuting the industrial desecration of Beldover into its numinous sacralization, the dream of transcendence that came</page><page sequence="22">68 Violent Immolations to grief with Skrebensky rewrites itself as the new Logos, the "living fabric of Truth" that overarches the heavens. In this reconstitution, the apocalyptic fantasy of a present regeneration succeeds where more earthly "consummations" abjectly failed (459). Notes 1. Dennis Keenan analyses in depth the constitutive role of sacrifice in the writings of Julia Kristeva (34-38), Luce Irigaray (89-94), and Jacques Lacan (113-23). 2. Throughout this essay, the term "animal-body" includes the human and nonhuman varieties. 3. Cary Wolfe puts it concisely: Lacan claims that "the transcendental turn of the Enlightenment (as completed by Kant) consists in the desubstantialization of the subject, its 'purification' from its substan tial origin in nature, the animal, the bodily, the contingent ... the 'pathological'" (109). 4. Vincent Pecora characterizes early twentieth-century secularism in terms of the "survival of desacralized religious dispositions, attitudes, strategies of response, and improvisations ... in spaces intellectually dominated by the disavowal of belief" (160). 5. For lucid discussions of the historical constitution of the humanist self, see Alain Renault (17-22) and Jerrold Seigel (537-650). 6. Discussing Mrs. Ramsay's erotic union with the lighthouse's light in Virginia Woolf's To The Lighthouse, Pecora notes that the union is "inseparable from the religious context in which it occurs, as if the erotic were to be taken quite immediately as a reoccupation of the answer position that had once been provided by the inner light of religious experience" (191). 7. For Bataille, the erotics of sacrifice are linked to death and trans gression, to the breaking of a sacred interdiction: "The feeling of sin is connected ... to the idea of death, and in the same manner the feeling of sin is connected with pleasure" ("Hegel" 23). 8. Lawrence's insistence on the simultaneity of the orgasm spans his whole writing career from Paul and Clara in Sons and Lovers (408) to Lady Chatterley's Lover where, in their third encounter, Connie and Mellors celebrate that they "came-off together" (134). 9. While Freudian ideology draws the human and nonhuman domains into closer proximity, it also splits them off from each other: by identifying the body with animality, it stigmatizes those instincts that civilized humans must overcome, preferably with the help of psychoanalysis (Rohman 23-24; Wolfe 3,109).</page><page sequence="23">Doherty 69 10. Sacrifice itself is one of these delimiting concepts, since it helps to define the difference between humans and animals, who themselves have no need of such rituals. 11. In order to underscore the sacrificial structure of cultural discourse, Derrida, as Wolfe notes, extends his "famous portmanteau designa tion of the essence of Western metaphysics, which he accordingly now refers to as 'carnophallogocentrism'" (100). 12. Carol Adams designates "meat" as one of those "absent referents" that disguises its link with a once-living creature (50). 13. This is Wolfe's term for those human beings who are sacrificed by a cultural law that identifies them with animality (101). Frank is symbolically sacrificed by being ruthlessly excised from the text. 14. For a deconstructive analysis of the delimiting effects of Kant's humanism on his aesthetics, see David Carroll (140-43). See also Kant's The Critique of Judgment (68-70). 15. Through his ability to create artworks, man attempts to distance him self from the "world of immediacy" within which the animal remains locked (Wolfe 176). 16. Akira Lippit suggests that the animal figure functions not only as an exemplary metaphor "within the scope of rhetorical language," but also as an originary one. Its "fantastic transversality . . . breathe[s] into language the vitality of another life, another expression" (165). Such "transversality" goes some way to account for Will's fluid rhe torical transferences between different species domains. 17. Quoting Jean-Luc Nancy, Carroll suggests that in the sublime, art has "its destiny in some sense outside itself" (142), precisely the kind of transcendental destiny the narrator attributes to Will's "consumma tions" in the cathedral. 18. Because, as Henry Krips puts it, fetishists "are 'irrational' in the sense of not pursuing their desires .. . the fetish . . . functions as an impediment, a delaying mechanism with respect to the attainment of their desire" (32). 19. See Carroll 139-40. Libidinally tethered, limited in anticipation to prechosen sites on the body, Will's lovemaking reinforces his human identity, as opposed to his animality. 20. According to Lacan, Kant's ultimate lesson is that the subject "is" only in so far as "the Thing in itself... is sacrificed, 'primordially repressed"' (Zizek 181). Will's final solution—his primordial repres sion of his own animality—brings the subject as acceptable public figure into existence. 21. One of the excised sections of The Rainbow details the contents of Ursula's autoerotic fantasies: Jesus "flung away his garments... and kissed me . . . and embraced me more mightily than Jove" (630).</page><page sequence="24">70 Violent Immolations 22. For Lawrence's critique of masturbation, see Phoenix (170-87), and Fantasia of the Unconscious (119-20). See also James Cowan. H. M. Daleski was one of the first of the earlier critics to draw attention to Ursula's autoerotism, especially in the first moonlit love scene with Skrebensky (110). 23. By the latter half of the nineteenth century, as Lippit notes, it is possible to interpret "the animal as a version of the unconscious in nature," a locus of being that cannot be "inhabited by a [human] subject" (177). 24. As Derek Hughes comments, "We are accustomed to seeing the knife as the invention that both typifies culture and declares its ineradicable origins in violence" (236). 25. In the "Shame" chapter that immediately follows, Ursula's God is "neither Lamb nor Dove"—the "sacrifices of some priest"—but the proud "lion and the eagle" (317). Identifying herself with their power, she stretches "her own limbs like a lion or a wild horse, her heart was relentless in its desires" (318). Such access to an instinctive vitality signals the end of her schoolgirl relationship with her teacher, Winifred Inger, whose body, now seen as "ugly, clayey" (319), lacks precisely the animal vigor Ursula thinks she herself possesses. 26. Linda Ruth Williams's acute but overschematic reading of sexual difference in this scene (she identifies "masculinizing power" with darkness, and "feminizing power" with light) mistakes the dimensions of the dark "beastly" continent Ursula confronts. Less a "masculine territory," as Williams suggests, it represents the primordial space of repression, the core animal darkness within the human that a long European philosophical culture repressed (144). 27. For a detailed history of this tradition, see Gary Steiner's Anthropo centrism and its Discontents. In The Animal That Therefore I am, Derrida critiques Lacan's concept of a Cartesian "fixity of coding" in animals, the "pre-wired behavior" problematic that "repeats the most worn-out truisms of metaphysics" (122). 28. See Rohman's subtle analysis of a typically modernist anxiety in T. S. Eliot and Joseph Conrad about where (and how) to draw the always-precarious fault line between human and nonhuman being (31-52). See also Wolfe's fine essay on Hemingway's The Garden of Eden, which shows how Africa is coded more along species than racial lines (142-68). 29. Exposing the "fixed" Cartesian roots of Lacan's animal ontology, Der rida comments: "For not only is the animal held within the imaginary and unable to accede to the symbolic ... but the description of its semiotic power remains determined .. . fixed within Cartesian fixity, within the presupposition of a code that permits only reactions to stimuli and not responses to questions " (Animal 122). 30. Mediated almost exclusively at this point through narratorial exegesis, Ursula and Skrebensky's communication is minimally verbal. Like Ursula, Skrebensky has "no use for people, nor for words" (416).</page><page sequence="25">Doherty 71 31. Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari are the great theoreticians of the becoming-animal motif. (See especially chapter ten of A Thousand Plateaus, the centerpiece of the book.) Their modernist masters of the art of becoming are Franz Kafka, Virginia Woolf, and Lawrence himself. At a level below preset social identities, becoming-animal involves intense two-way molecular flows between human and animal through which each participates in the other's existence. Neither an imitation nor an identification nor a figure of speech, such a becoming, Deleuze and Guattari insist, is a real event: "The becoming-animal of the human being is real, even if the animal the human being becomes is not" (262). Thus Ursula's becoming-horse-group also involves the horse-group becoming-human. Indeed the description of Ursula's encounter is replete with pointers to a horse-group self consciousness, just as acutely aware of its situation as Ursula is of hers. To take a single example: the horse-group "stirred uneasily, awaiting her, knowing its triumph. . . . She knew the horses were aware" (453). 32. As Julie Smith says of Descartes's view, though animals have sensa tions, and can therefore react, they cannot respond because they lack the capacity for propositional thought, and for "attitudes towards phenomena" (232). 33. Past criticism has overwhelmingly interpreted the horse-group as a metaphor for human psychological states: as "the ultimate energic source of man's vitality" (Moynahan 146), or as a projection of Ur sula's "self-alienation" (Bell 86). One of the pluses of a "becoming animal" reading is that it opens up the subject (Ursula) to animal being. It replaces the logocentric quest for meaning (the reader, as Fiona Becket disarmingly puts it, must "labour hard to extract it" [108]) with meaning's subtle dismantling, its infiltration by magnetic animal intensities, by the antilogos that inhabits the body of the logos itself. 34. For a discussion of Heidegger's concept of the stone, which is "world less and a-spiritual," in its relation to animal-being, see Leonard Lawlor (51-53). 35. In the terms The Rainbow establishes, Ursula's is not a "real" tran scendence, for the attainment of which mutual orgasm (Tom and Lydia's) is the condition, and total transformation the consequence. Ursula's autogenetic fantasy of an instant renewal is, by contrast, purely imaginary, a wish-fulfillment dream of completion and clo sure. Crucially, Beldover remains an industrial wasteland, the coal miners' bodies remain unresurrected, and, to judge from her early appearances in Women in Love, Ursula remains an "untransformed" character (459). She must await the coming of Birkin. 36. On this issue, F. R. Leavis was the spokesman for a generation of critics (142).
