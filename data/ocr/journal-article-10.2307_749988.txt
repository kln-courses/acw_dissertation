<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MASTER OF ANIMALS By Roger Hinks Among the bronzes from the Payne Knight collection in the British Museum is a small openwork relief representing a kneeling frontal figure, male and bearded, between a pair of seated griffins arranged heraldically to right and left (P1. 35a).x The kneeling personage wears a tunic with tight-fitting sleeves which reach to the wrists, and over his left shoulder a skin which hangs in a point in front and down the sides, but leaves the thighs bare. In his hands he grasps the tails of the griffins, who raise their forepaws and turn their heads towards him. The griffin on the left has the head of an eagle, that on the right the head of a lion: in other words, they are respectively of the Greek and Persian types.2 Although this piece is not unknown, its archaological and mythographical interest have not hitherto been recognized. The main points requiring elucidation are the meaning of the motif, the identity of the personage represented, and the date and stylistic affinities of the object. It will be convenient to treat them in this order. First the motif: the heraldic scheme and the action of the central figure in grasping the tails of the griffins at once suggest that he is a male counter- part of the n6rcv 0-p"v, a 'master of animals.' Although abundant in the East from a very early period,3 and although not infrequent in Minoan and Mycenaean times,4 it is much less common in Greek art, at any rate after the archaic period.5 The late Mycenaean type found on the gold orna- ment from the Aegina Treasure 6 (P1. 35b) reappears on some of the ivory plaques from the sanctuary of Artemis Orthia at Sparta7 (P1. 35c) : the winged Master of Animals strides along, holding a bird in each hand; or, unwinged, clasps a pair of confronted griffins by their necks. After the seventh century, the date of the Spartan ivories, the motif dis- appears for a time in the explicitly antithetical form derived from the orient; though a reminiscence of it may be detected in the common late 1 Walters, Catalogue of Bronzes in the British Museum, No. 859, p. 155, pl. xi.

R. Hall and C. Leonard Woolley, Ur Excavations I. Al- 'Ubaid, Oxford, 1927, p. 27 f., pl. vi). The motif is also popular in anthropomorphic form on seal-cylinders from Sumerian times down to the Persian period: see L. Dela- porte, Catalogue des cylindres orientaux du Muse'e du Louvre, Paris, 1920-3, pls. 43, 65 (Sum- erian) ; 52, 87 (Assyrian) ; etc. 4Examples of antithetical compositions showing the master or mistress of animals flanked by griffins are given by M. P. Nilsson, The Minoan-Mycenaean Religion, Lund 1927, p. 317, n. I. r Nilsson, op. cit., p. 442, goes so far as to say that in the Greek age the Master of Animals has vanished. He knows only the frankly assyrianizing representation on the bronze cymbal from the Idaean Cave: E.

In the fourth century the motif suddenly reappears, curiously trans- formed. In the Acropolis Museum at Athens is a marble throne, said to have been found in the vestibule of the Parthenon.' On the back is the upper half of a figure in swallow-tailed draperies, rising from a pair of acan- thus-volutes and grasping in each hand not a griffin, on this occasion, but an acanthus-bud which springs from the tendrils on either side. The head is destroyed, but it is clear from the replica of the throne in Berlin 3 that it was bearded and winged and wore a polos (P1. 35d). The gesture of grasping the acanthus-buds, apparently meaningless, becomes intelligible when we compare this figure with that on a marble acroterion in the Hermit- age at Leningrad,4 where instead of the tendrils we find two prancing lion- griffins with horns, by which the god grasps them. Here the 'master of animals' theme is unmistakable. A further variant of the motif appears on a relief in the National Museum in Athens,5 where the god is shown as a full-length figure in a long oriental robe ; he raises his hands and touches, but does not grasp, the horns of the two lion-griffins who prance to right and left of him. Lastly we may turn to an early Antonine grave-relief in the Lateran," where the same herm-like half-figure of the god reappears twice, each time holding by its beak an eagle-headed griffin. Who is this god, more than half oriental and as a rule only half human, from the waist upwards ? What is the significance of the griffin-support- ers ? Ludwig Curtius, the last to discuss this group of monuments,7 calls him Sabazios, 'the Phrygian fluteplayer' whose intrusion into the company of the Olympians was so keenly resented by Aristophanes.8 His wings and his polos indicate that he is no Olympian, but some stranger from the east. But the god on our bronze has neither polos nor wings ; and although his dress is half oriental, his face is Hellenic enough. As for the griffins, they are no key to his identity: they are regularly found in attendance on Apollo, upon Dionysos, upon Artemis and Nemesis, and other deities on rarer occasions. Of these Dionysos is the god who best suits the character of the central figure on our bronze; but it would be rash to assert posi- tively that he is Dionysos, unless some suitable qualifying epithet can be supplied. It is better to leave him for the time being without a name and call him simply 'The Master of Animals.' A final word as to the date of the relief: in style it resembles closely the 1 Cf. e.g. the bronze amphora from the Pourtalks collection found at Vulci and now in the British Museum : No. 557 ; Walters, Select Bronzes, pl. 11. 2 Casson, Catalogue of the Acropolis Museum, II, p. 278 f., No. 1366.
