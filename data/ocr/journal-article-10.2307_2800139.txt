<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reindeer and men SIR, Tim Ingold's 'On reindeer and men' (Man N.S. 9, 523-38) contained much of interest: the circumstances of changes in herd manage- ment in north-east Finland, for instance; but his supposedly ' ethological' portrayal of the relationship between men and reindeer (with its sociological implications) cannot pass un- remarked. He speaks insistently of a 'social contract between man and deer' (p. 537). I suppose this to be an anthropomorphic fantasy which even as a metaphor for heuristic purposes is (a) unhelpful: his good points about changes in herd management and economic conver- sions can be grasped-and accepted-without the metaphor; and (b) ultimately misleading. However, it seems as though Ingold is determined to be taken literally: the deer are involved in 'political/economic decision- making' (p. 523); their posited relationship with herders is one of value maximisation:</page><page sequence="2">CORRESPONDENCE 6I9 the value of security for the deer (p. 525); and (in conditions of intelnsive herd manage- ment) 'the deer recognises certain obligations towards its master. . . . Other men cannot command the same deer's obedience in this way: the relationship is exclusive' (p. 530); there follows a straight-faced explication of the reindeer :man relationship in terms of Radcliffe-Brown's well-known in rem and in personiam distinction (pp. 530-I). Nor do these statements purport to repre- sent the herdsman's perception of his relation- ship with his animals but are made explicitly by the ethnographer (cuini ethologist) on behalf of the reindeer. What first appeared to be an undisciplined parody of the socio- logical usage of words like 'contract' and 'transaction' (p. 525) now also looks like a parody of the claims of Pavlovian research. Of course the ease with which animals may be manipulated by herdsmen is in proportion to the extent to which an environment of security and congenial routine has been estab- lished for the animals; but is there entitlement to posit a sense of obligation on the part of the animals? Of course herdsmen deploy their accumulated knowledge about the habits and responses of their animals; but where is the evidence for supposing that the animals have anything at all approaching a reciprocal body of 'knowledge', deduced from experience, about the herdsmen? Of course frightened animals will (in many circumstances) attempt to evade the herds- men; but it is highfalutin' to begin to explain this in terms of a broken contract. As far as I know, reindeer herdsmen always draw upon a combination of 'physical force and technological superiority' (p. 53I), and not-as Ingold would have it-just when intensive management is abandoned. Where- ever the close man: animal relationship of intensive herd management was maintained it was (with local variations) through the use of dogs, lassoes, bells, harnesses, corrals, fences, smudge fires, salt licks-and when necessary the knife, for surgery (testicles, antlers) or for butchery. Indeed, one difficulty with Ingold's thesis is lodged in his character- isation of the change from intensive to ex- tensive herd management as one in which 'symiibiotic pastoralism is replaced by predatory pastoralism' (p. 537: my emphases). For instance, what kind of persuasion (metaphorical, sociological, biological, eco- logical, ethological?) can make sense of the idea of 'a long-term contract of mutual ad- vantage' (p. 525) or of a symbiotic relation- ship as opposed to a predatory one, between a reindeer owner and the large number of his bull animals that within a few days of their birth (under intensive herd management) will be castrated and/or slaughtered? Anyway, do reindeer 'think'-and think 'transactionally'? Be that as it may, Tim Ingold misses the chance, as it seems to me, to ask 'Do herdsmnen suppose their reindeer think?' But then, Ingold may say I have missed his point. Perhaps others have too? I would really appreciate it were he or some- one else to clarify, better still to demonstrate, the ethological metaphysics of his interesting essay. Robert Paine Meemorial University of Newfoundland SIR, Robert Paine is, of course, correct in seeinig in my article a parody of a certain brand of transactionalist theory. I cannot deny that this intention was at the back of my mind when I wrote it. He is perfectly entitled to view this as undisciplined and unhelpful. In hind- sight, I would admit as much myself. Paine does, however, question some of the more substantial points of my argument. Although I have rethought much of it since writing the paper two years ago, I would still stand by my main contentions, and therefore wel- come the opportunity to clarify some of the issues that Paine raises in his letter. There are really three themes, perhaps sometimes submerged or clumsily expressed, which I see as crucial to my argument, none of which Paine appears to have entirely appreciated. The first is the necessity to separate ideo- logical variables, concerning the articulation within human society of rights over animals, from ecological (or ethological) variables, con- cerning the nature of the interspecific relation- ship between human and animal populations. I take the distinction between hunting and pastoralism to be an ideological one: briefly, pastoralists recognise rights over live animals, hunters over dead ones. Now, I admit that the simple opposition between symbiosis and predation is hardly adequate to describe the wide range of forms that the man-animal relationship can take, whether the ideological context be hunting or pastoralism. Never- theless, it is surely legitimate to contrast a situation in which animals 'in the terrain' seek, or at least admit, the presence of man with one in which they avoid him. Techni- cally, if this presence is protective, leading to a hiigher animal population than would other- wise be sustained, then the relationship is a symbiotic rather than a predatory one, regard- less of the fact that the majority of aniimals may, in the end, suffer death or mutilation by the herder's knife. After all, every animal ultimately dies, one way or another. The essence of the symbiotic relationship lies in the provision of security for the animals, and strictly selective husbandry which eliminates</page><page sequence="3">620 CORRESPONDENCE only those animals incapable of further in- crease. Under such conditions, slaughter could be regarded as anticipatory rather than preda- tory; whereas in a predatory relationship, no provision is made for security, and a random factor is introduced into husbandry. In any case, I find Paine's assertion that herdsmen have always used force rather puzzling, in view of the fact that many elements in his subsequent list (para. 6) do not involve the use of force at all: for example bells, smudge- fires and salt-licks. Although corrals and fences have been generally, though not uni- versally used, even in intensive management systems, the reliance on temporary or perma- nent barrier fences, strung out for many miles across the landscape, has become a prominent feature of herding campaigns only with the breakdown of traditional controls. Herding with dogs, unlike snowmobile driving, takes advantage of the natural response of deer to threat without using direct force. The lasso is useless until the deer is within roping distance, whilst only deer that are already broken in can be harnessed. Finally, I have never heard of a man controlling his animals' behaviour by threatening them with a knife! Here, Paine is confusing his own distinction between herding and husbandry. The second theme of the article is to take up the differences between domestication and pastoral man-animal relationships. I stressed that the bulk of the pastoralist's expanding herd is domesticated neither in the sense of tameness nor that of genetic modification. The pastoral relationship, whether symbiotic or predatory, is one between a population of men and a population of animals: hence the transactional analogy. On the other hand, through domestication, as I have defined it, the animal is partially incorporated into a human group, establishing a particularistic relationship with its master, and performing certain expected duties for him. The assort- ment of quotations in the third paragraph, some dealing with domestication, others with the pastoral relationship, and the assertion that I am positing a sense of obligation on the part of undomesticated animals under symbiotic pastoralism (para. 5), suggests that this point has not been driven home. The confusion may arise from my misleading use of 'the contract', but I suspect it is also due to Paine's lumping together of both domestication and symbiosis under the same rubric-'intensive management'. The third theme of my article is the contra- diction between the ideals of pastoralism and the ecological foundations of pastoral con- trols. Pastoralists aim to achieve ever greater concentrations of animals on the range; but the natural response of the animals to in- creasing population density on inadequate pasture is to break down into ever smaller and more widely dispersed social units, mak- ing it impossible for the pastoralist to provide the security for his animals and exercise the strict selection that underly the symbiotic relationship. Control over reproductive in- crease therefore breaks down before popula- tion densities become so high as to bring about a Malthusian catastrophe. The point is simply that reindeer are not just passive objects but social animals; and their responses to changing environmental conditions are not altogether under human control, and may indeed undermine this control. Given the fact that man is such a ubiquitous feature of the reindeer's environment, it would be extra- ordinary if they did not react in some way, be it positively or negatively, to his presence. Finally, Paine's preoccupation with the herder's perception of his relationship with his animals must stem from his current ethno- methodological bent. I can assure him that the Lapps amongst whom I worked certainly viewed deer as strategic agents whose tactics, sometimes stupid, sometimes cunning, by all accounts had to be reckoned with (see section VI of my article). But this is really a rather anthropocentric position. An eminent ethologist has aptly remarked that 'the animal's tendency to zoomorphize corre- sponds to man's tendency to anthropomor- phize' (Hediger I965: 29 ). It is unfortunate that reindeer are not in a position to contribute to academic debate. Tim Ingold Uniiversity of Manchester Hediger, H. I965. Man as a social partner of animals and vice-versa. Zool.
