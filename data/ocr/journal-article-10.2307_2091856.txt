<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DECLINE OF POLITICS AND IDEOLOGY IN A KNOWLEDGEABLE SOCIETY ROBERT E. LANE Yale University From reports on the growth and changing character of contemporary knowledge, it is argued that we live in a "knowledgeable society" with certain epistemological characteristics, among which are the development of more fruitful categories of thought, increased differentiation of ego from inner and outer worlds, an imagination of situations contrary to fact, reflective ab- straction, changing truth criteria, and a changed philosophy of knowledge. This increase in knowledge and change in thoughtways lead to changes in policy-making procedures. There is increased application of scientific criteria for policy determination at the expense of the usual short-term political criteria and ideological thinking as well. In this situation, social knowledge is creating its own attitudinal disequilibrium. T has been a common thing to speak of a "democratic society," and recently of an "affluent society." Could one, in some analogous sense, speak of a "knowledgeable society," or perhaps historically of an "age of knowledge"? Good scholars are likely to be so aware of what they do not know to regard the term as pretentious, yet they are familiar with, and perhaps accept the implications of conventional statements on the "scientific age." The purpose of this piece is to explore the concept of a knowledgeable society, and to examine some of its political implications. The strands of thinking which may be woven into such a conceptual fabric are many and varied and curiously isolated from one another. There are, in the first place, certain early sociological and anthropological thinkers, each with a somewhat different in- terpretation of the stages of development of knowledge.' The Marxian dialectic offers a further developmental analysis, in the tradi- tion of the sociology of knowledge.2 Students of social change,3 historians of science,4 and philosophers of science 5 add to the picture. Knowledge is cognition-psychologists deal- ing with cognitive processes and concept formation and thinking illuminate the micro- processes given greater emphasis in an age of knowledge.6 Even economists have re- cently dealt with knowledge.

Never- theless in discussing the concept of a knowl- edgeable society, we have the help of many others. "Knowledge," of course is a broad term and I mean to use it broadly. It includes both "the known" and "the state of knowing." 11 Thus a knowledgeable society would be one where there is much knowledge, and where many people go about the business of know- ing in a proper fashion. As a first approxima- tion to a definition, the knowledgeable society is one in which, more than in other societies, its members: (a) inquire into the basis of their beliefs about man, nature, and society; (b) are guided (perhaps unconsciously) by objective standards of veridical truth, and, at the upper levels of education, follow sci- entific rules of evidence and inference in inquiry; (c) devote considerable resources to this inquiry and thus have a large store of knowledge; (d) collect, organize, and in- terpret their knowledge in a constant effort to extract further meaning from it for the purposes at hand; (e) employ this knowl- edge to illuminate (and perhaps modify) their values and goals as well as to ad- vance them. Just as the "democratic so- ciety" has a foundation in governmental and interpersonal relations, and "the affluent so- ciety" a foundation in economics, so the knowledgeable society has its roots in epis- temology and the logic of inquiry. In order to support such an epistemologi- cal effort, a society must be open, i.e., free discussion must be allowed on every topic, with the outer limit posed not by threats of social change, but by concern for survival as a society. It must be stable enough to maintain the order necessary for the process of inquiry, trusting enough to encourage cooperative effort and acceptance of each other's "findings," 12 rich enough to educate its population in the modes of inquiry, dis- satisfied or curious enough to want to know more. Obviously this definition and these condi- tions raise more questions than can be an- swered easily: Who are these paragons? What power have they? What standards of knowledge qualify a man or a group or a society? How shall we deal with mystical and religious knowledge? With poetical and artistic knowledge? What about the basis for the epistemology itself-is not this the crudest act of faith? This is only an ap- proximate definition of a model of a "knowl- edgeable society." The elements are present in some degree in every society; in the knowl- edgeable society they are present to the greatest degree. COMMENTS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE KNOWLEDGEABLE SOCIETY I have defined the knowledgeable society in terms of an epistemology, a search for and quantity of knowledge, and a pattern of use of that knowledge. Any effort to examine in detail how such a society developed leads into theories of social change.

The growth and communication of experi- ence. Malinowski gives us a starting point: "every primitive community is in possession of a considerable store of knowledge, based on experience and fashioned by reason." 13 He is here arguing against the view that primitive men are irrational and mystical; his argument takes the form of identifying the "profane" domain of life where cause and effect and the effectiveness of skill and reason are clearly perceived, in short, where "scientific thought" is dominant. Wherever the relationships between action and results are obscure, magic and religion have their domain, but the two may be kept separate and the latter need not dominate the former.14 The knowledgeable society de- velops by an extension of an understanding of the cause-and-effect relationships in every- day experience and the withering away of the supernatural. Two further points can be made. Following Sumner part way,15 we propose that philosophy and ethics, and perhaps a kind of low-level science, come to be the generalized and rationalized versions of everyday experience. To some extent they are emergent from and dependent upon the codification of everyday experience. The in- teraction between science, or at least tech- nology, and philosophy and religion, is an interaction between experience of the mass and the reflections of the elite. In making experience conscious, modern society may, quite apart from the apparatus of science, increase the knowledge applied to everyday acts and decrease their magical and religious components. When experience is "lost" or when it is unconscious and traditional, the opportunities to build a knowledgeable so- ciety at this level are wasted. The growth of culture and science. In Con- figurations of Culture Growth,16 Kroeber employs the notion of episodic cultural "flowering," of typical phases of early growth, pause, maturity, perhaps revival, and then exhaustion. The reference is to all phases of culture-art, music, architecture and philosophy, as well as science and inven- tion. The flowering of one field of culture is, according to Kroeber, likely to be accom- panied by the flowering of others, but there are no necessary associations. "Flowering" and "growth," identified by historical recog- nition of excellence, represent the selection of a dominant "pattern," reinforced (or at least not opposed) by other social forces or areas, and selectively exploited until the pos- sibilities of this particular specialized way of looking at things is exhausted, ending either in repetition or in rebellion, perhaps with an occasional revival.'7 Science, it seems, is no different. "It is . . . specifically to be noted that continuity is a proper quality only of the results of scientific activity. The activity itself is discontinuous." 18 Following Kroeber's line of thought on general culture growth, a knowledgeable society might be in a period of special "flowering," to be fol- lowed by decline; there have been many such in history. But since we are interested in exactly those areas of knowledge that are cumulative (and we have reason to believe that the policy sciences are beginning to show this property) we consider a trend to be more reasonable than a cycle. The concept of growth in knowledge to- gether with irregular scientific "flowering" is partly at odds with Ogburn's concept of an exponential growth of invention, due to the ever-expanding number of "elements" in a culture. Invention, for Ogburn, is the re- combination of these elements into a new pattern. Since the invention of printing, "ele- ments" are unlikely to be lost, and the com- munication process promotes increased dif- fusion; the possibility of new combinations is cumulative, and restrained only by fric- tion, lag and disturbance. Ogburn seems less concerned with the "quality" of the in- vention, a property central to Kroeber's ideas, than with the quantity and the ac- celerated rate of innovations of all kinds, and with their capacity for creating social change and social strain.19 Thus, the knowledgeable society is a strained society. 13 Malinowski, op. cit., p. 26. 14 Ibid., pp. 26-36. 15 William Graham Sumner, Folkways, Boston: Ginn &amp; Co., 1940 ed., pp. 1-74. 16See footnote (1) above.

Price finds something similar to Ogburn's cumula- tive curve. He says: It must be recognized that the growth of science is something very much more active, much vaster in its problems, than any other sort of growth happening in the world today. For one thing, it has been going on for a longer time and more steadily than most other things. More important, it is growing much more rapidly than anything else. All other things in population, economics, nonscientific culture, are growing so as to double in roughly every human generation or say thirty to fifty years. Science in America is growing so as to double in only ten years. . . . If you care to regard it this way, the density of science in our culture is quadrupling during each genera- tion.20 But Price is explicit about the inhibition of science. Clearly such exponential growth cannot continue: "To go beyond the bounds of absurdity, another couple of centuries of normal growth of science would give us dozens of scientists per man, woman, child and dog of world population." 21 According to Price, the curve of develop- ment is logistic in shape and we are nearing the point of deceleration of growth. One could then, at least on this quantitative basis, dif- ferentiate perhaps three periods: (1) ac- celerating rate of growth; (2) some inter- mediate constant rate; and (3) decelerating rate of growth. But this is still quantitative growth; it is at least possible that Kroeber's comments on "bursts" of greatness or emi- nence or quality apply. Nevertheless Kroe- ber's view that "there is no clear evidence of a tendency toward acceleration of growth as we pass from ancient to modern times" 22 seems to require reservations with respect to science. Machlup is concerned with yet another kind of relevant data: the increase in per- sonnel and expenditure on knowledge, and the implicit evaluation of worth by society relative to other pursuits. Machlup's concept of "the knowledge industry" is much broader than the focus on "science" or even "cul- ture"; it includes those who distribute knowl- edge (in education and teaching) as well as those who produce it. He finds that knowl- edge-producing occupations have grown much more rapidly than others and that the salaries of knowledge-producers and dis- tributors, relative to other occupations with equal education, have tended to increase. He also observes a changing emphasis within the knowledge industry: "While in the first part of this century growth was fastest in the clerical occupations, the lead was then taken by managerial and executive occupa- tions, and more recently by professional and technical personnel." 23 The knowledgeable society encourages and rewards the "men of knowledge," compared to the "men of af- fairs." The United States has been slow to recog- nize the importance of scientific knowledge, partly, as Machlup says, because of the "American idiosyncrasy in favor of the im- mediately practical and against the general- theoretical." 24 Although, in some ways, sci- ence grows out of technology,25 it is often the other way around; even in technology the United States in the 19th Century tended to lag behind Europe.26 This is no longer so. Consider the following data on current American expansion in the sciences: (1) From 1940 to 1957, Federal government expenditures for research and de- velopment (excluding military pay) in- creased from $74 million to $2,835 million; from 1953 to 1963, total Federal expendi- tures for these purposes increased from $3 billion to $10 billion.27 (2) In the ten-year period from 1953 to 1963, expenditures for research and development by colleges and universities increased from $420 million to $1,700 million.28 (3) In the seven-year period 20 Price, op. cit., pp. 107-108. 21Ibid., p. 113. 22 Kroeber, op. cit., p. 842. 23 Machlup, op. cit., p. 396. 24 Ibid., p. 202. 25 See Derek Price's discussion of "Renaissance Roots of Yankee Ingenuity" in his Science Since Babylon, pp. 45-67. 26 Eugene Ayres, "Social Attitudes Toward In- vention," American Scientist, 43 (1955), pp. 533- 535; quoted in Machlup, p. 202. 27 U.

The prodigious and increasing resources poured into research, the large and increas- ing numbers of trained people working on various natural and social "problems," and the expanding productivity resulting from this work, is, at least in size, a new factor in social, and (I shall argue) in political life. This "second scientific revolution," as it is sometimes called, reflects both a new ap- preciation of the role of scientific knowledge, and a new merger of western organizational and scientific skills.31 The knowledgeable society is a modern phenomenon; it has inherited a body of knowledge of man, nature, and society which has been continually created and reversed throughout a history of accelerating attention to systematic investigation, despite the ir- regularity of the production of "great" ideas. The scientific and technological component of culture is different from all other cultural products. Unlike "schools of art and litera- ture," or religious movements, or political movements with their regional incidence, it is a world-wide phenomenon, with demonstra- ble success in implementing whatever pur- poses it is applied to.32 All countries are de- voting increasing resources to scientific investigation, and part of this increase is in the social or behavioral sciences. Like the rest of the "knowledge industry," to use Machlup's term, the social knowledge in- dustry is expanding. THE THOUGHTWAYS OF A KNOWLEDGEABLE SOCIETY The knowledgeable society is characterized by a relative emphasis upon certain ways of thinking, a certain epistemology, or, at the very least, a certain knowledge about knowl- edge. Is this epistemological skill more char- acteristic of modern, particularly American, society, than of societies in previous periods? It is possible to speak of the development of epistemology somewhat as one speaks of economic and political development, and to construct a sketch of the "thoughtways" of a knowledgeable society. The view that these qualities are more widely distributed today than ever before (one of the themes of Whitehead's Science and the Modern World), and are more thoroughly understood by a governing elite of professional and man- agers, is reinforced by research showing the impact of modern education upon thinking processes.33 Anthropomorphic and analogical thinking. The first stage of thought is labelling, i.e., assigning things to classes-a more com- plicated process than at first appears.34 Durkheim and Mauss argue that primitive classification was first developed according to social categories: "the first classes of things were classes of men, into which things were integrated. It was because men were grouped, and thought of themselves in the form of groups, that in their ideas they grouped other things, and in the beginning the two modes of grouping were merged to the point of being indistinct." So, also, "the unity of knowledge is nothing else than the very unity of the collectivity. . . . Logical relations are thus, in a sense, domestic rela- tions." 35 This view has been criticized in detail,36 but the general point, seen in ani- mistic thought everywhere, is valid: Men classified the unfamiliar in terms of the for the United States: 1965, Washington, D.C.: 1965 p. 545. 29 Ibid., p. 551. 30 Ibid., p. 527. 31 See John J.

Even in the history of science the use of familiar analogies dominated thought. For example, it is said that Aristotle thought of causal effects in terms of a horse drawing a cart and that Galileo thought of heavenly bodies as something like ships moving in an ocean without friction.37 The knowledgea- ble society is one where, by successive ap- proximation, categories and classes of things move from the immediate, personal and familiar, to more abstract concepts with a better fit (more adequate to account for the properties of the phenomena observed). Differentiation of ego from inner world and from environment. The more a person responds "unselfconsciously" to his inner moods and fantasy life, without conscious thought, or to the stimuli of his environ- ment, reactively, the less able he is either to schedule his drives and maximize his pur- poses or to master and control the environ- ment. Somehow he must be "separate" from his inner world and his outer world; he must have ego strength to think through his problems, synthesize his desires and control his behavior. These qualities are said to be lacking in primitive man, as they are de- monstrably lacking in a child. Indeed as one ascends the phylogenetic scale, the separation of ego from inner and outer worlds becomes more and more marked.38 This is sometimes mistaken for alienation; in reality it is a necessary element in thought and a necessary ingredient of the knowledgeable society. Imagining situations contrary to fact or beyond experience. In The Passing of Tradi- tional Society, Daniel Lerner reports on surveys where Middle Eastern subjects are asked to imagine themselves as editors of a newspaper, Governor or President of their society, or residents in a foreign country. Those with the most limited experience and the most parochial orientations cannot do this; they boggle at the very thought. Lerner refers to this imagination of the self in the place of another as "empathy." 39 A more general notion is the "assumption of a mental set willfully and consciously," 40 as dis- tinguished from a capacity to respond only in terms of a given and familiar state of affairs and an inability to manipulate concepts in the mind so as to reconstruct them in an ungiven manner.40 Any society which relies upon widely distributed initiative, ambition, and innovation must encourage these quali- ties of imagination: men must think of them- selves and of elements of their situation as other than they are. Holding simultaneously in mind various aspects of a situation. Primitive and unedu- cated people can learn a task, a creed, a message, a set of conventions, but it takes special qualities to grasp the "essential" parts, to see how they are put together, to compare them, in short, to analyze them. Comparison and contrast implies holding and bringing together at least two things at once.41 Rote learning, as in many traditional schools, does not develop these special ana- lytical qualities; it only teaches parts, or, perhaps, sequences. To analyze is to ques- tion, and questioning is regarded as dan- gerous. The reflective abstraction of common prop- erties and the formation of hierarchic con- cepts. The capacity to compare and analyze, to disintegrate a whole, is usually paired with the more difficult task of integrating and organizing parts into a new pattern: analysis and synthesis. In the most primitive societies, the concept of abstract numbers, in contrast to concrete instances, is sometimes missing.42 Once possessed of the idea of, say, "fiveness" it is not difficult to assign groups with five discrete elements to this class; but to invent, from a multiplicity of objects, the concept of "five" or any other abstract number is the act of genius. The knowledgeable society is not only endowed with a great variety of 37Stephen Toulmin, Foresight and Understanding, New York: Harper Torchbook, 1961, pp. 52, 54. 38This point and several following are derived from Harvey, Hunt, and Schroder's explication and development of Goldstein and Scheerer's concept of a concrete-abstractness dimension of thought, originating from studies of children and brain- damaged patients.

The pre-knowledgeable so- ciety employs the concepts given by tradi- tion. The qualities discussed above fall along a dimension of concreteness-abstraction. The concrete style of thinking is stimulus-bound, unreflective, unanalytic, unsynthetic, and unimaginative. Present in all societies, it is most evident in primitive societies. Harvey, Hunt and Schroder believe it has social con- sequences, which can be summarized in these ways: 43 Greater concreteness tends to be ac- companied by absolutism, categorical think- ing, and stereotyping; it is likely to be ex- pressed in attribution of external causality and "oughtness" to rules; it disposes toward catechisms and word magic; it tends to be accompanied by negativism and resistance to suggestion; and it encourages ritualism. In these ways, as readers of The Authori- tarian Personality and of The Open and Closed Mind will recognize, the dimension of concreteness-abstraction has political and social implications: concreteness is related to authoritarianism and to dogmatic, rigid, and opinionated thinking; 44 The democratic society in contrast is marked by abstract thinking. Employment of objective truth criteria. A knowledgeable society is not only one where more people value knowledge, but one where knowledge is more likely to be valued if it can be shown to be true by certain objective criteria. In the words of Ithiel Pool: To evaluate assertions primarily by a criterion of objective truth is not a natural human way of doing things; it is one of the peculiar features of the Graeco-Roman-Western tradi- tion. . . . The Western criterion of truth- value . . . assumes that a statement has a validity or lack of it inherent in itself and quite independent of who says it and why.... In most societies facts must be validated by an in-group authority before they can be considered credible.45 In most societies, statements are true ac- cording to whether the spokesman is powerful and likely to dominate others, whether he is "one of us," whether it is expressed with ap- propriate politeness, and so forth. Moreover, in Eastern philosophies a thing can both be true and not true at the same time; there is no rule of the undistributed middle.46 In a sense, this is a facet of a much larger problem analyzed by Rokeach: the process- ing of information according to its "intrinsic merits." In his discussion of the open and closed mind, he says that the "basic charac- teristic that defines the extent to which a per- son's system is open or closed," is "the extent to which the person can receive, evaluate, and act on relevant information received from the outside on its own intrinsic merits, unen- cumbered by irrelevant factors in the situa- tion arising from within the person or from the outside." By irrelevant internal pressures Rokeach means unconscious intruding habits and poses, irrational power needs or needs for self-aggrandizement, the need to allay anxiety, to create an impression, and so forth. The irrelevant outside factors are at- titudes of dislike towards the source, con- formity pressures, the rewards and punish. ments implied by acceptance and rejection.47 The knowledgeable society screens out more of the irrelevant internal and external factors for more people. Tolerance of dissonance and ambiguity. The authoritarian personality, according to Else Frenkel-Brunswik, is intolerant of am- biguous stimuli; he needs quick, sharp reso- lution of his doubts. Thus he likes sharply de- fined art, quick (and usually easy) answers, people who are decisive.48 The person with a closed mind, according to Rokeach, does not bring together conflicting elements of his be- lief system; rather he compartmentalizes them, linking them only through the author- ity of the dogma or the party line or the dominant spokesmen's view.49 Similarly the capacity and inclination to hold simulta- neously in view opinions or attitudes each of 43 Harvey et al., ibid., pp. 36-46. 44T.

Changed views of metaphysics and re- ligion. Comte, writing in the early nine- teenth century, held that social progress was produced by a changing epistemology and metaphysics. Societies pass (necessarily, he thought) through certain stages marked by the dominance in modes of thought and emphasis first, of theology, then of meta- physics, and finally of science associated with industrial development, centrally planned and controlled with the help of extensive sociological studies which give the controllers knowledge of the laws of society.5' The agency of change is, however, unclear; there is no epistemological dialectic. Yet one can at least accept the idea that in the knowledge- able society theological and metaphysical modes of thought shrink in contrast to scientific modes. Within this framework, however, certain kinds of religious thought seem to have encouraged the growth of science. Merton expressed his position as follows: "It is the thesis of this study that the Puritan ethic, as an ideal-typical expression of the value- attitudes basic to ascetic Protestantism gen- erally, so canalized the interests of seven- teenth-century Englishmen as to constitute one important element in the enhanced cultivation of science. The religious interests of the day demanded in their forceful im- plications the systematic, rational, and em- pirical study of Nature for the glorification of God in His works and for the control of the corrupt world." 52 A knowledgeable society, then, emerges from and is reinforced by religious beliefs which, however framed, focus attention upon this world, and allow for or encourage a scientific epistemology. Today, scientists and professional people are much less likely to be religious or believe in God than businessmen, bankers, and law- yers.53 Changed philosophy of knowledge. The mind vs. matter problem appears in many guises: as the contrast between "words and things", as rationalism vs. empiricism, as idealism vs. nominalism, and so forth. Whitehead considered that the great differ- ence between the modem scientific age and all other periods was the wedding together of speculative and theoretical modes of thought with empirical and systematic modes of investigation.54 Similarly Reichen- bach has argued that the rise of scientific philosophy is grounded in a shift from "transcendental conception of knowledge, according to which knowledge transcends the observable things and depends upon the use of other sources then sense perception," to a "functional conception of knowledge, which regards knowledge as an instrument of prediction and for which sense observa- tion is the only admissible criterion of nonempty truth." 55 There are not two worlds, an ideal and a real one, but one integrated world of thought and experience. The knowledgeable society is marked by an increased acceptance of this view. "The opium of the intellectuals" is not so much, as Raymond Aron thinks, Marxism,56 as it is philosophical idealism. One facet of this changed concept of knowledge has been an emphasis upon oper- ationalism, i.e., the position that concepts are related, however indirectly, to the oper- ations which measure them, and by inter- subjective testability. Knowledge in the knowledgeable society must be public, its sources indicated and its conceptual bound- aries marked by something other than in- communicable experience. From symptomatology to taxonomy to explanation. The history of the biological and behavioral sciences, reveals a tendency first to report observations on phenomena (the naturalist and the journalist), then, 50 I think the most useful short account of the general phenomenon of cognitive dissonance and cognitive balancing is in Milton Rosenberg and others, Attitude Organization and Change, New Haven: Yale University Press, 1960, pp. 112-163. 51 A General View of Positivism, passim. 52 Social Theory and Social Structure, pp. 574- 575.

When this latter phase is successful, control is more feasible and social policy is likely to be more adequate to the situation. In the knowledgeable society, the intellectual em- phasis is more likely to be upon laws of behavior, change, and control. Attaching metrics to phenomena often improves our understanding and our control. The knowl- edgeable society increasingly employs math- ematical modes of expression and thought. The contribution of the philosophy of science. We have been discussing the complex of attitudes and skills which equip men to deal realistically with the events which im- pinge upon their lives-policy-formation at the micro-level. This is related to but sepa- rate from the ways of thinking of scientists and philosophers who are interested in social policy. This history of social thought reveals the importance of analogical thinking: If geometry yields results from axiomatic methods, so should sociology; in an age of mechanics the model may be clockworks or hydraulics to some (cf. Freud); organismic theories dominate certain periods: a primi- tive set of anatomical analogies seems to have been prevalent in the Middle Ages.57 It seems to me that the emergence of a coherent philosophy of science or logic of inquiry represents a crucial change in this groping toward a method of studying society, particularly as it has matured and increased the scope given to imagination. If one goes back no further than the beginning of this century, with the rise of analytic philosophy in Austria (the Vienna Circle) and in Eng- land, the development of the "unified sci- ence" group at Chicago, perhaps the general systems theorists, and the widespread teach- ing of the philosophy of science today, a change in intellectual posture toward man and society so great as to represent a water- shed is evident. Other knowledgeable so- cieties, marked by Kroeber's "bursts" of culture growth, have not sustained their performance. I believe the development and widespread acceptance of the philosophy of science as a basis for social inquiry repre- sents a "take-off" phenomenon in social science, promising sustained growth in social interpretation. PROFESSIONALISM AND THE "PRE-FORMULA- TION" OF POLICY The discussion so far has sought to illuminate the development of the knowl- edgeable society, and to show its character- istic thoughtways. Now we turn to the application of this knowledge to public policy. The people who make this applica- tion are, in the first instance the profes- sionals, organized in their own associations, governing and staffing institutions devised to develop and teach the new knowledge and apply it to current problems. Within the professions there are tendencies to allocate responsibility for knowledge domains and hence responsibilities for working out "solu- tions" of social problems relevant to these domains. One aspect of professionalization is the establishment of standards of per- formance well above actual performance. The gap between the actual and the idea creates within the profession a kind of strain towards remedial action. The consciousness of meeting or failing to meet standards enlists profes- sional ambition, reputation, credit and blame. Staff conferences, annual meetings, and new research studies set up strains for better per- formance, better instruments, better laws, and new agencies to meet the new standards. In the knowledgeable society, much policy is made first through professional intercourse, concerning what solutions to press upon the government and what men to advance to positions of influence as well as what standards to impose. In some ways this is only a change of venue for political maneu- vering, but in an important sense it implies a change in criteria for decision-makers from immediate political advantage to something within the professionalized domain of knowl- edge. KNOWLEDGE IS ENCROACHING ON POLITICS If one thinks of a domain of "pure politics" where decisions are determined by 57 Karl Deutsch has an interesting discussion of these analogies in his The Nerves of Government, New York: Free Press, 1963, pp. 24-38; The ana- tomical metaphor in medieval political thought is most explicit in Otto Gierke, Political Theories of the Middle Ages, trans. by F. W. Maitland, Boston: Beacon, 1958.</page><page sequence="10">658 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW calculations of influence, power, or electoral advantage, and a domain of "pure knowl- edge" where decisions are determined by calculations of how to implement agreed- upon values with rationality and efficiency, it appears to me that the political domain is shrinking and the knowledge domain is growing, in terms of criteria for decisions, kinds of counsel sought, evidence adduced, and nature of the "rationality" employed. Some of the evidence for this direction of change may be suggested in the following sampling of recent events: (a) With due allowance for political slip- page, there has been a gradual expansion of the civil service based on competitive exam- inations from 23 per cent of personnel employed in the executive branch of the Federal government in 1891, to 87 per cent in 1962. (b) The General Accounting Office, estab- lished in 1921, and the General Service Ad- ministration, established in 1949, supervise government business operations so as to encourage economic rather than political criteria. (c) The Council of Economic Advisers was set up in 1946, symbolizing the intro- duction of economic criteria into the mone- tary and fiscal operations of government. (d) The professionalization of the attack on poverty is illustrated by the contrast be- tween the methods and programs of the Works Progress Administration (1933) and the Office of Economic Opportunity (1965). (e) The growing use of extra-govern- mental organizations, like Rand and the university research centers, to study social and technical problems and formulate policy proposals, introduces a variety of less polit- ical (if not value-free) criteria for policy- making. (f) Similarly the growing employment of Presidential Commissions and Committees and White House Conferences changes the nature of the criteria employed in policy- making. (g) An enlarged governmental appara- tus has been created to enlist scientific advice on a variety of topics (not just what is coming to be called the management of "science affairs"), as seen in the President's Scientific Advisory Committee and the Office of Science and Technology, and even the Office of Science Adviser to the Secretary of State.58 Moreover, the dominant scholarly inter- pretation of policy-making processes has changed in the direction of emphasizing the greater autonomy of political leaders and legislators: with respect to the role of pressure groups,59 the power elite,60 and the electorate.6' If leaders and other legislators are less bound by the domain of pure politics than we had thought. Then they are freer to be guided by the promptings of scientists and findings from the domain of knowledge. Studies of the legislative process reinforce this view. A massive literature documents four relevant points: (a) the rising influ- ence of the bureaucracy is based in large part on bureaucratic command over the sources of knowledge; (b) state and national legislators respond to the growing import- ance of technical knowledge both with in- creased standards for their own mastery of subject-matter fields and with demands for greater staff resources to help them meet the challenge; (c) there is an increased reliance on the kind of professional help enlisted by the executive; and (d) the power of the lobby is less likely to be based on electoral sanctions than upon specialized information helpful (however self-inter- ested) in formulating policy change.62 58 Much of this is reported and commented upon in Gilpin and Wright, Scientists and National Po- licy Making. Here (on page 109) one will find Wallace Sayre making the point that "politics is inescapable." Nothing in this section should be read as implying anything contrary to this maxim. 59 E. E.

But, if political criteria decline in importance relative to more uni- versalistic scientific criteria, and if the professional problem-oriented scientists rather than laymen come to have more to say about social policy, the shift in per- spective is likely to occasion some differ- ences in policy itself. What would these be? In the first place there is the question of the very consciousness of a problem. The man in the middle of the problem (sickness, poverty, waste and especially ignorance) often does not know there is anything problematic about his state. He may accept his condition as embodying the costs of living: if one accepts his lot in life, one accepts lesions, hunger, overwork and un- employment. For this reason such people are often hard to reach. As Harrington says, "First and foremost, any attempt to abolish poverty in the United States must seek to destroy the pessimism and fatalism that flourish in the other America," the America of the poor.63 Often it takes years of dedi- cated agitation to make people aware that they live in the midst of a problem. The curious thing about modern times is the de- gree to which government itself undertakes to do what, in the past, has so often been the task of the agitator. The New Deal helped to organize labor, and the New Frontier and the Great Society help Negroes to demand more of society, and help organize the poor to pursue their own interests. Admittedly there are political benefits in these acts, and they can be attributed only in minor part to the growing insights into the nature of poverty and apathy. Yet con- sciousness of a problem may come first to the authorities, scientific and governmental. People may have to be told, not that they are miserable, but that the conditions of their lives are, in some sense, remediable. Beyond consciousness is something else, the analysis of the nature of the trouble: its causes, and what should be done about it. Here the main point is the environmental- ism of the authoritative scientific or govern- mental view, in contrast to the personalism of the man involved. The problem as it pre- sents itself to these two attentive persons is in each case different. For the unemployed worker, his problem is to find a job; for the economist, the problem is to analyze the causes of unemployment and sometimes to suggest remedial action. To the worker the "cause"7 of his plight is that he was let go; to the economist, the cause of the worker's plight may be insufficiency of demand due to higher interest rates and a budgetary sur- plus. What is cause to the worker is to the economist only a symptom, so different are their perspectives. The view of a problem by scientific or governmental authorities is very often an analysis of the environment in which it oc- curs; the causes for the scientist are the factors which make the "problem" for the individual. In consequence, the political de- mands of the affected group and the demands of the professionals interested in the group's condition, may lead in different directions. For people within a system (hospital, market, watershed, communication network), the boundaries and budgets seem fixed; they bargain for limited resources and more for them seems necessarily to imply less for someone else. An authoritative overview can change that perspective by introducing the possibility not of reallocating limited values but of generating an increase in values. Thus an economist today considers the problems of equity and efficiency in distribution in conjunction with the problem of growth. For the medical sociologist, the problem of the distribution of hospital facilities is paired with the problem of more and better facilities and better health; he is unsatisfied simply with a redistribution of untreated illness in a more equitable fashion. Political scientists have failed to understand this point, because their attention to "the authoritative alloca- tion of values" has tended to obscure another facet of government: the generation of values.

Since knowledge and ideology serve somewhat as functional equivalents in ori- enting a person toward the problems he must face and the policies he must select, the growth of the domain of knowledge causes it to impinge on the domain of ideology. Silvan Tomkins has developed a theory of a basic ideological left-right dimension in virtually all domains of life, turning on the questions, "Is man the measure, an end in himself, an active, creative, thinking, desir- ing, loving, force in nature? Or must man realize himself, attain his full stature only through struggle toward, participation in, conformity to, a norm, a measure, an ideal essence basically independent of man." 65 He believes that arguments along these lines develop in passionate forms (in philos- ophy, mathematics, jurisprudence, etc., as well as in politics) wherever men are least certain of their ground. These arguments thrive on uncertainty and ignorance. "When the same ideas [that men have been arguing over in these ideological terms] are firmly established and incorporated into the fabric of a science or tested and found wanting, they cease to constitute an ideology in the sense in which we are using the term. At the growing edge of the frontier of all sciences there necessarily is a maximum of uncer- tainty, and what is lacking in evidence is filled by passion and faith and by hatred and scorn for the disbelievers. Science will never be free of ideology, though yesterday's ideology is today's fact or fiction." 66 The theory, then, is of an "ideo-affective" orienta- tion toward the world directed towards sub- jects about which there is doubt. If the doubt is clarified by knowledge, this ideologi- cal orientation moves on to some other marginal and uncertain area. Increasing knowledge about man, nature, and society can be said to reduce the target area for ideological thinking. A second way in which the characteristics of a knowledgeable society may be thought to reduce ideological thinking, is through the reduction of dogmatic thinking. Follow- ing Rokeach, we may conceive of dogmatic thinking as a selection and interpretation of information so as to reinforce a previously established creed, dogma, or political ideol- ogy. Information is used, not so much to understand the world as it really is, but as a means of defending against conflict and uncertainty.67 The knowledgeable society is marked by a relatively greater stress on the use of information veridically, relying on its truth value and not on any adventitious defense, popularity, or reinforcement value. This should be associated with a decline in dogmatic thinking. The decline of dogmatism implies the decline of ideology, in the nar- rower sense of the term used here. In the third place, consider the way in which knowledge may limit Mannheim's thesis that political thinking is inevitably biased. He says "all knowledge which is either political or which involves a world view is inevitably partisan"; and later "at the point where what is properly political begins, the evaluative element cannot easily be sepa- rated out," and still later, "the peculiar na- ture of political knowledge, as contrasted to the 'exact' sciences, arises out of the insepara- bility, in this realm, of knowledge from interest and motivation." 68 Mannheim has in view only the thinking of those who are themselves engaged in political strife; he does not envisage the possibility of such studies as The Legislative System and The American Voter,69 which, although evalua- 64 See my Political Ideology, pp. 13-16; also foot- note 10 above. Of course there are many definitions of ideology referring to a wider range of "mental products." 65 "Left and Right: A Basic Dimension of Ideology and Personality," in Robert W. White, ed., The Study of Lives, New York: Atherton, 1963, pp. 391-392. 66Ibid., p. 389. 67 See Footnote 49 above. 68 "The Prospects of Scientific Politics," in Ide- ology and Utopia, pp. 132, 168, 170. 69Angus Campbell, Philip E.

Granting that interested parties form their ideas about politics into ideologi- cal constructs it seems likely that knowledge may constrict the scope of their ideology. This narrowing effect was, in fact, experi- enced by the participants at the conference of the Congress for Cultural Freedom in Milan in 1955 out of which the theme of "the end of ideology" developed. These schol- ars and scientists came expecting, indeed inviting, a great confrontation of world views. Under the pressure of economic and social knowledge, a growing body of research, and the codified experience of society, ideological argument tended to give way to technical argument, apparently to the disappointment of some.70 The debate remained evaluative and partisan, but the domain of ideology was shrunken by the dominance of knowledge. KNOWLEDGE AS DISEQUILIBRIUM What happens when the scientific appa- ratus of the knowledgeable society produces some important findings: existential, causal, remedial, or whatever? Here are some ex- amples from the social sciences: Among the nations of the world, the United States ranked 16th in rate of infant mortality in 1961.71 "To raise every individual and family in the nation now below a subsistence income to the subsistence level would cost about $10 billion a year. This is less than 2 per cent of the gross national product. It is less than 10 per cent of tax revenues. It is about one-fifth of the cost of national defense." 72 "The reinforcing experience for convicted criminals while in jail results in high rates of recidivism: about three-fourths of those enter- ing jail have been there before. And the younger the person at the time of first offense, the higher the rate of recidivism and the sooner it occurs." 73 "Today, more American school children die of cancer than from any other disease. So serious has this situation become that Boston has established the first hospital in the United States devoted exclusively to the treatment of children with cancer. . . . One of the earliest pesticides associated with cancer is arsenic.... In the United States the arsenic-drenched soils of tobacco plantations, of many orchards in the Northwest, and of blueberry lands in the East easily lead to pollution of water sup- plies." 74 "The more an individual engages in personal interaction with persons of different race, religious, or national background, the lower is his general level of prejudice. This result holds not only for majority group prejudices but also for minority prejudices against the majority group and other minorities. It is true of youths as well as their elders. It has been confirmed in 14 different samples, involving about 6000 persons." 75 Such knowledge-discovered, organized, and communicated by professional men- creates a pressure for policy change with a force all its own. Knowledge (and what is regarded as knowledge) is pressure even without pressure groups, and without refer- ence to an articulated forensic ideology. If the reader of these statements experiences some kind of policy-oriented speculation, so, I believe, do policy-making officials. The source of the tension is not difficult to dis- cover. In skeleton form, the sequence may be as follows: (a) A state of affairs is presented, con- veying new or more precise information than that previously known (infants and children are dying at a "high" rate; poverty could be eliminated). (b) A value is engaged (early death is bad; poverty is worse than prosperity). (c) In some cases the information applies to particular groups whose needs and values are especially significant to an observer (Northwest apple growers, Southern Negroes and Whites, delinquent youth). (d) Remedial action may be suggested (subsidies to the poor, policing of pesticides, enforced integration). (e) Social, economic, and political costs are implied (taxation for subsidies to the poor, expensive re-education for prisoners, the opposition of tobacco growers). 70See footnote 10 above. 71 United Nations Statistical Yearbook, 1962, New York: United Nations, 1963, p. 50. 72 James N.

Is poverty "neces- sary"? Is human nature a constant?). (g) Certain ideological postures toward the business of government are enlisted (Is every increment of government a bad policy in itself? Is government too corrupt an in- strument to employ in changing conditions? Are tax dollars better spent by private organ- izations and individuals?). Let us suppose, as seems likely, that knowledge like that presented above sets up a kind of "disequilibrium" in a person's mind. The restoration of equilibrium, then, is the problem-solving process, perhaps by questioning the data or the source, perhaps by changing one's own priorities of action, perhaps by selective inattention, perhaps by delegation (real or symbolic), perhaps by purely expressive as opposed to instrumental behavior, perhaps by rationalization, perhaps by scapegoating, perhaps by advocating simplistic solutions, and so forth.76 But the 76 Dan Berlyne's Structure and Direction in Thinking illuminates the processes of "problem- aticity" and problem-solving, especially pp. 236- 293. point is that knowledge, with little more, often sets up a disequilibrium or pressure which requires compensating thought or ac- tion. SUMMARY In this article I have tried, first, to develop the idea of a knowledgeable society, with special attention to questions of growth and epistemology. Then, assuming that the con- cept applies to modern American society, I have suggested that the professionals and their associations have a role in the preformu- lation of policy, not all good, but generally responsive to the needs of society. Further, in comparing two "pure" domains, that of politics and that of knowledge, I have sug- gested that the criteria and scope of politics are shrinking while those of knowledge are growing. This has created a difference in perspectives of policy-makers: a different kind of consciousness, an environmentalist approach, and a concept of the generation of values. Like politics, ideology is declining as a necessary ingredient in change, partly be- cause, given present values, knowledge sets up a powerful kind of attitudinal disequili- brium all its own.</page></plain_text>
