<plain_text><page sequence="1">Surrealism Revisited: The Poetry of Dolores Etchecopar Melanie Nicholson Bard College Anna Balakian has argued that after the relative demise of the surrealist movement in Europe surrealism as a literary aesthetic found in Latin America a fertile ground in which to thrive (7). In Argentina, the viability of surrealism as a poetic orientation has survived through successive generations of writers, from Aldo Pellegrini in the 1920s and 1930s, through poets ofthe "Generacion del 40" such as Enrique Molina, Francisco Madariaga, and Olga Orozco, and even into the 1960s and 1970s (though in a more complicated guise) with Alejandra Pizarnik, Raul Gustavo Aguirre, Victor Redondo, and others. The paper will trace an even more belated incarnation of surrealism in contemporary Argentine poet and painter Dolores Etchecopar (b. 1954). I am interested in examining the ways in which this belated surrealism both follows and strays from the foundational notions set forth by Andre Breton and others in Europe in the 1920s. In particular, I will show that Etchecopar's relationship to language and her construction of the female subject reflect a problematized surrealist aesthetic. What is surrealism? It is no doubt necessary to distinguish the historical movement, which began definitively with the publication of the first Manifesto of Surrealism in 1924 and effectively ended with the death of Andre Breton in 1966, from the surrealist orientation that has taken hold in the Western world and that continues to broadly influence Melanie Nicholson is an Associate Professor of Spanish and Latin American Literature at Bard College in New York.

In historical terms, surrealism, coming close on the heels of Dada, was a direct response to what writers, artists, and intellectuals saw as the total corruption of the spirit in early twentieth-century Europe. Some response to the worn-out formulas of late romanticism might have been expected under any historical circumstances, but the rebellion against tired aesthetic practices took on a much deeper significance when World War I shook Europe to the core. The war, in short, caused many Europeans to doubt the very viability of that trophy of Enlightenment known as rational thought. Similarly, the optimistic promises of nineteenth-century positivism gave way to a total collapse of faith in human, social and political enterprises. In place of rationalism and human progress, the surrealists proposed total freedom of thought and action and a new reign of the imagination. In place of the real they proposed the surreal: that area of mental activity and artistic practice in which dream and waking states, conscious and unconscious, would merge, opening up entirely new possibilities of human perception.1 In Argentina, literary historians agree that surrealism has been a potent force in successive generations of poets, but the poets themselves are quick to point out their distance from the historical movement, and in particular, from the technique of automatic writing that was the cornerstone of Breton's early theorizing.2 What has remained, in poets we might term post-surrealist, is the spirit of rebellion against ordinary discursive language. This rebellion manifests itself most notably in an allegiance to a particular kind of poetic image. In the first Manifesto, Breton uses adjectives such as "gratuitous," "arbitrary," "strange," and "absurd" to characterize the surrealist image. In complete opposition to the image that imitates or seeks to represent reality, the surrealist image alludes to nothing seen, heard, or touched before. I believe it is important to stress here that "belated" poets such as Etchecopar have not simply adopted a method or a technique whose end is to shock or disturb the reader. The spirit of the surrealist rebellion against rational thought, against language whose sole purpose is to communicate—in short, against what Breton called "lucidity"—is still alive in late-twentieth century poetry. Historical circumstances may have changed, but the conviction remains that reason's grip on the human mind must be loosened in order to make way for a more "authentic" existence. Beyond their initial spirit of destruction, surrealist poets and artists sought optimistically to uncover the marvelous. If poets in the final decades of the twentieth century took up early</page><page sequence="3">96 Letras Femeninas, Volumen XXX, No. 2 (diciembre 2004) surrealism's "image-work," I believe it is because they found in surrealist thought a reflection of their own restless response to the world.3 A cursory reading of Dolores Etchecopar's poetry turns up images that are immediately identifiable as surrealist. When we read "En su tobillo gira un rio de plumas negras...En su cadera de oxigeno la luz hunde una rodilla negra," we recognize immediately a scene that cannot be properly visualized, a series of relationships between objects that have no logical explanation (Notas salvajes 76).4 Even the objects themselves—"cadera de oxigeno"—defy placement on any rational plane. My purpose in this essay is not simply to catalogue these images, but to identify two strains of surrealist thought that emerge from an accumulation of such images. The first is the desire for a return to origins; the second, closely related concern, is that of language and its counterpart, silence. In Etchecopar's work, as in the best works of the surrealist tradition, the poetic image—with its elements of linguistic surprise, logical absurdity, and seeming arbitrariness—holds the potential for illuminating a reality not accessible by the methods of discursive reason. In the spirit of her Argentine predecessors Olga Orozco and Alejandra Pizarnik, Etchecopar examines poetic language as a means of returning to a pre-logical state of being, a "viaje al origen" which, like psychoanalysis, is meant to elucidate the situation of the contemporary subject (in many poems, the female subject in particular). I will argue that Etchecopar's concern with origins is ultimately a concern with language, with human speech and its failures. Her poems return almost obsessively to the metonymic terms boca, voz, and palabra. She maintains a dramatic tension between communication and its antitheses: noise, babbling, howling, and especially, silence. In this paper I will examine the surrealist image in Etchecopar's work, paying particular attention to the unresolved contradictions of language that inform this body of poetry.5 In true surrealist fashion, Etchecopar's work is largely hermetic: it is difficult or impossible to say what most of her poetic utterances mean, though the force of accumulated images or allusions may allow the reader to extract a tone, an emotion, a tenuous direction of thought. In the tradition of the neo-romantics of Argentina's "Generacion del 40," Etchecopar builds her lexicon largely upon archetypal terms such as noche, luz, and fiera. Her poetry, in which historical referents are lacking or heavily masked, suspends time and creates a legendary or mythological space. All of this is reflective of the philosophy in which her poetry is grounded, that is, the surrealist notion that the creative act must release</page><page sequence="4">Nicholson 97 thought from its state of "thralldom" to rationality, must "steer it back onto the path of total comprehension, return it to its original purity" (Manifestoes 124). The surrealists, whose primary adherents were steeped in various currents of the esoteric tradition, posited a primordial, even pre-human state of being whose recovery would hold great psychic value for modern existence. One of the literary sources for this myth of origins, and in particular for the association between human and beast, was Isidore Ducasse, the self-styled Comte de Lautreamont. As Wallace Fowlie observes, "The hero Maldoror, who is in many respects the outstanding surrealist hero, is conceived of as a man still very close to his memory of animals, still very close to the time when he himself participated in an animal existence" (34). Though in quite distinct fashion, Etchecopar's poetry also reveals a human consciousness in which the animal presence looms large, a presence effectively evoked in the image of "un bufalo en la sombra del pensamiento" (Cancion del precipicio 14). In the pages of Notas salvajes (1989), whose very title connects writing (or music) with an uncivilized existence, we find references to horses, rats, bulls, mules, birds, fish, pigs, cows, and toads, as well as more generalized allusions to animales, bestias or fieras. The second poem of the collection, "Genesis" consists of a scant two lines in which animal existence is quietly exalted: el desembarco de los ninos y de las fieras no desfiguro el agua timida del universo (Notas 11) This poem, a clear allusion to the biblical story of the ark, allows a place in the newly-formed universe to both children and beasts, whose presence is seen as peaceable and innocuous. The poem "Advenimiento de los animales" reveals a more complex approach to the human-animal dynamic. The first stanza reads: estoy aqui como la cabeza de aquel muerto la manana recorre con un vidrio mi vieja mascara de toro quiero acordarme quiero escuchar los preparativos del universo la primera vez de los caballos la primera vez del silencio (Notas 15)</page><page sequence="5">98 Letras Femeninas, Volumen XXX, No. 2 (diciembre 2004) The lyric speaker announces her presence in the here-and-now— "estoy aqui"—but immediately evokes through simile both death and the fragmentation of the body. She wears the mask of a bull, a creature associated with violent, primal energies and also with the beginnings of human artistic expression. The mask is old, reminding us that the human beast association is an ancient one. The final four lines of the stanza state with relative clarity the speaker's desire to return to the time of origins, to listen to the universe as it comes into being, to experience for the first time both animal life (caballos) and silence. The poem continues: tengo el tacto embrujado sobre el sollozo y la tinaja que dejo la luz entre mis ropas (no lo digo con el lenguaje sino con el presagio y las mulas y la orfandad de los patios) arrastro la humedad brillante de las fornicaciones Here the speaker declares her possessions, but the declaration is not made, as we would expect it, with ordinary language, but rather with omens, mules, and abandoned patios. It may be helpful at this juncture to recall J. H. Matthews' observation that, "Where animism is a feature of the surrealist image, its function is not like that of literary anthropomorphism, to enliven the picture by means of figurative language. Instead, it introduces a dislocative factor for which there is no accounting on the level of rationality" (9). Though the elements in Etchecopar's poem seem unconnected, they share a common trait: omens, mules, and empty patios all point to an absence of humans or human logic. Underlying these images is the surrealist conviction that discursive, communicative language is inadequate or false, and that more authentic thought can be accessed and conveyed through intuition or brute instinct.6 The final image, that of the "humedad brillante/de las fornicaciones," reinforces the poem's insistence on animality. The poem's third stanza opens with the line "hablo con mi parte extinta," which serves to reaffirm, in the first person, the orientation toward a primordial imaginary. The fourth and final stanza once again opposes human language to a prelinguistic state:</page><page sequence="6">Nicholson 99 chatarra palabras contrahechas destruyeron un sonido del bosque hay sangre en el silencio cuando hablo solo me obedecen los animales del fin del mundo {Notas 16) The speaker's indictment of words, which are seen as deformed or counterfeit, is total: words are responsible for destroying what is taken to be the purer sound of the forest. She is left unable to communicate her desires to anyone other than animals, who, by being present both at the beginning and the end of the world, represent both origin and apocalypse. Etchecopar's use of animal images takes on an almost obsessive quality with the image of the horse, whose incarnations are richly varied and difficult to categorize. Like the surrealist painter Leonora Carrington, Etchecopar chooses the horse as her "personal totem."7 Cirlot's Dictionary of Symbols tells us that horse symbolism is complex, but that it often represents the cyclic movement of the phenomenal world: "...hence the horses, which Neptune with his trident lashes up out of the waves, symbolize the cosmic forces that surge out of the Akasha—the blind forces of primigenial chaos" (152). By extension, in psychological terms, the horse represents intense desires or instincts. Thus, the horse in Etchecopar's work may evoke a shadowy, unconscious existence: "mi caballo galopa en la sombra" (Notas 57), or it may take on dynamic Dionysian qualities, as in the image of "los zapatos rojos y el pelo alcoholico / de mi caballo en la fiesta del alba" (Notas 25). In the brief poem "Epifania," the colt appears as a sort of salvation, bringing wild energy where there was stagnation: cuando parece imposible un potrillo rapidisimo subleva mi tambor huerfano (Notas 51) Yet Etchecopar's use of symbolism is idiosyncratic and personal as often as it is conventional. In addition to being a force of untamed instinct, the horse is often a locus of suffering, as in the lines "yo recurro a mi potro / que camina y sufre" (Canciones del precipicio 47), or a victim: "pronto</page><page sequence="7">100 Letras Femeninas, Volumen XXX, No. 2 (diciembre 2004) ejecutaran al caballo" (Canciones 15). The double innocence of children and horses is evoked in the last lines of "El pozo": ...ese nino nunca sabra por que afuera de la luna golpean a un viejo caballo (Notas 79-80) In this poem, the moon's light seems to represent a magical space in which the animal is protected; outside this space, to the bewilderment of the child, the horse is abused. Given these precedents, it is perhaps not surprising that Etchecopar would assign human qualities to the horse that imply a disturbing role reversal. The opening lines of "Foto movida" depict a troubled paradise ("oh brisa se desalma el bosque"); among the noises of the darkness are heard "gritos de caballos dotados/de una gran misericordia" (Notas 43). We have seen several examples in which the horse represents not wild, instinctive desire, but rather victimization, implicitly at the hands of humans. In this poem the horses, although crying out as if in pain, are endowed with compassion. In sum, Etchecopar configures the horse as both the "blind force of primigenial chaos," and as a transcendent being, capable of more humanity than humans themselves. Why does Etchecopar explore and often exalt in unexpected ways the world of children and beasts? Like many surrealists writers and artists, she portrays a self that is alienated from the adult world, from the world of time and the intellect: En mi cuerpo no encontre los pies ruidosos de la Historia. Cuando mi casa ardio adentro con sus palmeras y su sapo. No encontre a las Ideas. Cuando algo oscuro vocifera, quiero que estes sobre mi entendiendo a los astros que me poseen hasta que una paloma se desprende de mi nuca. Mi cuerpo en la violenta oscuridad te llama. Te mostrare a las pocas bestias multicolores que jalonan el agua altisima de las piernas. (Notas 81) In this prose poem, "La sillita," the speaker makes an explicit connection between the search for origins and the role of language.8 In the passage just cited, she places herself in the role of medium or oracle, in what appears to be a painful process akin to exorcism. As the poem proceeds,</page><page sequence="8">Nicholson 101 death is visited upon the innocent, leaving the speaker confused and vulnerable: Entonces la muerte volvio a instalarse en la sillita de las munecas. Nunca supe. Palmera furiosa de la luz, hablame. Aurora minada, hablame. Toro quieto del fin de los relatos, hablame. No se refugiarme. En medio de las arenas y de los afiches. Nunca supe. Palabras encapuchadas, lentamente extraidas del bosque para irradiar el resplandor de la desgracia, acompanenme. (Notas 81 -82) The poem concludes as a plea or a prayer, directed at words themselves. The words—which we may presume to constitute not ordinary communicative discourse but rather poetry—have their origins in the forest, site of primordial life. The image of "palabras encapuchadas" alludes to the hooded, i.e. hermetic, nature of the kind of words the speaker desires for her companions. Like precious metals, they are extracted from the forest, but their radiant gleam is ironically that of misfortune. In his book The History of Surrealism, Maurice Nadeau speaks of the "profound despair" that animated the surrealists, "a despair analogous to that of Rimbaud, who posited everything here on earth in order to recreate an animal life, an aggressive pessimism like that of Lautreamont..." (221). Etchecopar's work seems to embody, if not an aggressive pessimism, at least a profound despair that is, in contrast to the first generation of surrealists, more personal than collective. God is nonexistent or inaccessible (the title of the poem that follows in Notas salvajes is "Dios cerrado"), and poetry provides a questionable refuge for the desolate. If the horse is an obsessive motif in Etchecopar's poetry, language is an obsessive theme, multifarious in its presentation. One of the constants of surrealist thought is the dialectical movement between opposites that may achieve resolution, though only momentarily, in synthesis. For Etchecopar, the fundamental, irresolvable polarity is that of human language and its antitheses. Her conflictive, often negative relationship to language—ironically, the very tool of her craft—is one of the features that distinguishes her work from that of the original surrealists and places her in the company of later generations. Breton wrote in 1924 that poetry "bears within itself the perfect compensation for the miseries we endure" (Manifestoes 18). Though the surrealists revolted against conventional language, their faith in the language of the imagination was almost infinite. Like Pizarnik in her later work, Etchecopar finds her faith in the magical powers of language shaken at every step; in fact, language itself becomes</page><page sequence="9">102 Letras Femeninas, Volumen XXX, No. 2 (diciembre 2004) one of the miseries she endures. The dialectic is ceaseless. A clear desire for transcendence by means of language may surface in one moment: "por que no me dirige el sol/la epifania la lenta palabra/que une los silencios de mi cuerpo" (Cancion 52); in another moment, disenchantment with or even disgust at language predominates: "la boca se pudre" (Notas 97); "al final de mi alfabeto esta todo oscuro" (Cancion 50). As we saw in the prose poem "La sillita," language and the fascination with primordial or nonhuman existence are intertwined. In certain poems, the subject's desire to master the expression of animals is explicit: "nadie supo por que [ella] quiso esa noche tan fria/cantar en el coro de los perros" 0Cancion 9). In "La edad del bosque," the ritual of family dinner is transposed to a prelinguistic scene: "...nos sentamos a la mesa/para recibir nuestra parte/de silencio o de aullido" (Notas 13).9 The prose poem "Julio es un mes oscuro" takes this association to a more profound level, playing out the element of silence, rather than howling, as the dialectical opposite of speech: ...Huyeron animales de mi voz; me cosieron una boca nueva: la boca que habla. Ahora puedo decir: hace frio en la casa de las Personas; hubo una region de tambores hechizados en mi lengua; hubo una region de alegria y el toro que me habia sido enviado por la respiration solo para conocer tu cuerpo. (Notas 63) In this passage, the speaker's ability to speak is not natural; she is endowed with it only by an ironic reversal—the sewing of the mouth—and only after her instinctive self (animales) has fled. The second sentence emphasizes the loss with the preterite "hubo," enumerating desirous possessions or qualities associated with a prelinguistic state: drums, enchantment, joy, and the bestial (i.e., sexual) vitality of the bull. Significantly, what she is able to say when she achieves human speech is the simple but loaded statement: "it is cold in the house of the Humans." In a rhetorical question reminiscent of Olga Orozco, the speaker expresses her frustration at the closed nature of language: "^Y quien me explica desde mi otra vida como se abren las palabras para que tu puedas entrar? Desapacible palabra; se pudre en el viento de las trincheras." The word, in a state of decomposition, is undesirable. The poem closes with the following enigmatic statement: "Las mujeres se acuestan en amplias salas para que alguien las abra y extraiga el silencio del mundo" (63). Artists of the historical surrealist movement have been broadly criticized for their depiction of "Woman" as primarily a male object of</page><page sequence="10">Nicholson 103 desire. In many surrealist paintings, the passive, often nude figure of the woman is seen performing erotic acts (consider Salvador Dali's "The Great Masturbator") or as standing or reclining, eyes downcast, perpetually ready to be gazed upon.10 Etchecopar's closing line in "Julio es un mes oscuro" (whose title echoes T.S. Eliot's famous "April is the Cruelest Month") raises disturbing questions related to the depiction of the female body. The image of women reclining in spacious rooms suggests a brothel. Their action has a purpose: they lie down so that "someone" can open them—clearly a sexual allusion—and "extract the silence of the world." Suddenly the image is more surgical than sexual. In either case, their bodies are passively being operated upon; something is being pulled from them. The idea that women are the repositories of silence (which foreign hands need to extract) would seem to perpetuate the patriarchal, even Lacanian notion that women do not fully participate in the symbolic order. And yet I hesitate to see Etchecopar's poetry, in which the female figure predominates and appears in multiple guises, as justifying such a reading. I believe the key lies in her notion of silence, to which she often assigns, as we shall subsequently see, a positive poetic value. The title poem from the collection Not as salvajes (39-41) explores the speech/silence polarity by interweaving it with others: birth (or pregnancy) vs. death (or decomposition), light vs. darkness, mobility vs. immobility. The poem begins with a sort of prophetic invocation: si tu lengua apoya las cacerias del silencio sobre mi lengua hablare The speaker enlists the aid of an unidentified other to help her uphold the "hunt for silence" [or "silence's hunt"] over her own tongue. Here, silence is an entity to be overcome in order for speech to occur: this is the basic dynamic of prophecy. But the function of both elements of this dichotomy grow more complex as the poem continues: montana oscura madre clavada en la nieve madre clavada en el angelus de la caverna en la vidriera en la rueca de los cuentos en la tonada de mi tonada puesta al reves que no puedo sacarme sin muerte</page><page sequence="11">104 Letras Femeninas, Volumen XXX, No. 2 (diciembre 2004) Like "Julio es un mes oscuro," this poem depicts an immobilized female figure—a maternal figure, in this case. As Mary Ann Caws reminds us in The Poetry ofDada and Surrealism, "surrealist mobility includes even a paradoxical immobility..." (27). The sites at which the mother in this poem finds herself fixed (or transfixed) are archetypal, religious, legendary. It is significant that one of these "sites" is the angelus, a prayer that celebrates the Incarnation, the word made flesh, which is a transformation in Christian terms involving the body of a virgin. The "rueca" or distaff of the following line makes yet another allusion to the mythology of the female body. As an instrument of spinning, the distaff was one of the attributes of the Greek Parcae, who would spin and then cut the thread of life. By extension, the distaff has come to mean women's work, or the female gender in general. Etchecopar links the distaff specifically to the "spinning" of tales, associated immediately in the poem with the musical "tonada." The speaker declares that she cannot remove the distaff/tune without bringing death upon herself. Although this rapid succession of images and associations confounds any definitive reading, the overall sense is that of the female figure being "nailed" irremediably to language. The lines that follow reinforce the speaker's alienation from words, an alienation that once again implicates the (female) body: palabras lentas de mi cuerpo en otra parte palabras fuertes mis enemigas raspan la noche el sol que me embarazo sumergida campana que cruza los caminos y los huesos The "submerged bell," immediately following the verb "impregnated," suggests an embryo or fetus, an image from which an allusion to language may again be extracted. Cirlot identifies the bell as "a symbol of creative power," its hanging position connecting it with all objects suspended between heaven and earth (24). It must not escape our attention, however, that a submerged bell is one that cannot be heard, just as a child in the womb cannot cry out. The poem continues with a vision in which images of decomposition and death are dynamically juxtaposed to those of fertility and life: antes que el otono fulile a las mariposas estaremos en el fondo de las pudriciones</page><page sequence="12">Nicholson 105 caballo bianco tuberculo que brilla en el regazo y arroja el oro de los muertos sobre el recien nacido el sol su cadera movil y simple pasara frente al lenguaje y hablare The positive tone of these last lines, emphasizing the birth-related elements of sunlight and mobility, and ending with the reiterated prophetic pronouncement "hablare," are followed immediately by images of violence and silence: alguien corta los hilos del bosque y deja los ojos de mi madre en el suelo oscuro puestera del silencio adios dije adios a las palabras The first line of this passage reminds us that, for Etchecopar, the forest symbolizes a desired originary state; to have the threads to the forest cut is to suffer alienation on several levels. It is but a short associative leap from this archetypal image to that of the mother who is violently blinded— a female counterpart to the figure of blind Tiresias. The term "puestera" defines her as a keeper of livestock—a shepherd, in this instance, of silence. The speaker at this point takes a definitive leave of words in a verse that is reiterated several lines later, at the close of the poem: adios dije adios a las palabras la basura decora mi piel como un relampago (Notas 41) This complex poem allows us a number of tentative conclusions. First, female generational ties are reinforced: the speaker refers directly to her mother and indirectly, metaphorically, to pregnancy and childbirth, the latter being balanced against death ("me separo de la muerte / con algo que la luna mece en mi cadera"). The figure of the woman is seen as immobilized and blinded, and the constrictions against which she struggles appear to be related to verbal language. As in much surrealist poetry, this</page><page sequence="13">106 Letras Femeninas, Volumen XXX, No. 2 (diciembre 2004) poem's approach to language is ultimately paradoxical: there is a double desire in the speaker to dismiss words completely and to master them: hablare. The figure of the mother hovers hauntingly in the background, tending her flock of silence. I conclude my discussion of Etchecopar's poetry with a brief examination of the poem "Encantamiento," whose very title refers us to the surrealist belief in the magical properties of language, and to the poet's own fascination with nonrational ways of viewing the world." I cite the poem in its entirety: no es ella pero su pie descalzo se apoya tan lentamente bajo la palmera es su sueno la buscan en el prado sus rastros en la hierba indican que se lleva la parte desconocida de su cuerpo por el silencio ella puede arrastrarse hasta el bosque puede encontrar sus pasos solares su antiguo cuerpo inclinado para hechizar el suelo mucho despues ella no habla sabe las palabras sacrifican el galope que brilla sobre el abismo (Notas 53) The poem opens with a sense of psychic doubling, the real self and the dream self being eerily connected. The female subject travels alone in a presumably uninhabited place; those looking for her find only traces in the grass. As we have seen in other poems, the female body is seen as displaced from itself, or even dismembered: the wanderer is carrying off a part of her own body, which is, significantly, the "unknown" part. The allusion may be sexual, or it may refer more broadly to the body's invisible interior, emblematic of the psychic or emotional inner space. The second half of the poem elucidates the first, and simultaneously reinforces several of the concerns that have surfaced in the poems previously discussed. The unidentified female figure (ella) is able to "drag herself' to the forest—the site par excellence of primordial being,</page><page sequence="14">Nicholson 107 as we have seen. The preposition por in "por el silencio" allows us to read silence as both her means and her path. At this point she is able to discover her "solar steps," a phrase suggesting both the light of the sun and the site of an ancestral home. Even more significantly, she discovers her own ancient body, bent to cast a spell over the ground. The bent body reads doubly as that of an old woman—a magical or wise woman in this case—and that of a prehistoric being akin to an animal. We are then told that with time the woman "no habla sabe." Here, Etchecopar compresses the verbs through parataxis, creating a phrase that diametrically opposes speaking to knowing and giving clear precedence to the latter. We recall that the wanderer had found her way through or by means of (por) silence. As in other poems, instinct or intuition is offered as a more authentic means to true knowledge than that afforded by rational language. The final two lines reinforce this pejorative view of language: "las palabras sacrifican el galope / que brilla sobre el abismo." The symbolic role of the horse or bull reappears in this phrase, which points rather directly to words as the agents responsible for a loss of unrestricted animal energy and dynamism. The animal's gallop, shining over the abyss, suggests the bridging of distant realities so fundamental to surrealist thought. Surrealism's radical insistence on pathways to knowledge through the power of dreams, the unconscious, and the unrestricted flow of thought was an experiment that could not be sustained; thus, literary surrealism as a historical movement had run its course by the advent of the second World War. The spirit of surrealism, however, particularly the revolt against the constraints of rational thought and the ordinary language used to convey it, continued to answer a fundamental need in many artists and writers throughout the twentieth century. Argentina in particular appears to have emerged as the site of a rebirth, or rather a continuous re-imagining, of surrealist approaches to life and to language. Contemporary poets such as Dolores Etchecopar follow surrealist lines of thought in their concern for a myth of origins, manifested in particular in a dissolution of the antinomy between humans and animals, between modern and primordial existence. Etchecopar's work crosses the line from surrealism into post-surrealism, however, in its more pessimistic stance toward the "magical" possibilities of human language. Furthermore, as a woman writer, Etchecopar distances herself from Breton and his coterie by portraying the female figure (though enigmatically, even contradictorily, and never dogmatically) as something other than passive muse or object of erotic desire. The female body in Etchecopar becomes the site of a</page><page sequence="15">108 Letras Femeninas, Volumen XXX, No. 2 (diciembre 2004) sometimes violent struggle between the forces of creation and those of destruction and decomposition. Even more significantly, the female body harbors silence, a force that represents both the failure of language and a potentially transcendent leap beyond language. NOTES 1 Andre Breton's declaration regarding the resolution of these opposing states is found in the Second Manifesto: "Everything tends to make us believe that there exists a certain point of the mind at which life and death, the real and the imagined, past and future, the communicable and the incommunicable, high and low, cease to be perceived as contradictions. Now, search as one may one will never find any other motivating force in the activities of the Surrealists than the hope of finding and fixing this point" (Manifestoes 123-24). 2 It must be noted that Breton's own thought with respect to psychic au tomatism evolved over the years. In the first Manifesto of Surrealism (1924), he provided the following as the very definition of surrealism: "Psychic automa tism in its pure state, by which one proposes to express—verbally, by means of the written word, or in any other manner—the actual functioning of thought. Dictated by thought, in the absence of any control exercised by reason, exempt from any aesthetic or moral concern" (26). By 1935, however, Breton had begun to minimize the importance of this phenomenon to the movement: "Psy chic automatism... has never constituted an end in itself for Surrealism, and to claim the contrary is to show bad faith" (Manifestoes 231). 3 J. H. Matthews coins the term "image-work" in his book The Imagery of Surrealism, 4. 4 In Age of Surrealism, Wallace Fowlie characterizes the surrealist image as "more diaphanous and imponderable than the images of other poets. [The surre alists'] aim is to avoid the danger of using the image to communicate some point...If ordinary language is the communication of what is thinkable with what is thinkable, poetry is the communication of what is thinkable with what is un thinkable" (142-43). 5 Etchecopar has published five volumes of poetry to date: Su voz en la mia (Corregidor, 1982), La tanadera (El Imaginero, 1984), El atavio (El Imaginero, 1985), Notas salvajes (Argonauta, 1989), and Cancion del precipicio (Grupo Editor Latinoamericano, 1994). For the purposes of the present essay I work exclusively with the last two volumes. 6Cirlot explains that, in the mythology of several cultures, horses were "en dowed with certain powers of divination" (152). It is possible that Etchecopar</page><page sequence="16">Nicholson uses the mule in this sense here, creating an unseen connection between "presagio" and "mulas." 7For a brief but lucid discussion of the horse "totem" in Leonora Carrington's work, see Colvile, "Beauty and/Is the Beast: Animal Symbology in the Work of Leonora Carrington, Remedios Varo and Leonor Fini," Surrealism and Women 162-170. 8 Breton had laid the ground for the association of language with a search for origins in the first Manifesto: "It was a question of going back to the sources of poetic imagination and, what is more, or remaining there" (Manifestoes 18). 9 The association between the civilized communal meal and animal nature in this poem recalls the famous surrealist object "Dejeuner en fourrure" by Meret Oppenheim, which features a fur-lined teacup, saucer, and spoon. 10 The "prototype" of this image of the surrealist female muse is Rene Magritte's painting "Je ne vois pas la [femme] cachee dans la foret," published in La Revolution surrealiste in 1929, in which the figure of a female nude, face turned aside, is surrounded by the photographs of sixteen male surrealists, all with eyes closed. The figure of the woman stands in place of the word femme in the hand-scripted sentence that frames her. 11 Mary Ann Caws summarizes this orientation toward language as follows: "As much as anything else, Dada and surrealism are experiments with and in vestigations of language ...[T]here is evident a connecting thread or conducting wire ... an almost superstitious faith in language as a magic incantation, effec tive out of all proportion to its intelligible content" [emphasis in original] (20).
