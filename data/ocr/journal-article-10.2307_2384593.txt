<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sexy Rice Plant Gender, Farm Manuals, and Grass-Roots Nativism by JENNIFER ROBERTSON T | HE title 'Sexy Rice' is a playful reference to the popular practice among farmers in the Edo period of categorizing rice and other flora by gender. Any given plant was identified as either female or male.' Moreover, the 'female' of a species was deemed superior in every respect to the 'male'. The cultivation of either 'female' seeds or seeds from 'female' plants allegedly insured high-quality crops and yielded bumper harvests. The inclusion of plant-gender discourses in many of the leading nisho by (farm manuals) of the time bespeaks the considerable attention given to the practice of gender-based crop categorization. Nisho is the generic term for books, tracts, diaries, prose-poems, chronicles, memoranda, and catalogues dealing with agricultural and rural affairs. There was a great deal of variation in the actual prose style and format of farm manuals. Nisho aimed at the ordinary farmer were usually written, often by educated farmers, utilizing a simple vocabulary. Some were little more than illustrated leaflets. Those intended for administrators and local officials tended to abound in Chinese-character compounds. Farm manuals emerged as a genre in the Edo period and derive in common from a documentary impulse: a concern to record for posterity, in an ethnographic mode, the performance of farming and hus- bandry. The nisho genre reflects the bakufu's insistence on the primacy of agricul- ture, and its emergence parallels the increasing cogency offitsugaku At (practical or useful learning) as a mode of inquiry predicated on a conception of reality as verifiable by tangible forms and judgeable by actual things. As instructional THE AUTHOR is a doctoral candidate in the Department of Anthropology, Cornell Uni- versity. 1 'Female' was designated by the characters 4, At, k, and/or t, and 'male' by A, 4?, A, and/or M. The fact that these characters are used to represent such traits as, in the case of the former group, smooth, pliant, supple, etc., suggests that 'feminine' and 'masculine' may be the more appropriate English rendering of the characters. However, while linguistic dis- tinctions between biological sex and socially attributed gender traits are lacking in the vocabulary used by the farm-manualists, they did draw distinctions between the two. I have therefore used the terms 'female', 'femaleness', 'male', and 'maleness' for reasons of fidelity to the Japanese text.</page><page sequence="2">234 Monumenta Nipponica, XXXIX:3 manuals read by and to rural peoples, the hundreds of nosho published or otherwise circulated in the Edo period were instrumental in efforts to rationalize agriculture and revitalize farm villages. The genre also was exploited as a medium well suited for subjective social observations, commentary, and criticism, and farm manualists devoted many pages to determining which rural conventions were progressive and which were impediments to village reform. Unfortunately, much of the symbolic meaning of these often allegorical texts is obscure to us today. Several related areas of interest will be dealt with in this article. A point of special interest is the categorization of plants by gender, and, more fundamentally, the gender-attribution process itself. We cannot simply dismiss this popular practice as either pre-scientific or inferior to scientific agricultural techniques and therefore unworthy of study. 'Sexy rice' represents more than just a collection of folksy notions and rules of thumb. Rather, the practice of gender-based seed and plant categorization was a manifestation of the use of common-sense knowledge and reasoning.2 It was an expression of the application of this knowledge to create and sustain the facticity of the social world, of which agriculture was the largest division. My intention in this article is threefold: one, to present the practical basis for gender-based plant and seed categorization in the Edo period, and two, to describe gender attribution as a process of reality construction. Gender attributions are made within a particular context and in relation to all the routine features of every- day life. Moreover, since the meaning of common-sense categories, formulas, and terms is context-dependent, this study is undertaken within the context of somj no kokugaku $V#ODRI (grass-roots nativism) as articulated by Hirata Atsutane *RiXML9 1776-1843.3 Specifically, I would like to explore how and why advocates of this movement appropriated the popular practice of gender-based crop categori- zation. The third aim is to answer a question left unasked in the English-language 2 As Kenneth Leiter explains in his A Primer on Ethnomethodology, Oxford U.P., 1980, pp. 4 &amp; 209, common-sense knowledge is more than 'just a set of maxims' and in- cludes 'practices of commonsense reasoning and the cognitive style through which we experience the social world as a factual ob- ject.' A basic feature of such reasoning is the demand for 'appropriateness by correspond- ence to a context'. 3 Briefly, kokugaku refers to an Edo-period literary movement devoted to the study of the ancient history and classical literature of Japan. Hirata Atsutane undertook to increase the centrifugal force of kokugaku by expound- ing on its more emotional, religious, and practical aspects to unscholarly rural audi- ences. Somo was a term originally used in China to refer to someone who was 'with the people'. While the term has a long history of inter- pretation and use in Japan, in the Edo period it was used to refer to farmers, village officials, farmer-merchants, and provincial merchants. Some Japanese scholars insist that sdmd did not represent a distinct social class but bespoke a mindset representative of those advocating imperialism and exclusionism. Others, however, prefer to trace the simo phenomenon to the 'crisis mentality' accom- panying the Kyoho Reforms, 1716-1735. See Takagi Shunsuke AA**, Meiji Ishin S6mi Undoshi FM h"** #0, Keiso Shobo, 1974, pp. 2-43. The term is used in Ito Tasa- buro 1Xff-IR, Sdmd no Kokugaku V-#cDM *, Masago Shobo, 1966, to refer to the rural projection of Hirata kokugaku, an interpreta- tion followed in the present article.</page><page sequence="3">ROBERTSON: Sexy Rice 235 literature on nativism, namely, how was Hirata kokugaku actually promulgated in the rural areas ? While Harootunian insists that the underlying motive of simJ no kokugaku was to 'gain control of the countryside', he does not detail the ways and means by which this objective was implemented.4 This article will show how Atsutane befriended certain farm-manual writers as a major part of his strategy to promulgate his 'sexual theology' among rural peoples. It was in their nisho, edited and in some cases published by Atsutane, that the critical attributes of gender categories were debated and popularized along with the tenets of Hirata kokugaku. The article begins by describing the practice and significance of categorizing plants by gender. Next, spokesmen for the two major schools of opinion regarding the gender-attribution process are introduced, and Atutane's support of one of them and his patronage of its adherents are examined. Finally, grass-roots na- tivism and its dissemination throughout Japan will be briefly described. Plant-Gender Attribution The categorization of crops by gender was predicated on the assumption that all living things could be differentiated as either male or female. Actually, it was not so much that gender was differentiated as it was attributed in the first place. The plant-gender discourses published in Edo-period farm manuals revolved around the 'gender-attribution process'. The word 'attribution' in this context implies an active decision-making process incorporating certain implicit, ideologically relative rules for assigning gender traits. The gender-attribution process is by no means a matter of simple inspection, but involves a careful inquiry into the presumed or presupposed intrinsic nature of things. Accordingly, the theorists considered in this article did not merely gloss this process but sought to explicitly define and systematize it. There was no consensus among the farm manualists about the critical attributes of gender categories, although the dichotomous division of gender per se was not disputed. To forestall any possible confusion, the difference between the terms 'sex' and 'gender' should be pointed out here. 'Sex' refers to the reproductive organs and the reproductive functions associated with these physical genitalia, and 'gender', to the social interpretation and construction of maleness and femaleness. Gender is not to be regarded as a consequence of a biological blueprint. Rather, I follow Kessler and McKenna in emphasizing that 'the element of social construction is primary in all aspects of being female or male.' Although the gender-attribution process involves an interaction between the attributor and the attributed, 'concrete displays are not informative unless interpreted in light of the rules which the attributor has for deciding what it means to be a female or male.'5 I H. D. Harootunian, 'Ideology as Con- flict', in Tetsuo Najita &amp; J. Victor Koschmann, ed., Conflict in Modern Japanese History: The Neglected Tradition, Princeton U.P., 1982, pp. 25-61. 5 S. J.

McKenna, Gender: An Ethnomethodological Approach, John Wiley, New York, 1978, pp. 7 &amp; 157.</page><page sequence="4">236 Monumenta Nipponica, xxxix :3 These rules are learned as a part of the socialization-or indoctrination-process and are not universal.' Thus, in Edo-period farm manuals, the plant-gender issue was discussed in terms of gender attribution, and, concomitantly, the selective perception of gender cues. Miyazaki Yasusada 9FgR, 1623-1697, the celebrated agriculturalist, is credited with giving the process of plant-gender attribution its first literary men- tion in Japan. In his widely read and cited opus, the ten-volume NdgyO Zensho Atria ('An Encyclopedia of Agriculture'), 1697, he notes, 'The female rice plant has spikes that are amply laden with grains of rice. The stem and leaves of the female rice plant are smooth, pliant, and supple. This beautifully colored plant is im- pervious to harmful insects.'7 Although Miyazaki is recognized as the first farm- manualist to have promoted gender as a basis for the selection and classification of superior rice plants, it is debatable whether his views on rice gender were shaped by his collaborator, the Confucian scholar Kaibara Ekiken I 1630- 1714,8 or simply reflect the popular practice of the day. While the selection and cultivation of 'female' seedlings was admittedly a common practice, the widespread influence of Nogyo Zensho spurred the interest of Miyazaki's contemporaries in the more ideological aspects of the plant-gender issue. The classification of all plants, and not merely rice, by gender appears to have been, in the context of the Edo period, a wholly Japanese construct, although its philosophical basis derives from the Chinese theory of yin-yang. Plant gender was in fact mentioned in Chinese farm-manuals but only in reference to bamboo. Nongzheng chuanshu Ark7 ('A General Treatise on Agricultural Administration'), 1639, by Xu Guangchi Add, 1562-1633, serves as a case in point. As Xu ex- plained: There are male bamboo and female bamboo. The female bamboo produces many shoots and thus only the seeds of the female should be cultivated. As for distinguish- 6 The significance of gender attribution as a culturally relative process is demonstrated by cross-cultural studies. Anthropological literature has many examples that show that 'membership in a culture blinds us to the constructed nature of that culture's reality.' Kessler &amp; McKenna, p. 22. In short, gender is not necessarily dichotomous; it can be trichotomous, or fluid, or have no meaning at all as a classification. See Kessler &amp; McKenna, pp. 21-41. 7 Miyazaki Yasusada , Ndgyj Zen- sho f in Nihon Nosho Zensha [NNZ] H * Nosangyoson Bunka Kyokai, 1978, xii, p. 69. Possibly an earlier mention of rice-plant gender appeared in the supplement of Aizu Ndsho *ffi ('Aizu Farm Manual'), 1688- 1711, by Sase Yojiemon Jti ~tWP9, 1630- 1711, wherein the author notes that 'female' rice seedlings have broad leaves while 'male' ones have narrow leaves.

But the exact date of publication of this book is not known and it was not widely circulated outside of Aizu. 8 Ekiken wrote the preface to Ndgyd Zen- sho, and his elder brother Rakuken tf, 1625-1702, an agriculturalist, edited the entire text. Ekiken also wrote two herbology texts intended as handbooks for farm house- holds: Saifu XA ('Herb Taxonomy'), com- pleted in 1704 and published in 1714, and Yamato HonzJ kcW*V ('Japanese Herbs'), 1708. In these works, the author espouses a more scholarly version of the yin-yang theory popularized in the farm manuals described in the present article.</page><page sequence="5">ROBERTSON: Sexy Rice 237 ing between male and female bamboo, the female has two branches growing from the lowermost node and the male one branch growing from there.9 Miyazaki borrowed heavily from Xu's treatise, adjusting the contents to fit the Japanese agricultural situation, but where Xu referred only to male and female bamboo, Miyazaki focused exclusively on rice-plant gender. The overall superiority of the female of the species was generally agreed upon by the vast majority of those farm manualists who included plant-gender dis- courses in their texts.'0 Likewise, the two-gender division of the phenomenal world was not disputed. Hotly contested, however, were the critical attributes of gender by which 'male' and 'female' seeds and plants could be differentiated. Two competing schools of opinion emerged. One was represented by Kojima Josui WAAR* and Kojima Tokushige , who outlined their position on gender attribution in Noka Gyjfi W$ ('Farm Household Management'), 1789-1829." The spokesmen for the other school were Konishi Atsuyoshi 1JYWff, 1767-1837, and Miyaoi Sadao gAti, 1797-1858. In his farm manual N5gy5 Yowa Ati@ ('Discussions on Agriculture'), 1828, Konishi denounced the method of plant-gender differentiation promoted by the Kojimas. Miyaoi, following Konishi, laid out his formula for plant-gender attribution in two of his manuals, NigyJ Yish7 a- ('A Compendium of Essential Agricultural Knowledge'), 1826, and Somoku Senjuroku Wyatt ('A Guide to Plant Taxonomy'), 1828. Both Konishi and Miyaoi were disciples of Atsutane, who assisted in the prepara- tion of their texts and referred to them as 'agricultural sages'. Miyaoi, in turn, spearheaded the sJmJ no kokugaku movement in Shimosa province, Atsutane's provincial stronghold in the first half of the nineteenth century. Atsutane's involve- ment with these and other farm-manual writers and agricultural consultants in- creased the visibility of Hirata kokugaku in the rural sector. Atsutane's Sexual Theology Atsutane perceived agriculture as a particularly cogent analogy in which to cast his sexual theology. In his view, the universe was a synthesis of what appeared to In Shi Shenghan WMX, ed., Nongzheng chuanshu jiaoju , 2, Shanghai, 1979, p. 1089. 10 See Hironaga Tsutomu qLK:A, 'Toku- gawa Jidai ni okeru iwayuru Sakumotsu no Shiyfisetsu ni tsuite' Jl es ?Xf coX-fiv'~zg&gt;&gt;, 1-4, in NMgy6 oyobi Engei A M , ix (1934), 6, pp. 89-94; 8, pp. 87-92; 9, pp. 107-10; &amp; 10, pp. 113-18. 11 There are a number of riddles about Noka Gyoji. There are no actual place names appearing in the text, and those names that do crop up are either fictitious or ubiquitous. Also, the authors do not divulge any auto- biographical information either in the preface or afterword as was the standard practice among farm-manual writers. The hypothesis that the renowned agricultural consultant Okura Nagatsune -kA7*t, 1768-1856 ?, wrote this manual is supported in part by the fact that several later editions were published under his name. In addition, the contents of the original edition were borrowed virtually intact from several of his other farm manuals.

This synthesis was reified as the bisexual deity, Musubi no Kami 924, the fount of all (re)creation. 12 In terms of its function, the name of this kami was interchange- able with the homonym musubi t{Y (knot), from the verb musubu , which literally means 'to tie or knot together'. Musubi also is a euphemism for sexual intercourse. Atsutane emphasized the processual nature of musubi, which he ex- pressed in terms of the harmonization of the polarities of existence, such as life and death. He sought to alleviate popular anxieties about infirmity and death by convincing his audiences of the circularity-or the back and forth-of degenera- tion and regeneration, and of the contiguity between this world and the after- world. The helical procession of the four seasons and the annual agricultural cycle were evoked by Atsutane to support his ideas. Childhood, youth, maturity, old age, and death were like the seasons in their destined order. The meaning of life, Atsutane insisted, was to be found in their perpetual rotation. Atsutane also maintained that humans could initiate and control the process of cosmic synthesis, and not only in the form of sexual intercourse. In the farm manuals published under his auspices, farmers were exhorted to imitate the musubi no kami by cultivating their fields, thereby effectively mediating the union of 'male' heaven, 'which gives life', and 'female' earth, 'which nurtures life'. Farmwork itself was looked on as the act of harmonizing male and female forces and entities. The anthropomorphic, sexual connotations of farming are evident in the following passage from Miyaoi's Minka Yjjutsu fr lf ('Essential Practices for Householders'), published in 1831 but completed at a considerably earlier date. Farmers should sow the seeds of the five grains according to exactly the same princi- ple that underlies marital harmony. As for elderly or sickly persons, even if the seeds they sow produce life, these seeds lack life force and therefore will neither bloom nor ripen. To sow during periods of household discord or turmoil, such as after a quarrel, an illness, or a sad occasion, will result in inauspicious and unlucky happenings. Thus, only persons in the prime of life and in good spirits should sow seeds. Then, what is engendered will grow vigorously and ripen in great quantities.'3 With respect to the difference between the terms 'sex' and 'gender', we may infer that Atsutane realized that the gender designations 'female' and 'male' were more encompassing than their sexual counterparts, 'egg carrier' and 'sperm carrier'. This is because neither fertility nor reproductivity is a permanent condition but a phase of the life cycle. Atsutane and his nasho-writing colleagues were not making an argument for the 'biological imperative' of reproduction per se. Rather, they were defending the systematization of the gender-attribution process. The rules that they developed for differentiating male from female gender formed the basis 12 Musubi no Kami is rendered here as a proper noun because Atsutane, following Christian doctrine, conceived of an almighty, omnificent creation deity. See Richard Devine, 'Hirata Atsutane and Christian Sources', in MN xxxvi (1981), pp. 37-54. The Shinto pantheon, however, includes numerous crea- tion deities known generically as musubi no kami. 13 In Ono Takeo 'i~kW4X, ed., Kinsei Jikata Keizai Shirya 1 Yoshi- kawa K6bunkan, 1932, v, p. 269.</page><page sequence="7">ROBERTSON: Sexy Rice 239 for their view of reality as comprising mutually constitutive components. By encouraging farmers to apply these rules in their daily labors, Atsutane and his associates were in effect attempting to resocialize the rural populace. Moreover, since gender attribution is the basis for understanding other components of gender, such as 'gender role' and 'gender identity', this process has ramifications for the social division of labor as well. The problem ultimately addressed by the grass-roots nativists was how a social reality in which there are only two genders works. What Atsutane did was to link his cosmological precepts with the existing practice of gender-based seed and plant selection. He modified the former by recasting his ideas in an agricultural idiom, and sought to systematize the latter, evoking to this end the fundamental dimorphism of the universe. Gender dichotomy was recognized by Atsutane as the very principle of organization of the world and the dynamic of its operation. The Kojima School The Kojimas presented their side of the gender debate by noting, in N5ka Gyofi, The female rice seedling is of a yin nature; that is, it is like a mother. The purpose of mothers is to bear children. Likewise, when the female rice seedling matures and ripens, it naturally produces an abundance of kernels. If the kernels from these female spikes in turn are selectively cultivated, they will produce rice plants having spikelets heavy with large kernels featuring thin hulls and a brilliant polish. There will be few empty husks, and, what is more, the amount of straw will decrease con- spicuously. Also, they will have but a few surface roots and a large number of long roots. Such plants are able to survive drought conditions with minimal damage. They can withstand typhoons, heavy rainstorms, floods, blight, and insect infesta- tions. Such are the superior qualities of female rice plants."4 The authors further advise that, when selecting seeds, farmers should pick kernels only from the tip of the 'female' spike and ignore those at its base.'5 The 'female' of the species could be identified, the Kojimas explained, by two topmost spikelets of equal length (Figure 1). One spikelet longer than the others signified a 'male' plant, which was inferior in every respect: few long roots; seed- lings that shriveled at even the slightest direct exposure to the sun; a high suscepti- bility to damage, injury, and blight (Figure 2). The authors also drew attention to a 'super female' rice plant featuring not two, but three equally long spikelets (Figure 3). This superior plant was regarded as a 'mutation"6 of sorts, and was manifest in all four types of rice: wase VIN (early rice), nakate rfM (mid-season rice), okute *fH (late rice), and mochigome 0 (glutinous rice). Although their main concern was with rice cultivation, the Kojimas included a section on how to identify male and female cotton plants at different stages of growth. 14 In NNz, xxi, p. 14. 15 NNZ, xxi, p. 12. 16 NNZ, xxi, p. 31. The phrase kore wa me no naka yori henji ideshita ho nari BA le JP 1 D X 1U- 1-t Vt 9 further illustrates the point that dichotomous division of gender itself was never challenged. Here we see that male and, in this case, female remain the basic categories to which even deviants belong and from which their deviation is judged. See Leiter, p. 98.</page><page sequence="8">240 Monumenta Nipponica, xxxix :3 The Konishi-Miyaoi School The criteria for gender-based seed and plant selection established by the Kojimas influenced many nisho writers in the decades that followed the publication of Nika GyJfi. Konishi and Miyaoi, however, denounced their criteria as wholly absurd, and also claimed that Miyazaki's explanation of gender in Nigyj Zensho was incomplete, ambiguous, and carelessly worded. Konishi devised his formula, explicated in NigyJ Yowa, by extrapolating the Chinese method of identifying 'male' and 'female' bamboo to plants in general. Konishi's explanation eventually undermined the credibility of the Kojimas' thesis and became the prevailing formula for gender-based seed and plant categorization. Rice gender, for example, was distinguished in the following way. Two spikelets at the node where the stalk of the rice plant meets the spike indicate a female plant. Males have only one spikelet there. These are the same criteria used to distinguish bamboo gender. Farmers can increase their yields by sowing only seeds from the female rice plant.... For every tan, the total yield will increase by two to three to and will continue to do so for the next five or six years. It is imperative that farmers select and store female seeds.17 Konishi's method of gender identification was a more comprehensive and systematic one inasmuch as virtually all plants have branches while only some have tips, leaves, and root structures that conform to the Kojimas' criteria. Koni- shi's formula held for all the stages in a plant's growth, since despite its mor- phological changes over time, a plant's intrinsic nature remains the same. He did not confine his rule for gender attribution to rice or cotton, as did the Kojimas, but extended it to all living things. Konishi dealt in particular with the five grains, weeds, insect pests, cotton, ramie, Japanese radish, rape, soybeans, azuki beans, broad beans, eggplant, tobacco, melon, leeks, oxen, horses,"8 fruit trees (plum, persimmon, tangerine, loquat, jujube), cryptomeria, oak, and bamboo, in that order. Nigyo Yowa, in fact, was the first farm manual in which yin-yang theory and that of the five agents19 were adopted as the paradigmatic context in which the contents were presented. 17 In NNZ, VII, p. 286. A tan a was equiva- lent to .245 acre, while a to S was 18 liters. 18 Konishi's critical attributes for establish- ing gender pertained to plants, insects, and mammals alike. The gender-attribution process for each life form was carried out in a context assembled for the occasion on the basis of yin-yang theory. Thus, according to Nagya Yowa, 'Oxen, and black oxen in particular, are yin in na- ture. ... and prefer [to rest] lying down.' Horses, on the other hand, 'are yang in na- ture, especially red horses, and prefer to remain standing.' Konishi indirectly suggests a division of social classes on the basis of gender: farmers, 'to whom oxen [yin] are indispensable,' constituted a yin class, and samurai, 'to whom horses [yang] are indispens- able,' a yang class. In NNZ, VII, p. 339. Elsewhere in his manual, p. 229, Konishi differentiates humans and beasts as yang and yin, respectively. 19 The gogya Th are wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. Paired, and thereby acti- vated, they manifest the perpetual regenerative dynamic of all living things. From wood, fire; from fire, earth; from earth, metal; from metal, water; and from water, wood. As regards plants, Konishi declares that the roots correspond to water, the stem to wood, leaves to fire, nodes to metal, and spikes to earth.

The text of this circular is as follows. All the living things of the world can be classified as male or female. Huge profits will be realized provided that the female seeds of all plants, from the five grains to bamboo and fruit trees, are sown. However, in ancient Japanese and Chinese texts, the methods of distinguishing between male and female flora are not explained in any detail. Thus, even today there are only a few persons who know how to tell the difference between male and female seeds and plants. Several persons have recently appeared on the scene with formulas for identifying male and female rice seeds and plants. The majority of these methods, however, are wrong and only serve to confuse and mislead simple-minded farmers. Also, the explanation in NogyJ Zensho of female rice seeds and plants is much too abbreviated and therefore extremely difficult to understand fully. A couple of years ago, in Bunsei 9 [1826], Amizawa gjg of Edo published an illus- trated leaflet titled Shiyfi Inaho no Ben W*V ) ['An Explication of Rice Gender'], which was distributed widely. According to Amizawa, the differences be- tween male and female rice plants are evident in the shape of their tips and roots, a notion that is altogether wrong. Also, in the spring of Bunsei 10 [1827], an explana- tion equally as preposterous was published by two men-Ishibashi :5A and Kawai )I-B---from Ota in Mito han, Hitachi province. Their leaflet too was distributed far and wide. Now then, this year a person from Settsu province by the name of Konishi brought out NigyJ Yowa. In this farm manual he accurately and correctly explains the differences between male and female rice seeds and plants. His formula surely will prove to be a great boon to the general public. Konishi, unlike many others, does not explain gender differences in terms of tip and root configurations. Rather, he says that the criteria for rice-gender attribution are the same as those for bamboo: one branching at the base of the rice spike signifies a male, while two branchings indicate a female. The distinctions between male and female bamboo are widely known, and were presented in Li Shizhen's W Bencao gangmu * ; 0 ['A Reference Guide for Herbology', 1590] and Kaibara Ekiken's Yamato HonzJ. I have already pointed out the many erroneous explanations of rice gender in my manual, Minka Yjjutsu. Provided female seeds are selected and cultivated, yield increases from two to three to per tan will be realized. Of course, these increases depend on the region, and, even in the same region, on the quality of the paddies. Moreover, the annual crop conditions must be taken into account. Still, these differences average out to an in- creased harvest of about two to five sho per tan. Thus, a farmer who cultivates a chi of paddy will be able to realize an increase of two koku five to. For 100,000 chi of paddy, the calculated increase amounts to 250,000 koku. Needless to say, that is an immense amount of rice! It is more profitable to cultivate the female seeds of the five grains, bamboo, and fruit trees. As for the male barley spike, there are many empty husks toward the base and just about only one kernel ripens. However, the female spike has spikelets from tip to base bearing up to three kernels each. The female wheat spike has spike- lets of four kernels each from tip to base, while the male spike is the same as that of barley. At the base of the female hie t [barnyard millet] spike are two symmetrical</page><page sequence="11">ROBERTSON: Sexy Rice 243 branchings; rarely are there three or four branchings. The same pertains to the female kibi i [millet] spike.... When weeding cotton, pull out all the male cotton seedlings. The male seedlings have one leaf above the other in a staggered fashion, thick stems, and quickly grow- ing branches that reach upward. The female's stem is narrow and the branches are arranged opposite each other.... This leaflet provides illustrated comparisons of thirty-three male and female seeds and plants. Not featured are the gender differ- ences of medicinal herbs, fruit trees, livestock, fish, and insects, for I have already described these in detail in Banbutsu Hinbok6 7YWIMt1?4 ['A Comprehensive Treatise on Gender'].20 Miyaoi presented the case for gender-based seed and plant categorization in this circular. At the same time, he denounced the alternative formulas for gender attribution as completely erroneous. Clearly, plant-gender attribution and its ramifications were of sufficient concern to a large enough number of people to make it a live issue, particularly in the latter half of the Edo period. Miyaoi under- scored the efficacy of his school's gender prescriptions by claiming the possibility of increased yields provided that female seeds and plants were cultivated. The same argument was put forward by his rivals, as the association of 'femaleness' with in- creased productivity was not problematic-it was taken for granted. Rather, sharp words were exchanged between schools over the matter of how femaleness was to be attributed in the first place. Each side vociferously defended its criteria for distinguishing between the 'male' and 'female' of a given species. Regardless of whether plant gender was attributed on the basis of the configura- tion of the tip of the spike (Kojimas) or the pattern of branching at the base of the spike (Konishi and Miyaoi), the most amply laden spike invariably proved to be 'female'. The Kojimas had further emphasized this point by noting that the 'female' rice seedling, being 'like a mother', naturally produced an abundance of kernels.21 'Females', in short, were best. It was not that superior plants were merely labeled, ex post facto, 'female', but rather that certain seeds and plants were superior because they were intrinsically 'female'. Seeds and plants, and all things, were shaped by an immanent creative principle. 'Female' plants were 'beautifully colored' and 'impervious to harmful insects',22 had a 'large number of long roots' and could withstand all sorts of natural calamities,23 and had a naturally symmetrical shape.24 The notion of 'female' superiority, in short, also inhered in aesthetic and pragmatic considerations. The common-sense rationale for plant-gender attribution was discounted by Okura Nagatsune Jc), an agricultural consultant, entrepreneur, and nosho author of great renown. In the supplement to his farm manual, SaishuhJ Aft ['The Method of Double-Cropping Rice'], 1831, he made the following observa- tions. 20 The text of SOmoku Senjuroku V-M f is found in NNz, III, pp. 65-74.

Because the [so- called] female spike bears more kernels than that of the male, selecting female seeds for storage is a sound policy. However, since the labels 'male' and 'female' are simply synonyms for inferior and superior, respectively, superior rice could just as well be labeled 'young brother' and inferior rice 'older brother'.25 Okura disregarded the common-sense knowledge motivating the practice of plant- gender attribution, along with its ideological dimensions, as elucidated by Hirata nativists, and proceeded to criticize it on the basis of Dutch learning and Western technology. Using a microscope, he examined the male and female re- productive structures of plants, and concluded, 'While the premises of gender- based selection are efficacious-that is, the selection of seeds from superior, high-yielding plants-the categorization of plants as male or female according to their gross morphology is preposterous.'26 In a later farm manual, Menpo Yomu ON WA ('The Essentials of Cotton Cultiva- tion'), 1833, Okura graphically, if anthropomorphically, described the reproductive organs and process. All plants and animals are alike in reproducing sexually, and their reproductive structures correspond to those of human beings. For example, [in the case of cotton,] the petals correspond to the vagina, the pistil corresponds to the Fallopian tubes, the calyx to the uterus, the carpel to the placenta, the ovules to the ova.... Pollen is equivalent to semen. Human semen contains countless numbers of sperm. The sperm enters the uterus and fuses with the ovum released through the Fallopian tubes. Similarly, in the case of [cotton] plants, pollen grains from the stamen [anther] are blown onto the pistil [stigma], where they ger- minate, once a life-giving essence has been released from within the pollen.27 [Figure 5] While this passage shows that the general details of sexual reproduction were understood by this time, the excerpts from Saishuho clearly indicate that Okura conflated gender, a social construct, with sex, or the reproductive organs themselves. In his view, gender was a consequence of a biological blueprint. He reduced the practice of plant-gender attribution to the status of a 'residual category', a refer- ence to phenomena that are deemed unscientific and therefore neither credible nor worthy of further consideration. Okura's dismissal of gender categories as mere qualitative synonyms, or metaphors, was indicative of his discontent with the common-sense rationalities rooted in agricultural life. As Smith points out in his short biography, Okura 'frequently stated that peas- ants could never see for themselves the inefficiency of inherited methods.'28 25 Quoted in Tanaka Koji, Kaidai 2, 'Saka- motsu Shiyasetsu no Keifu ni okeru Miyaoi Setsit no Ichi' {f1#MO6*-P=2 KR i OD MM 1979, in NNZ, III, p. 96. 26 Quoted in Tanaka, NNZ, III, p. 96. 27 In NNZ, XV, pp. 339-40. 28 Thomas C.

What is more, he is thought to have been the author of the con- troversial Njka Gyqji.29 There are many speculations as to why Okura, if he did in fact write that text, played up plant gender therein, only to debunk it several years later. He may have orginally viewed plant-gender attribution as a convenient way of processing agricultural information for popular consumption. His later experiments in microscopy effectively undermined his support of yin-yang theory and, consequently, his appreciation of plant-gender categories. Atsutane also was a student of Western learning, but unlike his contemporary Okura, he did not apply this knowledge to debunk the popular practice of plant- gender attribution. This was because, for him, the facticity of two genders was supported by more than biological details alone. Where Okura relied on sex, or physical genitalia, as the ultimate criteria in the attribution of gender, Atsutane believed that two genders were ultimately a natural consequence of a dimorphous universe. Moreover, he viewed the relationship between male and female as a reflexive one. Atsutane's perception of the workings of the universe was of a musubi, or coupling: a dynamic pattern of creation and re-creation comprising mutually constitutive components. The popular practice of gender attribution, and the refinement of this method by Konishi and Miyaoi, were in accord with Atsutane's cosmological ideas. In his view, the universe comprised the reflexive entities, kakurigoto 1R-1- and arawagoto PAA*. The former may be translated as 'hidden matters', in the sense of concealed and mysterious, and the latter, 'open matters', as in visible, clear, and manifest.30 Atsutane sought to clarify through philology the contiguity of this life and the afterlife. Likewise, he saw in gender attribution, as a type of nomenclature, an effective means of demonstrating the enantiomorphic relationship of the natural (plant and animal) and social (human) worlds. Furthermore, the invisible-in the sense of undeciphered-world of nature could be made visible, or decipherable, through the gender-attribution process, itself a 'sense-making' activity. Atsutane's point was that while femaleness was distinct from maleness, and the natural world distinct from the social one, each was a necessary condition of the other. Through the nosho published and distributed under the auspices of the Hirata school, along with those written under the influence of the Konishi-Miyaoi school, farmers were their exclusive concern was with 'material problems'; in fact, they 'vehemently attacked religion', pp. 127 &amp; 140. He refers to the farm manualists as 'technologists', a term whose connotations-objective, rational, agnostic, scientific-support his thesis more than ac- curately characterize nosho writers of the Edo period. The plant-gender debate and its ramifica- tions, not to mention somi no kokugaku, are only part of the evidence for the involvement of farm manualists in much more than purely 'material problems'. 29 For more about Noka Gyaji, see n. 11. 30 Muraoka Tsunetsugu, Studies in Shinto Thought, Ministry of Education, Tokyo, 1964, p. 182.

Atsutane and Konishi Atsutane's residence in Edo, the Ibukinoya nA2,31 doubled as a forum where agriculturalists could meet and exchange information. Ibukinoya Nikki to E E ('The Ibukinoya Diary'), compiled by Hirata Kanetane TZEfl)AL, 1799-1880, Atsutane's adopted son and successor, contains a chronological account of Atsutane's meetings with Konishi, who authored the precedent-setting Nogyj Yowa. The following account of their acquaintanceship, however, is drawn from the more literary version in the afterword of this farm manual.32 The afterword, written by Kanetane, opens with a brief biography of Konishi, who succeeded his father as village headman of Saho mura in Shimashita gun, Settsu province. As a youth, he had spent about ten years in Kyoto before return- ing home to farm full time and initiate various agricultural reforms, including gender-based seed and plant selection. Kanetane records that Konishi had been involved with agriculture since his childhood, and that through firsthand experience and experiments with different cultivation techniques, he had discovered the in- nermost nature of rice. This intrinsic quality, moreover, was not yet comprehended by anyone else. In the sections that follow, Kanetane describes the circumstances of Atsutane's (and his) role in the preparation of NigyJ Yowa. Atsutane evidently heard about Konishi through a third party, and intrigued, requested an introduction. They met for the first time on the 21st day, Sixth Month, 1826, at the Ibukinoya. According to the afterword, Atsutane cross-examined Konishi about agricultural technology. Kanetane was present at the discussion; later he was appointed by Atsutane to revise NogyJ Yowa, which had been drafted in 1809. Konishi shared his worries about the copious numbers of farm manuals being recently published, remarking disparagingly that the vast majority of them had nothing to do with practical agricultural affairs. Farmers who followed the errant advice offered in their pages were simply 'learning to swim in a dry pond'. Konishi insisted that his text was different, as it had emerged from his lifetime experience as a farmer.33 Atsutane seems to have been profoundly affected by his session with Konishi, for he implored the farmer to stay several more days in Edo. Konishi declined and arranged to visit again in the following year. At their second meeting, Konishi presented Atsutane with the Nigyo Yowa manuscript. Atsutane agreed to have 31 The residence was known as Masuga- noya 7 prior to 1816. 32 Unless otherwise noted, this account is a paraphrase of the afterword to Nogyo Yowa, in NNz, VII, pp. 376-80. 33 Most nisho authors stressed the empirical validity of their texts by introducing themselves as veteran farmers, or by prefacing key passages with the literary device, 'According to a wise old man ... ,' or by recounting the advice of experienced farmers interviewed in the course of their fieldwork.</page><page sequence="18">250 Monumenta Nipponica, xxxix:3 the text rewritten in 'rustic Japanese'34 as a way of making it more accessible to the general public. Kanetane was entrusted with that task, which he began on the 10th day, Fourth Month, 1827, by copying the entire manuscript. He then went over the work section by section, questioning Konishi at length on several occa- sions about the meaning of certain ambiguous passages. Not being scholarly, the farmer was often at a loss for concise words, and his manuscript consequently was full of unclear and confusing passages. According to the Ibukinoya Nikki, Konishi also visited Atsutane's residence on the 12th and 19th days of that same month, ostensibly to work with Kanetane on the revision. Lest readers jumped to the conclusion that he ghostwrote the manual, Kanetane was quick to establish its homespun veracity by noting that, on Konishi's insistence, he often let awkward passages stand as originally written. He was pleased when Konishi thanked him for revising the text, for, he confessed, he was worried that, because of his lack of firsthand experience with farming, he might have misinterpreted the author's ideas and intentions. Kanetane continues, in a somewhat self-congratulatory manner, by noting that he toiled unceasingly on the manuscript out of a sense of obligation to both Atsustane and Konishi. The rewritten text was shown to Atsutane, who gave it his wholehearted ap- probation and referred to Konishi as a 'sage of agriculture'. Kanetane quotes his father as remarking, Since ancient times, persons of talent and skill have been called the sages of this or that vocation: the sage of poetry, the sage of go, and so on. However, how do these sages of the performing arts contribute to the prosperity of the country? Is not agriculture the foundation of the country?35 NogyJ Yowa, as noted earlier, was the first farm-manual in which yin-yang theory and that of the five agents were adopted as the paradigm within which the entire contents were contextualized. While other nisho authors may have couched their ideas in similar terminology, Konishi was the first to employ these dynamic principles systematically throughout his manual. His achievement probably had much to do with the fact that Atsutane himself had marked off those parts of the text to be explicated in gender-bound terms.36 The following excerpt from NogyJ Yowa illustrates Konishi's appropriation of yin-yang and the five agents. The yin-yang principle pertains to all vegetation. For example, the wisteria tree growing in the mountain forest has vines that wind around to the right, a yang direc- tion. The arrowroot vine, on the other hand, winds in a yin direction to the left. This is because the wisteria is a tree (which is yang) and the arrowroot an herb (which is yin).... The human body is yang, therefore its life forces and blood circulate to the right. By virtue of its yin nature, herbal medicine cures by initiating movement in the opposite direction, thereby expelling from the body all noxious germs.... Of the five agents, earth and water are yin in nature, as together they are responsi- 34 Satobigoto Ad. The text was rewritten using vernacular idioms and imagery to blend Atsutane's ideas with Konishi's more 'empirical' observations. NOgyj Yowa in a sense may be considered a primer of grass- roots nativism. 35 In NNZ, VII, p. 379. 36 Tanaka, in NNZ, VII, p. 410.</page><page sequence="19">ROBERTSON: Sexy Rice 251 ble for the growth of all living things; together they are the mother of all living things.... Agriculture is the product of the union between heaven, which gives life, and earth, which nurtures life. Farmwork must be geared toward harmonizing the prevailing yin and yang forces. Calamities such as floods and droughts are to be offset by preparatory measures, and insects and weeds are to be exterminated. Fertilizers must be applied to insure the yin-yang balance of the soil, and agricultural tasks are to be started and finished at the appropriate times. Farmers are to cultivate their fields in imitation of the creation kami.37 In a chapter dealing with cultivation methods, Konishi notes that there are all types of activity in society, from strenuous physical labor to the arts and 'useless' vocations. He bemoans the dearth of experimentive and resourceful farmers, as well as the absence of teachers who can effectively dispense agricultural know- how. Farming, after all, proclaims Konishi, is the source of human life. He insists that local officials actively encourage agricultural productivity by instructing villagers in beneficent farming methods, such as those proposed in NMgyJ Yowa.38 This would have the additional effect of eliminating greed and lopsided profits, thereby making for peace and well-being in the community. Farming, he notes, is an occupation free of the turbulent competition characteristic of merchant households. Because agriculture is in accord with yin-yang and the five agents, it constitutes a 'natural labor' and thus does not provoke any ill-feelings, envy, or jealousy.39 N5gyo Yowa was a popular text, and, in the Edo period, was reprinted in 1829 and again in 1856. In 1828, the Edo kokugaku scholar, Sugawara Shigemichi ;PT#,M published an abridged, picture-book version titled Nogyo Yowashj At iM8J Also, in 1837, the Edo humorist Sant6 Kyozan i*Rb, 1769-1858, wrote a comical chapbook, based on both Konishi's and Sugawara's texts, titled Hinen Hyakush5 Kagami Mansaku Odori Vt 7J{f1f- t? E 9 ('A Romp Through a Year of Bumper Crops'). Kyozan declares in the preface that his jocose version stimu- lated interest in Konishi's original text. Although he refers to the veteran farmer as a 'farm householder's bodhisattva', Kyozan felt that Konishi's concepts were too difficult for uneducated persons to grasp, despite Kanetane's conscious use of 'riiutic Jna-nese'.40 37 In NNZ, VII, pp. 231-32. 38 This is precisely what Tokugawa Nariaki ')JII3M, 1800-1860, daimyo of Mito, did, although not directly in response to Konishi's appeal. Nariaki turned his 36-volume nasho collection over to the district magistrature for the education of provincial administrators, thereby enabling them to implement village- revitalization programs more proficiently. Four of Miyaoi's farm manuals were included in this number. Miyoshi Nobuhiro M,:, Nihon Ndgyd Kydiku Seiritsushi no Kenkya H *AffftWjtS Et, Kazama Shobo, 1982, pp. 155-64; Sakurai Takeo &amp;4tA, 'Mito Han no Nisei to Nisho' *kPMWDfi L A*;, in Geppo 9 *, 3, pp. 10-13, NNZ, III, 1979. 39 In NNZ, VII, pp. 371-72. The concept of 'natural labor' (shizen ni makasuru waza PA -SztWS) inheres in the ramifications of a world engendered by mutually constitutive entities, whether they are identified as yin and yang or female and male. Conflict, expressed here as envy or jealousy, was theoretically impossible in a world of dynamic equilibrium. 40 Kato Sokury6 MO AT, 'Hirata Atsutane to Konishi Atsuyoshi no Koto nado-"Ibuki- noya Nikki" o Chashin ni' IffLa iXf oe - t- rote F Fien - i", in Gepp6,</page><page sequence="20">252 Monumenta Nipponica, xxxix:3 Atsutane and Miyaoi Unlike Miyaoi's farm manuals, Konishi's NogyJ Yowa was not published with Ibukinoya funds, although both Atsutane and Kanetane assisted in editing and revising the work. Miyaoi learned of Konishi through Atsutane, and quickly became a proponent of his theory of plant-gender attribution. Atsutane wrote the preface to Miyaoi's first farm manual, Nogyj Yjshfi. He also contracted with a copyist and later a craftsman to carve the woodblock plates for printing.41 About six-hundred copies were published in the first, and apparently only, edition.42 Miyaoi wrote the manual with the intention of initiating revolutionary changes in the mindset and lifestyle of farmers. That his philosophy dovetailed with that of Atsutane has much to do with the fact that his father, a disciple of the Hirata school, introduced him at an early age to various kokugaku texts. Unlike Konishi, Miyaoi was an active promoter of grass-roots nativism. In Nogyd Ydshil, he advocated that financial solvency be tempered by vocational ethics, material wealth by charity, personal success by altruism, and village autonomy by national integrity. He also expounded the dialectical relationship between work and productivity, and propriety and affluence. Miyaoi emphasized Atsutane's notion of the transience of the present material world and the interrelationship between the visible and invisible realms. Miyaoi was born in Matsuzawa, a small village in the eastern quarter of Katori gun, Shimosa province. He served as the sixth head of his household, which had been established as a branch household sometime between the 1680s and 1730s. By the 1780s, it was the largest landowning and cultivating household in the village. From the 1820s onward, the land owned by the villagers decreased dramati- cally, having been bought up by farmers in the neighboring villages. This crisis situation served as the backdrop for Miyaoi's debut as an agricultural consultant with an eye toward village revitalization.43 According to his biographer, the Shimosa-born nativist, In3 Hidenori #RfgIJ, 1805-1877, Miyaoi at first did not take to farming at all. Rather, he reportedly was a heavy drinker and quite a playboy, in addition to being a lazy spendthrift. Not surprisingly, he was disinherited by his father, whereupon he set out for Edo. There he met several kokugaku scholars and wrote two books, marking the beginning of his career as a prolific author. Meanwhile, according to Ina, a mystical experience cured him of his wanton ways, and he returned to Matsuzawa and a 7, pp. 9-11, in NNZ, VII, 1979; Suga Kikutar6 VVfizMI 'SantJ Kyozan no Icho "Ndsaku HyakushM Kagami" ni tsuite' IAlAIO 11 or TAJ 1 -DvC, in Shakai Keizai Shigaku ttiggtt, xi:6 (1941), pp. 101-05. 41 Publishing a book through legal channels in the Edo period was a complicated process that involved securing permission to publish from both the city magistrate and the book- dealers' 'guild'. Konishi and Miyaoi were doubtless appreciative of Astutane's assistance in these bureaucratic matters. 42 Kawana Noboru )i1t, Kaidai 1, 'Miyaoi Sadao to "NogyJ Yosha" nado no Chosaku no Haikei' tra~t FAM J M E OVOW, 1979, in NNZ, iII, pp. 80-81. 43 Kawana, in NNZ, III, pp. 76-77.</page><page sequence="21">ROBERTSON: Sexy Rice 253 life of farming.44 This experience foreshadowed his later absorbing interest in spiritualism and the supernatural. Miyaoi succeeded his father as village headman in 1831 but passed it on several years later to his eldest son, as the position infringed on his reform activities. He constantly was on the road, traveling from one province to another in search of superior seeds, improved cultivation methods, new farmtools, and the like. In fact, he was such an inveterate traveler that his family attributed his death, in 1858, to septic poisoning contracted when the moxa scars on his feet became infected from all his walking.45 Miyaoi's father had joined the Hirata school in 1819, as is duly recorded in the Ibukinoya roll book, on the invitation of a man from his district. Miyaoi became a disciple seven years later at the age of thirty. He was an active recruiter and encouraged about fourteen men from the village and nearby areas, including his three younger brothers, to join the Hirata school. Most of Atsutane's rural disciples, in fact, were introduced to the school by acquaintances and recruited by invitation. It is mentioned in the Ibukinoya Nikki that Miyaoi went to Edo on the 4th day, Third Month, 1826, to partake in a ceremony during which he was issued his certificate of discipleship. The same entry notes that he brought with him the manuscript of NdgyJ Yoshz7, which was published in the Eighth Month of that year. In the Fourth Month, Miyaoi had forwarded the treatise to Atsutane along with some money to cover the publication costs. Meanwhile, Kanetane toured Shimosa and Kazusa provinces, once in the Fifth Month and again in the Ninth Month of 1826, staying several nights at Miyaoi's house on each occasion. Miyaoi, in turn, visited Edo on a regular basis. His purpose in the First Month 1828 was to submit to Atsutane the pledges and registration fees of three Matsu- zawa recruits. In the Ninth Month of that year he took with him the manuscript of Somoku Senjuroku, which was published by the Ibukinoya eight months after Konishi's NdgyJ Yowa. This leaflet proved to be a popular item. According to the Ibukinoya Nikki, a total of 1,758 copies were distributed personally by Atsutane, whose residence served as a clearinghouse for this and other farm manuals. Re- quests came in for copies or permission to distribute the leaflet: a hatamoto sent his retainer to Atsutane's house to procure a copy; two fortunetellers sought per- mission to distribute the circular, whose yin-yang precepts likely appealed to them; a request came from a bookseller in Echigo to reprint the flier; a disciple in Echigo conveyed that in no time he had accrued orders for five-hundred copies. Atsutane, moreover, sent numerous copies to his disciples throughout the country to distribute in their respective regions.46 The Hirata-school network, which by the 1820s had expanded country-wide, provided the structure within which such literature could be published, promoted, and disseminated. And, by the same 44 Ito, p. 10. 45 Kawana, in NNZ, III, pp. 76-77; Miyoshi, p. 128. 46 Kawana, in NNZ, III, pp. 82-84.</page><page sequence="22">254 Monumenta Nipponica, xxxix:3 token, the farm manuals were instrumental as a popular medium through which Atsutane's theology was promulgated in the rural sector.47 A major reason why Miyaoi's leaflet proved so popular had to do with its format. The pictures and brevity of the text made it widely accessible to an uneducated audience. Some farmers evidently interpreted their receipt of the circular as a good omen, and many pirate editions in fact were printed and circulated as talismans. Also, some were printed on folding fans and sold as souvenirs, others were produced by innkeepers for distribution to their guests. Most of the counterfeit copies were enlarged versions of Miyaoi's original illustrated text.48 Despite their unorthodoxy, these souvenirs and pirate editions were among the ways in which the general public was familiarized with the tenets of sdmJ no kokugaku along with the debate about plant-gender attribution. Atsutane, Tamura, and Sath Atsutane himself had no agricultural training, admitting that he had 'never dirtied [his] shins in mud, much less used a plow or spade.'49 It therefore was imperative that he cultivate cooperation with nosho authors to insure that his theology was disseminated in an idiom familiar to unscholarly farmers. Atsutane perceived gen- der attribution as one of the most accessible, if not expedient, means of linking his cosmological ideas with the pragmatic advice offered by the farm manualists. The synthesis of his thought with that of his farmer colleagues, however, was not always a smooth process, as his collaboration with Tamura Yoshishige 1114, 1790-1877, reveals. Toward the end of 1840 the bakufu suddenly moved to expel Atsutane from Edo and censor his writings owing to their pro-imperial bias. Atsutane himself heard of the decree on New Year's Day and left for Ugo eleven days later, ac- companied by his wife. Illness obliged them to stay for three months at the Nira- gawa encampment, a parcel of land in Shimotsuke province owned by Akita han. During this stopover Atsutane met Tamura and agreed to write the foreword to his farm manual, NdgyJ Jitoku AO US ('Farming for Self-Sufficiency'), a two- volume set finally published ten years later. In the foreword, Atsutane likens NdgyJ Jitoku and NdgyJ Yowa to the two shells of a clam and to the two wheels of a cart. He also praises Tamura and Konishi as 'farmer-sages' of the east and west, respectively. Although Tamura's prose is somewhat crude, Atsutane writes, the contents of his manual are laudable. Tamura was born in 1790 in Shimokamai mura, Kawachi gun, Shimotsuke 47 Somoku Senjuroku was circulated in Mikawa province as recruitment propaganda for the Hirata school.

He succeeded his father as household head in 1821, a position he apparently detested. With his father's permission, he turned the headship over to his son in 1839. Tamura's early retirement awakened the writer in him, and before his death in 1877 he had authored at least twelve texts dealing with agricultural techniques and administration, and farmer education.50 As its title suggests, NogyJ Jitoku was conceived of as a handbook for household and village revitalization. The contents range from weather forecasting, regional crops, and cultivation and fertilization techniques, to efficient record-keeping methods. Tamura evoked yin-yang theory to substantiate certain aspects of plant growth, although he did not go so far as to reify it or employ it as an overarching paradigm. He also differed with Atsutane on the issue of plant-gender attribution. Atsutane wielded a heavy hand in editing NdgyJ Jitoku. Although subtle, his revisions were more than rhetorical flourishes, and his editorial zeal was not limited to merely cleaning up Tamura's 'crude' prose. He erased those portions in which Tamura's misgivings about the plant-gender attribution process were most obvious, deleting such passages as, 'Regardless of the tenets of gender theory, farmers should weed out odd-shaped spikes of rice.' Like Okura, Tamura was not interested in the cosmological significance of categorizing odd-shaped, inferior spikes under the rubric 'male'. Atsutane augmented other passages in order to emphasize the importance of plant-gender attribution and to circumstantiate gender-based taxonomy as the sagacious advice of the veteran farmer.5' Although Ndgyd Jitoku was not written from an overtly kokugaku point of view, Atsutane nevertheless revised the text for the likely reason that he saw the book as a vehicle to circulate his teachings among farm householders. Tamura's initial meeting with Atsutane probably was less motivated by a disciple's desire to meet his master than by a single-minded ambition to distribute his farm manual through- out the Kant6 region. He sought to achieve this goal through the offices of the Ibukinoya, of which he was not a member. Tamura's eagerness to enlist Atsutane's aid stemmed from his desire to popularize a rice-cultivation technique that was either absent from, or mentioned only in passing in, the many farm manuals that he had consulted in compiling Ndgyd Jitoku. The technique in question involved sowing or transplanting a reduced number of seeds or seedlings. As Tamura explains in his farm manual, the origin of this method dates back to his childhood, when at the age of thirteen he watched help- lessly as wild boars devastated the household's rice-seedling bed. This disastrous event actually proved to be a blessing in disguise. Although many seedlings were destroyed by the boars, those that had been only partially uprooted grew in sturdily, and despite their depleted numbers, yielded one of the household's largest harvests ever. Consequently, Tamura and his father hit upon the technique of sowing or transplanting fewer seeds and seedlings than previously done, to which 50 Nagakura, in NNZ, XXI, pp. 256-59. 51 Nagakura, in NNZ, xxi, p. 275.

According to NogyJ Jitoku, plants are the offspring of the union of Heaven, the father, and Earth, the mother. Whether Earth is able to conceive depends on the season and climatic conditions. For humans and beasts, however, procreation is not contingent upon seasonal factors. Despite the fact that all living things are classifiable by gender, Tamura continued, plants are somewhat different from animals in this respect. Namely, the 'female' rice spike is not only 'morphologically stable', but it is also more 'natural' in the sense of being the most prevalent type of spike. 'Male' spikes, on the other hand, appear primarily during periods of crop failure.53 Thus, while indirectly supporting the axiom,' "Female" is best,' Tamura bypassed the cosmological grounds for gender-based classification espoused by the Konishi-Miyaoi school. Atsutane disagreed with Tamura's distinction between plant and animal gender, as well as with his notion of the mutability of the 'male' rice spike. (Recall that the Kojimas also had described a mutated rice spike, the 'super female', on the basis of criteria rejected by Konishi and Miyaoi.) For Atsutane, maleness and femaleness were manifested in morphologically distinct entities. His belief in the dyadic construction of the universe did not dovetail with Tamura's more 'empirical' findings, and vice versa. Nevetheless, this did not prevent the two men from collaborating for reasons of mutual interest. One Ibukinoya sympathizer with whom Atsutane did not collaborate was the prolific farm manualist and 'compleat' intellectual, Sat6 Nobuhiro Unbid, 1769-1850. Sat6, the fifth-generation descendant of an academic family, was in- trigued by Atsutane's explanation of the creative evolution of the universe and all living things. In Somoku Rokubu Kdshuhd , ('Cultivation Methods for the Six Parts [root, stem, bark, leaf, flower, and fruit] of Plants'), he criticized Miyaoi for not dwelling in Simoku Senjuroku on this creative prin- ciple at any length, much less with profundity. Referring to Miyaoi as a 'yokel', Sat6 accused the grass-roots leader of billing himself as Hirata's disciple but ignoring his mentor's cardinal ideas. Sat6 believed that to preach from the pulpit of personal experience alone was insufficient-practical experience must be tem- pered by learned inquiry.54 His self-righteous attitude, however, hardly seems justified, since his agricultural writings often were blatant plagarisms of Chinese and Japanese nisho. Much of his Naegi Sakuzukehd '{1fiIf ('How to Transplant Rice Seedlings'), for example, was more or less lifted from Konishi's Ndgyo Yowa.55 52 Tamura, in NNZ, XXI, pp. 7 &amp; 28-29. 53 Tamura, in NNZ, XXI, pp. 25-26. 54 Sat6 Nobuhiro ftuffiRf-, 'S&amp;moku Ro- kubu KoshuhJ' i in Takimoto Seiichi 4ge , ed., Satj Nobuhiro Kagaku Zensha (gekan) Iwa- nami, 1927, pp. 35-36. 55Sat6 Nobuhiro, Naegi Sakuzukeho, in Takimoto, pp. 545-60; Hani Gor6 gfifi:HM, Sato Nobuhiro ni kansuru Kisoteki Kenkya ft -MS tfB 14 t, Iwanami, 1929, pp. 94-96; Hironaga, in NdgyJ oyobi Engei, ix:9 (1934), p. 108.</page><page sequence="25">ROBERTSON: Sexy Rice 257 Sat6 was mainly interested in the theoretical underpinnings of agricultural administration and, while basically supportive of the Konishi-Miyaoi school, put forward his own novel explication of plant gender. He reversed the premise of gender-based selection in general and advocated the superiority of 'male' seeds and plants. In his view, the superior qualities of a plant did not derive from its intrinsic femaleness; rather, superiority inhered in a plant's maleness. Sata did more than shift synonyms for superiority, as Okura might have accused him of doing. Instead, evoking complicated and abstract arguments, he challenged the common- sense rationale for linking femaleness with superior attributes.56 His eccentric views, however, remained outside the context of the plant-gender debate for Somoku Rokubu KoshuhJ, completed in 1829, was not published and circulated until 1874, more than twenty years after Sato's death. Grass-Roots Nativism Atsutane sought to increase the centrifugal force of nativist thought by widening the scope of its informing sources and audience. He promulgated a theological kokugaku that was augmented by and affirmed popular beliefs and practices, in- cluding gender-based seed and plant categorization. Somo no kokugaku appropriated such everyday routines as praying to the kami every morning, and such folkway motifs as the central importance to the community of the ujigami Fit (tutelary kami), ancestor worship and the omnipresence of the ancestral spirits, the conti- guity between this world and the afterworld, the autonomy and self-sufficiency of the village, and the relationship between human and agricultural fertility.57 Atsutane's cosmological precepts also were inspired by folk religion, particularly the dosojin 3MliP creed. Dosojin are regarded as, among other things, manifesta- tions of the-creation kami and are popular symbols of fertility and marital (sexual) bliss. Their usual form is that of a carved stone relief of two figures, male and female, depicted in a posture of erotic embrace. Atsutane situated these various credos within the sjmJ no kokugaku context, imbuing them with cosmological significance. By collaborating with the farm manualists among the Ibukinoya members and sympathizers, he attempted to shape and regulate the way in which ordinary Japanese interpreted and re-enacted the routine features of their everyday lives. His strategy to 'gain control of the countryside' was essentially one of affective (re)socialization. Atsutane and his colleagues undertook to construct a new, alternative world-view as a precondition of social reform. Their first step was to recontextualize the diverse life-styles, customs, beliefs, and practices of the farming populace within a gender-bound theology. 56 Sato, Somoku Rokubu Kdshuha; Tanaka Koji Hi rP#J, 'Gakusha no Nisho: "Somoku Rokubu Koshuho"' o*16 F:f* 9iJ, in Iinuma Jir6 P zz-]3, ed., Kinsei Nosho ni Manabu i NHK Bukkusu 271, 1977, pp. 188-206. 5 See Numada Tetsu EM , 'Somd no Kokugaku to Hirata Atsutane' V-# r*L Ed)XAL, Geppo 7, p. 6, in Shinsha Hirata Atsutane Zensha W flXALA~A, Hirata Atsutane Zenshfi Kankokai, 1977.</page><page sequence="26">258 Monumenta Nipponica, xxxix:3 Atsutane was apprehensive of the increasing disorder in the countryside. Blame was placed on the social ramifications of cash-crop agriculture, such as the decline of cooperation and an emphasis on short-term transactions. There was also the devastation wrought by crop failures, the most severe ones during Atsutane's lifetime occurring in the 1780s and 1830s. Atsutane began in earnest to propagate kokugaku throughout the countryside in 1816, when he embarked on a recruitment tour of the Tonegawa region northeast of Edo. He geared his teachings toward the needs of the uneducated and often illiterate rural peoples. Farm manuals played a major role in familiarizing country folk with the gist of Hirata-school cosmology. Atsutane provided nisho authors with a cognitive framework within which to con- ceive and implement their village revitalization programs. Likewise, the plant- gender debate, in full swing by 1830, provided Atsutane with the language necessary for the popular dissemination of Hirata kokugaku. One main reason for his strategy of utilizing farm manuals was the difficulty he had in expanding his school in Edo, owing to the many social reform movements and religious sects waging recruitment campaigns there.58 Atsutane also regarded his collaboration with farm manualists as an expedient means of generating much-needed capital to cover his substantial debts. The Ibukinoya thus doubled as a publishing house, and Atsutane, with Kanetane, consulted with and entertained a number of farm-manual writers, proofread and edited their texts, contracted with woodblock carvers and printers, and distributed their nisho throughout Japan via his network of disciples. Farm manuals proved to be an effective means of introducing Hirata kokugaku to the potential fund- 58 Atsutane's chief 'competitors' in Edo were the Nichiren F X and Ikko -rXJ sects, which ran tightly organized local associations as well. Other rivals included the Fujik6 &amp;-?X and Hotokukyo Bilk missions, Sei(ri)gaku 19(fft and the Shingaku LX movement, all of which sought a following among the farming peoples.

Unlike Atsutane, who employed the offices of village leaders and Shinto priests in pro- pagating grass-roots nativism, YeIgaku worked from the bottom up in initiating sweeping social reforms. This approach jeopardized the authority of local officials, who finally ex- pelled Yiigaku from Osabe mura, Katori gun, Shimosa, where he had been working. Haga, p. 678.

Atsutane was dependent upon them for raising or donating funds used to cover his publication ex- penses, and for providing his household with such bare necessities as food and clothing.59 Well over half of the Ibukinoya membership comprised financially solvent farmers, followed by country merchants. The members included village headmen, landlords, wealthy farm householders, provincial officials, and post-station innkeepers. Shinto priests, city merchants, doctors, and lastly, samurai, made up the remaining membership. The majority of the 550 names recorded in the Ibukinoya roll book during Atsutane's lifetime were of persons from Shimosa, Kazusa, Musashi, Suruga, and Echigo provinces. Throughout the 1820s Shimasa proved to be Atsutane's provincial stronghold, no doubt owing to Miyaoi's assiduous propaganda and recruitment efforts there. Subsequent to Atsutane's exile to Ugo in 1840, the numbers of Ibukinoya members from there and neigh- boring Uzen increased. In the decades following his death, the Ibukinoya-now directed by Kanetane-grew by 3,733 members, many of them from Shinano and Mino provinces.60 Atsutane sought to draw ruralists into the kokugaku fold. His emphasis on practi- cal and religious studies bespoke his concern for the welfare of the rural populace. The process of 'gaining control of the countryside' was a reciprocal one. Atsutane's interest in rural customs and his working relationship with several nosho authors effectively helped him turn kokugaku toward a theory of practice. Just as modern- day village change-agents have discovered, the selection of a propaganda medium that is emotionally and culturally meaningful to rural peoples is central to the success of a revitalization program. Atsutane's appropriation of the popular prac- tice of gender-based plant categorization shows that his efforts to revitalize villages were in accord with the practical knowledge of farmers and the routine features of their lives. By the same token, in conjoining Atsutane's cosmological precepts with agricultural techniques, the nosho authors in effect pursued a practice of theory. Conclusion Considerable attention was given to the practice of gender-based seed and plant categorization by farmers, agricultural consultants, and nisho writers of the Edo period. Nativists of the Hirata school appropriated the practice, itself an applica- tion of common-sense reasoning, to demonstrate the dyadic construction of the universe to their rural audiences.

He also put his cosmological precepts to an 'experimental test' of sorts, albeit indirectly, by citing the findings of veteran farmers that 'female' seeds and plants were superior and yielded bumper harvests. In this way, Atsutane sought to present his ideas as a systematic and unified body of applied thought. Herein lies the reason for his cooptation of the farm manualists, for it was through their agricultural background and empirical experiments that he aimed to establish and sustain the facticity of a social reality in which there are only two genders. Through the auspices of somo no kokugaku, Atsutane advanced his view that cos- mological precepts were prior to scientific concepts in the agricultural domain. Okura Nagatsune ignored the cosmological significance of gender-based categorization and put forward the opposite thesis. He had no quarrel with the premises of gender-based selection-that is, the selection of superior seeds and plants-but denounced as preposterous the attribution of gender to plants accord- ing to their 'gross morphology'. In other words, he frowned on the intrusion of cosmological imperatives into what was to him a purely scientific matter. The main difference between Okura and Atsutane may be summarized as follows. Okura abandoned yin-yang theory when its cognitive value was surpassed by that of microscopy; contrarily, the emotional, religious needs that shaped the content of Atsutane's sexual theology and motivated grass-roots nativism prevented him from following suit. For Atsutane, common-sense rationalities and emotional needs were a resource; for Okura, they were not. The fact that two leading personalities of the late Edo period, and also their predecessors and contemporaries, debated the pros and cons of plant gender signals the problematic and controversial nature of the gender-attribution process. This popular practice was the source of one of the more patently ideological issues aired and deliberated in the nosho genre. Embedded in the somo no kokugaku con- text, plant-gender theory acquired a cogency beyond the rationale for gender-based seed and plant categorization. And, cast in an agricultural idiom, Atsutane's cosmological notions assumed a significance beyond the purely intellectual.</page></plain_text>
