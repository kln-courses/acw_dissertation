Luis Manuel N??ez's Santer?a Stories offers twenty pages of information about Santeria deities and some instructions on divination and offerings, but is largely a retelling of oral stories gleaned from "many followers of the religion" {Santeria Stories 393-94). It is not a scholarly work per se; it uses no citations and offers a truncated bibliography of four authors. But neither is it folkloric in Lydia Cabrera's sense of reporting fieldwork; N??ez takes the literary liberties of a storyteller. His earlier Santeria: A Practical Guide to Afro Caribbean Magic is a "how-to" book that utilizes the work of four additional authors. They therefore raise interesting questions about the relationship between orality and scholar ship. Read together, they bookend a troubled syncretic site where racialized, sexualized perceptions of a controversial diaspora religion meet up with would-be practitioners who seek quick-fixes and thrills rather than guidance from elders. The name Santeria denotes a group of religions, originally developed by West Africans enslaved in Cuba, which has spread as many variant branches throughout the world. The travails of slavery and continued migration help account for diverse theology and praxes. With familial similarities derived from Yoruba indigenous religion, divergent branches began with, and tend to be more or less rooted in, the need for "survival by way of resistance to a dominant culture" (De la Torre 845). Questions appropriate to books about this cluster of religions therefore include "in what ways is the work grounded in the history of slavery and accompanying dominant belief systems, in scholarship about and /or experience of Yoruba philosophy and the development of diverse diaspora beliefs and praxes?"; "what registrations of which shifts and resistance does it analyze or reference?"; and "where is it coming from, and who is it written for?" Michael Ventura provides a well-researched five page Introduction to A Practical Guide which offers minimal context. According to Ventura it is written for "you and I," not to encourage us to "start killing chickens" but to "remind us that [in Yoruba] the sacred is" 307</page><page sequence="2">CALLALOO neither "dead" nor predicated on the "Cartesian mind-body split." He also argues that the Yoruba concept of sacrifice is a necessary challenge to "an economics [ . . . ] which rewards selfishness" (viii) and offers remedy to the sacrifice of "the very ecology of the planet," (vi) of "huge segments of the population to poverty" (ix). This promising begin ning is followed by four pages of Historical Notes in which N??ez provides his sense of context and also invites us all: "neither skin color nor language is a barrier" {Santer?a 1). This book, then, is ostensibly written for everyone. But N??ez never delivers the remedy that Ventura promises. Instead he describes a religion of "throbbing" drums and adds his own promise to tell us about "blood, and sex" (Santer?a 1). This he delivers in abundance in Stories. Stories begins with two pages explaining that Yoruba religion and Cuban Catholic endorsed mutual aid societies converged as Santer?a, while A Practical Guide encapsulates Nunez's sense of the intimate side of history : "nannies croon African Apatakis. White babies fall asleep, the stories of the gods in their ears. The babies grow up. [ . . . ] They believe [ . . . ] white men have black lovers. Beautiful black women bite their ears. They learn to respect Chango" (San teria 4). These kinds of problematic tropes of African women as seminal mothers and as fiercely seductive lovers have been exhaustively chronicled, for example in books such as Janell Hobson's Venus in the Dark (2005). In this too familiar vein, according to Nunez's version of Santeria, Africa has been seductively transmitted to Spaniards in the most intimate settings, and, like Joe in Sankofa, is born as their conflicted child. The rest of A Practical Guide is concerned with the specific praxes of a particular branch of Santeria, while Stories delivers an oral literature that is, in a sense, Joe's version of his parents. The conversion of exploitation and rape to a romanticized union in which the master respects the god of, but not the body of, the slave?and one may well ask, what kind of "respect" is a master capable of??the displacement of the body of believer as black female by white male?shifts the original set of critical questions to a different set of queries. The main question becomes "how does Nunez's version of Santeria register what shifts and signs of struggle with which dominant schemata?" He characterizes the practitioner as "a devout Roman Catholic at the same time as he is sacrificing a rooster to a cement image of Elegua enthroned behind the front door" (Santeria 3). This and rape reveal exactly which dominant schema, inflicted by whom, activated the shifts. Understanding what has shifted, however, requires more information about the "sophisticated culture" of the Yoruba than N??ez provides in mere paragraphs (Santeria Stories 11). It is worth perusing some background in order to clarify this change in critical approach. Yorubaland (largely Nigeria and parts of Benin and Togo) is the place of origin of the African core of most branches of Santeria. However, this does not mean that there was a reified "original" version of the religion in Yorubaland that fractured as the many branches of Santeria. Rather, Yoruba religion has always emphasized local responses to local condi tions, and a certain amount of improvisation is built into Yoruba theology, so that practices vary from He Ife to Ode Remo, from Oyo to Abeokuta. The majority of Yoruba practitioners in Africa were traditionally, and continue to be, initiated to the praxes and liturgy of one or more lineages. Differences are thus not the result of insularity, and African practitioners tend to be familiar and comfortable with diverse expressions, and, indeed, worship as a whole is comprised of interdependent parts. Most enslaved persons therefore carried their part of what was originally whole in the context of extended communities, yet due to this 308</page><page sequence="3">CALLALOO in-built flexibility devotees relocated in Cuba were well prepared to maintain some aspect of practice under the most radically oppressive of circumstances.1 Still, and despite new Yoruba arrivals in Cuba as recently as the late nineteenth century, forcible divisions of families and generation after generation of subsequent divisions increased the challenge and resulted in splintering. Practices such as communal oral transmission?for example the four-day ceremony in which the entire literary corpus2 is recited, with an approving chant at the end of each line by elders?were impossible to maintain. If practice is varied in Yorubaland, it is more so in diaspora, yet perhaps each frag ment is capable of acting as a prism and reflecting the whole. For example, N??ez writes, "Babalu-Aye has become the Orisha [deity] of miraculous healing and compassion in the Caribbean, but he was greatly feared in Africa since he owns smallpox, leprosy, and now AIDS" (Santeria Stories 377). His necklace is described as "white with blue streaks," and in some Nigerian/Brazilian houses those colors belong to his mother, Nana Buruku (Santeria Stories 377; Solaye Epega). In Yorubaland, it is generally she who is credited with healing. One can only begin to imagine the method by which this shift from mother-healer to father-healer occurred. Perhaps a devotee who had the ase (pronounced "ah-shay," the life force in specific energetic pattern) of Babalu-Aye but not Nana?who would have worked with a priest of Nana in Yorubaland?had to heal without benefit of Nana and improvised accordingly. If it worked once, it would be done again, yet transmission of the trajectory of change may have been lost under conditions of relocation or death. One point of significance drawn from this is that while Santeria does maintain several key Yoruba philosophical paradigms, these are attenuated as the result of dealing with dislocation and enforced Christianity under the strictures of slavery. But in accord with the Yoruba perspective of local practices, instead of thinking in terms of "right" and "wrong" systems, "lost" and "found" systems, one can begin with the premise that differing systems may all work within themselves to broach the numinous. This inclusive perspective is accorded credence amongst varying branches of Santeria. For example, when a diviner receives the sign Oyekun, that is, when four pieces of coconut, ritually thrown to answer a question, all fall dark side up, according to N??ez's system the answer is "a very bad sign which announces [... ] evil influences," "death and suffering," (Santeria 83; Santeria Stories 85). In other Santeria houses it simply means the answer to the question is "no." In yet other houses, it means that the dead?the ancestors?wish to speak, and when it arises in certain Nigerian practices, people praise it, saying it refers to the power of motherhood. Perhaps the relationship between the last two is that the dead re-enter the world via reincarnation. Be that as it may, things shift in translation from one language to another?for example the gender-free word for God in Yoruba may be translated as He in English or Spanish?yet may still render effective guidance for resis tance when used within a coherent system. Members of differing systems do not tend to perceive these differences in competition; members of one house will instruct members in other houses to defer to the teachings of their own elders. Yet the specificity of what has shifted and how it has shifted calls for examination. In Stories, for example, God can be literally Biblical: "He said, 'Let there be light'"?and the deities themselves are no longer black, so that their emotions register on their faces in shades of red and purple (Santeria Stories 14, 126). At times N??ez frankly states that he is retelling a "classic Catholic story"; at other times he claims to be telling an "old African 309</page><page sequence="4">CALLALOO story" (Santeria Stories 136, 138). There is acknowledgement of colonization. There is no devil in Yoruba, but "The devil appeared before them and said 'There will be no rain until you bow to me and forget the other Orishas.' The people of Oyo shuddered in fear but they said, 'We honor the Orishas as our ancestors did'" (Santeria Stories 268). Examina tion of Nunez's books allows examination of the extent to which this branch of Santeria succeeded in resistance. The idea of sacrifice has always loomed large in imaginings about Santeria, so it's a good place to start. In Stories there is a sacrifice in almost every tale, and in A Practical Guide N??ez provides nineteen detailed pages of ceremonial sacrifices that, generally speaking, only initiates may attend and / or perform. All Santeria calls for ebo?the "doing" of sacrifice, or making sacred, well articulated by Ventura?and Santeria elders in many branches tend to suggest beginning with something simple, a fruit or a yam. N??ez himself focuses heavily on blood, and his Practical Guide calls for fresh blood at every single cowrie divination session, an emphasis on animal sacrifice that is both economically prohibitive and highly unusual. The deity stories N??ez tells in fifty pages of the Practical Guide are replete with lists of favored ingredients that can only be usefully utilized by knowledge able initiates. While Stories contains more varied sacrifices, almost every tale emphasizes the violent or tricky ascension to power of one force over another. That this is more than registration of political imperialism is suggested by the way tales and oracles in both books so often circulate around guilt and punishment in a way that is gendered and racialized. Stories confirms A Practical Guide's theme of punishments that are "very terrible and painful," especially for "those who do not follow the religion" (Santeria 31, 46). According to A Practical Guide, Babalu-Aye's ability to cure disease arose after he did the severe penance of suffering leprosy for a lack of "control over [sexual] desire [for women]" that N??ez characterizes as "frivolous" (Santeria 61-62; Santeria Stories 44). In Stories he is limping, shunned, covered with suppurating sores and lives in continual regret of his copulation. As corollary to this association of woman with temptation, sin, and taint, the role of Babalu-Aye's mother, Nana Buruku as healer has been obliterated. "Evil influences" are described with racially loaded rhetoric, such as "weaving a black web" (Santeria 68; repeated in Santeria Stories 284). In a story about Eleggua and a coconut, Olodumare?God?makes the coconut white to "match your goodness," then punishes wrongdoing by making it "roll through the mud and dirt until you are black outside"; in other stories "envy" and "ambition" made protagonists' "thoughts black" and "blackened [their] heartsfs]" (Santeria Stories 72,284,354). In "The Oracle" of the Practical Guide a divi nation sign, which in other systems means "this person must appeal to the ancestors for a good life," in Nunez's account means "a black, evil dead soul is tormenting you" (Fatunmbi 47; Santeria 104).3 These notions?sin, male prominence, and the idea of blackness as evil, have no roots in Yoruba and are clearly imposed from Catholicism. Indeed, the last seems to raise the specter of Spanish guilt reciprocated by highly effective haunting on the part of an occluded African ancestor of the religion. Reading between readings, they would only be "evil" as long as they were ignored rather than respected. A Practical Guide provides "Talismans, Spells, and Implorations," recipes that tell the reader "how to" accomplish various ends. Some provide succor by healing illnesses or clearing thoughts, but the largest category by far consists of "curses" (Santeria 121). While some curses may denote resistance?to kill an enemy or keep the police away may be an 310</page><page sequence="5">CALLALOO act of agency under oppression?many ironically foster the selfsame "evil" of "desire" that the deity stories warn against. These curses are designed to break up marriages, to control not one's own desire but the desire of another, to make a man impotent, or to bind a lover. Thus dualistic ambiguity about the fact of desire is encoded in N??ez's Santeria praxes, so that while he more than fulfills his initial promise of religious bloodletting, in A Practical Guide "sex" turns out to refer to the human lust of practitioners. And while Stories is full of tales of the sexual exploits of deities, they convey more about Spanish Catholic gender roles than they do about Yoruba concepts of humanity or divinity. In one story N??ez writes, "you created men and that is good. But you also created women and that is not so good. You can reason with men" (Santeria Stories 63). The Orisa, the deities, are exaggeratedly humanized in the sense that to be human is to err, and in very specific ways according to anatomy. N??ez's "Shango" and "Oggun," male Orisa, are hot tempered and violent, while the female Orisa are sexual temptresses (Oshun and Yemoja), martyr-like mothers (Yemoja), faithful wives (Obba), or "pure" virgins who are punished horribly upon deflowerment (Yeggua) (Santeria Stories 300). Only Oya and Obatala straddle the great divide. But even Oya, a female warrior, doesn't "open the door to anyone without my husband's permission," and Obatala's androgyny is resolved into two characters, male and female (Santeria Stories 166). N??ez would do well to consider Lydia Cabrera's finesse when she describes Yemoja as "andr?gino, de sexo anfibio. Asi se dice El mar. Y hem bra, La Mar"?androgynous, of amphibious sex. "Thus we say The Sea [with masculine pronoun]. And The Sea, [with feminine pronoun]" (Cabrera, Yemaya 28, my translation). Yemoja wears warrior's clothing, bears a machete, and fights alongside her son Shango. Cabrera had to break Spanish pronoun rules to make her point, yet Yemoja doesn't change sex when she changes clothing or behavior; women can be "warriors and mothers at once" (Olajubu 85). Machete in hand, Yemoja remains a female and Shango's mother. Then again, Yemoja is not a woman?she is the spirit of the Sea. Sadly, N??ez plays into the worst stereotypes of African Diaspora religions. Tropes of Voodoo, often figured by a "throbbing" male drummer or a priest stirring up a cauldron of purportedly African "curses," are well known. While the freight of sexualized blackness or racialized sexuality that Voodoo bears in the cultural imaginary is gendered according to notions of hyper-masculinity, Santeria bears the fraught burden of inter-racialized inter sexuality. In Santeria Afrophobia is complicated by the religion's perceived hybridity, by fear of miscegenation and a homophobic response to the gender fluidity that is performed as part of its religious praxes. The figure of the Santero/a is discomfiting because his/her Afro-Latino face is read as deceptively disguising or hiding "Africa." Thus Santeria, as it is portrayed in cultural imaginary texts such as television and film, circulates around a racialized, sexualized figure that becomes especially terrifying because it refuses to be statically male or female, African or European. Both Edward Humes?in Buried Secrets, his book on Adolf o de Costanza, a Cubanbisexual who self-identified as a Santero and committed the ritualistic Matamoros murders?and Ventura, in the Introduction to the book reviewed here?tie this terror to Latino immigra tion. As Ventura writes, "Latin American immigration to the United States shows no sign of abating, so Santeria will become more and more a part of American life" (v). Ventura posits this as reason to learn something, to explore "how we've gone slack, how we've become hypocritical and dull to what was best in our traditional [sic] religions" (x). But 311</page><page sequence="6">CALLALOO Humes asserts that "the unique black-magic amoral aspects of [... ] Santeria will continue to attract criminals [... ] drugs and violence?inevitably will rise" (Humes 376). Nunez's Practical Guide does too little to further the former and even less to counter the latter, what with its pages of "curses." In sum, A Practical Guide is a book that tells solitary, untrained readers how to perform a communal, elder-guided set of practices. Self-described as pragmatic, it consists of praxes split off from their grounding philosophy of intergenerational transmission, and therefore not surprisingly, rather than offering a paradigmatic difference that could remedy the social and ecological ills Santeria resists, they are termed magic. This attempt to "open the western mind," then, allows it to remain split off from the body politic (Santeria cover blurb). Stories is less overtly problematic yet encodes the same issues. It can be read as a comfortable set of stories for the Western mind, with some delightful turns of phrase and adaptations. For example, "[the Couple Who Created] were [ . . . ] larger than can be imagined because size did not exist," and a poor man slept on "a piece of cardboard" (Santeria Stories 25,306). As a set of stories it succeeds in utilizing varied versions of events to construct consistent and entertaining deities. But it does so by playing up flaws, by flat tening them into stereotypical anthropomorphic caricatures. Like the pages of curses in A Practical Guide, the tricky deities in Stories, often violent and capricious troublemakers, confirm Humes's fears of amorality. It is therefore a problematic representation of Santeria that reflects its problems back onto Africa. To return to Ventura's concern for ecology and the exploited, one might well question the value of a model of good /evil along the worst possible human lines. Orisa are, after all, nature?they are the interrelated 401 divine/ natural/ethical forces that together comprise what is called, for simplicity's sake, God, in "a nonanthropomorphic form of theism" that still has clear presence in some versions of Santeria (Verger 36). In such versions Shango, situated at the juncture of nature and ethics, is lightning and justice, not a blowhard, selfish bully. If one were to generously take the notions of good and evil, of black and white, of male and female as the signs of a conflicted birth that is open to reconciliation, one would still be left with the ultimate problem of these books according to Nunez's own terms. Ventura refers to the fact that Santeria praxis is largely communal, and N??ez notes that "It's very important that everything be the way the Elders did it" (Santeria 19). He often states that what he describes cannot be performed without initiation. Yet A Practical Guide largely consists of these proscribed practices. Generally speaking, such praxes are conveyed from elders to novitiates via active participation, and it is considered, at the very least, bad form to discuss them with those who have not experienced them first hand. This has to do with membership in community and with the requirement of presence that stymies the mind-body split, a split furthered by sitting in your living room reading not about, but how to do something that is meant to be fully experienced with others. The community is missing and the elders are missing.4 This and related problems are registered in the way the Stories are told. For example, Julio Garcia-Cortez tells the tale of how the parrot feather became sacred in Pataki: Leyendas y Misterios de los Orishas Africanos. In his version "el viejo Lechuza," the elderly owl, counsels the community against an error, and when they don't heed her advice "Fue La Lechuza quien le narr?," it was the Owl who told God what had happened (Garcia-Cortez 54, 56). In Nunez's version the owl is not even present and the birds have no guidance. La Lechuza?a bird of the Elder Mothers of the 312</page><page sequence="7">CALLALOO Night?has disappeared. While Yoruba tradition venerates the Elder Mothers, in N??ez "no woman would admit to being old" (Santeria Stories 63). While this may be read as a simple shift in narration, the absence of the female awake in the dark is the ultimate core of the tale that N??ez tells. And this trope of absence reiterates occlusion of "the dark continent of [the] body" of "Mama Africa" (White; Oyewumi). ?Menoukha Case NOTES 1. For more on how and why changes occurred and practices continued, see Joseph Murphy, David Brown, and George Brandon. 2. This consists of many thousands of verses that encode interlaced history, medicine, stories, proverbs, and other forms of sacred liturgy. 3. That the sign Eyife has two sides of white coconut showing in one book and three in the other does not engender confidence in N??ez's exposition on praxes (Santeria 81; Santeria Stories 84). 4. For example, from an academic standpoint, there are no citations at all. WORKS CITED Brandon, George.
