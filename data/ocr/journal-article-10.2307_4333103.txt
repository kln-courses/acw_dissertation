<plain_text><page sequence="1">Simple Like Genesis THE MIRACULOUS BIRTH OF LANGUAGE. By Richard Albert Wilson. Preface by George Bernard Shaw. Philosophical Library. $3.75 T HIS book may score a popular success. If it does, there will be three obvious reasons: (1) The subject is in high vogue at present; (2) the author's philosophical fancies (which he calls "hypotheses," though they are not hypothetical at all) and the loose, rhetorical strings of his reason- ing are exactly what the average man is familiar with from the pulpit and the more serious sort of round-table talk; (3) George Bernard Shaw has written the preface. The first of these reasons involves a very interesting fact, namely, that even in so little-known a field as philosophy the general public has an</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 689 instinctive penchant for what is really important and promising-a vague excitement about ideas that it cannot understand, but that actually consti- tute the most vital portion, the growing tip of contemporary thought. This speaks well for the public; its intuitions are sound even where its learning is pathetically weak. The problem of language is indeed a central issue in modern philosophy, and the somewhat faddish popular excitement about "semantics" echoes the deep stir of new ideas in the realm of more competent and systematic thought. The second reason is, of course, a less happy one. As a serious work, a professed contribution to philosophy, the book scarcely rates a long review, despite the fact that the present reviewer happens to be in agreement with Professor Wilson's main points, namely: the radical difference between language properly so-called and any sort of communication practised among animals, the dependence of our "world," which is a continuum of space- time events, on the power of thought that only language can bestow, and the dialectic of permanence and flux that characterizes all conscious experi- ence and is symbolically epitomized in language. All these points have been made, and treated far more cogently and profoundly by other writers, with whom Professor Wilson seems to be unacquainted. His "miraculous" emergence of language from a purposive, self-made World, at the bidding of a "Life-Force," tells us nothing at all about how language actually arose; compared with such works as Heinz Werner's Die Metaphor or Philip Wegener's Untersuchungen fiber die Grundfragen des Sprachlebens, it is no more than a vague "appreciation" of the fact that language did in- deed develop, that it occurred in due time in the order of things, and what- ever caused it must have caused the whole order (which last tenet is neither self-evident nor logically deducible). The book consists of two parts, one entitled "Clearing the Way," the other "The New Investigation." In the first the author is fighting against Darwin and Max Muller, neither of whom stands particularly in the way of modern epistemology and linguistics any more; the neo-positivists with their scientific language, their "material mode" or semi-scientific language, and their "emotive" language of poetic nonsense, who do sometimes ob- struct the progress of philosophical studies of language, imagination, culture, etc., do not seem to have got in his way yet. As for "The New Investigation," which forms his second part, it is far from new. Anyone might miss such small, howbeit important, books as Werner's or Wege- ner's; but how can one miss Croce's Aestheiic as the Sciencze of General</page><page sequence="3">690 KENYON REVIEW Linguistic, Urban's Language and Reality, or-above all-Cassirer's great Philosophie der Symbolischen Formen? Professor Wilson says: "So far as I know no attempt has been made to explore the nature of language in relation to space and time." Cassirer's three volumes (the first one en- titled Die Sprache) not only attempt just this exploration, but carry it through with brilliant success. To say that modern linguistic science has not recovered from Darwin's evil influence is certainly to overlook half a century of highly original and important work. But it is not only in respect to the literature of his subject that the author is in arrears; the entire metaphysical content of the book reminds one of the dear old undergraduate arguments. "If the parts of the bird's body were not purposively combined into a purposive organism, then they must have come together by chance." This has the authentic ring of dormitory conversations. Paley's parable of the gold watch on a desert island follows as naturally as, a page further on, the introduction of a "prime vital activity" instead of God, because "the word 'God' connotes in the minds of most people an anthropomorphic agency," etc., etc. The only startling feature of the world-view which finally results from this familiar reasoning is that it embraces both transcendentalism and positiv- ism, Kant's conception of Space and Time and also Newton's! I think the case is unique in the history of eclecticism. After man has become conscious and free he has a mental world; and Professor Wilson tells us explicitly that this mental world corresponds to Kant's exposition of space and time, "where he showed that these are forms of the mind. All our experience of the world arranges itself there in these two media." And then he says: "I am assuming, however . . . that there is a real or sensuous space-time world in which physical objects actually exist independent of the perceiving mind, and which was already highly actualized before the birth of free and conscious mind with its ideal space and time that came into being with it. This ideal, non-sensuous, mental space-time world is . .the conscious duplicate or counterpart of the real, sensuous, material, 'inconscious' [sic, throughout the book) space-time world of nature." "Obviously, what man required was a system of mental symbols of some kind to represent the system of actual types in the outward world of sense." And so "man" invented language to serve this purpose: a word for each idea. Later he invented writing to "spatialize," i.e. preserve, language; and he made a letter for each sound. It is all as simple as Genesis.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 691 One naturally asks why George Bernard Shaw should wish to write a preface to so weak a treatise. The answer is, I think, that in the first place Mr. Shaw likes to write prefaces; the Preface, as he employs it, is not a part of a book, but is a literary form in its own right, like the Editorial, that used to be a mere formal feature of the newspaper. In the second place, Professor Wilson says some very sound things about language, in the few pages (206 to 228) that he devotes specifically to that subject. The power of conventional vocables to fix distinct ideas, the permanence which language bestows on experience that, without it, would be mere flux, the great increase in such permanence which is achieved by the art of writing- these are interesting observations, though they are not thoroughly devel- oped. The little disquisition on writing, almost the last thing in the book, gives Mr. Shaw his opening to present an essay on the reform of alphabetical rendering, which deserves to be judged on its own merits. Shaw's thesis is, in essence, that we waste an inordinate amount of time writing two or more letters for one sound; that, since letters do not directly and unequivocally represent sounds, people pronounce them as they like, so that every locality and every social group develops its own pronunciation of English; that an alphabet for which "the rule is to be One Sound One Letter, with every letter unmistakably different from all the others," would not only save hours of writing, but would eliminate vulgarisnis and provincialisms in speech, since people could not say gah- oold for gold or !ay for tea "if it became impossible for us to learn to read and write without all learning to speak in the same way." The old alphabet of 26 letters is incapable of rendering all English phonemes; we should need at least 42 to represent our spoken language in visual terms. The little essay ends with the usual flash of Shavian nonsense contain- ing a core of wisdom. "The only danger I can foresee in the establishment of an English alphabet," says Mr. Shaw, "is the danger of civil war. Our present spelling is incapable of indicating the sounds of our words and does not pretend to do so; but the new spelling would prescribe an official pronunciation." But when we abolish, say, the silly spelling of h-e-i-g-h-t, "and we have to decide whether the official pronunciation shall be hite or hyth, there will probably be a sanguinary class war; for in this case the proletarian custom is more logical than the Oxford one." The core of wisdom in this fantastic prediction is enough to shatter the whole pretty structure of his rational-spelling dream, and with it Professor Wilson's oversimplified theory of the origins of writing. The</page><page sequence="5">692 KENYON REVIEW very power of written language lies in the fact that it does not pretend to fix the sound of speech; just as the secret of spoken language is that it does not require us to have a name for every item of experience. We have a word for every class of such items, and the class concept is not entirely determinate. This leeway makes it possible to assimilate novel experiences to the permanent world built by language. Similarly, in writing-the spatial symbolization of speech-we have letters, or conventional groups of letters, for various classes of phonemes, but the classes are not too pre- cisely defined; new meanings may be assimilated to the old symbolic forms, so that writing fixes the language pattern and yet allows for novelty. A living language is always changing; the laws of vowel shift, of Umlaut and Ablaut and consonant variation, are natural laws, not vagaries, and only a dead language could be immutably fixed by a legalized spelling. The elasticity of alphabetical rendering is actually a virtue, whereby writing can enhance the organic unity and permanence of language, carrying the symbols of its past through periods of great mutation and dropping them only when new forms are firmly enough entrenched to supplant them, and yet can permit actual speech, the symbol of thought, to develop historically, and grow in its own free ways with the advance of human reason.
