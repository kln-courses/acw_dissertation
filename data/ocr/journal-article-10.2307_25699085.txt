<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Darien Gold Pendants of Ancient Colombia and the Isthmus ANA MARIA FALCHETTI Independent Researcher, Member of the Academia Colombiana de Historia Precolumbian metallurgy on the American continents represents more than three thousand years of continu ous production. The technology of metalworking was developed during the first millennium B.C. in the central Andean area of South America corresponding to present day Peru. Metallurgical knowledge was established in southwestern Colombia by the latter half of the first millen nium B.C., reaching the Central American isthmus by the time of Christ and the Mesoamerican area some centuries later. In the context of the rich and diverse inventory of Precolumbian metallurgy and of continuous contact among different cultural areas, a particular category of objects linked numerous communities that lived and developed complex societies in an extensive area of the American con tinents. This phenomenon is represented by the so-called Darien pendants, a specific kind of ornament consisting of anthropomorphic figures adorned with distinctive ceremo nial regalia. Local variants of this iconographic representa tion were manufactured and used from northern South America (Colombia) to Yucatan (Mexico) during a period that extended from the last centuries B.C. to the seventeenth century A.D. The largest number of Darien pendants were produced in western and northern Colombia. During many centuries, the Darien region, on the border between the present repub lics of Colombia and Panama, served as an important route for contacts between northern South America and the Central American isthmus and the exchange of metallurgi cal knowledge. The name "Darien" was introduced for the first time in 1950 by Carlos Margain, based on the origin of a number of metal objects that had been found in the Pacific region of Colombia south of the Darien area.1 The name is commonly used in the literature on Precolumbian metallurgy, including works that refer specifically to these figures.2 A number of stereotypic diagnostic features identify the anthropomorphic figures known as Darien pendants (Figures 1, 2): two semispherical upper headdress ornaments; winged appendages at the sides of both ears; a face with animal features, such as a protruding snout and a turned-up nose; a loincloth; schematic legs and feet; and two staffs held by the figure that usually end below the mouth. As the figures went through different stages of schematization, their numerous variants included some of the diagnostic features of Darien pendants in spite of the local technical, stylistic, and iconographic preferences. This study is based on an examination of more than two hundred Darien pendants from different regions of Colombia in the collection of the Museo del Oro del Banco de la Republica in Bogota. It also includes nine objects in The Metropolitan Museum of Art and some examples with recorded provenances that belong to other museums (see Appendix). Study of Darien pendants is unfortunately limited by the lack of archaeological context for most of the objects. However, with a large group of diverse pendants from a wide area, it has been possible to obtain a good deal of information from the objects themselves through a system atic examination of their stylistic, iconographic, and techni cal features, as well as the different combinations of these characteristics in their association with particular regions. This study demonstrates the presence of patterns or types that can be linked specifically to local metallurgical work from different geographical areas and time periods. In addi tion, the results of more than thirty years of research carried out on the extensive collection of Precolumbian metalwork belonging to the Museo del Oro (33,947 objects at present) have made it possible to establish distinctive characteristics of the various regional styles and to link them to cultural developments as reconstructed through archaeological research in these gold-working areas.

In Amerindian societies, metals were not valued as a source of material wealth. Metal objects?and craft objects in general?were charged with religious meaning, and they represented a symbolic language based on mythical prin ciples that guided ritual activities, social relationships, and every aspect of human life. The information provided by Darien pendants offers interesting insight into the constant interaction and symbolic communication among ancient communities. Different metallurgical traditions merged to give origin to these stereotypic human figures, whose wide spread production and use extended beyond the boundar ies of local cultural areas and worldviews. THE DEVELOPMENT OF DARIEN PENDANTS AND THE EARLY METALLURGICAL TRADITION OF SOUTHWESTERN COLOMBIA (100 B.C.-A.D. 800) The oldest items related to the so-called Darien pendants are a number of metal pendants representing male humans wearing ritual ornaments, which belong to an important cultural development centered in southwestern Colombia during the period 100 B.C.-A.D. 800. In the communities in this area of considerable biodiversity, there developed a consolidation of ranked societies. From the jungles and mangrove areas of the Pacific coast, to the rugged and cold highlands of the Western and Central Mountain Ranges of the Andes in Colombia, to the temperate or warm valleys drained by the Cauca and Magdalena Rivers, the inhabit ants transformed the landscape in the process of organizing their settlements and practicing intensive agriculture. They exploited the area's rich sources of gold and were respon sible for an outstanding metallurgical production. The cul tural areas involved are known asTumaco-LaTolita, Calima, Malagana, Quimbaya, Tolima, San Agustm, Tierradentro, and Narino (Figure 3).3 In their basic technology, the southwestern Colombian objects that conform to the early metallurgical tradition are strongly related to the metallurgy of the central Andes, which shows a preference for shaping metal by working rather than by casting.4 The early southwestern metallurgy favored producing large hammered ornaments decorated with embossed designs from high-grade gold. Sheets of gold were also used to form three-dimensional objects by assem bling the sheets and fitting them together with small gold nails and folded metal tabs or by using heat to bond the metal parts. However, the metalworkers of southwestern Colombia also employed gold-copper alloys, usually known as tumbaga, preferring alloys high in gold content.5 Tumbaga 40</page><page sequence="3">3. Map of the gold-working Vv areas of Colombia (drawing: J y^pr Luis Guillermo Leon and ^^^^^ PACIFIC OCEAN fe^^ was used for casting objects by the lost-wax technique. As we will see, this technology was perfected especially in the Quimbaya area, and its influence was widely felt. The production of the earliest Darien pendants and related objects was linked particularly to the Calima area around the upper Calima and Dagua Rivers in the Western Mountain Range, the Choco district toward the Pacific low lands, the Quimbaya area in the mountainous region of the middle Cauca River, and, to a lesser extent, theTolima area centered on the middle reaches of the Magdalena River. However, it is in the first of these regions, Calima, where a group of anthropomorphic figures can perhaps be identified as the forebears of Darien pendants. They belong to the Yotoco period, which, according to available radiocarbon dates, covers the years 100 B.C.-A.D. 800.6 The "Ancestors" of Darien Pendants Among the numerous objects of early metallurgical produc tion in the Calima area, we can identify two groups of human figures whose characteristics merged to give origin to the particular items known as Darien pendants. In one group, a few small anthropomorphic pendants show the semispherical headdress ornaments, the staffs, and the ani mal features that are typical of Darien pendants. In the other, a number of realistic Yotoco adorned human figures display an attitude and body shape that represent a proto type reproduced in Darien pendants of the early period, although those figures do not include the diagnostic fea tures of Darien pendants.

Museo del Oro, Bogota (16637). Photographer: Clark Manuel Rodriguez represent one of the oldest patterns of Darien pendants (Type 1; Figures 4, 5, 16 no. 2). They are from the Calima heartland (Restrepo), although one (see Figure 16 no. 2) is said to have come from the Colombian Pacific watershed (Choco). One of these figures (Figure 4) was found at the site of San Salvador (Restrepo) among numerous grave goods that included ornaments in the most characteristic Yotoco style, such as diadems, nose ornaments, ear plugs, breast plates, and other objects made of beaten gold.7 These small Darien figures are solid castings in tumbaga.8 They are adorned with two semispherical headdress elements, in one case (Figure 5) decorated with lines and dots, which are supported by wires cast in one with the piece. In their hands, the small personages carry two staffs (rattles?) with llll^l^^^^^^^^^^^^^3^H^^^H^^I^^IIR6H^KVH^K^IRnK^^?^^ 42</page><page sequence="5">globular ends; they also wear Yotoco-style breastplates and ligatures around the legs. Two figures (see Figure 4) have animal features represented by a flat nose with two holes and pointed ears figured by short projecting triangular devices with incised decoration. Jose Perez de Barradas interpreted these traits as indicating the face of a vampire.9 A third pendant (Figure 5) shows different animal features, such as a triangular projecting snout that is common on other types of Darien pendants, described below. To understand the development of Darien pendants, we must consider some realistic Yotoco human figures con centrated in the Calima area. These figures represent male personages of consistent patterns with standardized techno logical, stylistic, and iconographic features. They belong to the local gold production, which appears to have been tied to the particular social order and worldview of people of the Yotoco period. The anthropomorphic figures are lost-wax castings of high-grade gold and, to a lesser extent, of gold rich tumbaga. They show distinctive stereotypic features, such as legs shaped with protruding knees, flat feet with parallel lines depicting the toes, loincloths modeled in high relief, and a rigid appearance. These personages usually carry staffs or other ceremonial objects in their hands. Some of them are standing, but others appear to be in a crouched position, which is indicated by a bend at the knees, ankles, and hips. Some of these naturalistic figures (Figure 6) have typical Yotoco-style adornments, such as large circular ear ornaments, crescent-shaped nose ornaments, and heart shaped breastplates (Figures 7-9). These personages usually hold staffs in their hands, although there are a few represen tations of musicians, such as a man playing a drum. A good number of these objects are solid castings, but in some cases, the body of the figure is solid while the headdress was open worked. A common representation (Figures 10-13), of which two examples can be seen at the Metropolitan Museum, is that of a man wearing a Yotoco-style diadem (Figure 14) comple mented by a crescent-shaped nose ornament and a branched element that covers the chest and has projections ending at both sides of the head. In one hand, these personages usu ally hold a staff with lateral protrusions (or sometimes a lance), and in the other hand they carry an element that has been interpreted as a shield, an animal skin, or a palm leaf.10 Another common type of Yotoco human figure (Figure 15), recently named "Wrinkle Face" by Warwick Bray, rep resents a naked man holding two simple staffs.11 These per sonages have a nonhuman mouth, a prominent nose formed by spirals, a protruding chin, and lateral branched head ornaments. The Yotoco anthropomorphic figures have a concentra tion in the Calima heartland, and a few related objects have ~"1 * " '^^^^ "'^r''."* *^ * ^ 8.

The recorded provenances correspond to the Calima heartland and to the middle Cauca River valley, while some have been found in the Tolima region and adjacent areas (Figure 16). These pendants (Type 2; Figures 17-20) are represented by a number of objects belonging to the Museo del Oro collection and two in the Metropolitan Museum, apparently found near the Calima River. They are lost-wax castings in high-grade gold or a gold-rich tumbaga, and they usually show the bent legs and the crouched position that recall the Yotoco anthropomorphic figures from the Calima area. The personages wear Yotoco-style breastplates and have several diagnostic elements related to those of Type 1, such as the thick loincloth decorated with incised dots, the staffs (rat tles?) with globular ends, and the two hollow semispherical headdress ornaments supported by cast wires. They also show a headband decorated with a triangle-and-dot pattern and two long feather-shaped lateral devices with incised lines that form a herringbone pattern, which are a develop ment of the short triangular ears of Type 1 figures. The defin ing characteristic of the face is a protruding triangular snout that shows two rows of teeth, bulbous eyes, and a nose usually represented by two pellets and sometimes by a raised metal piece. This representation has been interpreted as the face of a crocodile by Federico Medem and Jose Perez de Barradas, who refer to this type of figure as the "crocodile god."14 Ernesto Restrepo Tirado believed that they are representations of men with vampire features.15 In fact, bats, vampires, and crocodilians are also represented in other archaeological materials, especially ceramics, cor responding to the early cultural developments of the Calima area.16 A few Yotoco-related pendants that are linked to the pat tern represented by Type 2 have been found in the middle Magdalena River valley (Tolima area) and in the neighbor ing temperate slopes of the Eastern Mountain Range (Tocaima, Tibacuy, Guaduas; Figure 16). Early metallurgy of the middle Magdalena River drainage belongs to the tradition of southwestern Colombia, and, according to  16.

Photographer: Clark Manuel Rodriguez archaeological information, it is associated with a particular type of incised ceramic wares,17 which have been dated at neighboring sites to the third century A.D.18 One pendant from Rfoblanco (Figure 21) has a typical Tolima-style human face and is linked to Type 2 Darien pendants by its technol ogy and its lateral feather-shaped ornaments. It represents a man holding an object that can be interpreted as a musical instrument. Other pendants from the slopes of the Eastern Mountain Range are local versions that follow the basic pat tern of Type 2. These solid objects, cast in high-grade gold or gold-rich tumbaga, include the semispherical headdress ornaments and/or the lateral feather-shaped devices, while the staffs (rattles?) have elongated ends (Figures 22-24). The influence of Darien pendants and of early south western metallurgy on the western slopes of the Eastern Mountain Range preceded the development on its cold high plateaus of a regional style particular to the Chibcha speaking Muisca people, who inhabited this mountainous area until the Spanish conquest. According to radiocarbon dates associated with Muisca metal objects, the earliest manifestations of this metallurgy go back to the seventh century A.D.19 The Darien pendants of Types 1 and 2 and their variants were models that influenced the diversification of the theme. In the first stages this process took place in the Calima area itself and the middle Cauca River valley, and then it spread to the northwestern cultural areas. The Calima-Quimbaya Relationship The production of other types of Darien pendants is con temporary with the early southwestern metallurgical tradi tion and particularly indicates a relationship between the Calima area and the middle Cauca River region. During the first centuries A.D., this area witnessed the development of Early Quimbaya metallurgy, with local metalworkers perfect ing such techniques as solid and hollow lost-wax casting using gold-copper alloys20 and depletion gilding.21 While the links between Quimbaya and the other cultural areas of south western Colombia are evident, its metallurgy has a strong char acter of its own and has become famous for its realistic human representations with heavy-lidded eyes, multi-strand necklaces, and ligatures around the arms and legs (Figures 25, 26). The heartland of Early Quimbaya metalwork was the Central Mountain Range in the middle reaches of the Cauca River in the present Colombian departments of Quindfo, Caldas, and Risaralda, with a northern extension to the rug ged country of Antioquia, also drained by the Cauca River (see Figure 3). The production of Early Quimbaya metal lurgy belongs to the period between the first and fifth cen turies A.D., according to dates obtained from the clay and charcoal casting cores of Early Quimbaya ornaments in the Museo del Oro and the Museo de America, Madrid,22 and from archaeological contexts that included metal objects in the region of Antioquia.23 Early Quimbaya objects have also been found in the middle Magdalena River valley.24 46</page><page sequence="9">21.

Photographer: Rudolf Schrimpff 27 There is evidence of contact between the inhabitants of the middle Cauca River valley and those of the Calima area during the development of Early Quimbaya metalwork. Yotoco objects have been found in the former area, and Yotoco and Quimbaya metallurgy share certain specific shapes, such as pins with elaborate heads with anthropo morphic and zoomorphic decoration, and ear plugs, although those have local characteristics. The regular use in Yotoco metallurgy of casting techniques and of alloys with different amounts of gold and copper was probably encour aged by the relationship with the Quimbaya area.25 Patterns of Darien pendants that were produced in the context of the Calima-Quimbaya relationship show an increased schematization of the human figure. The distinc tive technical, stylistic, and iconographic characteristics suggest that these patterns derive from Yotoco-related proto * 28 30 types, with the introduction of some features that are closer to Early Quimbaya preferences, such as the intensification of the use of gold-copper alloys and depletion gilding, and of decoration formed by cast filigree spirals or incised designs of squares. However, these Darien pendants have their own diagnostic features and identity, and they were produced alongside the regional styles. A particular variety of Darien pendants (Type 3; Figures 27-30) that represents an elaboration of the Yotoco-related masked personages with feather-shaped lateral head orna ments (Type 2) is represented by a number of examples in the Museo del Oro collection; similar figures were reported in the Quindfo district by Luis Arango Cano.26 The objects were cast using the lost-wax technique, and the group includes some items made of high-grade gold with a small amount of silver, as well as objects of tumbaga with important 48</page><page sequence="11">31 32 amounts of copper.27 These pendants show some Yotoco related features, such as the decorated loincloth, the shape of the legs?though they are more schematic?and the Yotoco-style breastplates. They also have a headband and two upper semispherical ornaments, which are usually dec orated with branched devices of cast wires (Figure 28) or are transformed into two elements shaped like double-spouted jars (Figure 29). This double-spouted jar form, typical of Yotoco pottery, was also popular in other regions of south western Colombia during the period of high development of the local cultures in the first centuries A.D.28 The Darien figures of Type 3 have an animal face with a protruding triangular snout that shows one or two rows of teeth, a nose that is usually figured by a metal piece with two holes or an elongated pellet, and two rounded eyes. The projecting side ornaments?a salient characteristic of this type of Darien pendant?are an elaboration of the feather-shaped devices, but they introduce a substantial change in their shape and decoration: they are adorned by scrolls, spirals, or square designs formed by incised parallel lines, which pertain more closely to Early Quimbaya metal lurgy. The combination of the particular shape of the nose and the lateral head ornaments (ears?) on the pendants of Type 3 has been interpreted by Anne Legast as representing traits of a leaf-nosed bat (Phyllostomidae family).29 The Middle Cauca River Area and Diversification Different patterns of Darien pendants have been found in the middle Cauca River area, both in the Quimbaya heart land and in its northern extension to the mountains of Antioquia (see Figure 3). Some of them have Yotoco fea tures, while others are distinctive of the middle Cauca region and represent a process of diversification character 33 ized by further schematization of the human figure and a strong tendency to use gold-copper alloys and depletion gilding. A first group of Darien pendants from the Quimbaya heartland (Salento, Quindfo, Ansermanuevo;Type4; Figures 31-33) can be seen as a development of the masked figures of Type 3. They show some Yotoco elements, such as the shape of the loincloth and Yotoco-style breastplates, and they also incorporate the decorated headband, the two hol low semispherical devices supported by cast wires, and the animal face with a triangular projecting snout. The objects are made of gold-copper alloys with high copper content,30 and some of them show traces of depletion gilding. The greater schematization of the human figure is especially apparent in the treatment of the legs, which are represented by a single metal plaque with curved sides and a vertical groove in the center; a bend in the upper leg suggests a crouched position. The staffs have spiral ends, and the upper semispherical devices are decorated with cast filigree spi rals or branched ornaments that usually show incised designs of squares. The northern Quimbaya region of Antioquia has pro duced additional and unique patterns of Darien pendants. Type 5 is represented by a figure in the Museo del Oro that was found in the region of Frontino (Figure 34) and by a similar object in the National Museum of the American Indian of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., apparently found in the Sinu River area in northwestern Colombia.31 The one in the Museo del Oro was cast in a copper-rich alloy (51.5%).32 These figures have schematic legs, two hollow semispherical headdresses supported by thick metal wires, a snout with two rows of teeth and a pro truding nose, and triangular lateral headdress ornaments 31.

The highly schematic body is formed by a flat plaque, the legs are separated by a vertical groove, and the toes are represented by parallel incisions. Another pendant, of uncertain origin, is linked to Type 6 in its Quimbaya-related features and schematic legs (Figure 36). In his hands, the personage holds two flasks of a particular shape that is also typical of Early Quimbaya metallurgy. The middle Cauca River valley has also produced some anthropomorphic figures made of gold-copper alloys, whose iconography is related both to Yotoco metallurgy and to some variants of Darien pendants. A particular pattern of Darien-related pendant that belongs to the Quimbaya heart land is represented by highly schematic figures with joined legs, a human face, and laterally projecting devices with multiple danglers (Figure 37), which recall some Yotoco fig ures (Figure 39). Two objects of this pattern belong to the Quimbaya treasure, an outstanding group of Early Quimbaya metalwork found in two graves in the district of Filandia (Quindfo) and now housed in the Museo de America in Madrid.35 Another group of figures from the Quimbaya area is rep resented by four items made of an alloy with a high copper content, which belong to the Museo del Oro (Figure 38).36 These figures have schematic legs formed by a flat plaque that recalls some Darien pendants. The personages hold a horizontal bar with elongated danglers, their faces have bird features, and the headdress is formed of spirals and scrolls. THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE EARLY NORTHERN REGIONAL STYLES (ca. A.D. 1-900) The production of Darien pendants and their distribution during the early centuries A.D. must be understood in the context of a gradual diffusion of metallurgical knowledge. Different influences merged to stimulate the metalwork pro duction in northern Colombia and the Central American isth mus. On the one hand, we can trace the influence of the early metallurgical tradition of southwestern Colombia?with its preference for using high-quality gold and for working metal to shape?and the production of particular categories, among them highly schematic Darien pendants of high-grade gold. The mountainous areas and the Pacific corridor of west ern Colombia were permanent routes for the multiple contacts between these regions and northern Colombia and Panama. On the other hand, we can follow the extensive influ ence of a technology that was perfected in the middle Cauca River area during the production of Early Quimbaya metal lurgy, with its preference for lost-wax casting, gold-copper alloys, and depletion gilding, and the distinctive icono graphic features that characterize this group of works. This influence is also evident in the production in northern areas of Darien pendants with Quimbaya-related features that were cast using gold-copper alloys. The Cauca River con nected the mountainous regions of western Colombia and the northern Caribbean area, and its inhabitants had con tacts with the Pacific region. 42.

Map placing schematic 900 (drawing: Luis Guillermo PAClFlC ECUADOR These processes were related to particular categories of metal objects that have been found in an extensive area from central Colombia to Costa Rica. The list includes, among other items, double spiral pendants, various Quimbaya-related anthropomorphic figures, Darien pen dants, human figures with recurved headdresses, animals with a raised tail, and two-headed birds. These categories belong to the distinctive groups of works produced before A.D. 900 that Bray defined as the Initial Group and the International Group (Figures 40-42).37 The earliest items from central and western Colombia might belong to the last centuries B.C., since the casting core of an International Group zoomorphic pendant found in the region of Antioquia was dated to the third century B.C.38 The Initial Group was already established in Panama and Costa Rica by A.D. 400, although the earliest manifestations must go back to the beginnings of the Christian era. The International Group has a temporal distribution corresponding to A.D. 400-900.39 The popularity of Darien pendants and their decline before A.D. 900 were linked to the history of the International Group, and their production followed two different trends with specific distribution and technological choices. As we 52</page><page sequence="15">will see, these anthropomorphic pendants indicate the influence of the different technological traditions mentioned above and the preferences of the particular cultures. In fact, although Darien pendants and International Group metal objects share a basic iconography, the objects do have regional differences and were produced alongside the earli est regional styles of northern Colombia and the isthmus that flourished during the first centuries A.D. From their early stages, these regional styles defined a "metallurgical province" that contrasts with the southwestern areas. Schematic Darien Pendants of High-Grade Gold: The Influence of the Southern Tradition of Working Metal and the Pacific Connection The highest degree of schematization of the human figure reached by Darien pendants can be identified as a develop ment of some patterns described above that show the Calima-Quimbaya connection and that were diversified in the middle Cauca River area. This refers especially to Type 3 and 4 pendants, distinguished by lateral head ornaments formed by spirals, an animal face with a protruding snout that might correspond to crocodilians or bats, and sche matic legs formed by a single flat plaque. The preferred technology for producing these Darien pendants of high grade gold was the combination of lost-wax casting with some techniques of working metal, which demonstrates a link with the early southwestern metallurgical tradition in which the Colombian Pacific area played an important role. As for the iconography, some Darien pendants of unknown origin can be identified as transitional between middle Cauca patterns and most schematic versions (Type 7; Figure 43 no. 4). These objects have some features that resemble those of middle Cauca pendants, such as sche matic legs, lateral winged head ornaments with spirals, and the shape of the upper semispherical devices. However, the facial features are different and indicate a further schemati zation. We can recognize two eyes, a protruding snout formed by parallel cast wires that project forward, and a triangular nose that might be seen as an interpretation of a bat's nose leaf. The personages hold two simple staffs and wear several elements that show a rupture with the pat terns of Darien pendants already described. Among these are the multiple-strand necklaces and the triangular loin cloth, which replace the ornaments typical of the Yotoco related patterns. The most characteristic iconographic pattern of the highly schematic Darien pendants (Type 8) indicates the relation ship of the middle Cauca River region with the Pacific area, and the influence of those regions on the upper Sinu and San Jorge River valleys?the gateways to the Colombian Caribbean lowlands?and the Pacific watershed of Panama (Figure 43). The pendants belonging to Type 8 can be clas sified in several subgroups according to their distinctive technological and iconographic features in association with their place of origin. Although these divisions are arbitrary, they help to understand the transformation in different cul tural areas of the patterns of Darien pendants and the tech nological preferences in their manufacture. Schematic Darien pendants of Type 8a have been found in the Colombian Pacific region (Baudo River and upper Atrato River) and in the middle Cauca River valley (Quindfo), while some items of unknown origin also belong to this pattern. These pendants are coarse lost-wax castings in high-quality gold with a considerable amount of silver (Figures 44-47).40 The hollow semispherical headdress ornaments are slightly flattened or tilted toward the front, and they are usually placed on top of the head without cast wires to support them. However, one pendant from the Pacific area (Alto Icho, Choco; Figures 46, 47) shows two vertical cast wires adhered to the back of the figure, which simulate the supports of the semispherical devices.

Photographer: Clark Manuel Rodriguez A variation of the highly schematic gold Darien pendants (Type 8b; Figures 43 nos. 6 and 7, 48-51) is represented by a number of specimens from the transitional area between the Western and Central Mountain Ranges and the Caribbean lowlands. The recorded provenances include the upper Sinu River (Tierralta and Valencia) with an extension to the middle reaches of the river in the Caribbean lowlands (Betancf), the middle San Jorge River drainage (Montelfbano), and the lower Cauca River valley (Caucasia). Several pendants in the National Museum of the American Indian that were apparently found "on the east bank of the Sinu river7'41 are related to this pat tern, as are some objects in the Museo del Oro and two of unknown origin in the Metropolitan Museum (Figure 49). These pendants are cast in high-grade gold or a gold copper alloy.42 The highly schematic legs occasionally have a bend that recalls the crouched position of the various Darien pendants from southwestern Colombia described above. Some items do not include a representation of the arms, while in other examples the arms are suggested by cut-out triangles or lozenges on the main body. The multi strand necklace is represented by a few cast wires placed horizontally on the shoulders and the chest. A few pendants have a triangular elongated loincloth, but the most common representation is that of a horizontal device of cast filigree with two hanging spiral ornaments; one object found near Betancf, in the middle reaches of the Sinu River, has a loin cloth in the shape of a frog (Figure 43 no. 10). 53.

Photographer: Clark Manuel Rodriguez This particular variant (Type 8b) includes a number of items that show two wires on the back of the figure that represent the supports for the semispherical headdress ornaments (Figure 51). Usually the supports were made as part of the original wax model of the figure, which was then cast in a single piece. However, in a couple of speci mens, the main figure was cast, but the supporting wires were probably soldered to the back. This combination of techniques, which deserves a detailed analysis, would show both the distant influence of the early metallurgical tradition of southwestern Colombia and a technological relationship of the Type 8b pendants to another unique pattern (Type 9) represented by two items found in the Pacific area. The schematic personages represented on Type 9 Darien pendants (Figures 52, 53) have a lozenge-shaped nose, and the upper semispherical headdresses are tilted forward and are surrounded by braided wires; the lateral headdress devices have four raised circular decorations, which are also bordered by these wires. The main figure of a pendant found in Puricha (Figures 52, 43 no. 1) was cast in high grade gold with some silver but with no traces of copper,43 while the eyes (now missing) and a separate piece that includes the loincloth, the staffs, and the nose were joined to the main figure using a gold-copper-alloy solder of a pink color.

The influence of western Colombian metalworking in areas toward the Caribbean region is also apparent in what may be local production, in the Sinu and San Jorge River drainages and neighboring zones, of some specific variants of Darien pendants. Some items follow the pattern of Type 8 but introduce different features, while others belong to new patterns. Indeed, the general pattern of one pendant of high-grade gold found in the region of Betancf, in the middle Sinu River area (Type 8c; Figure 54), matches the prototypes of western Colombia. However, this pendant introduces variations in the upper semispherical headdress ornaments, which are tilted toward the front, and in the shape of the "feet," which show squared borders and incised decoration forming a herringbone pattern. The loincloth is attached to the staffs, following a pattern that exists in some pendants from western Colombia (Type 8a). A couple of unique and atypical pendants from the mountains of San Jacinto, in the northern region of the Caribbean lowlands, probably dating before A.D. 900, anticipate the popularity of local and distinct versions of Darien pendants, which, as will be seen below, differenti ated this region during the later period. These atypical pen dants (Types 8d and 8e) are made of gold-rich tumbaga and show a basic pattern related to other schematic Darien pen dants (Type 8). They also include particular features such as a triangular raised nose (Type 8d; Figure 55) or the bird shaped loincloth of the pendant of Type 8e (Figure 56), which represents an interesting variation of the triangular loincloth with elongated sides. The conical shape of the headdress ornaments of this pendant is also found on the unusual specimens from the Caribbean lowlands described below. 56 The upper Sinu and San Jorge River areas have produced a few different gold pendants (Type 10; Figure 43 nos. 8,11) that show some stylistic relationships with theType 5 pattern belonging to the Antioquia and Sinu regions (see Figure 34). The technology used for Type 10 pendants also suggests an influence from the Pacific area during an early period. The pendants have schematic legs, conical and hollow semi spherical headdresses, and triangular ornaments at each side of the head. One, in the collection of the National Museum of the American Indian, apparently found "on the east bank of the Sinu river" (Figure 43 no. 11 ),44 holds a bar with schematic birds that recalls some Early Quimbaya rep resentations. A pendant from Montelfbano, in the San Jorge River drainage (Figure 43 no. 8), has a human face and shows traces of a now-missing device that was soldered to the main body. The presence in the Sinu and San Jorge River areas of these variants of Darien pendants related to middle Cauca River and Pacific versions is not surprising, since the upper Sinu River was a zone of permanent contact between the communities of the Pacific area and the inhabitants of the Caribbean lowlands.45 On the other hand, the Cauca River flows through the mountainous area of Antioquia before entering the districts of the Caribbean lowlands, which are drained by its effluent, the San Jorge River. In the transi tional zone, archaeologists have detected settlements dated to a period between A.D. 700 and 900 that produced the distinctive brown incised ceramic wares that are related to Early Quimbaya metalwork46 and, nearby, the vestiges of important settlements of the Zenu people, who were responsible for a long cultural development in the Caribbean lowlands.47 The Darien pendants of the Sinu and San Jorge River areas described above did not mix and form hybrids with 56</page><page sequence="19">the earliest groups of objects produced in Zenu metallurgy in the Caribbean lowlands?the Early Zenu (Figure 57) and the Planeta Rica groups?that were already in use by the time of Christ. This metalwork belongs to the long cul tural development of the Zenu people, which reached its peak between A.D. 400 and 900. The Zenu transformed the landscape of the seasonally flooded lands in the lower Sinu, San Jorge, and Cauca River drainages with artificial canals that covered 500,000 hectares; numerous metal objects have been found in the burial mounds built by these communities.48 In Betanci (Sinu River) and Montelfoano (San Jorge River)?two areas that produced Darien pendants?large cemeteries of artificial mounds have yielded a high number of metal objects belonging to Zenu metallurgy, which, in its earliest stages, was influ enced by southern traditions. Early Zenu and Planeta Rica metal objects have a strong local character, but they also show the effect of the International Group as well as particular technological ori entations. Early Zenu metallurgy reflects the influence of Early Quimbaya metalwork in its preference for casting techniques, depletion gilding, cast filigree work, and alloys with high gold content49 for staff heads (Figure 57) and other hollow and heavy objects, as well as the distinctive cast fili gree earrings. The Planeta Rica group includes a larger num ber of hammered objects and some items that were made by joining several previously shaped pieces, probably using some kind of solder.50 This type of technology, which was 57.

Some schematic Darien pendants have been found in Panama, where the early local metalwork was flourishing during the first centuries A.D. A pendant corresponding to Type 8a from western Colombia was found in the area of Venado Beach on the Pacific watershed of eastern Panama (Figure 43 no. 9). This item might be contemporary with the early Venado Beach metallurgy, whose temporal distribu tion corresponds to A.D. 500-700. The early metallurgy at Venado Beach includes objects related to the Initial and International Groups and also the Openwork Group, which has been identified as one of the earliest styles of the isth mus.51 This last group, with its preference for the use of cast filigree ornamentation (Figure 59), shows an interesting relationship with Early Zenu metallurgy in this technology and decoration. Several Darien pendants that have been found in the region of Parita in the Azuero Peninsula of central Panama,52 among them one at the Metropolitan Museum (Figures 60, 43 no. 5), have a basic schematic pattern that relates them to Colombian prototypes. However, these are local versions that have a number of appurtenances in the style of the Parita Assemblage (Figure 61), a local group related to the Conte tradition of central Panama, whose development 58.

The distribution of the highly schematic Darien pendants described above is concentrated in western Colombia, with an extension to the Pacific area of Panama. The reconstruc tion of the cultural processes in these regions has shown that this was a very old pattern of relationships that goes back beyond the beginning of the Christian era.54 The par ticular pattern of schematic pendants represented by Type 8 was a popular model that was reproduced and modified by different cultures which had already developed their own regional styles during the first centuries A.D. As will be seen below, this was also the basic pattern that was adopted and modified with the addition of new technological and stylis tic features in one region of northern Colombia where the theme survived until the Spanish conquest. Quimbaya-Related Darien Pendants in the Northern Cultural Areas Other Darien pendants that were produced in Central America before A.D. 900 have a distribution and technical and stylistic characteristics that differ from those of the highly schematic pendants described above. These objects were produced in the context of the influence of Early Quimbaya metallurgy that is apparent in the widespread adoption of its specific technology and in the manufacture of distinctive categories, which are included in Bray's International Group. We can mention the various anthropo morphic figures, which are clearly local variants but which show similarities with the naturalistic Early Quimbaya personages. Their distribution extends from Panama to Yucatan (Mexico), with a special concentration in the Atlantic watershed of Costa Rica, where they can be dated to the period between A.D. 500 and 900.55 The Quimbaya-related anthropomorphic figures fre quently hybridized with Darien pendants and with figures adorned with recurved headdresses. These particular Darien pendants also show a concentration in Costa Rica (Figure 62), while two items were found in the sacred Cenote of Sacrifice of Chichen Itza in Maya territory.56 The Darien pendants from Costa Rica (Figure 62) are lost-wax castings in gold-copper alloys. Their technology, iconography, and decoration recall some items from the middle Cauca River area in Colombia and the traits of Early Quimbaya anthropomorphic figures. However, the pen dants are likely to have been manufactured in Costa Rica, for they conform to different patterns. It is interesting to note that one object of unknown origin housed inthe Metropolitan Museum (Figure 63) includes some features related to those of the Central American pendants. The Darien pendants found in the Chichen Itza Cenote of Sacrifice were cast in gold-copper alloys, and their par ticular patterns are unique (Figure 62 nos. 5, 6). In general terms, their traits show more links with the items from Costa Rica, suggesting that they were probably manufactured in that area.57 The Quimbaya-related Darien pendants and associated objects found in Central America show the importance of the Caribbean connection in the transference of metallurgi cal knowledge. These pendants are part of the International Group, and their decline coincides with the waning pro duction of those works by A.D. 900. THE LATE PERIOD: A LOCAL SURVIVAL OF DARIEN PENDANTS (A.D. 900-1 600) The Decline of Darien Pendants in Western Colombia and the Isthmus In southwestern Colombia, the long cultural developments that identified this extensive area from the first millennium B.C. were replaced by A.D. 700-800 by a cultural tradition that corresponds to the populations still living in the area by the time of the Spanish conquest in the sixteenth century. This new cultural tradition is linked to metalwork produc tion that differs from the earliest tradition, which preferred high-grade gold and the direct working of metal. The late metalwork practices of southwestern Colombia are instead distinguished by the general use of gold-copper alloys, lost wax casting, and depletion gilding and by the production of a large number of smaller categories of metal ornaments.58 Darien pendants were not part of the metalwork associated with this late cultural development.

In northern Colombia and Central America, the early regional styles evolved or merged with late metalwork pro duction, which lasted until the Spanish conquest. The late regional styles not only demonstrate strong local character istics, but they are also linked by common technological preferences for gold-copper alloys, lost-wax casting, and depletion gilding, although the production of hammered objects in high-quality gold existed in some regions. In the majority of these cultural areas, Darien pendants disap peared from the inventory of the metallurgy, with the pos sible exception of some isolated items. A pendant found in Panama has a basic shape that can be matched in Colombia,59 but it includes ornaments in the form of saurians and ser pents, which are in the Veraguas-Gran Chiriquf style that developed in western Panama and eastern Costa Rica. The earlier manifestations of that regional style can probably be traced to a period about A.D. 500-800, although it had a long history that lasted until the Spanish conquest.60 In the Caribbean lowlands of Colombia, the period between A.D. 1000 and the Spanish conquest was a time of diversification for Zenu metallurgy. A large number of cast filigree earrings (Figure 58), staff heads, and other objects made of gold-copper alloys as well as hammered ornaments of high-grade gold were produced in extensive areas of the lowlands and were buried in cemeteries of artificial mounds that belong to later periods of the Zenu people.61 Darien pendants were not included in the late Zenu metalwork of the lowlands, and neither were the bird-shaped pectorals or the animals with a raised tail that go back to the International Group and which were present in the early aggregations of Zenu goldwork. In the vicinity of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, in northeastern Colombia, the Late Tairona regional style devel oped after A.D. 1000, and its roots can be traced back to the Early Tairona or Nahuanje metallurgy that was already in production by the early centuries A.D.62 Late Tairona metal lurgy shows a preference for surface-enriched objects cast in gold-copper alloys. These have a strong local character and a complex iconography that was tied to the local social order and the cosmology of the Chibcha-speaking groups whose culture consolidated between A.D. 1000 and the Spanish conquest.63 A unique Darien pendant found in this area (Figures 64, 65 no. 7) belongs to Late Tairona metal work. It shows a typical Tairona face adorned with an elon gated nose ornament, a lip plug, and lateral appendages with zoomorphic figures that are seen on a large number of ornaments belonging to this regional style. Darien pendants were not integrated into Late Tairona work, and the isolated example must be a local copy of the numerous pendants produced during the late period in the neighboring San Jacinto area, with which the inhabitants of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta were in permanent contact.64 Darien Pendants in the Land of Copper The origins of metallurgical development in the mountains of San Jacinto, which separate the lowlands from the Caribbean coast of Colombia, are poorly known. However, these origins appear to go back to A.D. 900, since the metal lurgy of the area shows the presence of categories related to the International Group, such as Darien pendants and fig ures with recurved headdresses (see Figures 66-70). As we have seen, a few atypical Darien pendants found in this area suggest the early influence there of southern metalwork tra ditions (see Figures 55, 56). The presence among the metalwork objects developed in the San Jacinto area65 of staff heads, cast filigree ear orna ments, and other categories shows the influence of Zenu metalwork, although the San Jacinto objects have a good number of local features. Archaeological and historical research has demonstrated that there also existed an old pattern of relationships between the San Jacinto area and the Sinu and San Jorge River drainages.66 The aggregation of San Jacinto works shows a long-lasting regional style that was still in use after the Spanish con quest, as indicated by the seventeenth-century date associ ated with a Darien pendant.67 The urns and the shaft graves grouped in cemeteries in the hills of the San Jacinto range contain numerous metal objects found in association with pottery, shell ornaments, and, occasionally, glass beads and iron weapons of Spanish origin.68 Ornaments related to the San Jacinto group, including Darien pendants, have been found in the neighboring lower Magdalena River region, where there is also evidence of metalwork production after the Spanish conquest.

Archaeological research has traced the Malibu influ ence in neighboring regions, such as the lower San Jorge and Cauca River drainages and the mountains of San Jacinto.69 In fact, San Jacinto metallurgy reflects the multi ethnic situation in the region: the long-lasting influence of the Zenu and Malibu traditions as well as contact and exchange with the Tairona area during the later period.70 The aggregation of San Jacinto metalwork shows particu lar emphasis on the use of copper mixed with small amounts of gold and silver and on lost-wax casting.71 The matrix of the metal is usually heavily corroded, and, although some objects still have a gilded surface, in the majority of cases it looks badly worn.72 The numerous Darien pendants from the San Jacinto area (Figure 65; there are eighty items with recorded provenance in the Museo del Oro collection) were especially concen trated in the local districts of Coloso and Ovejas, with an extension to the lower Cauca and Magdalena River drain ages (twenty-three of the items), where other categories belonging to the San Jacinto assemblage are also common. The San Jacinto Darien pendants belong to well-defined highly schematic groups whose origins can be found in the earlier objects from the middle Cauca River area, the Pacific area, and, especially, the Sinu and San Jorge River regions. However, the San Jacinto pendants also reflect the orienta tion of local metallurgy, for they were cast in tumbaga with much copper and small amounts of gold73 using the lost wax method.

Darien pendant (Type of pendants were also developed and added to the reper toire, suggesting that the Darien pendants were adapted to a local assemblage which was tied to a particular social order and worldview. The iconography of the largest group of pendants belong ing to San Jacinto metallurgy (Type 11; Figures 65, 66) is related to that of Types 8b and 8c from the Sinu and San Jorge River areas. Some of the features, such as the frontal position of the upper semispherical ornaments and the shape of the lower body, recall specimens of Types 8c and 8d found in the Sinu River area and the San Jacinto moun tains that probably belong to an earlier period (see Figures 54, 55). The flat schematic legs of Type 11 Darien pendants do not have the bend suggesting a crouched position that was present in some schematic pendants from western Colombia. The triangular loincloth is common, although it is small and lacks the lateral extensions that appeared in other variants. A number of specimens have a loincloth represented by horizontal cast wires and two hanging spiral-shaped devices. The staffs, when present, are simple and schematic. The nose is usually represented by one or two sets of juxtaposed spirals, although in several examples it is replaced by a real istic frog (Type 11a; Figure 67). In one case, the lower part of a frog's body replaces the loincloth on a human figure (Figure 65 no. 2). It is tempting to speculate that, in the case of the San Jacinto Darien pendants, the typical spiral-shaped nose could be the schematization of this animal. The upper spirals, which might represent the eyes of a frog, are usually surmounted by two cast wires forming a triangular pattern that can be interpreted as a mouth. Additionally, in the pen dants with a spiral-shaped loincloth, this device resembles the body and the schematic legs of a frog. One pendant with a frog-shaped nose has conical upper headdress ornaments (Figure 67). Another pattern of San Jacinto Darien pendants, Type 12, is represented by two items that have a similar basic shape but introduce such new elements as bottle-shaped upper headdress ornaments and a triangular nose that recalls the old pattern possibly linked to a leaf-nosed bat.74 Pendants of Type 13 demonstrate another step in the schematization of the human figure, for the lower part of the body is limited to the schematic plaque that represents the legs (Figures 65 no. 5, 68). These pendants include a realistic human face and sometimes a necklace with elongated beads reminis cent of a kind of shell bead found frequently in the archaeo logical sites of the San Jacinto area. The three items belonging to Type 14 maintain the schematic shape of the legs, and they show some variation in their iconographic features (Figures 65 no. 3, 69), although they are all related by the recurved winged headdress ornaments that recall some fig ures belonging to the International Group (see Figure 40). This form of headdress ornament was included in the San Jacinto assemblage and was modified following local tech nical and stylistic preferences (Figure 70). Two items belong ing to Type 15 (Figures 65 no. 4, 71) have four semispherical headdress ornaments and a human face. They wear nose ornaments with lateral appendages, a typical feature in the Darien Gold Pendants 63</page><page sequence="26">San Jacinto metalwork assemblage, and one item shows a necklace with elongated beads (Figure 65 no. 4). Finally, one figure (Type 16; Figure 72) has a unique style of head dress, one decorated with cut-out triangles. This design is common among other objects of San Jacinto metalwork. The San Jacinto group, with its assimilation of Darien pendants, represents the last interpretation of this old pat tern of human figures, and it is the only case in which the pendants were produced in abundance, merging with other influences on a regional style that developed a strong char acter of its own and managed to survive even after the Spanish conquest. DARIEN PENDANTS' PAN-AMERICAN ROLE During the period of expansion of Darien pendants in Colombia and Central America, between the time of Christ and A.D. 900, the codification of diagnostic features identi fied an unmistakable personage, regardless of the variants that demonstrate selection of stylistic patterns and icono graphic elements as well as the distinct technologies of par ticular cultural areas. Darien pendants maintained their identity during a long period without merging with local metalwork assemblages, suggesting that the subject of the pendants themselves was not precisely tied to local worldviews or mythologies. Indeed, regional styles were linked to particular systems of beliefs and social organizations as expressed in local ico nographies. Shared symbols are important in social com munication and in the determination of cultural identity. Beyond the distinctive expressions of local mythologies, constant and basic lines of thought are recognizable: this phenomenon relates to the very nature of mythology as a way of explaining the world in terms of multiple analogies and transformations. Thus, it is possible to find central prin ciples associated with the essence of mythical thought. Darien pendants, with their stereotypic diagnostic features, might represent a synthesis of symbols linked to a basic "Pan-American" symbolic framework that supported differ ent local mythologies. The widespread and long-lasting use of Darien pendants suggests that the iconography of a stereotypic personage? whether priest, shaman, cacique imbued with sacred power, ancestor, or mythical being?was recognized by people dis tinguished by different cultural heritages and ideologies. The diagnostic features of Darien pendants might represent a common means of communication, some sort of symbolic lingua franca that went beyond the particular expressions of the local worldviews. According to the mythical interpretation of the world, all the elements of reality?the natural world, the cosmos, and humanity?are intimately linked, and living beings are formed by the same properties as part of a multidimensional reality. In a ritual context, people can be transformed into other beings in the cosmos, such as animals, deities, or ancestors. Men are able to identify with a mythical condi tion and with the ancestral world by means of meditation and dreams and with the use of hallucinogenic drugs, masks, ritual ornaments, music, rhythmic chants, and dance that induce altered states of consciousness. In collective rituals directed by the religious specialists, humans enter other dimensions of reality, recalling their origins to ensure social reproduction. Ritual elements have specific symbolic associations guided by these principles. Darien pendants depict ceremo nial paraphernalia linked to the world of transformations and to the search for equilibrium expressed during ritual occasions. The personages represented are frequently shown in a crouching position, which, for many Amerindian com munities, has a connotation of wisdom and stability and allows men to establish a link with the axis mundi.75 The posture of the figures also recalls that of the dancers during ritual occasions. Additionally, the staffs in the form of rattles {maracas) held in the most naturalistic representations on Darien pendants remind us that music is a ritual language, with multiple associations related to social norms. Music also contributes to inducing particular mental states in par ticipants and to communicating with the ancestral world.76 The two semispherical devices on the upper headdress, one of the most distinctive features of Darien pendants, have been interpreted by some authors as representations of mushrooms associated with hallucinogenic drugs.77 Darien pendants show an animal face?a mask or a transformed man?symbolizing the metamorphosis that imbues men with powers linked to the properties and abili ties of particular species in an altered reality. The represen tation of masked men, probably with the features of crocodiles, bats, and vampires, might indicate the old and long-lasting importance of these animals for the people living in an exten sive territory. In addition to the many local interpretations of the symbolic and cosmological aspects of these animals, it is common to find a widespread interest in the ability of bats to dominate darkness and with their relation to the under world and to life transformations and regeneration. To give just one example, for the Uwa people of the Eastern Mountain Range of Colombia, bats are associated with the souls of the dead that return to the paths of origin. In caves, the souls "feed on smoke and sleep hanging from the rock walls," while they replenish their strength and go through a process of transformation leading to rebirth.78 The cosmological importance of crocodilians prompted their popularity in the iconography of Precolumbian objects over extensive areas and their survival in contemporary traditions. Thus, for the Zenu people of Caribbean Colombia, the most important of 64</page><page sequence="27">the lower world's water spirits is the golden alligator, which supports the world and protects humanity.79 The role of Darien pendants as a widespread codified symbolic communication might be responsible for their wide distribution before A.D. 900. The iconographic fea tures of the pendants represented basic principles belonging to the mythical interpretation of the world that went beyond the boundaries between cultural areas and local world views. The various local features of the pendants and the technical preferences in particular areas show the ways in which different cultures interpreted these principles. We can see the contrast among the high-grade gold pendants from the Colombian Pacific area, the wider range of metal com positions of the Yotoco-related items, and the preference for tumbaga with important amounts of copper indicated by the middle Cauca River examples. These technological choices, which must reflect the strong relationship of technology to specific systems of beliefs, are also guided by primary sym bolic principles that guided the use of metals and that are related to cosmological cycles and the cycle of develop ment of humans. Some basic symbolic principles define the primary cos mological associations of metals. These are related to the inherent properties of metals as expressed in visible or per ceptible qualities, such as color, odor, brilliance, and tex ture. In ancient Colombia, gold and copper were the dominant metals. On a symbolic level, they represented opposing yet complementary properties. The association of gold with immortality and with brilliant yellowish hues as the expression of male generative power and the fertilizing energy of the sun is a universal concept among ancient and non-Western societies.80 Copper is related to mortality, to humanness and the reddish hues of blood, to female prop erties, and to transformations. On a cosmological level, these qualities are linked to the cycle of the moon, which represents the full process of life development, decline, and regeneration. Each phase in this cycle is related to a particu lar stage in life transformations and to distinctive colors, which, in the mythology of the Desana people of the north west Amazon, are referred to as "copper colors/'81 Thus, copper is related to the waxing moon?with the reddish colors of blood and the initial development of the human embryo, and the green colors of vegetation growth?and to the waning moon, which, among the Desana, is associated with blackened-red hues, identified as "copper colors," and to strong odors corresponding to illness, decay, and putre faction.82 Copper symbolizes the development and decline of human life as expressed in its basic reddish hues and in its multicolored transformations through tarnishing and oxidation.83 Particular interpretations of these principles according to local mythologies and systems of beliefs might be respon sible for the variations in the selection of specific metals and technologies. In the case of Darien pendants, the preference for high-grade gold in the production of pendants from the Pacific region was probably related to the presence of rich alluvial deposits in the rivers that flow to the Pacific Ocean. In addition to the availability of the raw material in this choice of metal, the symbolic properties of gold, as the immortal metal related to the life-giving energy of the sun, were probably dominant for the people living in this land of gold. In contrast with the Darien pendants from the Pacific region, examples from other areas demonstrate the increas ing importance of copper and, especially, of tumbaga. In Early Quimbaya metallurgy, the techniques related to gold copper alloys were perfected, and their influence was felt over extensive areas. In the northern regions, even in the San Jacinto area where copper was dominant, objects con tain small amounts of gold. At a symbolic level, tumbaga represents the mixture of the male and female qualities of gold and copper. To initiate the embryonic development that would result in the gold-copper alloy, the fertilizing influence of gold had to be added to the copper, which has an inherent potential for transformation. Through this metal lurgical process, people reproduced the cosmological pro cess of the transformations of the moon, which begin with the fertilizing influence of the sun during the phase of the new moon. The alloy of gold and copper represents the union of male and female properties, the combination nec essary to ensure the continuity of life, with the metals seen as embryos or seeds that produced the germ of life through metallurgical transformations. This combination of metals thus stands for an act of creation similar to the cycle of human development and to cosmological cycles. The gold copper alloy also symbolizes the union of the human and the divine?of mortality and immortality?an absolute unity.84 As we have seen, the Quimbaya area was where tum baga was used in greater quantities in manufacturing Darien pendants. The symbolic relationships of gold, copper, tum baga, and their metallurgical transformations guided the emphasis these local cultures placed on making spectacular tumbaga items. Early Quimbaya metalwork is characterized by large, heavy, polished objects that represent adorned human beings holding ritual paraphernalia. They have been found in graves perhaps of people who had a special role in local communities. In her study on Quimbaya metallurgy, Maria Alicia Uribe suggests that these metal objects served primarily to legitimize the power and prestige of local lead ers.85 Such personages?priests, shamans, or caciques? developed symbolic and ritual functions to enable them to ensure the permanence of social life and of the cosmologi cal cycles. The symbolic properties of manufactured objects, Darien Gold Pendants 65</page><page sequence="28">including the elements of tumbaga, were probably linked to this justification of power. The symbolic associations of the role of local leaders can probably be extended to every Indian community, for these people directed the various rituals that served to ensure the continuity of social life. However, in the social relationships practiced in different cultures, we can trace some variations in the specific emphasis placed on the function of metal. Thus, for example, the emblematic nature of Early Quimbaya metallurgy contrasts with that of San Jacinto metallurgy, which developed in a later period. In the San Jacinto area, a large number of small, intensively used, portable objects were produced. There, Darien pendants were integrated into a regional style for the first time, and these numerous pendants reflect the particular social orientation of San Jacinto metallurgy. Darien pendants as well as other items belonging to the San Jacinto assemblage had a restricted distribution that covered the San Jacinto heartland and neighboring regions such as the drainages of the lower Cauca and Magdalena Rivers. The symbolic essence of gold, copper, and gold-copper alloys can be related to the emphasis in the popular use of the metal objects in these regions. Spanish chronicles and documents of the colonial period describe how the peoples of these areas prized objects of copper and tumbaga, espe cially nose ornaments, that a bridegroom offered to his father-in-law during a marriage ceremony.86 Such ornaments represented women, social identity, and the marriage alli ance permitted by social rules that ensured the permanence of the society as a whole.87 Historical sources report that the Indians distinguished the origin of the objects by their par ticular shape, as well as by their color and their smell, and that different communities were known for producing dis tinctive categories and shapes of ornaments made from spe cifically prescribed amounts of gold and copper.88 This suggests that people could identify the color and odor of the metal combinations associated with different communities. An alloy with specific amounts of gold and copper might represent the correct and balanced mixtures of male and female properties, which, at a symbolic level, identified a particular community.89 Matrimonial exchange included the idea of the right combination of odors. Among the Desana, for instance, marriage alliances that are correct according to exogamic rules are interpreted as a good com bination of odors, while the incompatibility of partners is described as having a "contaminating odor."90 The smell of copper and tumbaga has sexual and gender connotations and is associated with particular animals. Among the Desana, the odor of copper is related to that of a toad, which represents female fertility and procreation.91 The association of frogs and toads with female sexuality is common in the mythologies of the indigenous groups of Caribbean Colombia, among them the Zenu people and the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta.92 These associa tions recall the importance of frog representations in various archaeological materials of Caribbean Colombia, of the frog-shaped nose of some Darien pendants from the San Jacinto area, and of numerous copper and tumbaga nose ornaments showing local variations of standardized forms that have been found in extensive regions of Caribbean Colombia.93 We can mention as well the large number of nose ornaments with two lateral upturned "legs" that have been found in the San Jacinto area and that are depicted on local anthropomorphic figures, including Darien pendants (Figures 69-71). Although we cannot affirm that these nose ornaments represent a schematization of the legs of a frog, their shape reminds us of the features of this animal, and such an interpretation would accord with the symbolism of frogs. Additionally, the social importance of nose ornaments recalls particular gender and sexual connotations, which, in the case of metal ornaments, deserve further study. For example, for the Uwa the nose is related to male sexuality and the ears to female sexuality.94 The use of copper and tumbaga objects in the particular context of matrimonial exchange was widespread on the American continents and included different types of orna ments. The ancient Tamo of the Caribbean islands used ear ornaments as "bride price" during marriage alliances; they appreciated the dark red color and the smell of such orna ments made of the gold-copper alloy that they called guanfn.95 Among the indigenous people living in the North American northwest coast, the various uses of copper objects included their function in the context of marriage relationships. Among the Kwakiutl, for instance, the women accumulated "coppers," the most important of metal items for these people. Coppers, or bride wealth, were offered to the future husband. By giving coppers, the woman's family group symbolically bought the rights to the future children,96 the coppers serving as substitutes for children. In general, the coppers were individuals?"people": they had names, and they were described in terms of smell and texture.97 Darien pendants were also "people." The coppery matrix of the metal, subject to heavy corrosion, recalls the human ness of copper, its feminine associations, transformations of embryonic life, and the mortality of human beings. However, the presence of gold, which made a brilliant yellowish sur face possible, introduced the complementary male feature of divine immortality. These pendants were probably used as emblems evoking basic mythological principles related to balance and continuity of life. The Darien pendants that belonged to late cultural devel opments in Caribbean Colombia were probably used in activities related to social and political alliances, which might also have involved nose ornaments, other metal 66</page><page sequence="29">73. Shell ornament in the form of a Darien pendant, Caribbean Colombia; Canalete, Cordoba. H. 2% in. (6.1 cm). Museo del Oro, Bogota (K19). Photographer: Clark Manuel Rodriguez items, and objects of different materials, such as the frog shaped shell beads that are particularly abundant in the San Jacinto and neighboring areas or the shell ornaments in the form of Darien pendants (Figures 73, 74) that are occasion ally found in the Caribbean area. Copper, tumbaga, shell items, nose ornaments, frogs, anthropomorphic figures?all are linked by a basic symbolism that follows the integrative orientation of mythical thought. The widespread phenomenon represented by Darien pendants allows us to explore some possible explanations for their extensive distribution and for the local differences in their manufacture. The "birth" and diversification of Darien pendants by the time of Christ correspond to the development of local cultures associated with spectacular metalwork that lasted until A.D. 800-900. These early regional styles were probably tied to the prestige and social functions of local leaders, who had the right to be buried with large quantities of emblematic metal ornaments. This tendency is suggested, for instance, by the rich funerary offerings in the Calima River area, by the Quimbaya trea sures uncovered in the Quindfo region, by the numerous metal objects buried in the Zenu funerary mounds, and by the rich content of the Code graves in Panama. During this period, the Darien pendants that were produced alongside the early regional styles over large areas acted as a common means of symbolic communication. With the consolidation of the late regional styles in Colombia and Central America after A.D. 900, there was a change in the primary orientation of metallurgical produc 74.

Photographer: Clark Manuel Rodriguez tion. Chiefs, priests, and shamans also had a particular power that was imbued with cosmological energies and that gave them the right to use sacred ritual objects. However, in this period, popular use of numerous metal items during ritual occasions and in social alliances becomes more evident. Thousands of smaller, portable objects were produced in this context. The fluctuation in emphasis that guided the production and use of metal objects is reflected in the diminishing distribution of Darien pendants and in the mass production of objects belonging to the distinctive metalwork of the San Jacinto area. These differences, how ever, are linked by a primary and basic principle: the search for balance between opposing and complementary quali ties, which must be reproduced by humans to encourage the continuity of life in society, nature, and the cosmos.

There are a few preliminary studies of the physical and chemical mineralogical composition of Darien pendants. X-ray Fluorescence Analysis (XRF) was carried out on one pendant (Departamento Tecnico Industrial, Banco de la Republica, Bogota; Plazas 1998) and on two fragments, which were also analyzed using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS) (Scott 1982). The inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) technique was employed to examine the elemental composition of one fragment (Scott 1998). Fire Assay (FA) analysis of sixteen objects from differ ent regions of Colombia, carried out years ago (Casa de la Moneda, Banco de la Republica, Bogota) was published by Jose Perez de Barradas in 1954 and 1965-66. These results can be considered a first approach to our understanding of the wide range of gold copper alloys employed to manufacture the pendants in some areas and the use of high-grade gold or mainly copper in others. However, Darien pendants deserve a systematic metallurgical analysis that should be carried out on samples selected from dif ferent patterns of pendants associated with particular areas and periods. The FA analysis of two small Type 1 pendants (MO 6199, 6200) indicates 54-84% gold content, 5-7.5% silver, and 32.8-8.6% copper; Perez de Barradas 1954, pp. 25, 180, 272. 9.
