<plain_text><page sequence="1">BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES AUSTRALIA Understanding the Australian Aborigine. By A. P. Elkin. Morpeth Booklet No. 2. St. John's College Press, Morpeth, N.S.W., 1931, pp. 30. Though brief and non-technical, this is an excellent account of the life of the aborigine. It is divided into three parts, headed respectively language, social organization and secret life. In the first part the author points out how effective for native purposes the aboriginal languages are, and how they enshrine native thought. The second part contains a particularly lucid account of the kinship and marriage systems. Although Dr. Elkin's booklet is intended primarily for those in direct contact with natives - missionaries, pastoralists and protectors - he has not written only for a limited audience. The practical implications of the various customs are clearly pointed out, and, wherever possible, suggestions are made for overcoming difficulties. The following extract is from the section dealing with land ownership. " Once the Government has allowed white men to settle on tribal lands, both the settler and the aborigine can justify the attitudes they adopt toward one another. But obviously, some attempt should be made to prevent the develop- ment of strained relations. The white man might give the members of the horde or tribe whose country he now desires to use for grazing, a regular allowance of rations, more especially of meat . . . and explain to them that this is in return for depriving them of their right of hunting where his cattle are grazing, and for lessening their natural food supply." Primitive " Literature." By A. P. Elkin. The Morpeth Review. St. John's College Press, Morpeth, N.S.W. No. 14, December, 1930, 35-43, and No. 15, March, 1931, 38-47. Dr. Elkin begins with an account of primitive grammar, and he shows that it provides an effective means for the expression of the native's feelings, ideas and</page><page sequence="2">BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES 241 philosophy. He then classifies the various types of primitive literature into folk- tales, myths, riddles, proverbs and songs. Finally, he analyses the functions of primitive literature. It serves to preserve the happiness of the group and so makes for social solidarity, it gives a historical record and so preserves the continuity of tradition, it provides sanctions for law and morality, it is a means of handing on knowledge which gives efficacy to certain types of work, and it serves to hand on a philosophy of life and death. The article is intended for the untrained reader, but it contains some excellent material, and with expansion it could be made into a real contribution to anthropology. Selections from the Letters of Lorimer Fison and A. W. Howitt to Lewis Henry Morgan. Edited by B. J. Stern. American Anthropologist, XXXII (new series), 1930, 257-279 and 419-453- These letters are of special value to those interested in the history of the theory of kinship. Howitt and Fison owed their inspiration directly to Morgan, to whom they dedicated Kamilaroi and Kurnai. The letters, besides showing that these two men had also ideas of their own, throw light on the conditions under which anthropo- logical problems were investigated fifty years ago. Physiology and Mental Observations on the Australian Aborigines. By R. Pulleine and H. Woollard. Transactions of the Royal Society of South Australia, LIV, 1930, 62-75. Presents results of various physiological and mental tests. From these the deduction is made that visual acuity of the aborigines is high, while their intelligence is low. POLYNESIA An Ancient Maori Oven on Mount Egmont. By W. R. B. Oliver. Journal of the Polynesian Society, XL, 1931, 73-80. Description of an oven found buried under a thin layer of pumice. Orientation of the Maori Dead. By R. H. Steele. Journal of the Polynesian Society, XL, 1931, 81-86. The Maori buried their dead with the head towards the west. Judging from certain skeletons revealed by shifting sands in Wickcliffe Bay, New Zealand, the sun was the point on which the west was fixed. Maori Material in the Vienna Museum. By Raymond Firth. Journal of the Poly- nesian Society, XL, 1931, 95-102. Maori Canoe Sail in the British Museum. By Raymond Firth. Journal of the Polynesian Society, XL, 1931, 129-135.</page><page sequence="3">242 BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES Additional Notes on the Maori Canoe Sail in the British Museum. By Te Rangi Hiroa. Journal of the Polynesian Society, XL, 1931, 136-140. The first article contains notes on a chest, a desiccated body - of interest in view of past controversy on Maori mummification - weapons, various implements and ornaments, &amp;c, in the Vienna Museum. These are mainly from the collection of Andreas Reischek who was in New Zealand in 1881. The second and third articles give a complete description of, as far as is known, the only Maori canoe sail in existence. Some Curiosities of Polynesian Possessives. By A. Capell. Journal of the Polynesian Society, XL, 1931, 141-150. A discussion of possessives found in the languages of Futuna and Aniwa, New Hebrides. A theory of migrations is put forward to account for the appearance together of both Polynesian and Melanesian characteristics. A hypothetical re- construction of this type may be interesting, but it can be of no scientific value, for the author has taken no account of the laws by which languages work. Polynesian Leis. By E. D. W. Brown. American Anthropologist, XXXIII, 1931, 615-619. A sentimental description and classification of the different types of lei, and a non-scientific discussion of their origin. Notes on Polynesian Mythology. By Nora K. Chadwick. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, LX, 1930, 425-446. A comparison of certain features of Polynesian and Japanese mythology. The author concludes that both are derived from the same source, though culture creeps have also been responsible for some details of Polynesian mythology. The reader wonders why investigations were confined to these two areas. On the lines followed it appears that it would have been easy to have derived all the mythologies in the world from this same source. Incongruous elements could easily be explained away as culture creeps. An Unrecorded Feather Cape. By H. G. Beasley. Man, 1930, 140. A description is given with illustrations of a feather cape from Hawaii in the writer's collection. It is a fine example in red, yellow and black, and was for over a century in the possession of the family of Admiral von Kotzebue who received it from the wife of Kamehameha I in 1816. A Discussion of the Hamzah and Some Allied Aspects of Polynesian Phonetics. By J. Frank Stimson. Journal Polynesian Society, xxxix, 1930, 263-283. An exhaustive discussion is given of the place of the hamzah in Polynesian linguistics. The writer holds the usual opinion, that the glottal stop should be classed</page><page sequence="4">BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES 243 as a consonant - or at least as a consonantal effect - and advises the adoption of ' as the symbol for it in printing. With his further suggestion that by a modification this sign should be used to indicate etymology as well as a purely phonetic phenomenon, agreement is not so easy. Apart from the general objection to the mingling of etymological with phonetic representation, it is still largely a matter of opinion whether individual words can be identified and the loss of consonants thus proven, as between the various Polynesian dialects. MELANESIA AND NEW GUINEA Vital Statistics of New Ireland as Revealed in Genealogies. By Hortense Powder- maker. Human Biology, III, 1931, 351-375» While admitting that the collection of statistics through genealogies may lead to errors, the author puts forward figures to show that in certain parts of New Ireland during the era of European influence the native birth-rate has either decreased or remained stationary while the percentage of sterile women has increased. The figures also seem to show that there has been a corresponding increase of infant mortality. The conclusion is therefore drawn that the population is decreasing. While this is undoubtedly true, it is probably unwise to trust native statements regarding children who die in infancy, for they are so apt to be forgotten. The probable causes of depopulation are briefly outlined. The most important of these, in Dr. Powdermaker's opinion, is introduced disease, especially tuberculosis and gonorrhoea. Psychological causes do not operate, for the natives have by no means lost their joie de vivre, and their culture still functions as it formerly did. Malekula: Flying Tricksters, Ghosts, Gods and Epileptics. By J. W. Layard. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, LX, 1930, 501-524. A description of certain types of sorcery found in Malekula, New Hebrides. Analogies are drawn between beliefs associated with this sorcery and similar beliefs in ancient Egypt. The author suggests that there is a connection between the two. He is also of the opinion that much of the ritual associated with the initiation of the sorcerers is derived from epileptoid conditions. No attempt is made, however, to define the social position of sorcerers either in Malekula or ancient Egypt. Shamanism : an Analysis based on comparison with the Flying Tricksters of Malekula. By J. W. Layard. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, LX, 1930, 525-550. A comparison of the sorcerer of Malekula with the shaman of Siberia. It is suggested that the similarities, especially with regard to epileptoid features, point to a common origin.</page><page sequence="5">244 BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES Das Zwcigeschlecterwesen bei den Zentralaustraliern und anderen Volkern. By J. Winthuis, Hirschfeld, Leipzig, 1928, xii+293, 19 Plates. An argument that bisexuality is the basis of primitive religion. Das Zweigeschlecterwesen. By P. Gerhard Peekel. Anthropos, xxiv, 1929, 1005- 1072, 44 Figs. A criticism of Winthuis from the point of view of New Ireland culture. Die Wahrheit über das Zweigeschlecterwesen durch die Gegner bestàtigt. By Joseph Winthuis. Supplement to Zeitschrift fiir Volkerpsychologie und Soziologie, vi, 1930, viii+100. A reply to Peekel, partly on the ground that he overlooks the sexual character of the New Ireland cults. Papuan Petrographs. By F. E. Williams. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, LXI, 1931, 121-156. A description of the rock paintings and carvings of Papua. They are found in the Sogeri district, in the village of Lohomunidabu, and in the D'Entrecasteaux Islands and the mainland close by. Modern natives are not interested in the designs and deny all knowledge of them. The finest paintings of the Sogeri district are in red, yellow and white. In form both they and the carvings appear to be only geometrical designs. In Lohomunidabu there are no paintings, and many of the carvings are anthropomorphic. The carvings and paintings of the third area are both geometrical and anthropomorphic. The carving is always done by the " pecking " method. The Kazukuru Language of New Georgia. By J. H. L. Waterhouse, with notes by S. H. Ray. Man, 133, 1931. Some specimens of a hitherto unrecorded dialect from the interior of New Georgia are given, the speakers of which are now few in number, and mostly inter- married with Roviana and Muda folk. The vocabulary of Kazukuru shows few resemblances to the Roviana speech, or to any other language of the Solomons, Melanesian or Papuan.</page></plain_text>
