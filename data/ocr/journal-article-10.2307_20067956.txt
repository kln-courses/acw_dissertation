<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEW God Is Red, by Vine Deloria, Jr. New York: Grosset and Dunlap Publishers, 1973. Pp. 375. $10.95. Vine Deloria, who has been largely responsible for bringing Native Americans into their present state of consciousness, has taken the tenets of both his legal and theological training, as well as his insight ful and at times biased view as a Standing Rock Sioux, to explain to the world the moral, cultural, and religious foundation of the Indian society. Discussing the Native American concepts of time, space, land, history, origin, death, personality, family, and tribe, Deloria condemns much of the industrial order and hails the aboriginal call to a religion of harmony with nature. These third-world people, Deloria claims, will "rise and begin to reclaim their ancient heritage." (p. 301) This reclamation will be an unphilosophical one and thus its simplicity will give meaning to life today. In short, Deloria seems to say, the old morals will return and all will be well. How does Deloria support this claim? God Is Red is divided into 16 chapters and begins with the first few chapters setting the histori cal stage which most readers have come to expect from Deloria, even though he later points out it is Western Christian people who have a "preoccupation with history" (p. 112), and it is the Indian who is not "dependent on the belief that a certain thing happened in the past." (p. 113) In the first chapter, Deloria assesses the Indian move ment of the last decade as an unsuccessful parade of activists whom America began to hear but not heed. This activism produced an odd result, according to Deloria, causing many Americans to embrace the Indian cause. Whites wanted to share fishing rights, dig up graves, and generally treat the Indian as just another ethnic group groping for identity. This is not the goal, says Deloria, and Indians writing about them selves helped to create an ever-increasing "go-in-peace-my-son" stereo type of the Native American. The author believes this concept was broken down by authorities like Alvin Josephy, whose best-selling The Indian Heritage of America began to emphasize the "relevant" and ancient heritage of the Indian, (p. 43) Clearly Deloria feels it is these older ways, particularly the older moral and religious ways, which can knit a fabric strong enough to protect and preserve the contemporary Indian. It is the nature of these religious ways which Deloria next discusses in the 13 remaining chapters. Why, Deloria asks, did the Indians who looted and burned the Bureau of Indian Affairs have several holy 537</page><page sequence="2">men with them to conduct ceremonies? What is in the tribal religions that is central to the Indian way of life? Deloria believes that these religious views are especially central to the current demands for legal redistribution of land or the civil right to hunt without state encum brances. If Indians and non-Indians fully understand the deep re ligious commitment to land, then they should better understand the bitter and desperate actions, both legal and extralegal, taken by ac tivists to regain land. Deloria devotes considerable space in this book to describing the philosophical importance of space?a particular space?to most Native Americans. Some religious ceremonies like the rain dances of the Southwest are totally dependent on the geography of the place. Such a concept seems unimportant when compared to Western defi nitions of religion, but, Deloria insists, we will have to redefine our working concepts of religion to allow for the Native American. This redefinition will be less universal and cannot explain all of life as other religious definitions do. In moving toward this redefinition, Deloria compares the Chris tian and Indian tribal religions. For example, creation in the tribal religions is an "ecosystem" (p. 91 ) or a series of events and interpre tations, whereas Christians emphasize a single event. Unlike Chris tians, Indians do not emphasize anthropomorphic deities. Deloria also points out that Christians rely totally on the concept of specific history where the focus of tribal religions is nonspecific. Even though the Hopi have much understanding of history and believe they sur vived three world destructions, these concepts of history are still time free and nonspecific. Deloria desires to view Indian tribal religion as a common denominator of all origin. Because the Indian concept of religion is more global, the Indian concept of reality is more global concerning such things as death. Death, according to Deloria, is not nearly so grief ridden an act in tribal religion as it is in Christendom. Deloria implies from this that the tribal religions offer a more posi tive outlook for the future. In these Indian religions the individual becomes less important and his society, family, or tribe is related to God. This is contrasted with Christianity which emphasizes a per sonal relation between God and an individual. In this way, religion dominates Indian culture as a band between belief and the land. Christian religion has produced institutions, whereas the only insti tution of Indian religions is the land. Legally, as Deloria points out, tribal religion presents a new prob lem because requests for land space on which to practice religion are not historically in contention in cases involving religious freedoms. A 538</page><page sequence="3">more difficult problem, says Deloria, will be overcoming the ridicule of the old religions by contemporary society. The problems of this book are many. The discourse is often ramb ling and assumptive. The scholarship and source material in God Is Red is less tightly woven than other Deloria works. However, these concerns are minor, and the work is a sound contribution to better understanding Native American culture. Their religion allows them to experience life, not explain it. To Deloria's mind, the tribal re ligions offer an alternative. Every lawyer, judge, student, scholar, thinker, both Indian and non-Indian, will gain a greater understand ing of these alternatives as they affect the Indian movement today by reading God Is Red.
