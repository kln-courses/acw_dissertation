<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN ARGUMENT FOR INDIAN STATUS FOR NATIVE HAWAIIANS-THE DISCOVERY OF A LOST TRIBE Richard H. Houghton III* Introduction There is only one group of Native Americans in the United States today that is not considered "Indian," one group that the United States government has consistently overlooked in its efforts to benefit and compensate Native Americans. That group is the Native Hawaiian people.1 Unlike other Indians, including Native Alaskans, Congress has not dealt comprehensively with Native Hawaiians.2 Moreover, statutes passed for the general benefit of Indians or Indian tribes have not yet been administratively or judicially in terpreted to include Native Hawaiians.3 Nevertheless, the concerns motivating Congress to enact legisla tion for other Native American groups exist equally among Native Hawaiians. Like other Native Americans, Native Hawaiians were once a sovereign people4 who have suffered as a result of white encroachment and eventual United States seizure and exploita tion of their lands.5 Like other Indians, Native Hawaiians have become a forgotten and impoverished minority in their own land.6 More than 60 percent of the Native Hawaiian people have no re portable income, and of those with income, nearly 30 percent * B.S.F.S., 1983, Georgetown University School of Foreign Service; J.D., 1987, Catholic University Law School.

Only since 1974 has Con gress sporadically begun to include Native Hawaiians in limited programs designed to provide services for mainland Indians.16 Still, Congress has done so with some reticence,17 reflected even in the 7.

More often, Congress' intent to extend benefits to all Indians is frustrated by the Washington bureaucracy. A good illustration is the application of the Snyder Act establishing certain programs for Indians under the auspices of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA).19 Congress identified as the beneficiaries of the Act the Indians throughout the United States;20 the Department of the Interior, which oversees the BIA, originally ruled that "Indians" meant "any and all Indians, to whatever degree."21 Nevertheless, Native Hawaiians are excluded from applying for the benefits of fered under the Act because the Department later required that Indians be members of a "federally recognized" tribe to receive any benefits from the BIA, and that an Indian group must inhabit the continental United States to apply for recognition.22 Thus, every Native American group in the United States except Native Hawaiians can apply for recognition and the benefits flowing from that status. This small section of the Code of Federal Regulations succeeded in arbitrarily denying a myriad of benefits available to Indians and Indian tribes to Native Hawaiians, even in instances where it appears that the intent of Congress would have been to include them.23 Welfare; the Congressional Research Service, and the Department of the Interior sub mitted opinions that Native Hawaiians could not be included on the basis of their being Indians.

Part II will analyze the term "Indian" and its application in the law to show that Native Hawaiians are Indians. Part III will examine the criteria used to establish tribal status and, applying each to the Native Hawaiian people, will demonstrate that as a group they constitute an Indian tribe and therefore are eligible for benefits extended to other Indians and Indian tribes. Part IV will then propose both congressional and administrative solutions to the present failure to include Native Hawaiians in programs for the general benefit of Indians and Indian tribes. Finally, it will be shown that without the implementation of a comprehensive solution, the Native Hawaiian people will continue to be unjustly excluded from a vast number of programs for which they should be eligible because of their status as Indians and as an Indian tribe. I. The Importance of Indian and Tribal Status in Federal Law: A Brief Introduction The question of whether a person is an Indian or whether a Native American group constitutes an Indian tribe is one of un questionable significance in the field of Indian law.24 The benefits afforded by legislation for Indians hinge on a determination that the beneficiary is indeed an Indian.25 Similarly, because the federal government's power to legislate for the benefit of Indian groups26 is limited by the Constitution to Indian tribes,27 a showing that (S. 1356). While the United States has declined to bring suit against the state of Hawaii over the latter's mismanagement of the Hawaiian trust lands, Native Hawaiians are unable to avail themselves of section 1362 because the statute requires that the tribe be recog nized by the Department of the Interior, and Native Hawaiians are precluded from recognition. 24. For a detailed discussion of tribal status, see generally Weatherhead, supra note 21. For the purpose of this article, the term "tribe" is not meant to refer to any particular socio-political arrangement. Rather, it is a reconciliation of the legal and ethnohistorical meanings of the term. See id. at 5 n.27 and accompanying text. 25. See, e.g., 25 U.S.C. ? 1901 (1982) (Indian Child Welfare Act) (set out in 25 C.F.R. ? 23 (1985)). 26.

Most benefits conferred upon individual Indians are ex tended to them as tribal members, and thus a great deal depends on the affirmative establishment of tribal status. Though the layper son might think there is only one kind of Indian tribe, for purposes of American Indian law there are basically two?those that are "recognized" and those that are not.29 "Recognized" means that the government acknowledges as a matter of law that a particular indigenous group is a tribe30 by conferring the legal status of "tribe" on that group,31 thus bringing it within Congress' legislative powers. While recognition of tribal status may come from many different entities for a variety of purposes, the most important is that offered by the federal government. Unequivocal federal recognition of a group's tribal status is a prerequisite to receiving the services offered by the Department of the Interior32 and establishes tribal status for all federal purposes.33 Although a large number of Native American groups have been governmental^ recognized as tribes,34 many, including Native Hawaiians, have not. There are two situations in which the federal government or the courts will be required to determine whether 28. For an exhaustive study of the federal services available to Indians and Indian tribes, see generally Congressional Research Serv., Federal Programs of Assistance to American Indians (1978) (No. 78-110 GOV) (R. Jones, author). 29. Nonrecognized Indians can be broken down into three basic subgroups. The first are those that have never been recognized, like Native Hawaiians. The second consists of those that were once recongized, but have had their tribal status terminated by Con gress. See, e.g., 73 Stat. 502 (1959) (Catawba Tribe); 71 Stat. 283 (1957) (Coyote Valley Ranch Band); 68 Stat. 250 (1954) (Mixed-Blood Utes). For detailed discussions of the termination of tribal status, see generally S. Tyler, A History of Indian Policy 151-97 (1973); Wilkinson &amp; Biggs, The Evolution of the Termination Policy, 5 Am. Indian L. Rev. 139 (1977); Note, 35 Stan. L. Rev., supra note 11, at 1181. The third are those that have applied for recognition, but have been turned down. See, e.g., 51 Fed. Reg. 2437 (1986) (United Lumbee Nation of North Carolina); 50 Fed. Reg. 38047 (1985) (Northwest Cherokee Wolf Band, Red Clay Inter-tribal Indian Band); 50 Fed.

Although Native Hawaiians as a group would meet the criteria required by the Department of the Interior for recognition, federal regulations preclude Native Hawaiians from even applying for recognition by the Bureau of Indian Affairs as constituting a tribe.37 Nevertheless, there is nothing to preclude the recognition of Native Hawaiians as an Indian tribe for purposes of general Indian legisla tion not directly provided by the BIA. A close examination of the Native Hawaiian people shows that they are both Indians and an Indian tribe because they are an aboriginal group whose ancestors, before the arrival of whites, inhabited territory that became a part of the United States.38 In addition, the Native Hawaiian people constitute an Indian tribe because they meet the criteria necessary to establish tribal status.39 II. Native Hawaiians as Indians: A Matter of Semantics The term "Indian" is perhaps as ambiguous as any in legal usage in the United States. Congress has never provided a generic definition for application to the field of Indian law, and as a result the base determination of who is an Indian has been left to be decided inconsistently by the courts40 and federal agencies.41 However, courts now generally agree on the basic definition of 35. See, e.g., 25 C.F.R. ? 20 (1985) (financial and social services); 25 C.F.R. ? 26 (1985) (employment assistance). 36. See Weatherhead, supra note 21, at 18. 37. 25 C.F.R. ? 83.4 (1984).

Cohen, Handbook on Federal Indian Law 2 nn.3-4 (1942) [hereinafter 1942 Handbook].</page><page sequence="7">No. 1] INDIAN STA TUS FOR NA TIVE HA WAIIANS 7 "Indian,"42 and although no federal court has considered whether Native Hawaiians as a people fall under that rubric,43 the status of Native Hawaiians as an indigenous people within the United States calls for legal treatment identical to that received by mainland Indians. The term "Indian" encompasses those aborigines who, before the arrival of Caucasians, inhabited the territories that became the fifty United States, and their descen dants.44 Therefore, the term properly includes not only the natives of the forty-eight contiguous states, but the Inuit and Aleut peoples of Alaska,45 and the natives of Hawaii. In addition, racial characteristics are not determinative of one's status as an Indian because the term "Indian" is not a racial classification; rather, it is a political distinction based on historical circumstances. Thus, although Native Hawaiians may not be similar to mainland In dians in the anthropological sense, the plight of both groups as indigenous peoples within the United States requires analogous legal treatment.46 The ambiguity surrounding the term "Indian" has a long history. A confused Spanish admiral named Christopher Colum bus, who mistakenly believed that he had discovered the East In dies,47 first applied the term to the native residents of the Carib bean Islands in 1493.48 Though others later corrected Columbus' mistake in geography, they never corrected the appellation that he applied to the indigenous people of the Americas. Westerners eventually applied the term "Indian" to all aboriginal groups in North and South America,49 a practice taken up by the American 42. See infra notes 55-63 and accompanying text. 43. 1982 Handbook, supra note 2, at 803. One court has ruled that a particular group of Native Hawaiians does not constitute an Indian band for purposes of 28 U.S.C. ? 1362 because it was not "duly recognized" by the Department of the Interior, but left open the question of whether Native Hawaiians as a group constitute a tribe.

In United States v. Native Village of Unalakleet,56 the Court of Claims held that the generic term "American Indian" as used in section 2 of the Act encompassed "all American aborigines."57 Because 50.

In 1948 the court held in Hynes v. Grimes Packing Co.59 that the Indian Citizen Act60 conferring United States citizenship on "all non-citizen In dians" applied to Native Alaskans.61 Similarly, in 1976 the court, relying in part on the reasoning of the Court of Claims in Unalakleet, ruled that the term "Indian" as used in 25 U.S.C. ? 34562 means the aborigines of America and thus includes Native Alaskans.63 The inclusion of Native Alaskans within this definition leaves Native Hawaiians as the only other aboriginal people who, prior to Western settlement, lived in an area that later became part of the fifty United States and are not considered Indians.64 Nonetheless, it follows from the reasoning of the Court of Claims in Unalakleet and other later federal cases65 that Native Hawaiians properly can be termed Indians. The Unalakleet court determined that the term "American Indian" includes all the descendants of any pre-Columbian inhabitants of the United States.66 Thus, this definition must also include Native Hawaiians who are descended from the prediscovery inhabitants of what is now the state of Hawaii.

Captain Cook wrote of his return to the island of Hawaii in January 1779: "The ships are very much crowded with Indians &amp; surrounded by a multatude of canoes." James King, who took charge of the expedition after Captain Cook's death, described Cook's anger at a native's theft of some tools from one of the ships: "In going on board, the Capt' expressed his sorrow that the behaviour of the Indians would at least oblige him to use force." Dr. William Ellis, Cook's surgeon, wrote: "[T]he Indians behaved with great resolution and intrepidity, and notwithstanding a severe fire was kept up for some time afterwards, they maintained their ground, and as soon as one fell, another immediately supplied his place." 3 Captain Cook's Journals 490-91, 530, 540 (W.

For example, in 1982 the Hawaii Supreme Court com pared the status of Native Hawaiians with that of mainland Indians in Ahuna v. Department of Hawaiian Home Lands,16 and stated that questions involving Native Hawaiians should be analyzed in the same manner as those involving other Native Americans.77 To determine the breadth of a trust responsibility owed to Native Hawaiians under a state statute, the court turned to mainland federal decisions involving the federal-Indian trust relationship, stating that the court was dealing with relationships between the government and an aboriginal people and thus "reason dictates that [courts] draw the analogy between Native Hawaiians . . . and other Native Americans."78 Congress has also indicated an understanding that Native Hawaiians can be treated as Indians by including Native Hawaiians in the term "Indian" in several pieces of legislation, including the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978,79 which was enacted to protect Native American religions.80 Thus, under the reasoning of federal and state case law and in the view of Congress, Native Hawaiians can validly be considered Indians. The determination that Native Hawaiians are Indians is unaf fected by the argument that they are not of the same racial stock as the Indians inhabiting the forty-eight contiguous states and thus cannot be considered to be Indians.81 The Court of Claims re jected a similar anthropological argument regarding Eskimos in Unalakleet.%1 The court reasoned that the term "Indian" does not 76. 64 Haw. 327, 640 P.2d 1161 (1982). 77.

Hawaiians are of Polynesian racial stock, while the groups inhabiting the forty eight contiguous states are of Asian/Mongolian racial stock. Yet despite analogous racial differences between Indians in the lower forty-eight states and Native Alaskans, the United States Supreme Court has implicitly included Native Alaskans, non-Indians under an "an thropological" meaning, within the term "Indian." See Alaska Pac. Fisheries v. United States, 248 U.S. 78, 86-87 (19?8) (Annette Islands were set aside as an "Indian Reserva tion" for the Metlakahtla Indians and "such other Alaskan Natives as may join them"). 82. See Unalakleet, 411 F.2d at 1260-61. Inuits ("Eskimos") and Aleuts display many physical characteristics which differentiate them from the Indians inhabiting the "lower 48." Members of the two groups have more pronounced Mongolian features (almond shaped eyes, round faces), have generally smaller hands and feet, and have an appreciably higher percentage of B-type blood (ABO system) than do other Indians.

Congressional enactments for the benefit of Indians are based on the Indians' political status as dependent aboriginal peoples, not on their racial status as Indians.85 Thus, in situa tions where one's status as an Indian is determinative of a benefit available under a federal statute, to limit those benefits on the basis of race would violate the fifth amendment equal protection clause.86 To illustrate, if legislation for the general benefit of In dians was based on "race, creed, or color, slant of eyes or shape of cranium,"87 that legislation would constitute invidious racial discrimination and violate the Constitution.88 Because a construc tion of a statute rendering it constitutional is always preferred,89 it must be assumed that when Congress accords benefits to In dians generally without limitations, it does not do so on the basis of racial criteria but on the basis of their status as members of 83.

Therefore, the term properly includes the natives of Hawaii. III. Native Hawaiians as an Indian Tribe: A Matter of History Once it is determined that members of a particular group are Indians, the only issue remaining regarding the inclusion of that group in federal programs not directly tied to the Bureau of In dian Affairs for the general benefit of Indian tribes is whether the group constitutes a tribe.92 Congress may not apply its powers over Indians to a particular group or community by arbitrarily calling them a tribe.93 Rather, the group must possess certain characteristics that make them a tribe: those that they possess as an American aboriginal people, and those that are a result of treat ment by the federal government. The Handbook of Federal In dian Law94 discusses five considerations which "singly or jointly have been particularly relied upon in reaching the conclusion that a group constitutes a tribe or band"95 of Indians. The considera tions are: (1) whether the group has had treaty relations with the United States; (2) whether the group has been denominated a tribe by act of Congress or Executive order; 90. Id.

A treaty relationship with the United States expressly recognizes that an Indian tribe is an in nately sovereign entity,100 a showing important in establishing tribal status. As with many mainland Indian tribes, the Native Hawaiian people had extensive treaty relations as a sovereign nation with the United States over a period extending from the first visit of an American military ship to the Islands in 1825 to the overthrow of the monarchy in 1893.101 As with treaties concluded between the United States and the mainland Indian tribes, the first treaties with Native Hawaiians were concerned primarily with "peace and 96. 1942 Handbook, supra note 41, at 270-71. 97.

After that date, in order to receive benefits from the BIA the requirement that the tribe reside in the continental United States was added. See 43 Fed. Reg. 39,361 (Oct. 2, 1978). Although there are other definitions of tribal status, see, e.g., 25 C.F.R. ? 83.4, they are more general than those outlined here. Thus, meeting these five criteria would suffice to establish tribal status under any test. 99. The small fish cannot swallow the big fish. Hawaiian proverb. 100. Washington v.

As American interest in the lands of the aboriginal signatories increased, however, amorphous concepts of peace and friendship gave way to concrete trade and land concessions, fur ther mirroring events on the mainland. The final result was the abrogation of the treaties and complete annexation of the natives' lands by the United States. Treaty relations between the United States and the Native Hawaiian people began with the signing of a bilateral agreement between the parties in 1826102 by Captain Thomas ap Catesby Jones on behalf of the United States, and the Regent Ka'ahumanu on behalf of King Kau'ikea'ouli.103 Captain Jones, commander of the U.S.S. Peacock, concluded the Articles of Arrangement while on a military tour of the Pacific.104 The agreement, like most of the treaties entered into with mainland Indian tribes during the same period, included a "perpetual peace and friendship" provi sion.105 Similarly, the Articles primarily served as a commercial agreement that was "eminently beneficial to the United States,"106 yet gave no real benefits to the native people.107 While the Ar ticles are considered an "unperfected treaty" because they were never presented to the U.S. Senate for its advice and consent, 102.

Like the Indians on the mainland, the Native Hawaiians learned that the word "perpetual," when used in a treaty by the United States, meant "at our pleasure." As with many of the treaties signed by the United States and mainland Indian tribes, the United States moved from seeking friendship and economic cooperation with the Native Hawaiian people as a sovereign nation to finally expropriating the natives' lands and extinguishing that sovereignty. Nevertheless, treaty rela tions did exist and therefore Native Hawaiians satisfy the first consideration in determining tribal status.

Congress has since continued to include the Native Hawaiian people in programs enacted for the benefit of Indians. In 1974, Congress specifically included Native Hawaiians as beneficiaries in a bill providing services for other Indians. The Native American Programs Act of 1974147 included Native Hawaiians in a program to "provide the goal of economic and social self-sufficiency for American Indians" through providing financial assistance to both public and nonprofit agencies serving native groups.148 Similarly, the American Indian Religious Freedom Act149 guarantees "In dians their inherent rights of freedom [to practice the] religion of the American Indian, Eskimo, Aleut, and Native Hawaiian,"150 thus explicitly equating Native Hawaiians and Indians.151 The Drug Abuse Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act provides that Native Americans, including Native Hawaiians, are to be given special consideration in government funding of rehabilitative pro grams.152 Finally, the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act153 provides similar benefits for Native Americans, again including Native Hawaiians.154 In addition to the acts of Congress including Native Hawaiians in programs benefitting mainland Indians, Congress has passed legislation specifically for Native Hawaiians.

Similarly, while no executive order has ever expressly designated Native Hawaiians a tribe, the executive branch has consistently treated Native Hawaiians in the same manner as other Indian tribes. In 1829, President Adams, in terms reminiscent of the official attitude toward Indian tribes in the nineteenth century, expressed to King Kamehameha III his wishes for his people's "advance ment ... in the arts of the civilized world"166 and congratulated the King and his people on the rapid progress made in "acquiring a knowledge of the True Religion?the Religion of the Christian Bible."167 In 1842, President Tyler, in a message to Congress on December 30, fully recognized the independent sovereign status of the Kingdom of Hawai'i and its people.168 Finally, when, in 1874, King David Kalakaua traveled to Washington, D.C., on a goodwill trip designed to promote treaty relations,169 he, like the chiefs of several Indian tribes that came before him, was received by President Grant as the visiting leader of a sovereign yet somewhat inferior native people.170 In addition to the President, other members of the executive branch have treated Native Hawaiians in a manner similar to mainland Indians. For example, in 1920 the then-Secretary of the Interior, Franklin K. Lane, referred to Native Hawaiians as "wards 165. 1942 Handbook, supra note 41, at 271; Letter from LaFolette Butler, supra note 95. 166.

Congressional dealings with Native Hawaiians show that they have been treated as an Indian tribe on many occasions. Con gress concluded treaties with Native Hawaiians as a sovereign peo ple and then later, after their lands and sovereignty had been taken from them, included Native Hawaiians in programs for Indians. While not as extensive as the contacts between Native Hawaiians and Congress, the relation with the executive branch similarly showed a predilection on the part of the Executive to treat Native Hawaiians as a tribe. Thus, Native Hawaiians satisfy the second consideration for tribal status. Hawaiian Trust Lands: Ola ka lawai'a i kahi po'o manu.173 Native Hawaiians traditionally had a collective right in their lands and maintain their right in 200,000 acres of Hawaiian lands set aside for them by the United States Congress as the equivalent of a reservation. Both the historical developments surrounding the Hawaiian trust lands and the present status of those lands compel the conclusion that the Native Hawaiian people possess a collective right in tribal lands, and thus they satisfy the third consideration for determining tribal status. The basis of the Hawaiian civilization was a complex system of land tenure174 similar to the feudal system prevalent in Europe 171. Ahuna, 64 Haw. at 336, 640 P.2d at 1167. 172.

Most ahupua'a were divided into smaller units called 77/ and 77/ kupono,181 which in turn were sub divided into individual plots farmed by the general population, or maka'ainana. A hierarchical social system paralleled this pattern of land divi sion. Although the maka'ainana lived on their own plots of land, there was no concept of fee simple absolute ownership.182 Rather, 175. J. Hobbs, supra note 72, at 1; 1 R.

In sum, the government and landholdings were inextricably woven into the Native Hawaiian social fabric and formed the stylobate for the entire culture. This system of feudal land tenure remained basically unchanged even when the first Hawaiian king, Kamehameha I (the Great), united all the islands into a single kingdom between 1794 and 1805.187 After his conquests, Kamehameha became the ali'i 'ai moku of the entire island chain and thus exercised supreme author ity, as sole owner188 and government, over all the lands of the kingdom.189 All Hawaiians held their lands at the King's pleasure; there were no inheritance rights and non-Hawaiians were excluded from holding land.190 183.

Because of Hawaii's geographic position, it was becoming a principal trading center in the Pacific basin and a large number of whites settled on the Islands. The results closely paralleled those of Western contact with the Indians on the mainland.191 Increased settlement by whites caused the economy to change rapidly from one based on agriculture to one dependent on trade, and as the economy changed traditional Hawaiian culture changed with it. Under pressure from white settlers who wished to own land in fee simple, the King promulgated the Constitution of 1840 declaring that the land belonged collectively to the ali'i, and to the people, under the monarch's control.192 Consequently, as whites began to acquire land under the new system, the traditional system began to col lapse. Native population levels fell drastically and native land ownership fell with them.193 In short, white settlement in areas populated by the native people had the same deleterious effects in Hawaii as on the mainland.194 These effects continued to intensify as more whites settled in the kingdom. Pressure from the growing number of westerners to make land available for development mounted on the govern ment, and the result was the Great Mahele, the Great Division, 191. 1982 Handbook, supra note 2, at 799. 192.

First, the act limited the land available for kuleana grants because it only allowed the hoa'aina to apply for a grant of land that they had actually cultivated199 plus a small house lot of not less than a quarter of an acre.200 Second, a hoa'aina had to prove his claim before a Land Commission and pay the survey costs.201 However, many hoa'aina were too poor to pay for the survey,202 or lacked the sophistication necessary to prove their claims.

When Congress annexed Hawaii in 1898, the United States, without paying any compensation, took title to the crown and government lands expropriated from the Native Hawaiian people by the Republic.215 In denying compensation to Queen Lili'uokalani or the Hawaiian people for the crown lands taken by the United States, the United States Court of Claims nevertheless recognized that Native Hawaiians had a collective right in the lands.216 On July 9, 1921, Congress acknowledged an obligation to the indi genous people of Hawaii and their descendants by enacting the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act.217 The Act established a land 211.

But when Hawaii was admitted to the Union, title to and administration of the trust was transferred to the state under sec tion 5 of the Hawaii Admission Act225 as a condition of statehood226 and adopted as state law.227 In accordance with this transfer, sec tion 5 of the Admission Act provided that: (b) the United States grants to the State of Hawaii, effective upon its admission into the Union, the United States' title . . . to all lands defined as ''available lands" by section 203 of the Hawaii Homes Commission Act, 1920, as amended . . .

A trust relationship between the United States and an Indian tribe retains full force until Congress expressly repudiates it by contrary legislation,241 a repudiation that does not exist in the case of the Hawaiian Home Lands Trust. The United States has never sufficiently manifested withdrawal of its protection so as to sever completely the trust relationship.242 On the contrary, in retaining supervisory powers Congress has evinced an intent to continue that relationship. Similarly, the United States has not severed its trust relationship with some mainland tribes simply by having delegated a portion of its trust responsi bilities to the states.243 Thus, although the state of Hawaii has assumed the administration of the land trust, this assumption of responsibility for the Native Hawaiians' welfare is insufficient to abrogate the federal trusteeship.244 Despite the dual responsibilities exercised over the trust by both the state of Hawaii and the federal government, more than sixty years after its inception the Hawaiian Homes program is a disap pointing failure.

Despite this failure, some Native Hawaiians live in distinctively native communities throughout the state.256 The existence of these communities is important because some authorities require a show ing that an aboriginal group inhabits distinct communities as part of the test used to establish tribal status.257 Most live on the island of O'ahu258 in towns such as Wai'anae populated primarily by Native Hawaiians.259 Similar distinctive communities also exist on other islands.

Thus, this collective right in land satisfies the third element in determining tribal status. Intertribal Relations: Mai lou i ka 'ulu i luna lilo, o lou hewa i ka ulu 'a'iole, eia iho no ka 'ulu i ke alo.263 While there is little evidence that Native Hawaiians have been historically treated as a tribe by other Indian tribes, the absence of recognition lies not in a lack of grounds to be so considered by other tribes, but in a lack of geographic proximity to them. The unique geographic position of Hawaii has prevented Native Hawaiians from being treated as an Indian tribe by other mainland tribes. An isolated volcanic archipelago located in the central Pacific Ocean thousands of miles from the nearest populated land areas,264 Hawaii is the only state not a part of the continental land mass of the United States. This isolation has prevented con tacts between Native Hawaiians as a group and other mainland tribes.265 Nonetheless, Native Hawaiians have been historically treated as a distinct group by other Polynesian peoples. For ex ample, in 1854 the Hawaiian government appointed Charles St. Julian as minister-at-large to the governments of the South Pacific 261. The entire island of Ni'ihau is owned by the Robinson family and serves as a ranch. Almost all of the island's inhabitants are Native Hawaiians who work for the ranch. 262. That Native Hawaiians share a collective interest in land is also evident from the fact that, despite poverty-level incomes, many are ineligible for public legal aid pro grams because of their interest in the trust lands.

However, modern transportation and communication brought Native Hawaiians increased contacts with the United States and has resulted in their recognition as an independent aboriginal people by mainland Indians.

And with increased contacts with the mainland, Native Hawaiians are being recognized as a tribe by mainland Indian groups. Native Hawaiians as a group thus meet the fourth criterion used to establish tribal status. Native Hawaiian Political Authority: Mai nana i ka la'au malo'o, 'a'ole mea loa'a malaila.277 Although initially the government of the Islands was divided between numerous chiefs, the Native Hawaiian people were united under a single central government in 1795 that ruled until over thrown with the help of United States troops in 1893. Native Hawaiians were thus forbidden the exercise of their traditional form of tribal government. However, just as mainland Indian tribes adjusted their tribal policies and organizations to the realities of life under the influence of a dominant non-Indian culture, so too did the Native Hawaiian people adapt their ways to exercise what limited sovereign rights they could under American rule. Members of the royal family continued to provide for the benefit of their people, and though native laws were supplanted by American jurisprudence, the new court system upheld certain native legal rights. Gradually, Native Hawaiians regained limited political con trol through various governmental bodies. Thus, Native Hawaiians satisfy the fifth and final consideration in determining tribal status. Government authority in presettlement Hawaii was vested solely in the ali'i, whose rule over the majority of the common popula tion was absolute.278 Early Native Hawaiians were not united under a single king, but under a collection of feudal rulers whose domi nions varied in size according to the fortunes of war.279 The ruler of each dominion was the ali'i nui or great chief, whose position member of the Native American Rights Fund.

The high chief was assisted in governing by two officials: the kahuna nui or high priest, who oversaw religious affairs, and the kalaimoku,2*1 the prime minister, who acted as the principal ad viser on temporal matters.282 This fractured feudal system continued unchanged until King Kamehameha I united the five main islands under his rule in 1795.283 Kamehameha thus became the ali'i nui of the entire island group, and although preserving the traditional system of fealty, he appointed governors, kia'aina, for each island.284 However, pressure from a growing number of white merchants and Protes tant missionaries resident in the Islands began to accelerate changes in the traditional system of government. In 1826, the monarch concluded the Islands' first treaty with a foreign power,285 and in 1835 the first penal code, heavily influenced by the missionaries, was proclaimed.286 The traditional advisory council of chiefs evolved into a legislative body similar to the early English House of Lords, and in 1840 the first constitution was promulgated creating a constitutional monarchy patterned in part after England's, though the King retained a greater measure of power than his British counterpart.287 The growing economic power and diminishing numbers of 280.

This right was codified dur ing the monarchy, and it is still in effect today.313 In 1982 the Supreme Court of Hawaii ruled that regardless of the exclusivity traditionally associated with the non-Hawaiian concept of fee sim ple land ownership, Native Hawaiians may enter any undeveloped lands within the ahupua'a314 in which they live to gather items for cultural purposes.315 In addition to the judiciary, the federal government has also preserved some Native Hawaiian rights predating annexation. For example, before annexation, Native Hawaiians had a right to fish in coastal waters and along the shore regardless of who controlled the land off which they fished. In 1938, Congress reaffirmed this traditional right when it enacted a provision giving Native Hawaiians the exclusive right to fish along the shores of the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.316 313.

The Hawaiian Homes Commission was created in 1921,317 and today functions as the executive board heading the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, the state agency created in 1960 to ad minister the Native Hawaiian homelands program.318 The Com mission is composed of eight members, all of whom are of Native Hawaiian blood, and possesses governmental powers over the Hawaiian Homes Commission lands.319 The lands are held in trust for the benefit of the native population and are to be distributed solely to Native Hawaiians for agricultural, pastoral, and residential homesteads. The powers of the Commission include the right to determine eligibility of Native Hawaiians for participation in the program,320 much in the same way that Indian tribal councils have the power to decide who may participate in tribal affairs as a member of the tribe.321 Other powers are the ability to determine compliance with the Homes Commission Act, the successor ship to the trust lands, and other governmental powers analogous to those exercised by other Indian tribal governing bodies.322 Addi tionally, the Hawaiian Homes Commission is authorized to "under take . . . activities having to do with the economic and social welfare" of Native Hawaiians receiving homesteads under the pro gram.323 The second way Native Hawaiians exercise a form of self government is through the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA).324 317.

The Exclusion of Native Hawaiians from Indian Programs: Legislative and Administrative Solutions While it has been demonstrated that the Native Hawaiians satisfy the criteria for both Indian and tribal status, proposing solutions to the failure to include them in programs for the general benefit of Indians and Indian tribes is a difficult task. The first change that needs to be made is not in the law but in the minds of those who make the law. Still, Native Hawaiians, as members of the class of "Indians" and as an Indian tribe, are entitled to the same benefits as those groups. There are concrete changes both in the ways policymakers view Native Hawaiians and in the law that should be made as a matter of equity as well as of uniformity in treatment. The easiest solution to the problem would be the inclusion by legislators and administrators of Native Hawaiians in programs for the benefit of other Indians. Before lawmakers will uniformly take that step, however, they must be educated to the fact that Native Hawaiians belong to the class of Indians and constitute a tribe, both groups that lawmakers have singled out for special attention. The next step is to make them aware of the problems confronting Native Hawaiians today, as well as those they have confronted in the past, and to point out the similarities to the problems that prompted Congress to promote special legislation for the mainland Indians. The Native Hawaiian Study Commission established by Con gress in 1980 to study the culture and needs of Native Hawaiians was a positive step in this direction.342 It briefly focused attention on the plight of the Native Hawaiian, but was ineffective in propos ing any real solutions to the problems faced by Native Hawaiians.343 But because of Hawai'i's distance from Washington and because Native Hawaiians have no effective lobbying presence there as do the mainland tribes,344 the topic needs to be brought before Congress and administrative agencies as often as possible. Although 342. Native Hawaiian Study Commission Act, Pub. L. No. 96-565, 94 Stat. 3324 (1980) (codified at 42 U.S.C. ? 2991 (1982)). 343. See supra note 162. 344. For a short period ending in 1987, Native Hawaiians were represented in Washington by a Native Hawaiian student at Georgetown University Law School, Lawrence K.

In contrast, mainland Indians are represented by a myriad of lobbying interests such as Arrow, Inc., the Coali tion of Eastern Native Americans, and the Tribal Chairman's Association.

Still, education of the nation's lawmakers is the first step in ensuring that Native Hawaiians receive the same benefits as other Native Americans. There are, however, some more concrete steps that should be taken to equate the treatment of the Native Hawaiian people with that received by other Indians. The most comprehensive would be for Congress to provide for reparations for Native Hawaiians345 in the same way that it provided for Native Alaskans in the Alaska Claims Settlement Act of 1971 (ANCSA).346 Native Alaskans, like Native Hawaiians, were subjected to ever increasing demands on their lands after the "discovery" of the territory by whites in 1741.347 The Russian Empire laid claim to the whole of what now constitutes the state of Alaska, and when Russia sold that claim to the United States in 1867, the government concluded the agree ment without ever considering the indigenous population or com pensating them for their loss. Similarly, when the United States annexed the Hawaiian Islands in 1898, it did not do so with the support of the Native Hawaiian people348 but at the insistence of 345.

Thus, the Republic had no legal interest in those lands,353 and the United States did not acquire legal interest in the lands it acquired at annexation because the Republic had none to pass;354 title has thus not been extin guished.355 Although in 1959 the federal government returned 1.5 million acres to the state,356 it retained title to some 400,000 acres,357 including the entire island of Kaho'olawe which the U.S. Navy 349.

Under the Indian Claims Commission Act,358 Native Hawaiians as Indians would have been eligible to sue the United States for monetary claims based on these actions.359 Congress, after deal ing with Indian claims against the United States by passing special jurisdictional legislation each time a claim was presented,360 established the Indian Claims Commission to hear all Indian claims against the United States.361 But because Hawaii was not admitted to the Union362 before the deadline for filing claims expired,363 Native Hawaiians were ineligible to assert any claim for losses based on the United States' less than "fair and honorable dealings"364 with them, as did many mainland Indians.365 358.

Many Native Alaskans had not been able to take advantage of the Claims Commission Act.367 Partly as a response to this omission, Congress enacted ANCSA to provide the compensation that equity required. Similarly, Native Hawaiians have not had their day in court, and Congress should enact legislation similar to ANCSA for Native Hawaiians. As previously noted, Native Hawaiians were ineligible to sue for compensation under the Indian Claims Commission Act. In addition, Native Hawaiians are precluded from filing a claim for compensation arising from the actions of the United States during annexation in the United States Court of Claims.368 Because the court doors have been closed to Native Hawaiians, Congress should enact legislation to provide for some form of compensation for the actions of the United States. As the House committee report on the approval of ANCSA noted: It has been the consistent policy of the United States in its deal ings with Indian Tribes to grant them title to a portion of the lands they occupied, to extinguish the aboriginal title to the re mainder of the land by placing such land in the public domain, and to pay the fair value of the title extinguished.369 While Congress has arguably granted Native Hawaiians title to the 200,000 acres of land under the Hawaiian Homes Commis sion Act,370 extinguished title to all but 400,000 acres of the re Cl. 1957); Osage Nation of Indians v.

Congress should, therefore, enact companion legisla tion to ANCSA to provide for Native Hawaiians. As it did under ANCSA, Congress should place a dollar value on the Hawaiian land claim372 and avoid the lengthy and costly litigation associated with a claims system.373 The payment would then be turned over to the Office of Hawaiian Affairs for either disbursement on a per capita basis or for cooperative development.374 This is a far more realistic solution to the problem than any suggestion that Congress turn over land now used as active military bases375 or set aside as national parks. In conclusion, a claims settlement act would provide a comprehensive solution to the omission of Native Hawaiians from the benefits that Congress has afforded other Indians. A simpler legislative solution would be for Congress to denominate the Native Hawaiian people an Indian tribe. Congress has passed similar legislation for other Indian groups376 and could do so for Native Hawaiians based on their status as an indigenous people.377 The Congress could simply enact legislation making Native Hawaiians eligible for "services and assistance provided to Indians because of their status as Indians,"378 thus allowing Native Hawaiians to take advantage of programs enacted for other 371.

There is no base on the island; its sole function is to serve as a target for U.S. Navy bombs and shells. Despite the con tinued protests of the Native Hawaiian people, the Navy refuses to halt its bombings, even though there are several ancient heiau or temples on the island. In 1981, Kaho'olawe was designated a National Historic Site. The Navy agreed to discontinue bombing one third of the island, but has mistakenly bombed that portion of the island as recently as the fall of 1987.

The most important involves the Department of the Interior. In terior should promulgate a new rule to replace section 83.4 of its regulations governing federal recognition of tribal status,380 which allows every Indian group in the United States except Native Hawaiians to petition for federal acknowledgment as a tribe.381 Rewording this section would at least allow Native Hawaiians to apply for recognition,382 an option from which they are now un fairly precluded.383 Should the Department prove hesitant to change its stand, Con gress has given the President the authority to implement the same change. Title 25 of the United States Code authorizes the Presi dent to "prescribe such regulations as he may think fit in carry ing into effect the various provisions of any act relating to Indian affairs, and for the settlement of the accounts of Indian affairs."384 Therefore, the President could himself change the wording and thus the effect of section 83.4. Regardless of who instigates it, it is a change that should be made. Steps must be taken to ensure that Native Hawaiians are not arbitrarily excluded from programs 379. See supra notes 4-15 and accompanying text. 380. 25 C.F.R. ? 83.4. 381. Section 83.4 reads: "Any Indian group in the continental United States which believes it should be acknowledged as an Indian tribe, and can satisfy the criteria of ? 83.7, may submit a petition requesting that the Secretary [of the Interior] acknowledge the group's existence as an Indian tribe." 382. Simply striking the word "continental" from the section would suffice. 383. Aside from being patently unfair, this provision is constitutionally questionable. While not prohibiting legislation based on class, the equal protection clause requires that any classification must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation so that all persons similarly situated shall be treated alike. Native Hawaiians, as members of the class of Indians, are entitled to the same legal treatment as mainland Indians. Exclusion by the Department of the Interior of the Native Hawaiian people from a class to which they belong based solely on geographic considerations is arbitrary and not rationally related to the object of congressional legislation which Interior's rule seeks to implement. In short, excluding Native Hawaiians and only Native Hawaiians from peti tioning from federal recognition as a tribe when they would otherwise be eligible is uncon stitutional.

Conclusion Only with the implementation of a comprehensive legislative or administrative solution to the failure to include Native Hawaiians in most programs for other Indians will the Native Hawaiian people receive the benefits to which they are entitled as an indigenous people of the United States. There is no bar to including Native Hawaiians in programs for Indians because Native Hawaiians are members of the class of Indians. In addition, there exists no ra tional basis to preclude Native Hawaiians from benefits afforded Indian tribes because an informed examination of the history of the Native Hawaiian people shows that they constitute an Indian tribe. As a people, the Native Hawaiians have experienced a history of Western contact and domination similar to that experienced by the mainland tribes, and they should be included in these pro grams because the concerns motivating Congress to enact legisla tion for other Native Americans exist equally among the Native Hawaiian people. In the absence of any comprehensive solution to the exclusion of Native Hawaiians from these programs, they will continue to fall far below the basic educational, health, and economic levels for which this country prides itself. The federal government must lay to rest the harsh consequences of its failure to address adequately and properly the Native Hawaiian problem and lift Hawaii's status as islands of neglect.</page></plain_text>
