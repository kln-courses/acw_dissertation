<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> History of Religions 359 conception of  a deity to morality. Is it merely an authoritarian image of  the divine that imposes conformity? Or could the findings represent a few persons with Nietzschean views on religion and morality rather than a general tendency? Many of  the authoritative statements of  the book are questionable. This review can only present a few examples. It is hardly correct to state authoritatively that most people in medieval society had no contact with the church. Whether the Jews formed 10 percent of  the population of  the Roman Empire is also questionable. Also, low service attendance at different points of  history does not refer to a unified standard. Stark stresses the belief  aspect of  religion. Durkheim would hardly disagree, since he included it in his definition. However, the book does not clarify what belief  implies. Few adherents fully understand and accept the theological dogma of their church. Even students of  theology find it difficult. Many adherents believe that the institution contains sufficient insight. One could ask whether it is contra- dictory to maintain trust in the church but raise doubts about its dogma. Democracy includes religious freedom, and thus it mandates the religious autonomy of  all citizens. This is expressed by religious choice, which is directed in two ways. First, one may choose between different religious organizations with different profiles. This option of  choice is the focus of  those who study religion by a market model. Second, one may also choose a position within a religious institu- tion. Much of  the religious skepticism and nonconformist spiritualism may simply express religious autonomy. Such personal quests are deviant within the frame- work of  authoritarian churches or sects, but they do not necessarily undermine the platform of  more open, more democratic churches, such as the Nordic state churches. It is not difficult to trace Stark’s own sympathies for various types of  religion or intellectual skepticism. This fact may provoke some readers. Also, many historians of  religion would disagree with his definitions of  science, religion, and magic. His distinction is based on a certain theological and scientific position. However, it could be read as a clarification of  his own line of  arguments. Read as a positive provocation, Stark’s definitions open discussion concerning the subject of  the scientific study of  religion. This leads to the conclusion that the book is very valuable when it is read as a positive provocation.

Pp. vii+230. $52.25. In his book, Haunting the Buddha: Indian Popular Religions and the Formation of Buddhism, Robert DeCaroli has brought together much material to make an important contribution to how we characterize the nature of  early Buddhist practice. For too long the study of  early Buddhism has avoided a consideration of the religion’s relationship with other contemporaneous beliefs, creating a distorted </page> <page sequence="2"> 360 Book Reviews view of  Buddhism’s emergence and success in India. This has had wide-ranging consequences as, for example, in the treatment given to early Buddhist visual material. The study of  this imagery has overly emphasized the role of  narrative, somewhat unconsciously following a bias in the study of  Western art. DeCaroli’s work is a fine step away from this focus and should generate, I hope, many more such steps by him as well as others in the field. The bias for the Buddha’s narrative is a pernicious one, allowing a focus on doctrine and a celebration of  ancient India without much mention of  those who made the monuments and those who used them. DeCaroli effectively argues for a much more complicated, contentious atmosphere, in which Buddhism sometimes entered into an uneasy partnership with local but nonetheless powerful spirit- deities. When he discusses why he chooses to call them spirit-deities rather than yakshas or other frequently used names for such beings, he makes a very good argument. The large-scaled figures, such as the spirit-deities on the important early stupa railing from Bharhut, as DeCaroli notes, deserve much more careful con- sideration, and I think that this study offers highly interesting ways to think about the significance of  their presence. His view that the Buddha in some ways usurps the central place first held by these spirit-beings should lead, I think, to an important revision of  how we think about these early Buddhist monuments and the practices that occurred at them. Fuller consideration should also create some useful thought on various other questions, such as the now much-debated topic of  aniconism: Is there or is there not a specific avoidance of  representing the Buddha in anthropomorphic form? DeCaroli’s discussions will no doubt prompt reexamination of  this question and of  why earlier studies have failed to deal seriously with these deities, which are sometimes depicted as large-sized figures and other times as part of  more “narra- tive” reliefs. While such neglect would seem patently problematic, given that these are the largest figures depicted on such monuments during a period when anthro- pomorphic images of  the Buddha do not appear, many scholars have been overly attentive to the narrative imagery with little acknowledgment of  even the appear- ance of  these spirit-deities. What is particularly useful about DeCaroli’s study is how it changes the perspective with which one looks at these early monuments, so that even inquiries that continue to focus on narratives of  the Buddha might profit from the consideration of  how they are in dialogue with subjects of  the spirit-deities. The author has indeed begun an important discussion about the formation of  Buddhism in India.
