<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PERSON AS THE KEY METAPHYSICAL PRINCIPLE I On what grounds can the claim be made that the Person is the best available principle of metaphysical explanation? This claim can be justi- fied if a thinker can show that no sound methodological principle has been violated, and if he can show that the notion of the Person, adequately defined, is more successful than other conceptions in resolving the problems which confront the metaphysician. The matter of methodology cannot be dealt with here, but this writer1 (and pluralistic personalistic idealists generally) would insist that an ade- quate metaphysical hypothesis should allow us to see connectedly as many parts of experience as possible. In the search for an adequate hypoth- esis every facet of experience must be consulted without letting any one aspect, be it esthetic, moral, logical, scientific, or religious, dictate for the others. Again, if the metaphysician begins with experience, it matters not what flights he takes into the realm of fancy, logic, or creative imagination. For, no matter how he derives his hypothesis, it will be ac- ceptable only if, better than any other hypothesis, it allows the data of human experience to fall into place without arbitrary distortion. Abso- lute certitude he will never achieve. But his responsibility as a metaphysi- cian is to develop an hypothesis in terms of which the data of experience can be most adequately related to each other. Like Whitehead, he realizes that the purpose of metaphysical thinking is to corner mystery, not to resolve it completely. But what are the data of experience? Many who agree with this em- pirical methodology and criterion of truth, part company with the person- alist when they realize that he does not mean by experience (and em- piricism) the data of sense alone. Nor does he give priority to the data of religious experience or to the data of moral experience. In a word, the empirical personalist can give priority to no one aspect of experience. He means by experience the data supplied in the dynamic activities which constitute his consciousness or awareness. Consciousness is the active, 1 Most of what is said in this article would probably find confirmation in the thought of contemporary personalistic idealists, especially those influenced by Borden P. Bowne, Albert C. Knudson, E. S. Brightman and Ralph T. Flewelling. The author must, how- ever, accept the responsibility for the particular formulations in this article which, while reflecting his own empirical orientation, represent the basic drift of the personal- istic argument in these matters. 207</page><page sequence="2">208 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH ongoing and undergoing Erlebnis which, differentiated, is described as sensing, remembering, imagining, perceiving, thinking, feeling, wanting, emoting, oughting, willing, appreciating, - or, more broadly interpreted, as a unity of perceptual, rational, esthetic, moral, and religious conscious- ness. Let it be clearly understood that the empirical personalist does not assume that any of these activities (for all the objective reference intrinsic to each) is necessarily veridical, or has an independent object.2 That is a question for further epistemic analysis. But the empirical personalist does base his philosophic venture on the conviction that whatever the nature of X, or metaphysical reality, his best index to it may well be found with- in the nature of his own experience. His methodological faith, if you will, is that his own total conscious activity as experience may well contain a better clue to the structure of X than any other kind of entity. In this sense, the empirical personalist is more radical in his appeal to experience than, let us say, a sense-bound Humean, or a mystical, Berg- sonian intuitionist. Whatever hypothesis (or intuition) we may have about X, it will have to stand before the bar of the conscious person as a whole and show itself to be innocent of the charge that it arbitrarily disqualifies any aspect of conscious experience.3 In other words, the empiricism of the personalist is not some arti-factual abstraction, like sense apart from value, or sense and value apart from logic; it is the claim that empiricism should be wholistic or synoptic, and not favor in advance any one phase of conscious experience. So much for the general empiricism which guides the personalistic ven- ture. But from the outset the personalist must avoid an ever-present pitfall. His very empiricism of consciousness as-a-whole-and-in-its-variety might well lead him to insist that since what we know best is mind or consciousness, then, if we are to understand X, it must be conscious being of some sort. The cautious personalist does not fall into this "ego-centric predicament." At the same time he does not develop such a phobia re- garding it (or the accusation,"anthropomorphism"), that he fails to consider seriously the possibility that X is best conceived as analogous (in a sense to be carefully defined) to the finite person. The cautious, empirical per- sonalist does not move from esse is percipi (any more than Berkeley actual- ly did) to the conclusion that X is Mind. He asks whether the problems which confront the inquiring mind can be resolved by such an hypothesis better than they can by other suggested hypotheses. Just as Berkeley examined the basic alternatives as to the structure of nature and found 2 See the author's article "The Nature of Cognition: Minimum Requirements of a Personalistic Epistemology," The Review of Metaphy8ics, September, 1954. 3 The reader should bear in mind that any humanly established fact of science, art, or morality, or religion, is a product of conscious experience.</page><page sequence="3">THE PERSON AS THE KEY METAPHYSICAL PRINCIPLE 209 each more defective than his own, so the contemporary, more adequately empirical personalist examines other alternatives and re-examines his own alternative with a view to improving the solutions given to "the persistent problems of philosophy." If he can show that a given conception of the Person provides more insight into the inter-related problems of truth, of goodness, of beauty, of value and fact, of change and permanence, of causality, of substance, of order and relations, of the categories, of me- chanism and teleology, he is willing to rest his case until new evidence comes along. In what follows we shall attempt to indicate the relevance of the concept of the person to the related problems of substance, causality, order, purpose, and value, with special emphasis on the first three. Our first task will be, however, to define what is circumscribed in the words finite person. II First of all, a finite person is a conscious unity (capable of self-con- sciousness). Each personalist must decide what he would consider the basic irreducible activities of consciousness to be. For the writer a person is a unity of the activities of sensing, remembering, imagining, thinking, feeling, emoting, oughting, willing, and appreciating. These activities enable a person to know an external world, to plan and will the satisfaction of his wants in the light of those social, moral, esthetic, and religious ideals to which he comes to feel obligation. Second, this unity of activities is a unity within multiplicity; it is not a collection of psychic parts or faculties. The unity is not something other than these activities. It is not a soul-substance, an unconscious, or what- have-you, which unifies these activities without being any of them. The person is the unity of willing-oughting-knowing-purposing-feeling. The scholastic concept of the soul-substance was called upon to unify, and allow to persist through change, what does not need to be so unified. For the person as experienced is a unity of changing activities and is em- pirically inconceivable without change. This fact of changing, varied unity must not be passed over lightly. It is the datum without which there could be no data of knowledge or value. As erlebt we are each of us unities which find themselves changing in their perceiving and wanting, for example, and yet knowing that they are changing as they perceive and desire. There is no other being quite like this in the non-divine world. Animals seem to experience a unity of consciousness and may therefore be called selves. But in few, if any instances, are animals capable of self-conscious- ness, or of the reason, moral choice and the experience of value open to the personal self. There is no other finite being which seems by its very struc- ture to suggest: "In me you may find, empirically given, a being in whom</page><page sequence="4">210 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH the one and the many are inseparably united, and to whom and for whom other events may well be unities or pluralities." A chair can be one chair and have many parts, a book can be one book and have many pages, but a person differs from such artificial unities by never being assembled but always being the assembler. And it can assemble only because it is itself never a succession of experiences, to use Bowne's terminology, but an ex- perience of succession. Nor can any personal parts exist without relation to other parts. Analysis may differentiate, but if it separates, it does so only at the expense of personal reality as it is given to us. A third characteristic of the person is his temporality, or durge, in Bergson's sense. To say that the person is time-binding or time-transcend- ing is to say that no one abstract moment of "time" exhausts the person, but that every present duree is pregnant with a past for a future in one psychic Gestalt. But even more is meant. Personal events are not merely on-the-go in a sequence of before and after, or even as a unity of activity which is changing. More concretely, feeling-striving-purposing is intrinsic to the meaning of temporality in personal history. The person, in James's phrase, is a "fighter for ends." The act of selectivity is the fact of temporal- ity, and this means constant development into some new qualitative moment (Whitehead's subjective aim) which gives way to a growing fusion from the welter of sensing-feeling-valuing-thinking which is present in every moment of personal existence (cf. Whitehead's prehension and concrescence). In a very real sense, for the empirical personalist, conor, ergo sum and volo, ergo sum are as basic data of personal being as cogito (though Descartes himself included these elements in his description of the cogito). The important point is that though the person is receptive and relati- vely passive in his "intake" from the total environment, that very flow of intake is selectively modified by the uniquely structured functioning of the person who has his own desires and demands to make upon the world as it converges with him and upon him. The person cannot come to full fruition without the intake, challenge, and opportunity of the environ- ment. His dependence is an undeniable fact. But it is also true that the person is more than a point at which forces meet and accumulate, thus forming a collective unity. This tenet, like others, needs further argument of course, but unless each personal existence is something for itself, unless we recognize the person to be a qualitative structure with its own in- trinsic nature - a nature to be nourished, fulfilled, starved or handicapped by the nature of the environment - we shall have a difficult time account- ing for the novelty-and-order, for the empirical continuity and discon- tinuity, that is found in personal beings; we shall be unfaithful to the inner awareness of durge forging ahead to some new point of enjoyment- in-unity.</page><page sequence="5">THE PERSON AS THE KEY METAPHYSICAL PRINCIPLE 211 But no sooner have we emphasized the change and growth within the person than we become aware of a fourth ingredient of personal selfhood. Our experience as persons is permeated by a certain kind or quality of order. We become aware of a demand for logical consistency, as well as a (less articulate, perhaps, but equally persistent), feeling of obligation to some envisioned best. This is hardly the place to develop a theory of moral obligation4 and value, or to explicate the norms of logical order, or of esthetic and religious unity. Yet logic, science, esthetics, ethics, and religion testify to those normative aspects of existence which lie embedded in, or grow from, even as they define, life at the personal level. Form and content are inextricably bound into the erlebt, unified activity we know ourselves to be. Again, to distinguish these is not to separate them. But - and here we articulate a fifth aspect of the person - is it not characteristic of a person to order his own activity in relation to the world around him in a teleological manner? "Parts" get organized, as far as possible, in a whole of purpose. If anything, we have to discipline our tendency to give telic unity to our world. The maturing person seeks to organize his desires and his sense-data into a plan of living which will eventuate in the realization, preservation, and increase of values he con- siders worthwhile. The order of coherent purpose, in other words, transcends the order of the mechanical; the order of things is hardly intelligible unless it becomes an order of means, instrumental to the experience and realiza- tion of an envisioned purpose. Whatever happens at other levels of being, we cannot deny that at the personal level, rational, comprehensive pur- pose, fulfilling itself through well-ordered means, is the characteristic form of being. A sixth emphasis must conclude our sketch of the finite person. We have suggested that his is a unified, multiform, enduring activity which constantly selects and organizes the data of its own nature and the "in- take" from the surrounding world in accordance with purposes which reflect the individual capacity for logical order, and the felt obligation to the best possible in his situation. But now we must add that these con- scious activities cannot be reduced to the activities of electrons or any kind of spatial being, if we remain faithful to the given facts of conscious- ness. The writer is aware of Professor Charles Hartshorne's view that men- tality can be regarded as extended, but he has thus far remained unconv- inced. Just what does it mean to say, for example, that extension is involv- ed, in any sense, in the consciousness of logical relations? Here, however, he can only express his conviction, crude though it may seem, that the 4 See the author's "A Reinterpretation of Moral Obligation," Philosophy and Pheno- menological Research, 6 (1945), 270-283; and An Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion (New York: Prentice-Hall, 1951), Chapter 9.</page><page sequence="6">212 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL REiSEARCH activities of consciousness as introspected are non-spatial. None of them are in themselves extended. The perceiving, let alone the conceiving, of space is itself non-spatial. The relations between conscious activities are not side-by side or juxtaposed. How far these activities are dependent on the brain and nervous system is a matter for further consideration (though the writer would hold that even if one could show that the body is non-mental, the activities of the conscious person are neither to be identified with, or conceived as the product of, physiological energies). Better a difficult metaphysical du- alism, however, than the affirmation, contrary to our direct experience, that mental activity is spatial. The person is temporal but not spatial. The person experiences sense-data as extended, but the person exper- iencing is not extended - however intimately related he may be metaphys- ically to the world he knows as extended. Whatever the person knows about his subconscious, his unconscious, his body, his world, other persons, God - all this is the work of a non-spatial unity of consciousness coherently interpreting its sensory experiences, its nonsensory, imaginal, affective, and conceptual experiences, and its experiences of value. III We now have before us a sketch of the kind of entity which becomes for the empirical personalist the most suggestive clue we have for the interpretation of the world beyond the person. Each of us, a personalist argues, uses his experience of himself as a basis for analogical understand- ing of other minds, and each of us learns more about his own mind and nature by reflective interaction with other persons, with sub-personal selves, and the world. But in the person thus defined the philosopher is afforded an example, within the known world, of a being who is a self- identifying activity, simultaneously one-and-many, which is able to sustain and develop differences. Here he has a universalizing thinker, able to move through any incomplete series of particulars, a thinker who finds order in and through his experience only as he controls himself by rational ideals intrinsic to his nature. Here he finds an agent who not only feels and wants and purposes but can will what he ought (or ought not), a telie agent, in other words, who is in some sense a oo-creator of himself and his environ- ment, rather than the helpless victim of its compulsions. Here, then is a kind of being which, endowed as a metaphysical unity in activity, dis- covers, thanks to that very capacity, that some forms of thinking, acting, and appreciating enable him to realize his potentialities with a minimum of fruitless conflict and a maximum of wholesome enjoyment, in and through creative control of conflict. Much more should be said in expli- cation of these tenets, but these are minima for our present purpose. We</page><page sequence="7">THE PERSON AS THE KEY METAPHYSICAL PRINCIPLE 213 must now suggest the grounds which lead idealistic personalists to hold that the world which constitutes the environment of persons can best be conceived as the creation of a Person whose essential structure does not differ from that of the finite person. IV To begin with the problem of substance, it is the thesis of the person- alist that no hypothesis short of a Supreme Person can better account for the kind of unity and variety exhibited in the universe. Indeed, he would go further and suggest, as a general principle of interpretation, that the philosopher conceive any event-system which exhibits persistent qualities, interlocking dispositions, and properties in an order which is rationally understandable (be it atom, dog, cabbage, star, or cosmos) in terms of the kind of reality found in personal consciousness. The idealistic personalist, like Leibniz and Berkeley, cannot give empirical meaning to the concept of non-mental substance, but all personalists (in the broadest sense of the term) find the total order of existence impossible to understand or explain without belief in (and proper definition of) personal substance as the ulti- mate source of existence and value.5 We must pause here to witness a recent "debate" that has been going on in materialistic and naturalistic circles, since the course of the argument illustrates the kind of analysis a personalist might well support as a basis for the further definition of substance. W. R. Dennes, writing on "The Categories of Naturalism" 6 argues that the contemporary naturalist can legitimately defend only three basic categories, namely events, relations, and qualities. Each of these categories, Dennes argues, is a distinction of reason, since each is an aspect of a total situation actually given in exper- ience. Each category can be strictly defined by reference to experience, 5 Given this common core of agreement with regard to basic principle of explanation, the differences between personalists represent different conceptions of finite and in- finite substance and their relation to each other. Qualitative metaphysical monists be- lieve in one Absolute Personal Substance (Royce and Hocking); dualists believe in a Supreme Mind and its created or uncreated "body" (W. Sheldon, J. B. Pratt, J. Wildd. Pluralistic personal idealism takes three forms: (a) the denial of an infinite Mind but insistence on a society of finite minds (Howison, McTaggart); (b) the assertion by pan- psychists that there are different related levels of mind (sub-personal, personal, and completely personal); (c) the contention of the more typical personal idealists who side with the monastic Absolutists in holding that the spatial world is part of the infinite Person, but with the pluralists in insisting that finite minds as such are never a phase or part of the cosmic.Person. But all personalists agree that no metaphysics is adequate without a reasonable concept of substance, and they would find any attempt to evade them in the name of "empiricism" less than a reasonable interpretation of the facts. 6 Naturalism and the Human Spirit, ed. by Y. K. Krikorian. (New York: Columbia University Press, 1944).</page><page sequence="8">214 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH for there we are forever confronted solely with "qualified related events." 7 Dennes realizes that the primary categories do not inform us about any- thing in particular, and he would refer us to the empirical observations and explorations of science for the specific qualities and relations of events manifested in the various regions of being. As Dennes sees it, therefore, contemporary naturalism does, can, or should divorce itself from any "materialistic" doctrine that there are extended, hard, moving, indestruct- ible existents, or anything else which might be called "reality" beyond the qualified related events. Exactly why does Dennes reject the category of substance? He realizes that the naturalist provides us with no "positive doctrine or positive hypothesis."8 For he contends that "all natural processes (including those of human living) do not imply anything beyond themselves and do not require for their existence or for their explanation any grounds but the further stretches of natural processes which we observe or inductively infer to be their context ...." 9 But Dennes would protect us from "all philosophies which allege that events require, for their occurence or for their explanation, reference to transcendental grounds, orders, courses, purposes, Dinge an sich, or the like." 10 All the consistent and self-restrain- ed naturalist must do is take note, according to the requirements of scien- tific method, of the processes which are going on and will go on. With "no methods but observation and comparison and inductively controlled hypothesis about what is going on and has gone on and will go on,11 he must insist "that nothing that goes on and no human argument implies or even makes sense of, any notion that events require for their occurrence or for their explanation any grounds, controlling order, laws, principles, causes, purposes, values, which are anything more than the further stret- ches of events, including such events as are themselves the formulation of casual laws or the description of other sorts of order." 12 The contemporary naturalist, accordingly, would stay close to what can be discovered in sensory experience, and disengage, from the primary triune categories of events-relation-quality, the secondary categories of order, ground, space, time, cause, purpose, value, and explanation, and see these latter "as meaning various sorts of configurations, all intrinsically observable, for what it calls qualified related events." 13 But Professor E. J. Nelson, writing in Philosophy for the Future on "The 7 Ibid., p. 283. 8 Ibid., p. 288. 9 Ibid., p. 288. 10 Ibid., p. 289. 11 Ibid., p. 289. 12 Ibid., p. 289. 13 Ibid., p. 293.</page><page sequence="9">THE PERSON AS THE KEY METAPHYSICAL PRINCIPLE 215 Category of Substance," cannot accept this reduction of the categories to three. His essential contention is that this very doctrine that we can learn from experience, far from being "certified by data given in experience,"14 presupposses that "substance is an ultimate category." 15 "I shall defend the view that if empirical knowledge is possible, or if such notions as things, property, cause, order, law, or even process are to have the object- ive significance they do have in our interpretation of the world and are to play the role they do play in our knowledge of the world, then the category of substance is indispensable." 16 In a statement which personalists would approve, he contends that dispositional properties "lead directly to the problem of substance and thence to the relations between substance, causation, and natural law." 17 Thus, "when we assert, for example, that if this lump of sugar had been put into coffee, it would have disolved, then we are asserting that the lump of sugar is something which may be in various states and may stand in various relations to other things at various times." 18 Since this implies that the sugar could have maintained differ- ent relations to the same or to other things at that time, we actually imply that "the sugar has a nature which does not necessitate its being in just this state or in just these relations to these other things at this time, and that it would have been the same thing even if it had not been in these states or in these relations in which it now is." 19 And, as Nelson well says, even "the synthetic connectedness required of causation presupposes sub- stance,"20 in other words "causal law too involves substance." 21 We need not expound all the reasoning which leads Nelson to his po- sition, but we must note comments which further explain his inability to follow Dennes' analysis. His insistence generally is that there is no conti- nuity in experience, as is presupposed in talk of causal law or in "any unity or generality expressed by a universal proposition," 22 unless we postulate an element which "transcends sensory experience." 23 He cor- rectly insists that "the metaphysical function of substance has not been simply that of a subject of predication" but also "to provide the con- nection presupposed by the stable compresence of qualities, and let it be 14 Roy Wood Sellars, V.

For the Humean definition of causation "is not a theory of causa- tion at all; nothing follows from it; it is rather a denial of the possibility of a theory explanatory of sequences of events. Unless we believe there is something more to causation than constant conjunction, we might as well discontinue counselling the employment of the methods of science in the quest of knowledge." 25 Now Nelson realizes that the reply will be made that since every possible sequence of experience is consistent with the postulation of a non-sensory category like substance, he will be asked: "What difference can its truth of falsity make?" He replies, acutely, that while "such an assumption can make no experientially discernible difference," and that therefore "any difference it makes cannot be found in the data of ex- perience," 27 still "it does not follow that no propositions would be true about it in one case but not in the other." 28 To use his own example: it is true that the regularities recorded at any point in history may be purely accidental runs of events. At any specific point in history things will be what they are regardless of the assumption of substance (and cause). But once we ask the meaningful question at our one point in history: Are these past data evidence of what the future will bring? it makes a great deal of difference whether we supply the non-sensory substance. For if past events are evidence of future events, this can be so only if we presuppose a substance beyond the events which is not exhausted in the disposition and qualities and presences of any one moment. On the other hand, "if past data are not evidence of future ones, then science is nothing but a blind Musioned faith, and any success it has is not its success but its luck. Accordingly, the difference transcendent connections, or substance can make is the difference be- tween the reliability and the unreliability of inference. This.I insist, is a meaningful difference .... the difference might be compared to that between going up a blind road and proceeding to a destination. At no time before completion of the journey can we be sure that the highway is not a dead-end street; nonetheless the rationale of our continuing lies in the probability that not all roads are blind alleys. All of our practical activities, and all of pure science, presuppose that this is the case 24 Ibid., p. 114. 25 Ibid,. pp. 121, 122. 26 Ibid., p. 122. 27 Ibid., p. 122. 28 Ibid., p. 122.</page><page sequence="11">THE PERSON AS THE KEY METAPHYSICAL PRINCIPLE 217 This assumption then is the epistemological cash value of such a category of sub- stance." 29 The controversy we have been reviewing serves not only to emphasize the fact that a sense-bound empiricism of the positivistic variety is unable to develop the concepts needed if its own presuppositions and implications are to be intelligible, but also to underscore the kind of reasoning which is minimal in a personalistic philosophy. Nelson does not here suggest his specific interpretation of substance, but as a materialist, we would expect him to consider ill-conceived (a) any specific interpretation of substance which regards it as ultimately mental, (b) any conception of a supreme Substance as creator and sustainer of finite substances. But a personalistic metaphysician would press for a further interpretation of "substance" and of the relation of substances to each other. Nelson, we have seen, is too concerned to understand what makes experience, even in the positivistic sense, possible to be deterred by the fact that his appeal to transcendent substance is "unempirical." The personalist is so impressed by the fact that not all roads among "sub- stances" are blind alleys, and so concerned about making the scientific venture (itself a part of man's total moral venture) intelligible, that he moves beyond what the modern materialist would consider the demands of science.30 His basic concern is that the demand for a certain kind of accuracy (which may be so inaccurate about the whole of the universe!) should not keep us from developing hypotheses which are empirically adequate (in the truer sense of empiricism) to the varied aspects of the world in which man lives. In what remains we must suggest briefly some further problems relating to substances and causality occupying con- temporary personalists. V Substances (assuming for the moment that the physical world -is a plurality of substance-causes of different orders) are related to each other in a manner which enables persons to predict, in certain areas with a high degree of quantitative accuracy, what may be expected to follow from given events. But though the events are in order, the specific sequence of changes and the specific continuities we discover in that seeming community of changes we call Nature, are not self-explanatory. One might, with "empirical" piety, stop at this point, as naturalists and materialists do, and hold that our philosophic responsibility ends with the attempt to interrelate the observed levels of order found in Nature. It would not do, we are told, to move beyond Nature to "explain" it, for Nature is what it is. 29 Ibid., p. 123. 30 See "Foreword," ibid., viii.</page><page sequence="12">218 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH To stop here may be a great intellectual comfort for some. But there are those who will look even such simplicities in the face. What is Nature? Is it a heterogeneous interrelation of orders of being which simply happen to be together? Is the relation of life and matter, of life, matter, and mind in any sense calculated? How shall we conceive the orderly interaction between substance-causes at any level and the interaction between the different levels of substance-causes? In many respects the order of the orders is a more intriguing question than the nature of the levels of exis- tence themselves. Does the "Nature" of which they are a part conform in any sense to a rational pattern which makes a difference to another Knower-Valuer even as it does to persons? As we have suggested, the personalist is not first of all an idealist. Many minds to whom an idealistic account of the natural world is un- acceptable have agreed with personal idealists in explaining the particular complex or order which comprises the interdependence of the inorganic, the living, and the mental, as the creative work of a personal Substance. For these thinkers, as for idealistic personalists, the order of change, the continuity of change, the predictability of change - the fact, in other words, that all does not just change and that there would be chaos if change as change were "the order" of the day - these facts call for hypo- thesizing more than does change or the sheer plurality of substances in change. But the more empirical personalist would deviate from the more traditional hypothesis of an immutable cosmic Mind by maintaining that the supreme Substance is not unchanging or non-temporal. The moment there is similarity in change, continuity in change, predicta- bility of change, we are forced to seek not an utterly changeless Source of change, but a particular kind of changing being (unchanging in its kind of change). What is called for first by the vast complex of dependent order-and-change we call Nature is a Unity of Change. For this we can find the best analogy in the kind of being that we know as the person. The empirical personalist must also account for the further fact that the order of the world does in the main, at least, support both the human venture in understanding and the disciplined human purpose to build structures of value which are individually creative and socially cooperative. Such considerations have been taken, along with significant trends in the religious consciousness of man, to justify the postulation of a Supreme Substance which is not only a Person but a Person with that kind of wisdom, will, and power evocative of human worship . Again, this is not the place to develop the specific grounds for belief in God. But it is the place to insist that the argument from the metaphy- sical Ground to the Personal God is covered by empirical personalists not by a hasty jump from a "First Cause" to a completely perfect, eternal</page><page sequence="13">THE PERSON AS THE K:EY METAPHYSICAL PRINCIPLE 219 Being, but by adducing evidence for every attribute of God. Here, with the specific problem of substance and causality in mind, we must empha- size that the kind of substance called for by the fact of orderly change is a Substance which, like any person, is a self-identifying unity of ac- tivity whose given structure enables Him not only to initiate change but co-exist with it. Such a Being does not have to be eternal in the sense of being nontemporal. He can be transtemporal, or to use Brightman's term, omnitemporal, that is, related to every moment of every aspect of the temporal world. Indeed, for the empirical personalist the hypo- thesis of an unchanging cosmic Soul related creatively to the changing world is as contradictory and otiose as is the concept of a non-thinking, non-willing, and non-feeling soul-substance to explain the thinking, feeling, willing which we experience as the unified activity of conscious- ness. However, it is equally important for the temporalistic personalist to remind himself that the time-filled cosmic Ground is a continuous unity of conscious activity whose omnitemporal rational form is struc- tural. That is, the cosmic Ground could not change to something non- rational, or change to norms of value and reason other than those in- trinsic to its nature. This does not mean that the cosmic Person has no freedom to vary his volition, but it does mean that the will operates within the given framework of his omnitemporal unity. VI We may approach the nature of the cosmic Person's causality by attempting to obviate a misunderstanding which is stated frequently as an objection to theism in non-theistic literature. The idea of a First Cause, it is said, is an abuse of terms, if not a contradiction. Cause as we know it in the phenomenal world is always effect also; it makes no sense, there- fore, to speak of a First, Uncaused Cause. But it must be said that the sequential kind of causality restricted to the phenomenal world is not the causality ever meant in the notion of First Cause, which, after all, antedated the scientific use of the term. What is meant is not a cause at the beginning of things, simply the first of a series! What is meant is a metaphysical Cause contemporaneous with the events it produces, sustaining every one of its effects even as every change in my consciousness is contemporaneous with the sequence of ideas I am trying to express. Such a contemporaneous Cause, first in the sense that all other causality is impossible without its own contem- poraneous creativity, may well be called the Personal Ground of the world. Sequential or phenomenal causality is the human interpretation of the metaphysical interactions which constitute the nature of the meta- physical Cause or Ground. We now have a "substantial" active Person</page><page sequence="14">220 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH as the Ground for the interpretation that a lump of sugar will dissolve, to use Nelson's illustration. There is another aspect of this Personal Ground, however, which has so disturbed many acute thinkers that they have sought a different explanation of the order-in-change. This is the notion of the Supreme Ground as Creator of all dependent changing beings. What empirical content can be given to the idea of absolute creation, creation ab nihilo if not ex nihilo? It is simply impossible to understand what is meant by saying that this Ground created an entity other than itself, as no part of itself, without using any medium. No human creation, which is always to some extent dependent on a medium, can be analogous to this. Here, indeed, is one point at which the empirical personalist falls short of his ideal of finding within total human experience a fully adequate clue to the nature of reality. He can, to be sure, point to the creative ex- perience of the artist; he can also point to the alterations which a dis- ciplined will can effect in a person's character. But he must ultimately admit that his phrase ab nihilo, though clarifying his intent that the Ground in creating uses no means co-eternal with himself, is not something which is adequately clear to him. But why, then, not become an idealistic absolutist, for example, and hold that all "created" beings are centers, modes, or appearances of the activity of the cosmic Person or Ground? Because this forces the denial of what seems to the personalist the basic fact that his experience is not a part of another's experience. There have been valiant efforts, not the least by Royce and Hocking, to save the concrete individuality and free- dom of persons within the structure of the Absolute, and thus avoid the difficulties of creation ab nihilo. But difficult as it is to understand the notion of creation, which is not adequately confirmed in human ex- perience, pluralistic personalists have found even greater difficulties in the monistic thesis, which, they would contend, also forces them to deny the relative independence and freedom of finite minds and wills. Nor does the doctrine of creation lead one, as does absolute idealism, to hold that all the error, sin, and evil which are part of the finite mind and world are also parts of the infinite Mind. What incoherence must result in the Absolute from being and knowing finite sin and error, and yet at the same time transcending it! Better return to the difficult-to-conceive notion of creation, with the further reflection that if there were any one fact the finite mind would expect not to understand in virtue of its very predicament as dependent, it would be the process of its own creation. Here the empirical personalist may be satisfied with cornering the mys- tery, since his view of creation "saves the appearances "even as it en- ables him to escape the difficulties which confront any quantitative monism.</page><page sequence="15">THE PERSON AS THE KEY METAPHYSICAL PRINCIPLE 221 The naturalist, at this point, might once more ask whether it would not be better to give up such "speculation" and settle for the fact that from the bosom of non-living being there "emerged" life, and from these together there "emerged" mind. Most contemporary materialists and naturalists pay idealists the compliment of admitting at long last that the older reductive materialism was wrong in refusing to realize that the levels of being cannot be reduced to each other. But in the doc- trine of "emergence," whether in their hands or in the hands of Bergson and some Whiteheadians, we are introduced to one of the anomalies in contemporary philosophy. For at the same moment that strictures are being made against the inconceivability of the idea of creation ab nihilo (by a Mind who knows what he is trying to do and has a purpose in so doing) there comes the insistence that we recognize the fundamental reality of radical novelty, irreducible to, and unpredictable from, what has gone before. But call this emergence, label it creativity, hail it as creative evolution, the mystery is still there! How can the novel quality, in specific, the finite cell, the finite mind, come into being from non- being? Why and how does one pattern or form of order give birth to an intrinsically novel pattern? And what ground is there for believing in the stability of one pattern of emergence rather than any other? Every metaphysics, then, faces a certain amount of mystery in this area. The empirical personalist, however, integrates the brute fact of mystery in creation into a total theory which reduces other unnecessary "mysteries." For he contends that a cosmic Mind, creative in se, given to rational and moral form in its creation, and seeking to develop a society of free co-creators as its highest human aim, throws more light on the facts of experience than does a more mysterious "emergence." The theory of emergence does not explain why the orders exist or the inter- relation between the orders of existence. The creativity we find, on the other hand, seems to be creativity-in-order, and in an order which sup- ports the highest qualities of human experience.31 If there is no being in the universe who knows what "emergence" is about, and whose nature and purpose controls the creative powers, there is no explaining the one-way direction of creativity let alone the interdependent relations of the orders of matter, life, mind, and human values. 31 Obviously the problem of good-and-evil needs to be dealt with before any adequate substantiation of this sentence can be given, but here the reader can be referred to E. S. Brightman's A Philosophy of Religion, (New York: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1940), Chapter 8, and to the author's Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion (New York: Prentice-Hall, inc., 1951), Chapters 17, 18. Phylosophisch tijdschrift, 6062.</page><page sequence="16">222 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH VII So far we have argued for the theoretical availability of the concept of person in connection with the interrelated problems of substance, causality, and purpose. But we have not dealt specifically with the nature of the sub-personal realms of being, namely, physical nature and life. We have proceeded thus in order to indicate basic agreement among personalists in the broadest sense and to express the solidarity a personalist can feel with any school of thought which takes these metaphysical prob- lems seriously. But we must devote our final section to the more dis- tinctive phases of personalism as a metaphysics, namely, its pluralistic idealism. In the remaining space we shall not try to review the arguments for an idealistic account of the world beyond the person. It must suffice to say that idealistic personalists find it empirically less explanatory to hypothesize nonmental substances or neutral entities when all that is ever given within experience is some form of personal experience. Non- mental entities could be accepted as composing the sub-personal realms if it could be shown that they could be (a) intrinsic unities of activity, (b) if the mystery of the interrelation and interaction between such sub- personal entities and personal unities could be adequately reduced, or more adequately resolved, than by some form of the idealistic thesis. We shall focus attention on two alternative idealistic ways of conceiv- ing the non-personal realm. We have already noted the fundamental reason why personalists reject quantitative monistic idealism such as absolutism. As they see it, absolutism in the end is forced to annul the free will and relative independence of finite persons and to encumber the supreme Person with needless irrationalities. But except in the re- jection of the Absolute, the dominant exponents of idealistic personalism, such as Lotze, Bowne, Flewelling, Knudson, and Brightman, join ab- solutists in identifying the extended world with God. Nature is Person, they insist, but the cosmic Person is more than Nature. Again, these thinkers agree with the absolutist in holding that while the brute, per- sonal experience of patterns of sensation involves a most significant area of contact with the environment, the metaphysical nature of that en- vironment, operating as it does within order and law, is best conceived as unified by the being of the personal Ground himself. As Brightman has recently put it: First, the realm of physical nature, inorganic and organic seems to be one relatively continuous system of order (barring the quirks of quanta and indeterminacy). However, the molecular laws of the organic may differ from the laws of the inor- ganic, the chemical constitution of atomic matter, the spatio-temporal continuity of processes, and the close interrelations of organic with inorganic in the life pro-</page><page sequence="17">THE PERSON AS THE KEY METAPHYSICAL PRINCIPLE 223 cesses, all seem to point to one mind-energy at work (to use Bergson's term), and to support the Lotze-Bowne view of the thorough-going immanence of God in nature - or, better - the immanence of nature in God.32 For the more typical personalist, then, what the scientist describes as the atomic and subatomic world with its relations, and all spatial bodies, including those of animals and persons, are different levels of the ener- gizing of the cosmic Will. The interaction which takes place between persons, and even between persons and their own bodies, is mediated by the intelligent, appropriate volition of the personal Ground whose wisdom and ethical purpose control, within limits, the orderly interaction we take for granted as the laws of nature. From the point of view of an empirical pluralistic personalist like Brightman, then, the dualistic, personalistic realist, is unempirical in holding to unexperienced non- mental entities. Such a dualist, J. B. Pratt, for instance, is further em- barrassed by interposing such non-mental beings, as a medium of inter- action, between the reality of the cosmic Mind and finite minds. The panpsychistic personalist (like James Ward and C. Hartshorne) is more empirical in realizing that a non-mental realm is unnecessary to explain the interaction of the World-Ground and finite persons. All that is required is a mental Order adequate to account for the order-in- change found in the experience of sense. But, as the last quotation shows, Brightman has specifically urged that the panpsychist is adding to the problems of explanation by interposing between God and man sub-per- sonal mental unities at a low qualitative level, as found in the realm of physical nature and the human body. It is difficult to conceive how such lowly-endowed, psychic beings could carry on the work of the world. Brightman, therefore, finds it desirable to use Occam's razor on any attempt to account for activities in the physical world and in living bodies by postulating different orders of self-experience. And he does so all the more willingly since he believes that the energizing of a purposeful, rational, Will is an adequate explanation of the intricacy involved in the orderly working of the human nervous system, of animal and plant organisms, and of the network of atomic and sub-atomic activities, and, even more, of the systematic interrelation of these levels of existence. In Brightman's view the spatial universe is the nonspatial activity of the cosmic Will. A person's body is that differentiation of the supreme Per- son's energizing which is most intimately connected with the created, finite mind. The activity of the cosmic Mind in the forms we know as the bodies of persons in the phenomenally spatial world is the basis for 32 E. S. Brightman, The Philosophical Forum, (Boston University) 9 (Spring 1951), p. 6.</page><page sequence="18">224 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH relating each finite person to other persons and sub-personal selves. Accordingly, adjustments between finite persons and interaction between all levels of being are coordinated within rational and moral limits (and for .Brightman within the limits imposed at any one time by the irrational Given), by the constant rapport and interplay between the energizing of the cosmic Mind and all the other minds it sustains. This view may seem complicated, but it would be difficult to find any fact of science which becomes less intelligible on it. But it seems fair to add that, while there is nothing unintelligible about Brightman's view, some, like the author, wonder whether this metaphysical account does do full justice to the organic world. Brightman, to be sure, takes account of the differences between atoms, living beings, and minds. He holds that there are sub-personal selves of different grades, all differentiated from the human person by their incapacity for self- consciousness, reasoning, and moral volition, but similar to the person in their unified self-experience, temporality, and purposiveness.33 One cannot, therefore, accuse him of disregarding the animal world, though he has not been as explicit about the plant world. For him conscious experience, always a unity, is graded in quality from the consciousness of a protozoan, which passes our imagination at the lower end, to the consciousness of God, which passes our imagination at the other. But while Brightman attributes an independent created status to the men- talities connected with different levels of protoplasmic and physiological organization, he will not grant that the spatial "bodies" connected with these sub-personal selves are themselves societies of selves. For him the created non-spatial self of a dog interacts with that differentiation of God's energizing which we call the dog's brain. The dog's mind interacts with the cosmic Mind who makes the necessary "brain-adjustments" in that part of his energizing which constitutes the dog's brain. The question we ask is: Would is not be less awkward theoretically to grant to all kinds of organic life, in which something analogous to donation and purposiveness is suggested, the same relative autonomy that is now granted to sub-personal selves? Is it not somewhat arbitrary to grant selfhood to frogs and cats because they act as purposive, cona- tive unities, and not also grant it to the cells in the brain and bone, which also act like conative unities? Again, is it not arbitrary to grant self- experience to an amoeba while denying it to the components of the cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, and autonomic system? This would not mean, as the writer would argue, that the atoms in this table or that star could also be conceived as selves, for present conceptualization, at least, makes it hardly reasonable to grant them conative unity. 33 See E. S. Brightman, Nature and Value8 (New York: The Abingdon Press), p. 53; The Philosophy of Religion, pp. 350, 353.</page><page sequence="19">THE PERSON AS THE KEY METAPHYSICAL PRINCIPLE 225 On the other hand, to hold that the human body is a society of so- cieties of selves (related to and interacting with the finite person and with the Infinite Person) would allow us to give the human body a unitary autonomy which it seems to have whether personal consciousness is present or not. On this more panpsychistic view, the cosmic Mind creates- the kinds of selves which govern themselves with the degree of order which the biologist discovers in the differentiated functions of the nervous sys- tem. On Brightman's view, the Creator has to maintain each qualitative level of bodily function as parts of his own energizing. On the alternative view suggested here, the created self-experiencing unities (which we phenomenally describe as cells, for example) are invested with the quality of activity which cannot endanger the continuity and inter- related unity of the known world which Brightman is justly anxious to protect. Nor do we need to grant these lower creatures mathematical power to explain the quantitative order we discover in physiological phenomena.34 All that is required is that the cosmic Person so endow each level of existents that basic unity and order among functions may be maintained. In any case, to leave all the qualitative levels of bodily function within God's energizing is to maintain the less intelligible position that the unified p- sonal Ground is at the same time functioning in some aspects of his own nature as the particular brain, muscle, nerve, and tissue of an indefinite X ariety of levels connected with the indefinite variety of selves. This is possible, but one wonders whether Occam's razor would not do an even neater job if we held simply that God, consistent with his ultimate purpose, creates different qualities of self-activity, and spontaneity, as evidenced by-all entities which seem to exhibit unity of conative feeling. On such a view we could hold that just as idealistic personalists now hold that the energizing of God's nonspatial will is known as a phenomenal spatial world, so the energizing of subpersonal centers of conation, are known as phenomenally spatial. It has no doubt-become evident that, while this extension of delegated selfhood down to, but not including, the inorganic world, might seem valid, and while it may help to throw light on the relations of mind and body and of consciousness to unconsciousness, any final decision must rest on analysis of related metaphysical problems, such as the nature of space, which can be no part of this essay.

Brightman once protested that on a panpsychistic view of the body, it would be harder to explain the mathematical order observable in biological phenomena.</page></plain_text>
