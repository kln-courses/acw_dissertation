<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Twilight of Federalism. The Disintegration of the Federalist Party, 1813 1830. By Shaw Livermore, Jr. (Princeton, N. J.: Princeton Univer sity Press, 1962. xii, 292 p. Bibliography, index. $6.00.) Professor Livermore has made this study of Federalism during the fifteen years after the close of the War of 1812 on the assumption that such a party could not suddenly disappear and in the further belief that Federal</page><page sequence="2">1962 BOOK REVIEWS 495 ism may have been a significant factor in the continuation of the caucus system, in the peculiar presidential election of 1824, and in the re-emergence of the two-party system. The book is well written and deserves high praise for its useful insights and for a number of superb analyses, but this reviewer has some doubts that the topic really merits a study of book length. Its more significant points might have been more succinctly presented, perhaps as a part of a larger study of what happens to defunct American parties in general. Since the book is organized in a strictly chronological manner, it contains redundancies as it chronicles the actions and reactions of the Federalists. Mr. Livermore bases his conclusions about Federalist attitudes upon quota tions selected from the newspapers and correspondence of the time, but the reader will often wonder if completely different conclusions might not have been reached through a choice of other available quotations. There are occasional distortions of fact produced by too facile generalizations. For example, the author implies wrongly that the Pennsylvania Germans as a group were Federalists (p. 7), that Pennsylvania had a "solid bank" of Republicans in Congress prior to the election of 1814 (p. 11), and that the Federalists constituted no significant threat in the presidential elections of 1808 and 1812 (pp. 23, 30). An analysis of these elections will indicate that Madison had a good chance to lose both and that the tide turned in his favor largely as a result of the loyalty of the Pennsylvania Republicans. One may agree with the author's conclusion that the survival of Federal ism was important in the continuation of caucus nominations and in the maneuverings of the presidential elections of 1824 and 1828, but it is diffi cult to share his view that it played any significant part in the re-establish ment of two-party politics. Party realignments were overdue as early as 1808, and they might have begun then except for the political issues result ing from the Napoleonic wars. The delay in the resumption of meaningful two-party warfare was less the result of Federalist survival than of the slow development of new issues and of the readjusting of party structures and political techniques to the pressures of industrialization and westward expansion. When two parties did emerge, Federalism was simply irrelevant. On the interpretative side, Mr. Livermore has contributed a restatement of the old characterization of the Federalists as "the wealthy, the wise, and the good." He asserts that Federalism "was the political expression of those who sought security and self-fulfillment in an ordered, structured social system" based upon an "organic or anthropomorphic" conception of so ciety. Jeffersonianism, as the political expression of the growing American individualism, simply swept the Federalists from the field (pp. 4-5). Al though the full-blown Federalist view of society has been outmoded, it seems probable to this reviewer that the really basic distinctions between our present political parties are less the result of issues than of different outlooks on society. Such outlooks are analogous to those held by the original Federalists and Republicans.</page><page sequence="3">496 BOOK REVIEWS October The book is well edited and remarkably free from typographical errors. Mr. Livermore, however, does insist on "Vergil" rather than "Virgil" Maxcy, and upon the Pennsylvania Historical Society rather than the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. The book constitutes a stimulating essay, though somewhat overex panded. It will be read with interest by those of us who find fascination in the restless panorama of American party politics.
