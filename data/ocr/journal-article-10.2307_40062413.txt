<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MEDIATING MUSE OF PARADISE LOST: GUIDE TO SPIRITUAL TRANSFORMATION Martha Lifson It may be simple or complex, spiritual or worldly, complete or partial, but at the center of many autobiographies is a transformation. John Stuart Mill is transformed out of despair into a new state of Romantic feeling and joy; Anais Nin (Vol. I) is transformed from a fearful and cloistered young woman living behind stone walls into a bohemian artist, a butterfly of costumes and grace; Malcolm X turns from being a self -described Satan into a man of God; Wordsworth comes out of despair, if not totally, at least in the direction of poetic inspiration and keen memory. Behind them all stands Augustine's Confessions, not only as one of the first autobiog- raphies and a model for transformation, but also as a model for trans- formation as a profoundly spiritual and emblematic as well as personal endeavor. In many autobiographies, and in The Confessions as well, the finding of appropriate images frequently signals the change, or may in fact induce it. It is as if the picturing of new images and the abandonment of the old, were a crucial and necessary pivot in the change. Transformed from re- probate to Christian, Augustine, for example, employs the imagery of movement, from the darksome deep to light, from chaos to creation. This imagery, obviously and archetypically appropriate for spiritual renewal, profoundly parallels (if it has not directly influenced) the prologues in Milton's Paradise Lost.1 What I want to do here is to focus on the prologues as the specific locus for spiritual transformation in the poem, on the imagery used, and most importantly, on the muse as the necessary agent for such change. In the midst of an epic narrative with a definite sequence of events (though we hear about them out of order) , the prologues appear like moments of stop time, pivot points that refer back to creation, center on the re-creation of a despairing poet, and refer forward to the reader's participation in the same process. For Milton's prologues, as well as his poem, are for us. They are to justify the ways of God to man. They teach, therefore, both confes- sion, an essential part of autobiographies - even if modern unburdening</page><page sequence="2">46 l i f s o N Journal is only in terms of a weight of memories rather than of sins - and the ulti- mate possibility of creation and salvation. Although other autobiographical pieces, particularly ones written after Rousseau, are focused on the uniqueness of the individual author, Milton's work is dominated by correspondences between the scene of creation and the scene of re-creation, and between the poet-prophet's experience and the experiences of others. Moreover, once the poet drops the prologues after Book IX, the reader is drawn into the autobiographical process by being forced to participate in the poem's apocalyptic concerns directly. In other autobiographical works a reader may have the choice of identifying with the narrator, of allowing boundaries between the self and the nar- rated events to break down,2 but Milton seems to argue, by means of the poem's structure, that facd with the ultimate concern over the salvation of one's soul, one has no choice but to immerse himself. Consequently, the muse invoked in these prologues is not simply a classical model or holy spirit,3 but is created capable of supreme media- tion; and becomes emblematic of the possibility of an eternal present and communion with God, no matter what the age, no matter who the person. The muse becomes the means by which the poet of Paradise Lost knows both the Biblical story he is to tell and himself. Moreover, since the pro- logues seem to show both the dovetailing of private concerns with the more broadly religious concerns of mankind, the muse serves as a media- tor between these two realms, as well as in many other ways more specific to the poem. That is, she seems to suggest that there is no way to separate so-called larger concerns from individual concerns; starting with the pro- logues, then, as more obviously autobiographical, a reader can come to view the entire narrative of Paradise Lost as the spiritual journey of one as well as of many, the hell, paradise, fall, and redemption of a single per- son writ large. Thus, I will focus on the poet's utilization of the muse as mediator, one able to bridge what might initially be perceived as opposing forces, vastly separated arenas of concern. She breaks down differences.4 In his essay, "Genesis as Myth," Edmund Leach argues that the central problem of religion is to bridge the gap between binary oppositions: this world and the other world, man and God, death and life.5 In every myth therefore, binary discriminations are followed by a "mediation" of the paired categories: "Mediation" (in this sense) is always achieved by introducing a third category which is "abnormal" or "anomalous" in terms of ordinary "rational" categories. Thus myths are full of fabulous monsters, in-</page><page sequence="3">The Mediating Muse of Paradise Lost 47 carnate gods, virgin mothers. This middle ground is abnormal, non- natural, holy.6 The job of the mediating muse in Paradise Lost is a large one because the scope of the poem is vast, covering the space from heaven to hell, and time from the creation of the world to the present. In spite of this vastness, however, it is generally agreed that no one part of the poem can be seen in isolation: Eden reflects heaven; the seas of chaos are like the chaotic wars between angels; the landscape is symbolic of inner states of being;7 the creative poet is analogous to God the creator, to Moses the Prophet, to Tiresias the blind seer; the fall of Adam and Eve is analogous to the fall of the angels; and so on. As a result, although this vast poem portrays many landscapes and many scenes, the one at hand will frequently be reminis- cent of others and it will be the reader's moral task to perceive similarities and differences across vast reaches of time and space. It is, of course, most specifically the poet's role to guide the reader, to help mediate between one moment and another, between the best in man and God, to help make connections.8 Even as Raphael (or later, Michael) mediates between heaven and earth, attempting to help Adam and Eve perceive their duties among garden weeds and Satan's vague evil, so the narrator helps to sharpen the reader's perceptions so that he can make necessary analogies, and so that he can understand the truth. Cognizant of Christian history, aware of the entire cosmos of good and evil, he mediates between different realms and makes the reader aware, for example, of similarities and dif- ferences between Eden and heaven, between one hero and another, be- tween light in heaven and light in hell.9 Appropriately, therefore, the muse that Milton places in the prologues of Paradise Lost to aid the poet (who is not so easily able to sail "between worlds and worlds," V. 268) is one who is both multi-functional and extensive - travelling along the con- tinuum of time and of space and of matter. She enables the poet (and the reader) to extend his perspective and thus to perceive events more cor- rectly. She appears before God, before Moses, and before the poet; she covers great ranges of time and space, sometimes appearing as an em- bodied female form, and at others as pure meaning. Appropriately, too, the muse surfaces only in the prologues, for the prologues are those places where the narrative system most obviously breaks and time and space are fluid. That is, in the prologues the poet allows his readers to be most aware of the entire scope of the poem. Turning from a particular aspect of the story of the fall, for example, the poet asks us to think of what we have just read and what we are about to</page><page sequence="4">48 L I F s o N Journal read, of the difficult endeavor of creating a poem, of the central role of analogy in the poem, of the fact that the present of the poem is no longer our present. (If the poet is most self-conscious in the prologues, so are we; the break in narrative demands reflection.) Since the muse is one who extends across time and space, she fits well into prologues which draw attention to flux and change. Moreover, she makes the poet and hence the reader aware that one's sense of self is not confined to a particular histori- cal moment, to a particular set of circumstances, but belongs to all time and space. Like others I read Paradise Lost as a poem in which creative activity is central.10 The story of Genesis stands as the central book; God creates everything; the fallen angels parody creation (although they remain effec- tive only in destruction) ; Adam and Eve create a garden together; the just men create various things - just words, an ark, a covenant; the angels create songs of praise and Adam and Eve echo them; Adam and Eve create a prayer asking forgiveness and with grace have the potential of establishing a paradise within; the poet creates himself and a poem. Thus it is appropriate that the muse be intimately involved with creative energy and that she be present at the creation of the world. The poet emphasizes Urania's connection with creation and in Prologue I says: Thou from the first Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark Illumine, what is low raise and support; That to the highth of this great Argument I may assert Eternal Providence, And justify the ways of God to men. (I. 19-26) n Because she was present at the creation then, the muse knows about creation and is a fitting power for the creator-poet to appeal to. She is more than a source of present poetic power; she extends back in time to the original creation and carries some of the beauty and divinity described in Book VII with her. Even as the dark and void and chaotic were trans- formed during original creation (see VII. 235 ff.), so the poet himself first identifies almost completely with the dark and chaotic and low, then finds himself moving towards possible creativity until he reaches a point in his own spiritual transformation where he can imagine creating a poem as well. The poet's own movement from chaos to creativity occurs fre- quently in the prologues, and signals the way in which for the poet of</page><page sequence="5">The Mediating Muse of Paradise Lost 49 Paradise Lost, these particular autobiographical concerns cannot be sep- arated from the general movement of divine creativity. Although it is certainly true that in other autobiographical settings the narrator is in some way representative or typical (as Henry Adams is of the 1 8th century man trying to cope with the 20th century, or as Rousseau is of the Romantic man of passions and feelings), nowhere is it more ob- vious than here. The struggles of the poet belong both to the cosmos and to each of us, and because he makes contact with the muse, he is able to create an inner temple ("th'upright heart and pure") and consequently a poem, dependent at the outset on the muse, but afterwards confident and sure. Again, there are other autobiographies in which creation and crea- tivity of the self form the central core of an identity. Nin and Sartre are two such, the one building an artist out of a neurotic longing for her father, and the other self-consciously involved in self-creation on every page of The Words: "I keep creating myself," and "By writing I was existing." But nowhere is it more crucial than to the poet of Paradise Lost. To par- take of creativity as a divine energy in the cosmos, and to write about it, is to exist. Further, if the prologues are read as metaphoric autobiography, then the emphasis on Genesis signals the poet's own birth as well as the possi- bility of recreation and salvation. Thus, although the poet has a far larger perspective than most autobiographers, he too opens his work with the conventional references to the beginning and the end, birth and death. And the language he employs is, of course, crammed with words meta- phorically suggestive (in sequential isolation) of earthly reproduction: seed, hill, brook, soar, brooding, pregnant. The poet simply turns about the usual weighting of items; more typically an author refers to items out of a creation myth in the chapter on his own birth. In Speak Memory ', Nabokov, for example, fills the chapter on his own birth with references to primordial caves, the ancient world, dark tunnels, eggs, Easter, cosmos. The muse of Paradise Lost extends back even further in time than the time of creation, however; the poet pushes her back into eternity, making her ancient and a part of divine truth and energy even before that energy moved upon the deep. In the prologue to Book III, for example, when he addresses divine light, he acknowledges that the spiritual sustenance which he seeks existed "before the sun" and "Before the Heavens." He wants a muse who is able to put the poet in touch with all past time, even with the realms outside of time, so that he too will have the perspective of eternity. Thus, the muse described in the opening prologue is one who knows about and who is to sing of the creation, the fall, and the restoration of man, and</page><page sequence="6">50 L I f s o N Journal who establishes at the very outset a perspective on the whole poem, and particularly on Satan and his compatriots, by revealing the whole tapestry of Christian history.12 The reference to Christ and to the restoration of mankind, although fleeting and almost casual, yet asks the reader to main- tain an eternal perspective and to remember that the events of Books I and II cannot be judged as ones isolated in time. The prologue to Book VII, especially, portrays Urania as having roots in eternity since she was born before the creation of hills and fountains: Descend from Heav'n Urania, by that name If rightly thou art call'd, whose Voice divine Following, above iW Olympian Hill I soar, Above the flight of Pegasean wing. The meaning, not the Name I call: for thou Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top Of old Olympus dwell'st, but Heav'nly born, Before the Hills appeared, or Fountain flow'd, Thou with Eternal Wisdom didst converse, Wisdom thy Sister, and with her didst play In presence of th' Almighty Father, pleas'd With thy Celestial Song. (VII. 1-12) Since the poet's role is to recreate and retell an old story with a long and complex tradition behind it, it is appropriate that he appeal to a muse who can put him in contact with divine stores of truth since she, like Wisdom, existed before the creation of time and of the universe. And again, by reading the prologues as complete, personal autobiography, one might see Urania as an image for inspiration from within, creativity well- ing up from the muddy chaos of the poet's own dreams. One critic of autobiography, Burton Pike, argues that autobiographers focus on early stages of life - in Paradise Lost the stages are mythically early rather than stages of childhood - in order to call up unconscious forces while main- taining some protection for the ego by the buffer of time.13 The poet of Paradise Lost wants to speak more wisely than he knows; hence, his ap- peal to a muse who is more ancient, more deeply rooted than his own more literary and rational self. Moreover, she arrives in the night, speak- ing close in his ear, in his dreams: she "dictates to me slumbering or in- spires/ Easy my unpremeditated Verse" (IX. 21-22). She embodies both the unconscious and primitive urges spilling out easily, and the possibility of sophisticated voice, and thus again mediates between conventional op- posites. (Perhaps Blake was correct in arguing that reason and heaven are formed out of the energy of the abyss.) In this capacity, the muse</page><page sequence="7">The Mediating Muse of Paradise Lost 5 1 symbolizes every movement in the poem from low to high, from chaotic to ordered, from hell to heaven, from dark to light; that is, she stands behind the basic structural pattern in the poem, and behind many of its basic images as well. In Book V appears one of the most famous exam- ples of this movement as Raphael compares the idea of one first matter, from body to spirit, to a plant: So from the root Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves More aery, last the bright consummate flow'r Spirits odorous breathes. (V. 479-482) In the prologue to Book VII, it is especially significant that the poet should describe his muse as born before the creation he is about to de- scribe; she was with God and spoke to Wisdom, and now she speaks to the poet who follows her voice in order to be able to recreate himself and the story of creation. It is for this reason that the poet stresses the voice divine of his muse. As a human poet he wants to participate in eternal wisdom not only so that he will know what to say about creation, but also so that he will be able to create the words of his own poem.14 The muse's voice serves also as a deliberate counterpart to the voice of God which initiates each new act in the process of creation. Even as God speaks his commands in order to create the world, so the muse speaks to the poet who then brings his poem into being.15 One of the threads which runs through all existence and to which the poet desires to attach himself is that of sound; that is, one of the ways in which Milton images the eternal and reappearing nature of divine truth is in terms of a speaking voice, and it is as if by speaking the poet will become one with the speaking God of the Old Testament. In Book VII, God speaks and the world appears - word and event being one; later he talks directly to Adam and Eve or speaks through one of his emissaries on earth. In Milton's poem and in the Bible, it is by means of his word that God reveals himself to man.16 In order to describe the way in which he was touched by divine inspiration, the poet then emphasizes the voice of his muse. By merging with that voice the poet becomes part of the sound of truth, his identity as speaker-poet resting on contact with the eternal voice. For example, after the prologue to Book I, the poet turns to his muse ask- ing her to give the reason for the fall (and concerned as he is with creating his poem, he uses the name Creator for God) : Say first, for Heav'n hides nothing from thy view Nor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what cause</page><page sequence="8">52 lifson Journal Mov'd our Grand Parents in that happy State, Favor'd of Heav'n so highly, to fall off From their Creator, and transgress his Will For one restraint, Lords of the World besides? Yet it is the poet who tells the story, whose voice continues to unfold the narrative of Satan's fall from heaven and of the abject angels in hell. In the prologue to Book III the poet again asks for inspiration in order to be able to tell of things invisible to mortal sight, but it is in the prologue to Book VII that the muse's voice and the poet's voice receive the greatest attention. The poet says that he now sings with "mortal voice" but that he has been soaring above the poetic flight of classical poets by means of Urania's inspiration. He has followed her voice. More importantly, in Prologue VII, in terms of spiritual autobiography, the poet must disassociate himself from those elements which threaten to destroy his voice; that is, he must slough off emptiness, darkness, evil, self-pity growing out of his isolation, noise. Again, as in all the efforts towards creativity in the poem, the movement is away from elements closely allied with chaos or hell as the poet turns to his muse: But drive far off the barbarous dissonance Of Bacchus and his Revellers, the Race Of that wild Rout that tore the Thracian Bard In Rhodope, where Woods and Rocks had Ears To rapture, till the savage clamor drown'd Both Harp and Voice; nor could the Muse defend Her Son. So fail not thou, who thee implores: For thou art Heavn'ly, shee an empty dream. (VII. 32-39) As in other spiritual autobiographies, specifically Augustine's, or even Thoreau's, the poet pays as much attention to the parts of himself he wishes to reject as to that which he wishes to attain. Also, as in other auto- biographies, the poet turns to a model in the figure of Orpheus to help de- fine himself; yet he wants only half that poet's fate: to sing well and not to drown. For help he turns to his muse and because of her has the potential to sing like Orpheus and yet to be taken into creative protection, into the entire sweeping movement of the book of creation which follows: order, abundance, light, harmony, all followed by angelic song as the heavens celebrate God's achievement. The poet of Paradise Lost further describes his muse as a mediator be- tween the truth and other poets of history; she inspired Moses on the top of Mt. Oreb, giving him knowledge of the creation, and she touched those</page><page sequence="9">The Mediating Muse of Paradise Lost 53 poets who, though blind, came to know and to speak the truth: Those other two equall'd with me in Fate, So were I equall'd with them in renown, Blind Thamyris and blind Maeonides, And Tiresias and Phineas Prophets old. (III. 33-36) That the poet chooses here to refer to other poets and to set himself within tradition is important for understanding his concept of truth as something eternal and available to men of various historical eras. His muse is one who has served other times and other poets, and her primary role has been, and is, that of mediator between men lodged in time and the truth which is eternal. Clearly as well, the poet's identity rests on his association with such prophets. To be one of the members of this category which he himself puts before us, means that he is both an historical personage and one who partakes of divine creativity. Of these men Moses is, of course, the most important to the poet since he too sought for inspiration from a Christian God, and since he knew directly of God's creation of the world: "That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,/ In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth/ Rose out of Chaos" (I. 8-10). The poet of Paradise Lost wants to reenact the role of that prophet who came to know and to write about the truth concerning creation. In this respect he is not so dif- ferent from other autobiographers who use an extraordinary model in order to impel themselves to new heights, new ways of speaking, new identities. Most others do not select models from the Bible, but many do select heroes. Rousseau chooses a knight in shining armor; in The London Journal Boswell wants to be a witty and urbane man about town; Henry Adams chooses real models in the figures of his friends, Hay or King, but also selects a 13th century symbol of force in the Virgin. His own longing for coherence and for a non-fragmented self, finds at least one manifesta- tion in the image of force, the Virgin supplying the central force for all the splendid arts of the Middle Ages. For each of these authors, transforma- tion of self depends upon a model, and in many cases, the specific model is also a source of inspiration for necessary language or for art. For the poet of Paradise Lost as well, the model of Moses is his direct source for trans- formation of self and for transformation of unformed language - so that both can rise out of chaos. Logically, then, the poet prays to a muse who is a repository of truth open to all divinely inspired men and who is the source of words besides. The muse also seems to mediate between the two sorts of time main-</page><page sequence="10">54 lifson Journal tained in the poem, linear or progressive, and cyclical - at least in so far as she represents both. In Books XI and XII time is essentially linear as history leads men closer to the new heaven and the new earth promised by God, but the time suggested by the image patterns is, to the contrary, cyclical. Often these patterns picture the earthly cycles of days, of seasons, and of the life and death of plants. Life and creativity are seen reasserting themselves periodically throughout the poem. Furthermore, divine order is often conveyed in Paradise Lost by references to the cycles of repeating days: one way in which God creates order out of chaos is to establish the days, seven days which according to calendars repeat themselves in turn; Adam and Eve play their part in divine order by performing certain duties at set hours of the day, and most importantly, by praying in the morning and in the evening. Although time is often supposed to be static in Eden, Milton, in fact, creates a garden which in no way gives the impression that time is at a standstill or that time is all the same.17 Adam and Eve celebrate the various times of day by different activities, praying, working, eating, loving; Eve prepares their meal of fruit at a specific time each day. The cyclical re- appearance of holy light or of the one just man in the final books of Paradise Lost seems to indicate that God's providence is also cyclical. Since the poet of the prologues lives in a fallen world, his repeated refer- ences to the various times of day and to the seasons take on increased sig- nificance, for they remind the reader that God established the cycle of time and that he continues to control the diurnal sphere, the round of days, the returning nights full of inspiration, and even those recurring days which the poet cannot see: Thus with the Year Seasons return, but not to me returns Day, or the sweet approach of Ev'n or Morn, Or sight of vernal bloom, or Summer's Rose, Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine; But cloud instead, and ever-during dark Surrounds me. (III. 40-46) So much the rather thou Celestial Light Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers Irradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from thence Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell Of things invisible to mortal sight. ( III. 5 1 -55 ) The muse is somehow the reminder of the return of life and promise which</page><page sequence="11">The Mediating Muse of Paradise Lost 55 the return of daylight or of spring cannot be for the blind poet. Since she is pictured as appearing, disappearing, and reappearing in the course of the poem, she is a reminder of God's ever-returning influence both within man's soul and within nature. In spite of blindness and discouragement, the poet continues to receive visits from the muse who proffers a vision, renewed faith, and inspiration for poetic creation. Thus the poet pictures his own transformation as emerging from a bap- tism of darkness and chaos into the light of salvation. Creation is linked with salvation as the story of the holy spirit naming the waters of chaos reminds him of the soul's final struggle towards God. Even as the dregs are separated from created matter during creation, so evil will be purged away at the final judgment. Even as God plants the sky with light ("And sow'd with Stars the Heav'n thick as a field," VII. 398), so the poet is infused with light. It is as if his prayer is answered by its very formulation: "there plant eyes." With spiritual renewal then, the fallen man can become poet, able to tell "of things invisible to mortal sight." Throughout this journey, the poet is aided by his muse since she is the one emblematic of spring and renewal; she rescues man from linear time and answers a traditional lament of pastoral poetry - that unlike nature, man's life does not renew itself cyclically - by putting man in touch with nature. Although the muse's return is of a cyclical nature, it symbolizes finally the outcome of all history; according to the opening lines of the poem, the muse is to sing only during man's years of woe, "till one greater Man/ Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat" (I. 4-5) . The periodic gifts of a holy muse, even as the periodic bursts of sunlight, will eventually be extended across all time and Eden will be restored, not only physically, but within the clarified mind of man as well. One has the sense that the cycle will unwind and that bliss will extend linearly forever. The muse of Paradise Lost covers space as well as time, mediating be- tween the spaces of the universe the poet has constructed. She aids the poet in his poetic journeys through the vertical and divinely created spaces between heaven and hell. In the prologue to Book III the poet says that he was taught by his heavenly muse to venture down into chaos, night, and hell, and also to reascend. Again, in the prologue to Book I, the poet describes his flight above the Aonian Mount aided by his heavenly muse, and in Book VII his soaring ascent above the Hill of Olympus. Because the muse is divine and because she was present even before the creation of the vast spaces of the world, she can guide the poet easily and skillfully. She can mediate between the various geographic spaces which the poet must travel in writing his poem, and between the moral states which those</page><page sequence="12">56 lifson Journal spaces represent: she can put the poet in touch with both hell and heaven, making him a counterpart of that Renaissance man hung between beasts and angels, able to understand both. The dramatic interweaving of the divine and the satanic with the human which characterizes the poem itself occurs then within the poet as he experiences both divine light and the darkness of chaos and hell; in his prologues, for example, he is both hu- man - self-pitying, angry, weak - and divinely inspired. He is guided and he guides. As he works towards his inspiration and self-redemption, the poet fol- lows the pattern of Adam seeking grace after the fall: in Book III he first makes his own efforts to gain inspiration, seeking it among the haunts of the muses and among the holy streams of Mt. Sion; later he prays for celestial light; and as he begins his account of God in heaven, he demon- strates that he has indeed received the gift of inspiration and grace. The muse is somehow part of and the cause for the poet's spatial journey towards the light and creativity. Moreover, as the poet imagines himself freed from chaos, transformed, and finally approaching salvation and in- spiration, he pictures himself as winged and flying, like the muse herself.18 The image of flight is important not only because the Holy Spirit is repre- sented as a dove, but also because in the Neo-Platonic tradition the soul (the true self) is pictured as a bird. At the outset the poet asks for inspiration from the spirit which brooded dove-like over chaos, but in the prologues to Books III and VII, it is the poet himself who is flying, soaring, and climbing into the air. Taught by the heavenly muse, he has, like Satan, ventured down the dark descent into hell and has reascended (III. 13-22). For a moment he even completely identifies with Satan and calls the journey, "my flight." Newly created, the poet moves upward ("Up led by thee," "up to reascend," "That with no middle flight intends to soar," "what is low raise and support"), lifting himself up even as various other newly created life forms - water, trees, animals, man - lift up in the account of creation in Book VII. Having earned his role by experiencing chaos and evil, the poet becomes directly analogous to the dove at creation, the dove at Christ's baptism, the flying angels (Raphael as phoenix and mediator) , as well as to the muse and the direct source of poetry. (Or stated differently, the flight is directly depen- dent on the depths to which the poet has dared to plumb.) Moreover, the transformation of the poet is attested to by other sets of images that asso- ciate him with the power of water and of gardens: "Yet not the more/ Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt/ Clear Spring, or Shady Grove, or Sunny Hill" (VII. 26-28) . And out of this transformation of self comes</page><page sequence="13">The Mediating Muse of Paradise Lost 57 the possibility of poetry, each successive book of Paradise Lost bearing witness to the successful endeavors of the prologues. It is fitting that Milton's muse should prove to be a mediator between different times and spaces since the whole of the poem contains so much of the universe; somehow it must nonetheless pull together and be a whole. As a unifying symbol for so vast and inclusive a poem the muse is not only in touch with far-flung geographic parts of man's world, however, but also with disparate aspects of man's experience. She unites, for example, both classical and Christian mythologies. That this is a Christian muse, holy and divine, the speaker of the prologues repeats again and again. Yet the poet does not reject classical literature and forms, nor the inspiration from them or from pagan muses, seemingly gathering to himself all possible sources of energy and truth. Although the poet seeks a more heroic theme and a more divine source of inspiration than those available to him through classical literature, he describes the grand flight of Pegasus and seeks to find the muses of Olym- pus (III. 26-32). The name Urania refers to the classical muse of astron- omy, yet the poet of Paradise Lost insists that it is "The meaning, not the Name I call" (VII. 5). His choice of the name may indicate her role as mediator between the classical and Christian elements of the poem, par- ticularly since the poet draws attention to the extensive possibilities of his muse. Just as the old, classical forms of truth fed into and were modified by Christianity, so the pagan muse Urania becomes a heavenly Christian muse, without, however, losing her connection with that past that resides always in her name. Perhaps, too, the poet is risking himself at this point, for although he states that he calls upon the meaning and not the name, he does choose the name Urania, hopefully a fitting and true one. The first man, Adam, un- impaired by the fall, instinctively knew the right name to give each of the animals because he was inspired by God: "I named them, as they pass'd, and understood/ Thir Nature, with such knowledge God endu'd/ My sudden apprehension" (VIII. 352-354). Presumably, if the poet of Para- dise Lost calls upon the right name for his muse, if he is able to make the name and the meaning converge, he, too, will be in the favored position of Adam and will be one of those men whose language is inspired by God. Urania is not only classical and Christian, she is also portrayed as both a physical being and as pure spirit. She is both spiritual (a divine meaning, an inner assurance) and physical (a personified figure playing with Wis- dom, a dove moving over the waters). Within the prologue to Book VII, the muse seems to become more physical, though without sacrificing her</page><page sequence="14">58 li f son Journal spiritual meaning, as she moves towards the earth and the poet who is call- ing her. She enacts in reverse the process by which Adam and Eve were to have turned at last to spirit (V. 498 ff.) , as she appears first as pure mean- ing, then as a disembodied name and voice, and then as the sister of Wis- dom. Playing before the throne of God, whether rejoicing, dancing, or making music, she seems to assume a more physical presence, a presence which she maintains as she drives off the revellers threatening the poet or governs him in his account of creation. Again, she is very like the poem in which she is embedded, a poem which presents all of its elements as both physical and spiritual (God too appears as anthropomorphic as in the Bible). And thus, continuing her mediation of paired opposites, she assures the poet as he reaches into the depths of human and physical pain and despair, into whatever is low and dark, and into the heights, writing finally about things, "invisible to mor- tal sight." Finally, the muse asks that the poet be judged not only by the physical manifestation of his thoughts, the poem itself, but also by the meaning behind it and by the meaning brought to it by its readers. Most modern autobiographers recognize or at least play with the idea that they exist largely by text alone; but for the poet of Paradise Lost, the manifes- tation is not all there is. Yet it remains a large part, and the poet demon- strates his struggles and his established identity by means of the whole poem, and in some ways he is as much his text as Sartre is his. Thus the whole poem, particularly in its basic structural unit of movement, belongs to the spiritual autobiography of the poet who at the end, in spite of all he has accomplished, is thrust like Adam and Eve alone into the world, to experience the whole round yet again, until the world, even as the text, comes to its ultimate end.

Arguing trom the vantage point ot Milton s De Doctnna, Maurice Kelley identifies Urania with an attribute of God; since the De Doctrina for- bids the invocation of the third person, and since the attributes of the muse correspond to those assigned in the treatise to the virtue and power of God, Kelley concludes that the muse is a personification of various attributes of the Father. Maurice Kelley, This Great Argument (Princeton: Princeton Univ.</page><page sequence="15">The Mediating Muse of Paradise Lost 59 Press, 1941), p. 117. John Steadman also argues that Urania is a poetical personification of an attribute of God. He associates Urania with Wisdom and then with the Harmony originally existing in the divine mind and subse- quently reflected in divine decrees and in the 'pulcherrimo ordine' or the vis- ible and invisible worlds. John Steadman, "Urania, Wisdom, and Scriptural Exegeis," Neophilologus, XLVII (1963), 67. Lily B. Campbell identifies Urania with the Holy Spirit since the language used by many Renaissance poets to address the Christian muse is very similar to that traditionally used to address the Holy Spirit. Milton's first prologue which addresses the Spirit that prefers "Before all Temples th'upright heart and pure" fosters such an identification, for the Holy Spirit was sent to live in the hearts of all believers. Miss Campbell identifies Urania with Spenser's Sapience in the "Hymne to Heavenly Beauty" whom she identifies with the Holy Spirit. Urania is simply a new name for that spirit which inspired the authors of the Bible, particu- larly Moses and David. Lily B. Campbell, "The Christian Muse," The Hunt- ington Library Bulletin, VII (1935) 56-64. William B. Hunter Jr. argues that the imagery of the prologue to Book III reveals that Milton meant to in- voke the Son; according to Hunter, patristic writers often expressed the rela- tionship between the Father and Son by using the metaphors of a ray of light and its source and a stream of water and its source, the same metaphors which appear in the phrases, "Bright effluence of bright essence increate" and "pure Ethereal stream." He notes that in the Neo-Platonic trinity of One- Mind-Soul, Urania (Mind) is in the position of the Son in the Christian trinity, and that Urania is identical with Spenser's Sapience who represents the Son of God.

It may be useful to postulate the reasons for the feminine nature of the muse. Woman as mediator. Although Irene de Castillejo is describing women and not muses, her comments may be more useful in fact in describing a mythical figure: "her role is still, as it always has been, to be a mediator to man of his own creative inspirations, a channel whereby the riches of the unconscious can flow to him more easily than if she were not there. ... To do this she must never lose her natural contact with the living springs in the unconscious." Knowing Woman (New York: Putnam, 1973). 5. Interestingly, autobiographies also defy classification and the usual bi- nary categories such as history or diary, truth or fiction. 6.

I grant that this role of setting the narrative in context belongs largely to the narrator as Stanley E. Fish has so skillfully documented in Surprised by Sin. In the prologues, however, the narrator gives credit for his ability to sing of this larger context to his muse; frequently it is simply difficult to separate the two. 13.

Again, however, I see the muse as a mediator, here between the inspiration which is behind a work of poetry and the more mechanical talents necessary to bring it into being; the same figure is first one kind of figure and then the other.
