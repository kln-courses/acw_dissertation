<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHARAD PA TIL Earth Mother Significantly enough, there seems to have been an intimate connection between irina, the so-called natural cleft in the earth at the south-east of the Aryan sacrificial ground, and Nirrti, the goddess of evil. Who was she ? Rg-vedic hymns VII. 104. 9, X. 10.11, X. 18.10, X. 59.1-4, X. 95.14 and Atharva-vedic hymns VI. 84, XIV. 2.19 invoke Nirrti either as a deity of evil or of death. We come across her fullest description in Taittiriva Sarhhita IV. 2.5 as follows: g. Homage to thee, O Nirrti of every form (Visva-rupe), Loosen ye this bond made of iron; Do thou in accord with Yama and Yami Mount this highest vault. h. The bond that Nirrti, the goddess (devi Nirrtir.), Bound on thy neck, not to be loosened. This I loosen further as from the middle of life; Then living, let loose, do thou eat the food. i. Thee in whose cruel (Kriira) mouth here I make offering, For the loosening of the bonds, As 'earth' men know thee (Bhiimimiti tva jana viduh), As 'Nirrti,' I know thee on every side.</page><page sequence="2">SOCIAL SCIENTIST k. Seek the man who poureth not offering nor sacrifice, The road of the thief and robber thou followest; Seek8 another than us, that is thy road; Homage be to thee, O Nirrti, O goddess. 1. Praising Nirrti, the goddess, Like father his son, I weary her with my words; She who knoweth all that is born, Discerneth, the lady, every head. m. Abode and collector of riches (nivesanah saigamano vasfinam), Every form she discerneth with might, Like the god Savitr of true laws, Like Indra, she standeth at the meeting of ways.8 The post-Vedic Brahminical literature takes it for granted that Nirrti stands for everything evil and deathlike. Even the distinguished Marxist scholar Kosambi calls her 'a death goddess'.4 Nirrti was evidently a pre-Aryan goddess. Hence, such a non- Brahminical sect as the Jaina, is seen taking a totally opposite view of Nirrti. Kalpa-sitra records that Mahavira passed away on the most auspicious of the new moon nights: "This occurred in the year called Candra, the second (of the lustrum): in the month called Pritivardhana, in the fortnight Nandivandhana; on the day Suvratagni, surnamed Upasama; in the night called Devananda snrnamed Nirrti (Devananda namarh rajani Niratitti pavuccai)..."5 The commentator Samayasundara Gani explains, "That new moon day or night called Devananda is also spoken of as Nirrti (Devananda niima sa amavasy--rajani Nirrtir apy ucyate)." It seems for certain that Nirrti retained her exalted position in the early Vedic period. Nighantu, the Vedic glossary older than the extant recension of Rg-veda,6 gives Nirrti as a synonym of earth along with Aditi and Ila (I. 1.14,15,16). Nirukta (11.7.8) juxtaposes both the views, pro-Nirrti as well as anti-Nirrti. The etymologists rendered Nirrti as earth, while the ascetics interpreted Nirrti as calamity.7 The word Nirrti is formed by affixing the preposition 'nir' to 'rta'. According to the theory of the grammarian Gargya, quoted by Nirukta 1.3, prepositions '... have various meanings... hence, whatever their meaning may be, they express that meaning (which brings about) modifi- cation in the sense of the noun and the verb . . ' 8 It is according to this theory that Nir+rti means un-truth or evil. But, this theory fails to explain the original, non-Aryan and non-Brahminical, meaning of Nirrti. Only the theory of another grammarian, Sakatayana, provides a satis- factory explanation. 'Unconnected prepositions .. have no meaning but only express a subordinate sense of nouns and verbs' . . .9 Hence, according to this theory the preposition 'nir' does not reverse the meaning of rti, but buttresses it. 32</page><page sequence="3">EARTH MOTHER Rti or rta means, according to Nighantu (1.12.68), water. This etymology denotes that Nirrti was orginally an apsaras, a water or river goddess. Rta also means 'cosmic law', which makes Nirrti the universal mother, the Prakrti of the non-Brahminic Safikhya philosophy. 1 The above-quoted invocation of Nirrti by Taittiriya Sarhhita seems to have combined both the outlooks. By saying that she is called earth by the people (Bhumiriti tva jana viduh), the hymn expresses the love she evoked, while by stating that oblations have to be offered in her cruel mouth in order to free the sacrificer from her fatal sacrificial bonds (Yasyas te asyah krura asain juhomy esath bandhanam avasarjanaya) it expresses the fear she evoked. Being a ritual hymn, it has faithfully pre- served an ancient reality. Then how is it that the same deity should arouse such mutually antagonistic emotions in her devotees ? The absolute exclusiveness of such emotions is the work of civilization, while in tribalism these antagonistic emotions exist not only in an inseperable unity, but are evoked by the same phenomenon. Briffault explains it as follows: . . The distinction between 'good' and 'evil' powers, to which our theological ideas attach so much importance, is of little relevance in primitive thought, and can indeed scarcely be said to exist. 'The classification of spirits into good and bad, or rather the attribution to some of qualities chiefly bad, and to others of qualities chiefly good', remarks Sieroszewski, 'has only arisen very late and is not very strict'. Primitive supernatural beings are essentially such as we should classify as evil and maleficent. Power in egalitarian primitive society is intrinsically an evil thing; it is synonymous with power to harm; for benevolent action being regarded as a natural duty between members of the same group, it is not viewed as a manifestation of goodness. The Santal of Bangal 'cannot understand how a being can be more powerful than himself without wishing to harm him' . . . ... In New Zealand 'all the bad passions of life, such as fear, anger, revenge, vindictiveness, malice, remorse, sorrow, are attributed to the gods; but those sensations that render life desirable, as love, prosperity, health, etc., are supposed to exist without any divine intervention' . .. . . . The object of primitive religious acts is precisely to placate, to propitiate powerful, and therefore dangerous, beings who are capable of doing harm... Those beings are not always and necessarily thought of as 'evil'; but they are conceived as dangerous and irascible. They have the power to send diseases, to cause sterility in women and in animals, to bring about famine and render the earth barren; they have the power to kill. Consequently they have also the power to withhold disease and to cure, to cause fertility in women and in the earth, to bring to life. Hence, one and the same deity is the sender of diseases and the deity of healing, the cause of sterility and the 33</page><page sequence="4">SOCIAL SCIENTIST deity of motherhood and fertility, the power of death and the source of life. Interpreters of primitive religion are frequently perplexed over the apparent contradiction of good and evil attributes in primi- tive gods. Their difficulty arises from the circumstance that, with us, the first question as regards a strange supernatural thing is whether he is benevolent or malevolent, whereas the distinction has very little importance or meaning in primitive theology. . . This brilliant analysis is applicable to Nirrti only in so far as she coexisted with Aditi, the Aryan mother of gods, as denoted by Nighantu. This coexistence of non-Aryan and Aryan divinities is but the reflection of the initial coexistence of these two peoples whose deities they were. Kosambi explains this coexistence as 'recombination.'2' The above-quoted hymn of Taittiriya Samhhita imprecates Nirrti as one who follows "the road of the thief and robber," and thus denotes that the coexistence was antagonistic, The tribal peoples may combine in con- federations or clash in wars, but they are found to retain and rely on their own 'national' deities. W Robertson Smith gives the best elaboration of this phenomenon: Broadly speaking the land of a god corresponds with the land of his worshippers: Canaan is Jehovah's land as Israel is Jehovah's people. In like manner the land of Assyria (Asshur) has its name from the god Asshur, and in general the deities of the heathen are called indifferently the gods of the nations and the gods of the lands ... In fact the relations of a god to his land were not merely political, or de- pendent on his relation to the inhabitants. The Aramaeans and Babylonians whom the king of Assyria planted in northern Israel brought their own gods with them, but when they were attacked by lions they felt that they must call in the aid of 'the gods of the land," who, we must infer, had in his own region power over beasts as well as men. Similarly the Aramaeans of Damascus after their defeat In the hill country of Samaria, argue that the gods of Israel are gods of the hills and will have no power in the plains; the power of the gods has physical and local limitations. So too the conception that a god cannot be worshipped outside of his own land, which we find applied even to the worship of Jehovah, does not simply mean that there can be no worship of a god where he has no sanctuary, but that the land of a strange god is not a fit place to erect a sanctuary. In the language af the Old Testament foreign countries are unclean, so that Naaman, when he desires to worship the god of Israel at Damas- cus, has to beg for two mules' burden of the soil of Canaan, to make a sort of conclave of Jehovah's land in his Aramaean dwelling place. .1 Hence, though the pastoral Aryans settled in the land of Nirrti, adopted her along with many rituals of her people, their distrust of Nirrti and her people remained and asserted itself by making her subservient to 34</page><page sequence="5">EARTH MOTHER their deity, Aditi. The Raja-siuya, evidently a pre-Aryan ritual adopted by the Aryans, commences by oblations to Nirrti,l4 but her human representative in the sacrifice is the discarded wife of the king called Parivrkti, while the deity of the chief queen, called Mahisi, is Aditi.1 5 In order to learn more about the pre-Aryan or non-Aryan people, we will have to learn more about their goddess Nirrti. For, the Kunda- puva Jataka says, Yathanno puriso hoti, tathanna tassa devata. 6 (As is the man, so is his deity.) The invocation of Nirrti by the Taittiriya (IV. 2.5) and Vajasaneyi (XII, 62-66) Sarhhitas is followed by the ritual of ploughing and oblation to Sita, the deity of communal agriculture. Ritualists enjoin that the plough made of Udumbara wood should upturn four furrows.l7 The ploughing ritual is followed by the Rg-vedic hymn X. 97 dedicated to plants.18 The ritualists further prescribe that the first fifteen mantras of the hymn should be recited while sowing all plants in the four furrows.' 9 The first Rk of this hymn goes as follows; Ya osadhih purva jata devebhyas tri-yugarh pura Manai nu babhruinam aharh satar dhamani sapta ca. Keith renders it as follows; 'The plants born Three generations before the gods, Of the brown ones I celebrate The seven and a hundred abodes.'2? Siddheswarsdastri Chitrav, in his Marathi translation of Rg-veda, while translating the Rk, substitutes 'tri-yutam' in place of 'tri-yugam', and renders it as Nirrti.2 With this emendation, the Rk will appear in translation as follows: I invoke the brown-coloured primeval plant (mothers), which are born of Nirrti and the gods, and have one hundred and seven (clan) houses. How is it that an anthropomorphic goddess is visualized as putting forth the plant world ? Primitive man, though he had long ago separated himself physically from the non-human world, mentally was still wedded to that world in general. Hence, he thought the whole world, animate as well as inanimate,to be as human as himself. Indian myths are full of accounts of human beings giving birth not only to animals and plants, but also to inanimate objects. Kadrui was the mother of serpents, while Suparni or Vinata was the mother of birds or eagles.2 The sages laid a curse on the Yadavas, that Krsna's son Samba would give birth to an iron pestle which would be the cause of their total destruction (XVI. 1-19). Innumerable examples can be cited. It was this mental make-up that led tribal man to believe that the whole world, animate, as well as inanimate, was produced by an anthropomorphic world mother. Chattopadhyaya draws our attention to 35</page><page sequence="6">SOCIAL SCIENTIST a remarkable passage in Markandeya Purana: The Markandeya Purana has a well known section called Devi Mahatmya, that is the glory of the goddess. In this the goddess her- self makes a rather startling declaration: 'Next, 0 ye gods, I shall support (i.e. nourish) the whole world with the life-sustaining vegetables, which shall grow out of my body (atma- deha-samudbhavaih) during a period of heavy rain; I shall gain fame on the earth then as Sakambhari'.2s He goes on to explain that it is this concept of the mother goddess that led the people of Indus civilization to fashion the seal bearing a remarkable representation of mother goddess: Interestingly, a concrete evidence of this belief has been unearthed by the archaeologist at Harappa (Fig. 2). Marshall described it as '... a very remarkable oblong seal from the Harappa (Plate xxii. 12), on which a nude female figure is depicted upside down with legs apart and with a plant issuing from her womb.24 V S Agrawal in his India as Known to Panini has reproduced a photo- graphic impression of an ancient terracota relief of earth mother; her arms are intertwined by serpents and plants are growing on her head. She is the Sarpa-rajnii of Taittiriya Sarihita,25 Aitareya Brahmana26 and Satapatha Brahmana.27 Hence, it can be reasonably asserted that the figure of the mother goddess on the Harappa seal can represent nobody other than Nirrti, the pre-Aryan universal mother, who generated the plant world which had one hundred and seven houses (dhamani). Atharva-vedic hymn 5.7.8 attests to her being naked. Now, what are these 'houses' of plants ? Saktas, the worshippers of Sakti or mother-goddess, are enjoined by their scriptures to worship kula-trees and kula-yoginis: Another aspect of Saktism that demands notice in this connection is the worship of the kula trees. The very first duty enjoined upon a Sakta on rising from bed very early in the morning is the salutation of the kula trees with the formula, Om kulavriksebhyo namah. According to Kulacudamani, 'the worshipper should salute the kula tree whenever he sees it.' The author of Saktananda Tarangini reproduces two different lists of the kula trees . . . It is said of kula trees, 'The kula yoginis always dwell in all the kula trees. No one should sleep under the kula trees nor injure them.'g2 Kula tree means the deity of the clan. In the drama Uttara- Rama-Carita (Act VII) Prthvi (Earth goddess) says to her daughter Sita pointing at the river goddess Gafiga with the words, "This one (is) Bhagirathi. the clan deity of your father-in-law (Iyam to Svasura-kula- devata Bhagirathi)." The Buddhist Jataka stories have left us the record that all people in those days, from king to common people had trees as their clan deities and such a tree was called 'maigala-rukkha,' meaning 36</page><page sequence="7">EARTH MOTHER auspicious tree. In Kusa-nali Jataka, king Brahma-datta of Varanasi had his own mafigala tree.29 In the Kusa-nali and Palasa Jatakas rural and urban people in the kingdom of Varanasi offered oblations (bali) to their mangala trees.30 The gathas of these Jatakas are far more ancient, at least pre-Buddha. The gatha in the Kundaka-puva Jataka has the word bhaga for share instead of bali. A share is given to the member or deity of a tribe or phratry or clan, and not to an alien (anya-udarva). Hence these trees could only have been clan deities, and kula yoginis or clan mothers. Thus, one hundred and seven houses (dhtamni) were but one hundred and seven clans headed by clan mothers. The ritual directive of Vajasaneyi Sarhhita prescribes that the first fifteen Rks of the plant hymn, i.e. XII. 75 to 90, should be recited in five trks (one tfk com- bines three rks) while pouring the plants in the four furrows.3s Here we have actual modification of the five-phratried system into the four- phratried cau-pata system. That the Vajasaneyi Sarhhita should preserve a non-Aryan tradi- tion is not surprising. An ancient tradition preserved by the legal litera- ture says that the Sudras are Vajasaneyins . .. "In certain digests we find a smrti quotation to the effect that Sidras are Vajasaneyins. This is explained as meaning that the Sudras should follow the procedure pre- scribed in the grhyasutra of the Vajasaneya Sakha and a brahmana should repeat the mantra for him . . " The Rks X.97.17 and 18 of the plant hymn specifically mention that Soma was the king of the plants (Ya Osadhavah Soma-rajiih), and thus the divine consort of Nirrti. This is corroborated by Satapatha Brihmana, when it defines etymologically that ama-vtasya or new moon night mean the sacred marriage of moon with earth. Now this king Soma, the food of the gods, is no other than moon, When he (the moon, masc.) is not seen that night either in the east or in the west, then he visits the world; and hence he enters into the waters (f.) and plants (f.) ... And since during that night he here dwells together (ama ves), therefore that (night of new moon) is called amtavasya (the dwelling together, or at home).88 As already stated, according to the Kalpa-sutra of the Jainas, amavasyaf was Nirrti herself. Thus, on every amarvas! a the sacred marriage of Soma, the moon god, and Nirrti, the earth mother, took place. The bridegroom going to dwell at his bride's house itself denotes that it is a matrilocal marriage. In that monthly marriage, which is called divine marriage (deva-vivaha) by Aitareya Brahmana (IV.27), the old moon died and a new moon was born. That is why Satapatha Brahmana says, 'within death is immortality (Antarari mrtyor amrtam)'.84 This non-Aryan tribe consisting of 107 clans which were organized into five phratries and ruled by the human representatives of the earth goddess Nirrti and the moon god Soma is represented in the diagram. 37</page><page sequence="8">SOCIAL SCIENTIST Devi Nirrti Soma I I II rIII IV V Jani Tri-Ambdt 11 Rudras 1.

But as already pointed out, Visvedevas were thirteen, while Maruts were sixtythree. The above-quoted hymn of Taittiriya Samrhita says that Nirrti 'standeth at the meeting of ways (tasthu samare pathinam)'. Crossroads, it seems, was a place sacred to Nirrti. The lawgivers Apastamba (B C 600 to 300), Gautama (B C 600 to 400), Baudhayana (B C 500 to 200), Vasistha (B C 300 to 200) enjoin that oblations to Nirrti should be offered on the crossroads. ' Crossroads was the place where oblations to mother goddesses in general were offered since time immemorial. Carudatta, the hero of the drama Mrcchakatika (Act I), was but following a time-honoured usage when he requested his friend Maitreya to go to the crossroads and offer on his behalf the oblations of that day to the mother goddesses (Gaccha tvam api catus-pathe matrbhyo balim upahara).4 Bana records an ancient custom when he narrates in his Kadambari, that Queen Vilasavati, in order to overcome her childlessness, used to go to a crossroad on the fourteenth night of the dark half of every month, and sitting in a charmed circle traced by a great sorcerer, used to take a ritual bath (Maha-narendra-likhita-mandala-madhyavarttini vividha- balidana- anandita-digdevatani bahulacaturddasi-nisasu catus-pathe snana-manigalani bheje). Though dying out, the custom still persists in Indian countryside. In order that the fertilizing waters should touch every part of the body, childless women strip themselves completely naked. The Greek parallel to Nirrti is Hekate. The deity most overtly associated with the moon was Hekate, goddess of witchcraft. At the end of the month, when there was no moon in the sky, the Greek housewife used to sweep her floors and take the rubbish to a crossroads, where she threw it down with averted eves and returned without looking back. Such deposits were known as 'Hekate's suppers.' The idea was that the human excreta swept up with the rest were charged with magic and dangerous . . . On the sixteenth of the month, when the moon had just passed the full, the women used to go to the crossroads and offer to Hekate round cakes stuck with candles, which they called 'shiners' (amphi- ph6ntes). The object was to preserve the light of the moon. 'Shiners' were also offered to Artemis ... Aeschylus, . . . identifies Hekate and Artemis as a single goddess of childbirth ... Both goddesses are entitled trioditis referring to the crossways, the place where 'three ways meet'.'4 Crossroads was so sacred a place in non-Brahminical tradition, that no less a person than Buddha bade Ananda to erect a dagaba at the cross- roads on the remains of his body: At the four crossroads a dagaba should be erected to the iathagate (Catu-mahapathe tathagatassa thfipo katabbo). And whosoever shall 39</page><page sequence="10">SOCIAL SCIENTIST there place garlands or perfumes or paint, or make salutations there, or become in its presence calm in heart-that shall long be to them for a profit and a joy. 27. 'Those men, Ananda, worthy of a dagaba, are four in number. Which are four? 'A Tathagata, or Arhata-Buddha, is worthy of a dagaba. A Pacceka- Buddha is worthy of a dagaba. A true hearer of the Tathagata is worthy of a dagaba. A king of kings (raja cakka-vatti) is worthy of a dagaba.' 4 Buddha reiterates but an hoary tradition harking back to pre-Aryan times since when dagabas used to be erected at the crossroads on the remains of priests and priest- kings (cakka-vatti). It has already been noted that Nirrti's sacred place, that is, cross- roads was an impregnating place. The etymology of Nirrti itself reveals that she was goddess of fertility- ' . . . nirrtih (earth) is (so called) from giving enjoyment (Nirrtir nirramanat)'.44 What is meant by 'giving enjoyment'? The verb used is 'ram'. It also meant 'sexual enjoyment.' Rama- yana (1.77.13) narrates that Sita and her sisters enjoyed sexual pleasure with their respective husbands immediately after marriage(Remire muditah sarvah bhartrbhir mudita rahah). This becomes clear beyond doubt by the etymology of Urvasi, another mother goddess, given by Nirukta (V.13): "Urvasi is (the name of) a maid, (so called because) she per- vades wide regions (uru+vas 'to pervade'), or she pervades by means of thighs ..." Durga explains the latter rendering as 'in sexual enjoyment'.45 When Nirrti's people were enslaved by the Aryans, her daughters came to be called 'ramas' by their masters, the term again being derived from the root 'ram': " . . Having kindled the sacred fire, one should not approacll a lovely dark maiden (rama). It is only for enjoyment (rama- na.ya) and not for any sacred purpose that a lovely dark maiden is appro- ached . . . 4 It is by condemning woman to slavery that the norms of sexual morality were created. That is why the patriarch Karna, derided Drau- padi as bandhaki, or the meanest kind of slave woman or prostitute (II.61.35): Eko bharta striva devair vihitah Kuru-nandana! Iyarh tva aneka-vasaga bandhaki iti viniscita." [Gods have ordained, O scion of the Kurus, one husband for women But this (Draupadi) being possessed by several (husbands), is fit only to be called a bandhaki,] But, according to Mahabharata, totally different sexual code held sway when woman was free.47 Pandu persuades Kunti to resort to levi- rate by preaching the same ancient morality: But I shall now tell thee about the practice of old indicated by illu- strious risis fully acquainted with every rule of morality . . . Women 40</page><page sequence="11">EARTH MOTHER formerly were not immured within houses and dependent on hus- bands and other relatives. They used to go about freely, enjoying as best liked by them ... They did not then adhere to their husbands faithfully, and yet, O handsome one, they were not regarded sinful, for that was the sanctioned usage of the times. That very usage is followed to this day by birds and beasts without any exhibition or jealousy. That practice, sanctioned by precedent, is applauded by great risis. And 0 thou of tapering thighs, the practice is yet regarded with respect among the Northern Kurus. Indeed, this usage so lenient to women hath the sanction of antiquity. The present practice, however, hath been established but lately.4 8 This sexual promiscuity was not senseless indulgence in passion, but was considered to have magical significance. Primitive agricultural peoples all over the world firmly believed that permanent sexual freedom to their women was essential for assuring the fertility of the soil, and in order to gain abundant harvests both sexes of a tribe indulged in promis- cuous intercourse on appointed days. Briffault gives examples of peoples from every continent, out of which the examples of Indian tribals are reproduced here; In Chota Nagpur, among the Hos, the harvest is the signal for general license, and such license is looked upon as a matter of absolute neces- sity. In Orissa, among the Bhuiyas, during the spring festival called Magh Porai, "all respect of blood relations and husbands is set at naught." The Parganait, a caste of husbandmen in the Rajmahal Hills, have a great yearly agricultural festival, called Sohrai, at which the unmarried of both sexes indulge in promiscuous intercourse. In Jaypore promiscuity and changes of partners last for a month at the new year festival of the Runjas. The Kotas of Nilgiri Hills have a similar festival of continuous licentiousness. In Assam spring festivals are observed by all the tribes, and women are allowed complete freedom without "any stain, blemish, or loss of reputation." Similar festivals are observed in Khondistan, among the wild tribes of Mani- pur, and of Northern Burma.4 9 In the great agricultural civilizations of ancient Egypt and Asia it was obligatory for every woman, high or low, 'to sit in prostitution' at the door of the temple of their mother goddesses: In Babylonia every woman was under the obligation of proceeding once in her lifetime, most probably before her marriage, to the temple of the Great Goddess, arrayed in her most splendid apparel, and of waiting there until a stranger threw a piece of money in her lap with the words, "I beseech Our Lady to favour thee." She then retired with the stranger to an adjoining house, and surrendered to his embraces. The same rule appears to have been observed at one time throughout Semitic lands. The practice was abolished at Hieropolis in the time of Constantine. 41</page><page sequence="12">SOCIAL SCIENTIST In Phoenician temples women prostituted themselves for hire in the belief that they thereby won the favour of the divinity. Among the Amerites it was a law "that she who was about to marry should sit in fornication seven days by the gate." In Cyprus every woman, whether princess or peasant, offered herself at the temple of the goddess before marriage. In Lydia all girls were under the obligation to act as pro- stitutes before marriage. These customs have survived until quite recently in the islands of the Anatolian coast. At Chios it was in the eighteenth century the custom for girls to earn their dowry by pro- stitution.. In Armenia it was considered the duty of girls of noble family to serve for a considerable time as sacred prostitutes in the temples before they married.. Every girl of a (Egyptian) noble family was, before marriage, and indeed before the age of puberty, appointed to serve for a period in a temple of the god, and gave herself to any stranger who paid the required amount into the temple treasury. That promiscuous intercourse ceased when the first menstruation appeared and the young woman was then married as befitted her station.50 The custom continued in Egypt even after it embraced Islam. In Egypt, in the populous city of Tana, the great annual 'mulid,' or Saint's feast, of Ahmed al-Bedawi, is one of the most populous festivals of the Muslim world. Enormous crowds from all parts of lower Egypt gather during the celebrations. Special tents used, until recent years, to be pitched by the Egyptian Government, for the use of 'ghowazy,' of whom no fewer than six hundred established themselves there during the festival, acting as sacred hierodules. It is the custom at the present day for women of the most respectable families who desire any grace to make a vow to attend the holy festival, and to yield themselves to the first man who happens to approach them.6 But, as illustrated by the examples of the sage Uddalaka's wife and Kunti, even after marriage the sexual freedom of women was far from being restricted even by their husbands. If we accept the ethical code of Karna, who himself was the virgin-born (kanina) son of Kunti, then we will have to assume that in ancient times all women were but bandha- kis, while all men acted as but cuckolds to their wives. The real purpose underlying the strange sexual freedom enjoyed by women by universal consent in ancient agricultural societies, is disclosed by the equally strange usage prevalent among the Arabs of Morocco and North Africa, who were devout followers of Islam for more than a millennium when the French conquered them and wrote about them: In Morocco and North Africa the most solemn religious feasts are made occasions for sexual license and prostitution. In the region inhabited by the Walad Abdi tribe the women lead the most dissolute life; they are constantly divorcing their husbands, and in the interval between one marriage and another, are common prostitutes, though 42</page><page sequence="13">EARTH MOTHER continuing to dwell in the midst of their families. The French autho- rities have repeatedly attempted to put a stop to these scandalous disorders, but they have met with fanatical opposition on the part of the agricultural population zwho allege that such a state of things is necessary in order to obtain abundance of crops. 5 It is only in this context that the 'abominable' custom that till recently was prevalent in a part of Kerala can be understood: This (Wemmani) was a separate principality with Karttikapalli for its capital at the time of Nieuhoff. . . The Dutch captain speaks of a law existing in this kingdom of so abominable a character as scarcely to be believed of human beings. He says, 'It is commonly reported in these parts that the king of Batyma made a law, by which a man is empowered to kill any woman that should refuse him a kindness.' This law or custom is referred to by earlier writers also. Archbishop Meneses found it to exist when he visited 'Catiapilly' in the dominions of the Raja of Batuniena. Hugh says, 'The men assumed the right of dishonouring any woman, whatever her rank or circumstance; and the laws permitted them to put one to death on the spot who should resist their brutal demands.'53 To call the custom prostitution is a misnomer. It is only by depriv- ing woman of her sexual freedom and by imposing monogamy on her, that chastity of women in general and prostitution of a section of them in particular came to exist in a unity of opposites. Not a single prostitute was to be found in Tibet upto that time. The Tibetans practised group-marriage; while at the same time lowlands and Kashmir swarmed with prostitutes as a result of their adopting individual marriage.54 Hence, prostitution cannot exist in a society which practises sexual promiscuity. The classic illustration of ritual promiscuous copulation is that of the mother of Vy asa, the reputed author of Mahabharata. She was the daughter of the king of the D?aa tribe living on the banks of Yamuna, adjacent to the territory of the Kurus of Hastinapur, whose king Santanu she later married. Satyavati was known by her maiden name Matsya- gandha, or Fish-odoured (1.63.69). But it is significant that in her un- married and married states of life she was known by the name of Kali (I.104.24). Though Kali literally means 'dark', a princess and later a queen could not have been called by a derisive epithet. Krsna and Krsna or Draupadi, both meaning dark, were honourable epithets of the most dominating figures of Mahabharata. It is the colour of earth, and hence most esteemed by ancient agricultural societies. The Dasa king is said to have received Kali from the river Yamuna, (I.63.67). It means that the Dasa king was the sacred consort of the river Goddess. Popular tradition still assumes that Gafga is fair while Yamuna is dark. Hence, Kali must have been a name of the river goddess herself, and being the daughter of the river goddess, Satyavati came to be called 43</page><page sequence="14">SOCIAL SCIENTIST Kali. Kali also is one of the names of the mother goddess Durga (IV.6.17). When she came of age, she was appointed by her father to ply a canoe on the river. Accosted by the enamoured sage Parasara, she told him: "Sa abravid Dasa-kanya asmi dharmathar vahaye tarim pitur niyogad bhadrarh te Dasa-rajio mahatmanah." [She said, "I am a daughter of the Dasas, May you prosper! I have been appointed by my father, the great-souled king of the Dasas, to ply this canoe for earning religious merit".] What religious merit (dharma) accrued from plying the canoe on the river? The verses 1.63.72-73 will help explain it: Safigamarh mama kalyani kurusv ity abhyabhasata. Sa abravid pasya bhagavan paravare sthitan rsin. Avayor drstayor ebhih katham tu syat sangamah? [(Parasara) said (to her), Unite with me, O auspicious one!" She said-"See, O blessed one, the sages standing on the banks. How can the intercourse take place under their very eyes?" There is no compulsion or fear. That she consented through fear of the sage's curse is a later interpretation (1.104.10). The word 'ni-yoga' used, means 'appointed for copulation.' She was appointed by her father to ritually copulate with every desirous ford-maker and Parasara was one of the many to share her liberal favour. Yamuna was one of the earliest to be trained to artificial irrigation. Hari-vaimsa (46.30-52) narrates in an extremely poetical manner how Yamuna was tamed by Bala-rama. After ritually mating with her (46. 45, 49), he commanded her, "Lafgala-adista-marga tvam imamr me priya-darsane! Desam amba-pradanena pavayasva akhilarh subhe!" ["Follow the channel dug up by my plough, O beautiful one; and satiate this whole (vraja) country, O auspicious one, by the bounty of your waters!"] It was to ensure abundant harvests for the Dasa tribe that Kali Satyavati mated promiscuously in her sacred canoe. The matter is further clarified by the Kusa Jataka.55 Okkaka, king of the Mallas of Kusavati, was childless. The Mallas assembled be- fore his palace and raised a shout, "The country will perish!" The king, bowing down before the time-honoured custom, sent his three queens, the youngest first, the middle one next and lastly the eldest and the chief queen (mahesi) as 'dharma-natis' among his tribesmen for promiscuous intercourse. This was not an accidental, or non-Aryan, phenomenon. Rama and his brothers, Sita, the Pandavas, Draupadi alias Yajfia-seni, and a host of other celebrities of ancient times, were the offsprings of such dharma-natis. For tribal Indians the very meeting of their tribal assembly was 44</page><page sequence="15">EARTH MOTHER an act of sexual copulation. Majjhima-nikaya5 6 uses the term 'sannipata' for sexual intercourse (mata-pitaro ca sannipatita honti). Anguttara- nikaya,57 while narrating that five hundred Licchavis had assembled in the Sarandada Caitya (temple), uses the term 'sannipata' to denote that act (Tena kho pana samayena paiicamattanarh Licchavi-satanamf Sarandada cetiye sannipatitanamr... ) The very mnote-hall where the tribal assembly met was called 'sandha-agara', the house of coition. The meeting of the temple authorities in South India is called Yogam.58 Thus, dharma, which later came to mean religion, originally meant ritual promiscuous copulation. That is why, according to RamaTyana (I.36.24), earth goddess is the wife of many (bahu-bharya). The two words: Dharma and nati, forming the compound dharma- nati, have much to tell us. Let us first take up the former word. Purva- mimamfisa, the philosophy which grew out of and in defence of Vedic ritualism or magic, defines dharma as that which is characterized by Vedic injunction or Command (codana-laksano' rtho dharmah).59 Dharma or magic is defined by Thomson as 'command'.?8 Command to whom by whom? It was a command on behalf of a technically backward and organizationally monolithic tribe to nature. This is best illustrated by the Maccha Jataka.6 l Buddha, in a former life, born as the king of fishes in a lake on the outskirts of Sravasti in Kosala country, in order to save his tribe (fiti-sangha) from the raging famine and the hovering crows, commanded Pajjunna (god of rain) to open his floodgates, "Abhitthanaya Pajjunna! Nidliini kakassa nisava ! Kakam sokaya randhehi ! main ca eoka pamocaya !" ["Come thundering and flashing, O Pajjunna ! Deprive the crows of their feast! Enshroud them in lamentations! Release us from this affliction!] The command for the desired result was accompanied with the miming in song and dance of the actual natural process that was seen to precede that desired result. Nati is derived from the root 'nat', meaning 'to mime.' Kosambi explains, The original meaning of natya is precisely miming not acting in the modern sense. For example, in the Mrcchakatikam, the villain Sakara dances (nartayati) with joy in the 9th Act, a simple enough demonstration. But the masseur-monk in Act 3 takes the place of an image to escape his pursuers, after miming various sentiments: bahuvidham natyam krtva. Sakara mimes a sentiment, not an action (in the 9th Act) when he manifests temptation: iti moham natayanti. In the same act, the hero Carudatta mimes his shame (lajjam natayati) without verbal answer when the shocked judge asks him, 'Sir, is a courtezan then your friend ?'; fear is mimed by him on his way to execution.. 62 Many of the Rgvcdic hymns were ritual dramas, meant to be mimed and sung. 45</page><page sequence="16">SOCIAL SCIENTIST Most of the .Rgvedic hymns are meant to be chanted by one or more priests. But there are a few exceptions where the hymns can only be explained as what remains of a ritual performance. For example, three (or four) characters, Indra, Indrani and Vrsakapi (and per- haps his wife) take part in X. 86 which is unquestionably sensual with its quite erotic passages. . The dialogue of Urvasi and Purura- vas is likely meant to be a part of a ritual act performed by two characters representing the principals and is thus a substitute for an earlier, actual sacrifice of the male . .63 The rendering by Siddheshvar Shastri Chitrav of the Rks X 86.16 and 17 is given below: (Indrani eager for intercourse says), 'O Indra, a person whose sexual organ hangs (loosely) between his thighs is deficient in virility. Only he can copulate whose sexual organ stays erect even when he lies down. Supreme is Indra over all.' (Remaining apathetic to her proposal, Indra says), 'O Indrani, he whose sexual organ hangs (loosely) between his thighs can copulate better than the one having a taut sexual organ. Supreme is Indra over all.' 6 In such ritual dramas the dominating character is that of a woman. In the horse sacrifice, the three mothers, Amba, Ambika and Ambalika, mime coitionwith the slaughtered horse and later mime promiscuous copulation with the priests.65 The triune Amba and other heroines of these ritual dramas were tribal mothers and officiated as natis or jana pada-kalyanis or ganikas, or in Vedic idiom, as Brahmavadinis. They were originally in charge of the magic of the tribe. Maya is the Vedic term for magic. Chattopadhyaya explains the etymology of maya: ... Another well known synonym for prakriti was maya (in a sense opposite to the Vedanta) and it is suggested that the word was derived from the root ma, to measure. Obviously, it is the same root that gave Sanskrit the word 'mother' ..." What did she measure ? Obviously the rastra or the tribal land. How is it that the woman in ancient times, inspite of her indulging in promiscuous intercourse, was not considered 'sinful'? Because, declares the law-giver-Baiidhayana, their impurities were purged by menstrual discharges: 4 'Women (possess) an unrivalled means of purification: they never become entirely foul. For month by month their temporary unclean- liness removes their sins. 5 'Soma gave them cleanliness, the Gandharva their melodious voice, and fire purity of all (limbs); therefore women are free from stains.' 7 That is why the sage Parasara and the sun god assured Kali and Kunti respectively that they would regain their virginhood after delivery.6 8 46</page><page sequence="17">EARTH MOTHER It is on account of this unique quality of regaining virginhood after every monthly course, that mother goddesses in India received the epithet 'Kumari,' the eternal virgin. One of the appellations of Durga in Maha- bharata is Kumari (IV. 6. 7) Regaining of virginhood every month also meant rejuvenation. Hence, the mother goddess is conceived as eternally young. Atharvavedic hymn VII, 6.2 declares that Aditi is eternally young (ajaranti). This purification and rejuvenation of the earth mother after she has 'delivered' her yearly harvest, is celebrated by the Malayalis in the form of Ucharal festival: It is that (Ucharal) which proclaims the end of the agricultural season and comes on at the end of the month of Makaram (January- February). The second crop of the year will have been harvested by the time, and as the hot season commences now, Bhumi Devi, the goddess of earth, retires to take rest till the rains set in. "At the beginning of this period, the Malayali observes a festival in honour of the goddess' menstruation which, like the Roman Februria, are supposed to take place at this time. On the last three days, during which all granaries are closed, paddy is not sold and no implement of agriculture is touched. Even the rice to be eaten during these days is pounded beforehand. On the first day, before the evening, the granary is closed, some thorns and shrubs of broom being fixed to the door with cowdung and some ashes spread in front of it. The next two days are holidays for all the house, the house must not be swept nor the floors smeared with cowdung, and even the garden may not be swept or watered. On the fourth day, the granary is opened and a basketful of leaves is taken to the field and burnt with a little manure, perhaps to indicate that the cultivator remains in possession. Ucharal is the date on which all agricultural leases should expire, and demands for surrender of property cannot be made at any other time:...Special Ucharal festivals are held at Cherpplassery in the Walluvanad taluka and near Shoranur at which straw models of cattle are taken in procession to the temple of Bhagavati."69 Menstruation, to primitive mind, is the direct cause of procrea- tion.70 The Greek scientist philosopher Aristotle and Indian Ayurveda (medical science) believed in it.'7 Ancient Indians poetically called the appearance of menses as 'putting forth of blossoms'. The Asura princess Sarmistha, after attaining puberty, entreated king Yayati to fructify her blossom (... rtuh dehi nara-adhipa), so that she may generate fruit (Rajii putrarm phalami devam .. .)72 Pali scriptures are most explicit: "At that time the Magadha king Seniya Bhimbisara suffered from fistula; his garments were stained with blood. When the queens saw that, they ridiculed (the king, and said): 'His Majesty is having his courses. His Majesty will bring forth!"7 3 Rhys Davids' translation does not bring out the sense fully. Literal 47</page><page sequence="18">SOCIAL SCIENTIST translation will be, "His majesty is in blossom; his majesty has put forth flowers: soon his majesty will generate fruit!" (Utuni dani devo, puppharh devassa uppannarh, na aciram devo vijayissati).7' It is due to this conception that in matrilineal agricultural societies like Kerala, the attaining of puberty by a girl, instead of being shameful, was celebrated as a great event: Thirandukuli, the puberty rites of the Nayars, commence with the separation of the girl in a room in which there are a lamp, a brass pot, a bundle of coconut blossoms and other things. The girl holds a Valkannati, a mirror made of a round brass plate with a handle. The event proper is announced by the happy shouts of the female relatives . . . Women of the surrounding houses visit the girl and bring new garments as presents. Relations, friends and the village people are invited on the third day. The Manars and Valans, the washermen, so important in the routine of Nayar life, come on the fourth day. The girl is oiled and washed with water in the next tank together with her girl friends. The whole party then returns in procession accompanied by music. A pandal has meanwhile been erected in front of the main building where a luxurious banquet is offered to the guests to the sound of music and gay singing . 7 Celebration of puberty and other fertility rites were supposed to generate similar processes in nature. It was believed that plants had a longing like pregnant women (dohada) at the budding time, and the Asoka could blossom forth by the kick of a young belle, while the Bakula by a spout of liquor from a damsel's mouth.78 The proverb occurring in Kunda-puva Jataka which has been already quoted, literally means "As is the food of man, so is the food (offered) to his deity" (Tathanno puriso hoti, tathanna tassa devata). Hence, let us see what was the food of Nirrti. In the Ruja-siya sacrifice, in the house of the human represen- tative of Nirrti, Parivrkti, the discarded wife of the sacrificer king, the oblation offered to the goddess is: "To Nirrti (he offers) an oblation in the house of the neglected wife, made up of black rice broken by the nails," (Nairrtarh carurf parivrktai grhe krsn.anam vrihinarh nakha- nirbhinnari .. .) 77 In piling of the Garhapatya fire, the Taittiriva Sarhihita directs, "for Nirrti there are three (bricks) black, dried by a chaff fire; chaff is the portion of Nirrti; black is the form of Nirrti" (Nair~tih krsnas tisras tusa pakva bhavanti Nirrtyai va etad bhaga-dheyar yat tusa Nirrtyai rupam) . . . The food of Nirrti was black rice, in contradistinction to barley (yava), the staple diet of the Aryans. Satapatha Brahmana declares that except barley all the other food plants belonged to the Asuras. 9 The Buddhist canon Digha-nikaya preserves the account that wild paddy (aka- 48</page><page sequence="19">EARTH MOTHER ttha-pako sali) was the first food plant to be discovered by man.8" The agrestic slaves of Kerala were given as part payment of their labour, black rice, whose name, strangely enough, is akin to Nirrti: "When the paddy is cut they (Pulleahs) receive the tenth part in payment and a sort of black paddy which springs fourteen days afterwards called Neerab is also their perquisite ... 81 Tradition believes that these slave castes were the original inhabi- tants of Southern India and they were a free and prosperous people before they were conquered and enslaved by the Chola kings. The Pulavas still have their own temples of Bhagavati, and in Sarkaray, a Thanda Pulaya n officiates as a priest: At the great Siva feast of Tiruvalur in the Tanjore district, the chief of the Parayan rides an elephant with the statue of the deity, the Yak tail as a token of honour in his hands. Once a year, too, a Paravan becomes the ritual husband of the statue of the deity in Sriperum budu... It is probably true that, as H A Stuart reports in the Census of India, 1891, the Velluvan, priests of the Paraya caste, were employed in this function at the court of the Pallava kings, not only before the immigration of the Brahmins, but even some time later...82 E M S Namboodiripad observes: It is remarkable how, in spite of the centuries of Brahmin domination non-Brahminical deities continue to be worshipped in the plains and coastal areas, not to speak of the same being done in highlands. Many of these have of course been taken over by Brahmins, the deities them- selves being converted to Brahminism. There are, however, many more that are still under non-Brahmin domination, being non- Brahminical in name, mode of worship, etc.88 These non-Brahminical temples are predominantly of mother goddesses. The number of mother goddesses is legion. Mahabharata (IX.46) narrates that innumerable mother-goddesses accompanied Skanda, the commander-in-chief of the gods, when he led the gods in their battle against tlhe Asuras. The main mother-goddesses are variously said to be eight or seven. The eight mother-goddesses are given as follows- Bi-ahmi, Mlhesvari ca, Aindri, Varahi, Vaisnavi tatha Kaumari ity api, Camunda, Carcika ity asta-matarah, [Brahmi, Mahesvari, Aindri, Vaisnavi, Kaumari, Camunda and Carcika, these are the eight mothers]. Amara-kosa (70) enumerates the seven mothers as follows: Brahmi, MaIhesvari ca eva, Kaumari, Vissnavi tatha Varahi ca tatha Indrani, Camunda saptamatarah. Durga is the mo3t important deity of Bengal. The seven mothers have seven temples dedicated to them in XMaharashtra. The eldest sister is Sapta-srnigi (seven-horned) having her temple in Nasik district, and her fair, held on the full moon day of Caitra (March-April), is one of the biggest in Maharashtra. The youngest sister Eka-vira (one-heroed) has 49</page><page sequence="20">SOCIAL SCIENTIST her temple next to the cremation ground in Dhulia. Both of these god- desses are served by bhopes, a hereditary priesthood drawn from the non- Brahmin musician Gurava caste. Maha-laksmi, the famous tribal mother goddess in Thana district, is served in heredity by a family of Warli tribals themselves. The grotesque statues of these mothers and the gaudy temples housing them are but innovations. Originally a shapeless stone represent- ing the mother goddess was placed on a raised earthen platform in a sacred grove. Such a sacred grove is still known by the term 'vadi' in Maha- rashtra. Each village of the Khasis of Assam had its sacred grove.84 It has already been shown that Amba-pati, the representative of the tribal mother goddess of the Vajji confederation, had her own sacred grove called Amba-vana [(sacred) grove of the mother]. C Kunhan Raja thinks that this worship of mother goddess in sacred groves is of pre-Vedic and Dravidian origin. The gods of the Vedas are not forest deities. They came in chariots drawn by horses and there is no mention of hunting associated with the Vedic gods. But when we come to the non-Vedic gods of Hinduism, we find that they are associated with the forest and with hunting. Nearly all the Saivaite gods of Hinduism are non-Vedic, and are recognized as Dravidian. There are especially two deities, Kali or Durga and Ayyappan (a Dravidian god that is supposed to be the offspring of Siva through Visnu as maya, who distributed nectar to the gods after the churning of the ocean). The temple of these two deities is called a Kauu in certain parts of South India and the word means a forest or grove. This shows that these deities were worshipped in forests and groves. The place where the serpent images are instal- led and worshipped is also designated by the same term.85 It will be a misnomer to style the institution of grove-installed mother goddesses as exclusively Dravidian. Nevertheless, it was definitely of pre-Aryan origin and has existed throughout Indian history as a non- Brahminical institution all over India. A mother-goddess was originally but a deified tribal mother. Hence, it is incorrect to call the mother-goddess- worshipping societies as hunting ones.They were pre-eminently agricultural societies, in which women tilled the soil and men hunted. That Nirrti was worshipped as a shapeless stone becomes evident from the passage of Satapatha Brahmana, "Having thereupon put that stone (symbolizing rocks and mountains) into the water-pitcher, they threw it in that (south western) direction, for that is Nirrti's region..."88 A water-pitcher with a stone in it is also a symbolic representation of the female womb with an embryo in it; for in the worship of Durga, 'pfirna-ghata' is the only object of worship.87 As already shown, Nirrti was also a water or river goddess. Apsaras (naiad) has got corrupted in Marathi into the term Asara. Certain stones or rocks in a river are known as asaras, and they are stlll worshipped by 50</page><page sequence="21">EARTH MOTHER newly delivered mothers who take the infant to that rock and 'mime' swinging of the child on it. The Semitic peoples worshipped wooden stock and stone, for the Biblical patriarch Jeremiah condemned them as idolators who conceived the stone to be their mother and the stock to be their father: "...Jeremiah describes idolators as saying to a stock, Thou art my father, and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth. .. "8s One would think that Jeremiah was denouncing the seer of the Atharvavedic hymn XII, 1.12. 'Earth is mother, I am earth's son; Parjanya is father" (mata Bhumih putro aharh Prthivy,ah Parjanyah pita ..)89 The stone and the stock does not mean that their worshippers did not know the arts of architecture and sculpture. ''Even when the arts had made considerable progress the Semites felt no need to fashion their sacred syxmbols into likenesses of the gods. Melcarth was worshipped at Tyre in the form of two pillars, and at the great temple of Paphos, down to Roman times, the idol was not an anthropomorphic image of Astarte, but a conical stone . "90 The sacred black stone of Kaaba originally represented Al-Uzza, the primal mother goddess of Arabia. The Great Goddess of Arabia was most generally known as Al-Uzza. We are told by Al-Kindv that Al-Uzza was the moon. Her chief shrine, and the most famous and sacred spot of Arabia, was the Ka'aba at Mecca. The Khuraish, the tribe that had the charge of the holy place, were in pre-Islamic times her priestly caste and bore the title of 'Abd-al-Ussah,' that is the servants of Al-Uzza; but her immediate service in the temple of Mecca was performed by aged priestesses. At the present day the guardians of the Ka'aba are known as the Beni-Shaybah, that is 'the sons of the Old Woman' . The Great Goddess was worshipped in the Ka'aba in the form of a sacred stone, which, there can be no doubt, was none other than the famous black stone which is still the most sacred object in Islam. When he abolished the old 'idols' of the old religion; Mahammad, whose dominating ideal was to unite all Arabian tribes into a single political body bound by a common cult, felt it to be undesirable or impractic- able to do away with the most sacrosanct object of symbol of the old religion. The Muslim pilgrims from all quarters of the globe proceed to Mecca to this day chiefly with the purpose of kissing the ancient image of the Great Goddess of Arabia. As in most other shrines in Semitic and also in Greek lands, the anicomic stone of the deity stood by a sacred spring, or well, the Zemzem, whose sacred waters are drunk by all good Muslims ... 9 It is a mistake to call Al-Uzza the moon, for moon was specifically known as Sinn. 'The most general name of the moon god, in ancient Babylonia, was Sinn, which is still the ordinary Syrian name for the moon; the Kurds at the present day speak of the moon as Sheikh Sinn. 51</page><page sequence="22">SOCIAI, SCIENTIST The name is equally prominent in Arabian inscriptions down to the furthest southern extremity of the Peninsula .. Al-Uzza, like Astarte and Nirrti, was the earth mother of the Arabs. Now, why was the south-western direction especially sacred to Nirrti? If she was the deity of death as she is alleged to be, then her direction should have been south, the direction of Yama, the god of death, or of the deceased fathers. South-western direction was also the most sacred direction to the ancient and mediaeval people of Kerala. Every village had its mote-hall or sabha, and it was situated in the south-western corner of the village temple. In the inscription dated Kollam year 384 (A D 1209) we read, 'In the presence of the Tiruvantapuram Association and its Sabhanjita (Chairman) assembled in the Southern (Hall) of Mitranandapuram (under the solemn presidency) of (the Bhattaraka) &amp; Co.' Comment- ing on the above, Professor Sundram Pillai remarks that 'it is impossible to doubt that, in 384, Trivandrum, like so many other villages, had a sabha or association, with a Sabhanjita, Chairman, or Secretary of its own, and that it used to meet on occasions of importance in the old temple of Mitranandapuram about a couple of furlongs to the west of the shrine of Sri Padmanabha. The south-western corner of the court- yard of the temple is still pointed out as the sacred spot where the Sabha used to meet of old, and the word "Tek" or south, in one inscri- ption gives no dubious guide to the spot. The raised floor of this hall still remains . 6S It has already been pointed out that earth was called 'Sarpa-rajii', meaning queen of serpents. Kadrf or earth94 was the mother of ser- pents; hence serpents are also called Kadraveya. When the earth mother took away her daughter Sita to her home in the underworld (rasa-tala), her throne was borne aloft by serpents (VII.97.19). Rasa-tala is also called naga-loka, or the region inhabited by the serpents.95 It was a primitive belief that serpents are immortal due to their power of shedd- ing their old skins.96 Hence, serpents were identified with women due to their power of rejuvenating themselves through menstruation. Bana narrates in his Kadambari that queen Vilasavati, in order to overcome her childlessness, used to take dips into ponds dedicated to serpent goddesses (Prasiddhesu naga-kulahradesu mamajja). The author knows of such a pond near Sakri in Dhulia district, Maharashtra, and it is known as Naga-ai or Cobramother. Due to the identification of serpents with earth, Grhya-suitras ordain that a sacrifice should be offered to the serpents in the month of Sravana (July-August).97 Paraskara directs that Varuna and his royal kinsmen should be invoked in this Sravana sacrifice. Vidhura Jataka says that Varuna was the king of serpents.9 8 This denotes that Varuna was either the divine consort or son of the earth goddess. Hence, the Sravana sacri- 52</page><page sequence="23">EARTH MOTHER fice, instead of being just a ritual of safeguarding oneself from serpents, was intended to secure abundant harvest. The Sita sacrifice which immedi- ately follows it, bears out this contention. It is only in this context that the significance of the serpent-grove in the south-west corner of the Taravad-clan premises of the Nayars can be understood. The construction and outward appearance of a Taravad house exhibit several interesting details. The ground on which it is built should be slightly inclined towards the cast. It is confined by a square border- line and divided into four equal parts. The north-eastern and south- western parts of the ground are used for different buildings, the south- eastern corner for the cemetery. In the centre of the south-wesiern corner, the small wood comprising the serpent grove, so important in Nayar religious life, is situated .. .9 Such a sacred grove is called Nagattan Kavu, and women in their monthly courses are forbidden to approach it.' ? The apparent reason underlying the sanctity of this direction seems to be that it brought the life-giving rains. 'Their (monsoons') days of birth, namely, Tiruvatira(the sixth asterism) in Mithunam (June-July) of Cheran, Asvati (the 16th luniar asterism, Arcturus) in Tulam (October-November) of Cholan, Mulam (the 19th constellation) in Kumbham (February- March) of Pandian are worthy of remembrance. For, on these auspicious days commence the monsoons, namely, the South-Wcst monsoon in Malabar, the North- East monsoon or Tula Varsham in the kingdom of Chola and the rainy season in the kingdom of Pandya . 101 The two cities of the great pre-Aryan civilization, Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, were situated on the banks of the rivers Ravi and Sindhu respectively. The harvests, raised on the silts deposited by these rivers every year, generated and sustained this civilization. The general direc- tion in which Sindhu flows after entering the Punjab right upto its union with the Arabian Sea, is south-westerly. According to Siddhcshvarshastri Chitrav, Nirrti was also known as Tri-yuta. That this interpretation is not arbitrary is proved by the Rg- veda itself. Rk VIII.24.24 says that Indra is the k-nower of Nirrtis (vettha hi Nirrtinam). It means that Nirrti was conceived in the plural. Rk X. 116.2 provides the conclusive evidence: "The priests heard far away, as they are ordered, serve the three Nirrtis, for well they know them. Sages have traced the cause that first produced them, dwelling in distant and mysterious chambers." Rg-veda contains in all ten Apri hymns (1. 13, 142, 188; II. 3; III.4, V.5; VII.2; IX.5; X.70, 110). Before slaughtering a sacrificial animal, Apri mantras were recited and fire carried round it.'08 Apri deities are eleven, and they are: (1) blazing fire (Suprasiddha Agni), (2) fire residing in the two fire-producing wooden sticks (Tanunapat or 53</page><page sequence="24">SOCIAL SCIENTIST Naarsmrsa Agni); (3) invoked fire (Ila Agni), (4) darbha grass (Barhi), (5) door of the sacrificial hall, (6) dawn and night (Usasa-Nakta), (7) two divine hotr priests, (8) three goddesses (tisro devyah), (9) Tvastr, (10) sacrificial post (Vanspati) and (11) Svaha (hail). 04 According to commentators the three goddesses are: (1) Saras-vati (river), (2) Ila (earth or food), and (3) Bharati (Vak or speech), 05 from which it can be deduced that the goddess-triad originally was non- Aryan.' 0 Vedic-Index?07 states, "In the Apri hymns occurs a goddess Bharati, the personified divine protective power of the Bharatas." Nighantu gives two synonyms of Vak: (1) Bharati (1-11-16), and (2) gana (tribe) (1.11.38). Rk IX.97.34 invokes Vak also as three Vaks (tisro Vacah). The Raja-siya sacrifice commences with oblations to Nirrti. Keith explains the three mantras of Taittiriya Samhita: "The three mantras are a part of the offering to Nirrti; with the first an offering is made in the Garhapatya to appease Rudra; then by the south the sacri- ficer goes, taking an ember from the fire, to where there is a natural cleft (irina) and deposits his ember there and makes an offering with the second Mantra."' 08 The ritual makes it clear that the three Ambas or mothers of Trvambaka Rudra were none other than Nirrti herself. In the horse sacri- fice the three Ambas, namely Amba, Ambika and Ambalikia, 9 'mime' coition with the slaughtered horse who is addressed by them as 'gana- pati,' meaning lord of the tribe. From this it becomes evident that Nirrti was the triune mother of the tribe. The three characteristics of Nirrti are explained by the 'tisro devih.' Nirrti was 1) Sarasvati, or river goddess, 2) Ila, or earth mother, and 3) Bharati, or tribal mother. The triune mother phenomenon is not peculiar to India. The ancient Greeks had a similar mother triad in the Moirai. The Delphic oracle was, in fact, like all other Greek oracles, a mantic shrine of the Mother Goddesses, in their threefold fatidic aspect and of the Divine Son. Aeschylus tells us that Apollo inherited the oracle from Gaia, Themis, and Phibe. Those are but names for the triune Great Goddess in her three aspects, earthly, fatidic and heavenly. The Moirai had a chapel in the Delphic shrine. The Delphic deities were more usually referred to simply as 'The Three'."0 Al-Uzza, the great goddess of the ancient Arabs, was also three- fold. The Great Goddess was threefold, being at the same time one and three. 'The three Holy Virgins', Al-Ilat, Al-Uzza, and Manat. Al- Uzza is merely a cult epithet, meaning the 'Powerful One'; Al-Ilat is the feminine form of Ilu, or Allah, and may be rendered 'The Goddess.' Manat, which is the feminine form of Mani, stood parti- 54</page><page sequence="25">EARTH MOTHER cularly for the conception of fate or destiny. The word 'mana' is still commonly used by the Arabs in the sense of 'luck'. The threefold Arabian Goddess thus corresponds in character to the Greek Moirai, the Fates, and the Nardic Nornes.11 Thomson discloses the economic and social functions of these triune goddesses: The Moirai originated as impersonations of ancestral custom, as symbols of the economic and social functions of primitive communism -the sharing of game, the sharing of booty, the sharing of land, the sharing of labour between the clans; that is to say, they grew out of the neolithic mother-goddesses, who, emanating from the female elders of the matriarchal clan, symbolized the collective authority of countless generations of ancestresses who had held undisputed sway over the lives of men since they had lived in clans. Aeschylus rem- embered that in the beginning of the world the Moirai had been supreme.1" Rk X. 114.3 gives more information about Nirrti Catus-kaparda yuvatih supesah ghrta-pratika vayunirh vaste Tasyram suparna vrsanani sedatuh yatra devah dadhire bhaga- dhevam. [The youthful one, well-shaped, with four locks braided, bright- ened with oil, puts on the ordinances, Two birds of mighty power are seated near her, there where the Deities receive their portion.]l'8 Rk X. 114.8 identifies Nirrti with Vak. The function of the tribal mother Nirrti was to apportion the tribal wealth equally among the tribal members. An Indus stamp seal depicts the scene of a sacrifice. A naked goddess; wearing three-horned crown stands in an asvattha (ficus religiosa) tree, and priests wearing bird-masks are worshipping her.114 The plant hvmn says that the ficus religiosa tree is the home of the plants (asvatthe vo nisadam)l5 The sacred tree of Varuna, the des- cendant of Nirrti, was according to Rk 1.24.7, ficus religiosa.16. The three characteristics of Nirrti, overlordship of water, earth and tribe, in course of time were transformed into three gunas. For Nirukta (X. 23) commenting on Rk X. 121.1, declares that when a woman receives the life-germs (gunah) and her own life-germs (gunllh) are brought into contact with them. fertilization takes place."'7 Water is white so is the guna called satva; earth is black, so is the guna tamas; overlordship of tribe is red, and so is rajas. With these three gunas, Nirrti, transformed into the Sankh)ya Prakrti, propagates the world by promiscuous copula- tion with innumerable Purusas: With the one unborn female, red, white, and black, NVho produces many creatures like herself,</page><page sequence="26">SOCIAL SCIENTIST There lies the unborn male taking his delight.
