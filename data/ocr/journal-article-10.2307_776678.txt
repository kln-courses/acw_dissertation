<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Quest for Unity: American Art between World's Fairs 1876-93 In his essay published in the 1889 anthology American Art and American Art Collec- tions, art critic S.G.W. Benjamin observed, "American art at present is largely based on the imitation of other art-not only of past ages but of contemporary art in other countries." Choosing to view the situation in a positive light, he added that this was no cause for discouragement: "Every nation has to pass through its imitative period ... American art will soon attain the strength and courage to assert its powers in a vigorous manhood." All unwittingly, the first part of Benjamin's assessment foreshadowed the views held until quite recently by many scholars in the twentieth century. Because late-nineteenth-century American art was perceived as eclectic and unoriginal, its terrain remained largely un- explored. Whether Gilded Age or Brown Decades, it seemed a desert of genteel circumlocution and derivative tastes, hap- pily forgotten. It was a barren place lan- guishing in the long shadows cast by sev- eral mighty peaks: Winslow Homer, Thomas Eakins, Albert Pinkham Ryder, James McNeill Whistler. Then, the desert began to bloom with the appearance of exhibition catalogues such as Wanda Corn's The Color ofMood: American Tonalism 1880-1910 (1973), Peter Bermingham's American Art in the Barbizon Mood (1975), Michael Quick's American Expatriate Painters of the Late Nineteenth Century (1976), The Brooklyn Museum's American Renaissance 1876- 1917 (1979), and several new evaluations of American Impressionism, most notably William Gerdts's American Impressionism (1980). While the mountains have not been one inch diminished by these goings-on at their feet, the landscape as a whole has become increasingly more complex and interesting as scholars have continued to investigate, analyze, and redefine it. The Quest for Unity: American Art be- tween World's Fairs 1876-93, at the De- troit Institute of Arts (August 24-October 30, 1983), was the latest offering in this burgeoning field of revisionist and even resurrectionist studies seeking to develop a definitive, synthetic conception of late- nineteenth-century American aesthetics and culture. The exhibition dealt squarely -and fairly-with the issues posed by Benjamin a century ago: America's cultural growing pains and its search for artistic identity. The organizational goal of this exhibition was to assemble works that had actually been displayed at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition or the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and, if a particular piece proved unavailable, to substitute a similar work. Since at the 1893 Fair the American art section comprised a great many works created over the previous decade, the focus of the Detroit show was the 1880s. As David Huntington argued in his catalogue essay, this was a pivotal period that encompassed a most significant aesthetic reorientation: from romantic, provincial, and nationalistic perspectives to international and cosmopolitan attitudes. The alpha and omega of the exhibition precisely telescoped critical aspects of this transformation. The first painting to con- front the viewer beyond the Corinthian- columned entryway was Frederick E. Church's vast, red, volcanic panorama Cotopaxi (1862, Detroit Institute of Arts), a sublime vision of nature, microscopically described and loaded with religious allu- sion. The quiet coda, many galleries later, was The Seasons Triptych by Thomas W. Dewing and Dwight W. Tryon (1893, Detroit Institute of Arts). Decorative ab- stractions in cool, blurred greens and mauves, these paintings whispered of a poetic, intimate, and subjective view of nature. The path between alpha and omega was anything but straight. Despite its tight chronological limits, the Quest for Unity presented a more comprehensive and di- verse array of American arts than any of its predecessors. Expatriates, nativists, Tonal- ists, Impressionists, Realists, aesthetes, and Renaissance men appeared together in thoughtfully arranged sequences that con- vincingly charted the evolutionary currents of American art in a period that was simul- taneously the cultural climax of the nine- teenth century and the threshold to the twentieth. David Huntington's essay provided a core of aesthetic and conceptual nodes around which clustered loose and often overlapping constellations of artists. The art of the Centennial, he wrote, represented the disintegrating ends of a once-unified antebellum culture. Dominated by the primacy of subject matter, it was symbolic, narrative, literal, realistic, emotional, 74 Art Journal</page><page sequence="2">Zii~~i~i~iPsii~ii~ini~~i~ii~iiiiiiiii iii iiiiiiiiii .......~~ OM..........

The transformations in American art be- tween the Fairs were fueled by the need to replace these moribund Hebraic, or Puri- tan, cultural constructs by aesthetic ideas in harmony with new, secularized cultural conditions. The latter were strongly molded by Matthew Arnold's blithe, cosmopolitan Hellenism and irrevocably affected by the uncertain, fluctuating shape of the Dar- winian universe. Using Whistler's paint- ing as a paradigm of these crucial changes, Huntington showed that the aesthetic con- cerns of the 1880s focused on sensuous delight in beauty for its own sake. Accord- ingly, technical and formal considerations came to the fore as artists engaged more and more in the creation of self-sufficient visual harmonies. Trained in Munich and Paris, the cosmopolitan "new men" of the late 1870s enlisted the best and "fittest forms" of culture past and present, East and West, classical and exotic, in order to forge a new synthesis catering to the cul- tural requirements of modern America. Although the goal of many late-nineteenth- century tastemakers was to achieve a finely tuned fusion of aestheticism and secular- ism, this was still tempered by a Puritan- Hebraic insistence that art should assume responsibility for the redemption and ele- vation of the collective national soul. The issue of beauty, Huntington wrote, was compounded by the problem of nature itself. If nature was no longer fixed and God-centered, and if art was no longer to be a direct extension of nature, post-Darwin artists and designers must devise valid so- lutions to the problem of rationalizing and "translating nature's processes and forms into art." Their grapplings with this prob- lem produced several alternative ap- proaches. Positivism (definitively formu- lated by Hippolyte Taine) underlay the vision of many late-nineteenth-century realists. Numerous others, the better to see nature through their temperaments, assim- ilated and adapted technical aspects of French Impressionism. Finally, the Tonal- ists sought to discover in nature ethereal correspondences with their own inner, spiritual states. The exhibition itself paralleled and exemplified the intellectual and aesthetic premises of Huntington's essay. After the relatively small section of Art at the Cen- tennial came the galleries of Aestheticism, comprising the subdivisions Greece and Japan, Exotic Cultures, The Renaissance and Baroque Traditions, and the Colonial Revival. The last series of rooms presented aspects of the Rationalization of Nature in three clusters: the Impact of Darwin, the Abstraction of Landscape, and Tonalism. Painting, sculpture, and decorative arts were grouped in close proximity through- out. Each of the three major divisions was keyed to a distinctive, evocative back- ground color: dark billiard-table green for the first; delicate peachy pink for the se- cond; and light, clear yellow for the third. Although the range of themes and moods was quite wide, the paintings and other objects representing American art at the Centennial (with the exception of works by painters such as Winslow Homer and John LaFarge) generally submitted to the rule of narrative, slick realism, and senti- ment. Hung directly opposite each other, two paintings in particular epitomized the dominant taste: Tobias Rosenthal's lugu- brious, theatrical Elaine (Fig. 1) and East- man Johnson's The Old Stage Coach (1871, Milwaukee Art Museum), a carefully composed genre scene of play-acting rural children. Telling a pathetic story in stone was Randolph Rogers's very popular Nydia (1856, Detroit Institute of Arts), a depiction of the doomed blind girl of Edward Bulwer- Lytton's midcentury best seller, The Last Days of Pompeii. The pervasive tendency to make the sum of the parts greater than the whole was exemplified by objects such as Pottier and Stymus's overwhelmingly tall, crushingly elaborate Renaissance- Jacobean Cabinet (1876, Collection, Joe Bianca), and Reed and Barton's silver Progress Vase (1876, Reed and Barton Silversmiths), with its allegorical groups of savage Indians and civilized moderns. Paintings, sculpture, and objects were superbly well made but loaded down with representational, literary content. It should be noted, however, that the Centennial section of the Detroit exhibition labored under the disadvantage of serving as foil to the newer art ideas featured and celebrated in the subsequent galleries. Seen in that dialectical context, the art of 1876 shone but dimly. As the catalogue noted, the Centennial displays of Japanese and British decorative arts had an almost instantaneous impact on the aestheticizing of America. In Detroit these influences were most apparent in art glass and pottery. It was the spirit of Whistler, however, that presided over paintings in the pink rooms of Aestheti- cism, especially the Greece and Japan suite.

Tate Gallery) and the small oil sketch Tanagra (c.1869, Lynchburg, Va., Ran- dolph-Macon Woman's College Art Gal- lery) represented the American expatriate's elegant synthesis of Greek grace, Japanese compositional dynamics, and Velhzquez's cool, nuanced palette, without a trace of narrative "claptrap," as Whistler would put it. Whistler's works set the keynote for similar syntheses by T.W. Dewing, John White Alexander, H. Siddons Mowbray, Francis David Millet, Edwin Austin Ab- bey, and others. One motif in particular fascinated these artists: the long, low neo- Classical bench occupied by beautiful women making music, listening to stories, or simply reposing in graceful attitudes. Most of these compositions reflected the sensibility that prompted Abbey to choose the subject of his Fiammetta's Song (1894, Collection, Thomas E. Morgan): "The thoughtless life of cultivated people within beautiful surroundings . . . seemed to me to adopt itself particularly to decorative purposes." It was, indeed, the more "thoughtless" paintings-that is, those intended to be visual harmonies and noth- ing more-that were the strongest in the Greco-Japanese suite. Alexander's Panel for Music Room (Fig. 2) with its large, simplified figures, its long, rippling curves, and its muted tones (ashes of roses, ashes of green, orange, and yellow) provided a rewarding visual experience. On the other hand, Frederick Stuart Church's Knowl- edge is Power (1889, Grand Rapids Public Library), featuring another neo-Classical bench with its beautiful young woman, stumbled over its own obtrusive and some- what cloying mind-over-matter symbolism: in academic garb, the girl serenely lectured to a group of well-behaved tigers. Never- theless, for the most part the Greece and Japan suite was one of the most coherent ensembles in the exhibition. This was only fitting, since its tutelary genius Whistler was famous and occasionally even notori- ous for his insistence that interiors, from paintings to bibelots, should be exquisitely unified. The sculpture, which included Augustus Saint-Gaudens's Amor Caritas (1887-98/99, Cornish, N.H., Saint- Gaudens National Historic Site, National Park Service), and the decorative objects, such as the ravishing Wild Rose Pitcher by the New England Glass Works (c. 1886/ 88, The Coming Museum of Glass), shared with the paintings the aesthetic interest in long lines, grace of proportion, and lovely surfaces. In the Exotic Cultures gallery the domi- nant tendency was towards an eclectic bor- rowing of superficial appearances rather than the application of design principles. Artists translated the opulence and luxury of the Near and Middle East into forms fit to embellish the splendid houses of Ameri- ca's nouveaux riches, as, for example, Louis Comfort Tiffany's gorgeous, glitter- ing Peacock Mosaic (1890-92, Ann Arbor, University of Michigan, School of Art), designed for sugar millionaire H.O. Have- meyer's Fifth Avenue mansion. Frederick Bridgman's painting The Favorite (1882, Collection, Mr. and Mrs. Richard Ana- walt), depicting in sumptuous detail a hookah-smoking harem beauty, exempli- fied the costume-party Orientalism that characterized many of the works in this gallery. By the time one arrived at the galleries of the Renaissance-Baroque Tradition, which comprised portraits, religious, and ideal works, it had become ever more apparent that in the 1880s the American cultural appetite was little short of vora- cious, and very nearly omniverous as well. The portrait field was led by John Singer Sargent, William Merritt Chase, and, again, Whistler. The close proximity of their works in one room afforded a fasci- nating opportunity to compare the exuber- antly physical, aristocratic bodies of the first two with the diaphanous, aristocratic souls of the last. Echoes of Whistler's much-admired portrait of his mother rever- berated through portraits by Cecilia Beaux and Irving Wiles, and Renaissance classi- cism gave an underlying geometry to paintings as different in style as George de Forest Brush's shadowy Mother and Child (1892, Andover, Mass., Addison Gallery of American Art) and Mary Cassatt's The Child's Caress (1891, Honolulu Academy of Arts). A corner display featuring a frag- ment of George B. Post's Renaissance door grille from Cornelius Vanderbilt II's house (c. 1879-81-92, Washington, D.C., National Museum of American History) and an armchair designed by Richard Mor- ris Hunt (1878, Chateau-sur-Mer, The Preservation Society of Newport County) suggestively enhanced the prevalent aura 76 Art Journal</page><page sequence="4">of expensive, pedigreed taste sought and bought by America's moneyed elite in the late nineteenth century. Whether of saints or nudes, the religious and ideal paintings eloquently expressed the problem of subject matter in the 1880s: how to refill with life and meaning the shells of devitalized traditions. In many works the real warred with the ideal, as in Frank Vincent Du Mond's Christ and the Fishermen (1891, Collection, Stephen V. Delange and N. Robert Cestone), where the extremely naturalistic figures of the men were uneasily pitted against lavender- white, impressionistic mist and a wispy, spectral Jesus. Kenyon Cox's The Hunting Nymph (1896, New York, The Lotos Club)--despite her mythological guise-- persistently reminded one of a strapping, nude Gibson Girl. Less compromising was Saint-Gaudens's bronze Head from the Adams Memorial (1891, New York, The American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters), solemn, self-contained, and mysterious. The Aestheticism survey ended with a brief glimpse of the Colonial Revival, that phase of American cultural history in which the nation's own past was resurrected to serve a need for symbols of tradition and homogeneity in an increasingly fragmented present. Here again was considerable di- versity. Historicizing subject matter alone united F.D. Millet's and George Henry Boughton's light-filled, delicate period pieces with Eakins's dark, brooding paint- ing The Courtship (c. 1878, The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco). Quite sur- prising was Sidney Burleigh's rough-hewn, macabre armchair, its back carved to resemble the slab of a Colonial gravestone and decorated with mourning-picture motifs. In the final section, the Rationalization of Nature, the quest for unity became ever more polarized. While painters like Daniel Ridgway Knight took an escapist route by celebrating, in the manner of Jules Breton, the timeless European peasant, Thomas Eakins applied his ultrascientific realism to produce the huge, modern medical por- trait The Agnew Clinic (1889, Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania). Similarly, enameled finesse versus elemental force defined the contrast between George de Forest Brush's Ger&amp;me-like The Sculptor and the King (Fig. 3) and Winslow Homer's The Gale (Fig. 4), which em- bodied the essence of this painter's cold, deterministic, yet heroic universe. Still in the same room, the Renaissance bronze reappeared in the guise of the American Indian and, more captivatingly, as the small but vigorous The Baseball Player/ Our National Game by Douglas Tilden (1890-91, Kenneybunk, Maine, Richard Oliver Antiques). The Abstraction of Landscape gallery included skillful Impressionist composi- tions by Theodore Robinson and Childe Hassam and the decorative simplifications of Arthur Wesley Dow. The most egre- giously conspicuous consumption was exalted in Julius Stewart's On the Yacht "Namouna" off Venetian Waters, 1890 (1890, Hartford, Conn., Wadsworth Athenaeum), in which ajaponiste diagonal and blond plein- air values lent a chic gloss to academic realism. Most beautifully harmonized was the final gallery, devoted to various strains of Tonalism and demonstrating that since Corn's 1973 study this aesthetic category has been thoroughly absorbed into the American art historical mainstream. The key works were two Whistler nocturnes, one the famous Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket (c. 1875, Detroit Institute of Arts), and a landscape by George Inness, The Millpond (1889, The Art Institute of Chicago), hauntingly in- tense in its dense, mystical clouds of rus- sett, emerald, and cobalt blue. From there, one could proceed to contemplate the emotionally handled, grayed landscapes of Homer Martin and Alexander Wyant, and the distilled nature poetry in the nuanced, mauve and celadon-green deli- cacies of Charles Davis, Dwight Tryon, Thomas Dewing, and John Twachtman. Although there was nothing tonal or ethereal about the furniture and architec- tural motifs by Frank Furness, Louis Sul- livan, and Frank Lloyd Wright, they evinced parallel interests in the abstraction and rationalization of natural forms. In the preface to the catalogue, Research Associate Kathleen Pyne argued that pre- viously "shunned aspects" of the period should not be discounted as aberrations but were, rather, "essential links" in American cultural history. It was this very refusal to operate selectively that yielded the fresh- ness of this exhibition. The sprawling, immensely variegated display of American arts validated S.G.W. Benjamin's previ- ously cited assessment: it revealed them passing through an imitative period yet sounded many clear notes of powerful in- dividuality and authoritative synthesis. Indeed, the setting of American art in its evolutionary context was one of the strengths of the show. In this light, if some of the works failed to act upon late-twen- tieth-century sensibilities, then they could at least be tolerated and understood as aesthetic dinosaurs, obviously well equipped to compete successfully during their own epoch, even though they were ultimately not among the fittest. The Quest for Unity clearly revealed how both major and minor figures interacted with the com- plex aesthetic forces of the time. Not only were neglected aspects given their due, but, equally important, solidly famous figures like Eakins were seen to be touched at many points by the same concerns that engrossed their contemporaries. At the same time, however, the exhibition con- firmed the judgment of history on the perennial strength and originality of Whistler, Homer, Eakins, Sargent, and a few others recently rising in esteem, such as Saint-Gaudens and Dewing. Huntington's essay provided an emi- nently functional scaffolding of ideas. In its very breadth and fluidity, his synthetic conception served to embrace and lend credible order to the seemingly dense and fragmented tendencies of the period. (There remained, to be sure, some scope for debate about who should be included in which category, and the evident problem of over- laps must have made the arrangement a formidable task.) The thesis that the 1880s encompassed a fundamental aesthetic re- orientation was also extensively supported by the actual pieces, especially in such aspects as the near-universal fascination with technique and formal values. Hun- tington's proposals have contributed solid new structural components to the contin- uing art historical refabrication of an end- lessly Protean period. Along with the Brooklyn Museum's American Renais- sance catalogue, which advanced a socio- cultural interpretation of the same period, The Quest for Unity should be essential reading for scholars of late-nineteenth- century American art. The catalogue itself is large and handsome, with twenty tipped- in color plates of superb quality and black- and-white illustrations of every piece. The individual entries include very complete biographies and scholarly, informative comments on each object. The bibliogra- phy is extremely thorough and up-to-date. Inevitably, this exhibition prompted ruminations on the directions and quality of American painting, sculpture, and decorative arts in the late nineteenth cen- tury. Like Chicago's 1893 White City, a preponderance of works in The Quest for Unity aimed to create reality-denying fagades, rendered with consummate skill, knowledge, and taste, and communicating sentiments that now have a hollow sound. The picture of American civilization sug- gested here was a highly exclusive one. Luxury objects, grand-manner portraits, and scenes of neo-Classical or natural never-never lands all evoked the idea of a high-priced aesthetic sanctuary, firmly barricaded against the unaesthetic, incom- prehensible circumstances of American society in the 1880s. Surviving on bor- rowed time, the tastemakers and culture- shapers of this era resolutely defended their ideals against modern barbarism and vul- garity, against a mass culture fed by the popular press, against mechanization, against the alien hordes swarming hopefully towards the beacon raised by the very new Statue of Liberty. The hope was, of course, that by upholding high, pure cultural standards, all of society ultimately would be lifted to an ideal level of order, con- Spring 1984 77</page><page sequence="5">formity, and decorum. This was not to be, although to note this failure is by no means to denigrate the many genuine aesthetic attainments of art in The Quest for Unity. It is true, after all, that, like the Holy Grail, unity-with all its implications-was an elusive and ever more illusory ideal in the late nineteenth century. Although no absolute unity was found, the quest itself generated many an aesthetic adventure, and this alone makes the art of the time amply worth studying. The fact that art historians are now still very much engaged in examining the period suggests, finally, that the quest for retro- spective unity continues to produce sig- nificant and stimulating new analyses and interpretations of a vital, many-faceted, and discordant era.
