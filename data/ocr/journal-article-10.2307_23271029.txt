ISBN: 978-0-292-72312-2. doi: 10.1017/s0009840x12001424 This splendid book is the first in a series of volumes on ancient Chersonesus, a city located at the south-western tip of the Crimea next to modern Sevastopol, famous among English speakers as the Sebastopol of the Crimean War, which has left its marks on this site and other locations around the region. The ancient city has not been engulfed by modern development, so that over the last two centuries substantial excavation has been possible both in its urban core and in its extensive territory, remarkable for its pronounced centuriation. However, a major feature of the site is the key Byzantine cathedral of St Vladimir, now restored, which occupies its acropolis and (together with other Byzantine and Roman remains) renders impossible the full excavation of the city. This book publishes one of the most exciting complexes that has been excavated there, at the so-called Tower of Zeno. Here was re-used a substantial group of painted grave stelae, in remarkably good condition with colours still bright. Originally these stelae had been set up in a necropolis dateable to the later fourth and early third centuries B.C., whence they were taken together under circumstances which remain obscure in any detail, but apparently with some care (they were cut into sections for ease of handling) and with the purpose of using them in the extension of the city's fortifications in the harbour area to the southeast. There they were excavated in the early 1960s by Strzheletskiy and Danilenko and meticulously recorded. Now, for the first time (despite some partial publications), they have received the sustained attention and the quality of publication which they deserve, contributing importantly not only to our understanding of the society of ancient Chersonesus but also to our understanding of Greek painting and, more broadly still, of cultural developments in the Black Sea region. These stelae offer us a remarkable vision of the colours that decorated the Greek world, which so often seems so monochrome. Joseph Coleman Carter opens the book with an evocative preface, describing the 'excavation' of extensive archaeological deposits at the site where most of the stelae The Classical Review vol. 62 no. 2 Â© The Classical Association 2012; all rights reserved</page><page sequence="2">640 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW had been preserved. This was pioneering work at a location closed to foreigners for many decades, important in itself and also part of Carter's development of the well-known US-Ukrainian collaboration in Chersonesus. From 2001 Carter and his colleagues placed the materials in the hands of P., who now follows his stunning monograph on polychrome grave stelae from Attica with a scholarly and beautiful study of their counterparts from Chersonesus. The book provides, first, a very full description and classification of the stelae themselves, together with other stones accompanying them; painted 'sarcophagi' and other elements will be the subject of a second volume. This catalogue lays the basis for the material and socio-historical analysis which follows: stelae are listed according to findspot inside or outside Zeno's Tower. Each is given its own page and illustrated by at least one colour photograph and a detailed description. At times it would have been desirable to have drawings here of elements which are not visible otherwise, as for example of the medical instruments and gestures barely preserved on nos 52-3. It would have been desirable also to have the Greek inscriptions set out where these are not to be seen in the photographs, for which a variable scale might have been helpful at times, though images later in the volume sometimes meet that need. The catalogue is followed by a full Shape and Object Analysis, which brings out in particular the absence of the kind of 'family solidarity' on these stelae that is usual in their Attic counterparts. Of particular importance among other local tendencies is the use of anthropomorphic stones in association with the stelae: these and other such stones are catalogued and discussed in detail later in the volume. A chapter on Painting demands inclusion in any study of Greek art. Next, the stelae found inside the Tower are treated together, predominantly the products of two workshops, followed by those from outside, which are significantly more heterogeneous, and issues of dating. Next, a full discussion of the necropolis whence the stelae came. Chapter 10 compares these stelae with counterparts around the Greek world, with special emphasis on the Black Sea region, concluding that they share more with Attic funerary art than first glance might suggest. Finally, Chapter 11 offers interesting information about the history of the city (in the light of its funerary art in particular), though the retention of a foundation date around 422 is idiosyncratic in view of the scholarship of the last decade and more, which suggests a Greek presence at least half a century earlier: Herodotus' omission of the city, as of others, does not mean that it did not exist. Most interesting for our understanding of ancient Chersonesus is the development of a local practice of marking burials with an assemblage of stones which seems to amalgamate Greek practice (stelae) and something which looks to be more local in origin (anthropomorphic images). The funerary practices of the community thus seem to indicate the kind of cultural osmosis represented also by the city's appropriation (at least in its own view of the matter) of the goddess Parthenos from the local population.1 This volume sets a very high standard for the rest of the series, which shows how much international collaboration can achieve in the archaeology of the Black Sea, not only through new excavation and survey but also by examining the work 'See further D.
