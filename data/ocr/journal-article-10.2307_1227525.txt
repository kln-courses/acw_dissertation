<plain_text><page sequence="1">On the Morality of War: A Preliminary Inquiry* Richard Wasserstromt Americans-at least those who are not pacifists-have had the good for- tune of not having had to worry very much until recently about the subject of the morality of war. Although the United States was involved in several major wars in this century, and although these wars were not by any means free of problems of morality, still the morality of the cause and the immo- rality of the opponents encouraged Americans to accept quite complacently the rightness of American behavior. Two things changed all of this. Atomic and hydrogen bombs increased the stakes of war enormously; the destruc- tion of mankind is a consequence different in kind, not degree. And the Vietnam war, although commendable for little else, did succeed in making relevant and meaningful to all reflective persons the question of by what criteria wars are really to be assessed. For myself, at least, it is the present war that has led me to consider and to attempt to unravel what I have found to be extraordinarily difficult issues relating to the morality of war. Yet, while the war in Vietnam is the occasion for this inquiry, it is not the subject of the inquiry. I have purposely, to the extent to which it is pos- sible to do so, tried to exclude that war and my views about it from consid- eration. I have instead endeavored to identify a number of the issues that are raised by a discussion of any war, and to analyze and assess a number of the problems that intrude upon any rational consideration of the topic. The major focus is upon several arguments concerning the morality of war, chiefly the argument that any war is immoral if it involves the intentional killing of innocent persons, and the argument that any war is immoral be- cause it involves the use of deadly force. But this Article is also concerned, in a quite general way, with elucidating and evaluating several of the dif- ferent perspectives from which war can be morally assessed. In preparation for those discussions it deals with some preliminary but significant prob- lems of definition and analysis. A number of problems have been omitted, including some that are par- ticularly acute today in the United States: those that relate to the obliga- * An earlier version of one portion of this Article was read at the Eastern Division meeting of the American Philosophical Association in December I968 and was published under the title "Three Argu- ments Concerning the Morality of War," in 65 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY 578 (I968).

Thus, this inquiry is not directed to a consideration of the duty, if any, to resist an immoral war or to the right to be free of certain obligations to one's country, even in time of war. Nor, to take a related issue, is it addressed directly to the lia- bilities and duties of those engaged in war-the duty, if any, to refrain from committing certain acts, even in time of war and even if ordered to do them. These are large and important issues. They are not taken up only because the matters that are discussed require considerable analysis and are in some respects at least preliminary to them. The issues dealt with are numerous, complicated, and, most significantly, relatively unattended to by philosophers. The subject of war has, in fact, quite clearly been slighted in two respects-war has not been the subject of extensive, serious, and critical inquiry within the academy, and such in- quiry as has been undertaken has not benefited from the kinds of clarify- ing and critical examination-the narrowing of issues and the defining of terms-that are the peculiar province of the philosopher. There are at least two important areas in which the consequences of philosophical abstention are readily observable. Consider first the discussions and arguments that typically take place today concerning the morality of war. Someone will insist that all war is immoral; another that it is immoral or unjust for us to be fighting in Viet- nam; still a third that there is nothing immoral about war, as long as it is not a war of aggression. It is not clear, however, that these claims are suffi- ciently unambiguous to be dealt with sensibly. They may even be consist- ent. They must be broken down into several more specific claims before truly informed discussion can proceed. There are, I think, at least three sets of questions that deserve to be dis- tinguished and kept straight in discussions of the morality of war, even though they often are not. The first relates to the behavior of countries as opposed to persons. When we talk about the morality of war we sometimes appear to be assessing the intentions and behavior of persons and sometimes the intentions and conduct of countries. But are countries assessable on moral grounds in the same way and for the same reasons that persons are? The second concerns the rightness or wrongness of an action when con- trasted with the praise or blame attendant upon it. Someone can do the wrong thing, and nonetheless be free of blame. When we talk about the morality of war, are the relevant categories those of rightness-wrongness or those of praiseworthiness-blameworthiness, or both? The third involves the differences between particular acts, particular wars, and war as an institu- tion. We can evaluate the morality of individual actions leading up to or</page><page sequence="3">June I969] THE MORALITY OF WAR I629 taking place within a war;' we can evaluate the morality of a particular war; and we can assess the morality of war as a human phenomenon. Al- though the symmetry is, perhaps, imperfect, the differences seem no less significant than those between an individual law, a particular legal system, and the idea of a legal system. A more serious omission relates to the most typical of all philosophical issues-that of definition. There is a lot of talk about war, but what do we mean when we say of something that it is a war? It is neither idle philo- sophical curiosity nor ingrained philosophical habit that requires that some attention be given at the beginning to analytical considerations. Rather, it is important that analysis be undertaken here, as elsewhere, because a great deal can turn on what the subject under investigation is taken to be. It is not simply that we need common agreement as to the nature of the subject under investigation-although that is an important enough goal. It is, in- stead, that we must make certain that we do not surreptitiously, and hence uncritically, resolve important substantive issues via the definitional route. The danger of defining away important problems is illustrated first with one example not connected with war, and then with several taken from the literature on war. The non-war-related example comes from a quite well-known article by the philosopher Anthony Quinton entitled, "On Punishment."2 In his piece Quinton deals with one of the issues that has floated through the philosophical literature on punishment for quite some time: the so-called problem of the punishment of the innocent. Without going into any unnecessary details, the problem is this. It is thought by some to count as a decisive objection to utilitarianism that it would permit, if not require, the punishment of persons known to be innocent if the conse- quences of punishing them proved to be more desirable than those of any alternative course of conduct. For my purposes it is not important to try to assess the merits of this particular philosophical claim. What is of interest is the way Quinton deals with it. He says this: For the necessity of not punishing the innocent is not moral but logical. It is not, as some retributivists think, that we may not punish the innocent and ought only to punish the guilty, but that we cannot punish the innocent and must only punish the guilty. Of course, the suffering or harm in which punishment consists can be I. Actually, the issues are a good deal more complex than this. Consider, for example, the different things that might count as individual actions: (a) the action of an individual occurring at a particular time and place (for instance, an ordinary foot soldier shooting and killing an unarmed prisoner al- though he has not been ordered to do so); (b) the action of an individual who orders others to do something (for instance, a battalion commander orders his men to shoot and kill the prisoners they have taken); (c) the action of a group of persons acting collectively (for instance, a bomber squadron dropping incendiary bombs in a particular raid on a particular city); and (d) various kinds of con- tinuing actions by persons or groups (such as commanding a particular campaign or fighting a par- ticular campaign). 2.

I956).</page><page sequence="4">I630 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 2I: Page I627 and is inflicted on innocent people, but this is not punishment; it is judicial error or terrorism or, in Bradley's characteristically repellent phrase, "social surgery." The infliction of suffering on a person is only properly described as punishment if that person is guilty.3 Now, there are at least two criticisms that might be made of this account. First, it might be said that Quinton has simply erred in describing the nature of punishment. The guilt or innocence of the person punished-or even the believed guilt or innocence of the person punished-is not an important or central feature of all typical cases of punishment.4 Second, and more importantly, even if it were to be concluded that, within limits, Quinton is entitled to define "punishment" as he pleases, it would still be necessary to see whether major and problematic substantive issues had thereby been covertly resolved. Even if Quinton is right that punishing the innocent is not punishment, he has not at all succeeded in answering the question whether it is right intentionally to do to innocent persons the sorts of things that utilitarianism appears to permit and perhaps require. Yet his argument can be read as an invitation to regard the sub- stantive moral issues as now resolved.5 Similar possibilities for this kind of confusion abound in the literature dealing with war. In particular, when the topic is the assessment of the morality of war, or participation in a particular war, it is easy to see how what is taken to be the typical or standard example of war may have a very great impact on the moral evaluation that is to follow. Thus, when a I7th- century writer says of war that it is "a just contest carried on by the state's armed forces"6 he has already gone a long way toward judging the right- ness of war. Indeed, it is not surprising that within the tradition that does assert the morality of some wars and some participation in wars, one ap- proach that is adopted is to exclude from the very meaning of war precisely those cases that are hardest to justify. So, John Ruskin in his essay "War" makes what appears at first glance to be a truly startling claim.7 "War," he asserts, "is the foundation of all great art."8 The history of western civilization, Ruskin says, is unambiguous 3. Id. at 86. 4. It is not an easy question how we would or should decide this matter. Up to a point, though, there surely are arguments that can be given and evidence that can be offered in support of the truth or falsity of Quinton's claim. Beyond a certain point, or in certain contexts, there is nothing to be said other than to understand what is meant by Quinton when he uses the term "punishment." See H.L.A. Hart, Prolegomenon to the Principles of Punishment, in PUNISHMENT AND RESPONSIBILITY (I968). On the general question of resolving substantive issues via the definitional process see Morris, Verbal Dis- putes and the Philosophy of John Austin, 7 U.C.L.A.L. REV. 27 (I960). 5.

Art reached its highest point with the Gothic period because of that era's "passionate delight in war itself, for the sake of war."9 Then, the decline set in. [A]s peace is established or extended in Europe, the arts decline. They reach an unparalleled pitch of costliness, but lose their life, enlist themselves at last on the side of luxury and various corruption, and among wholly tranquil nations, wither utterly away; remaining only in partial practice among races who, like the French and us, have still the minds, though we cannot all live the lives, of soldiers.10 This is surely a provocative thesis. However, Ruskin renders it sub- stantially less unsettling than it first appears to be, by acknowledging the troublesome cases and admitting that for these particular kinds of war his generalization does not apply. So, immediately after he reports that all great nations are "nourished in war," and wasted by peace,"" he goes on to note that it is not all war of which this can be said.... It is not the rage of a barbarian wolf-flock, . . . nor the habitual restlessness and rapine of mountaineers, . . . nor the occasional struggle of a strong peaceful nation for its life, as in the wars of the Swiss with Austria; nor the contest of merely ambitious nations for extent of power . . . . None of these forms of war build anything but tombs.12 An interesting example of this definitional problem and a more con- temporary one is the argument advanced by Paul Ramsey, the Protestant theologian, in his book, War and the Christian Conscience.'3 Ramsey's gen- eral thesis is that war can be moral, that it is sometimes right to wage war, and that all arguments to the contrary are unconvincing. The most difficult argument for Ramsey, because it is one of the strongest against his position, is that the development of atomic and hydrogen bombs has made the stakes too high. The risks of total annihilation are so great, the argument goes, that no war can today be morally justified. Although this is an important thesis, for present purposes what is of interest is not its persuasiveness but rather one of the ways Ramsey selects to deal with it. What he says is this: It seems to me that an answer to this question is to be found in the fact that mega- ton weapons are no longer weapons of war, and that their all-out use would not be war. . . . It is right that the enemy be made to realize that he will have to exceed the limits of warfare to gain his ends, that he will have to destroy utterly where he thought to conquer and to bend. Then only will he be deterred from using a weapon that is not a weapon of war.'4 9. Id. at 39. Io. Id. ii. Id. at 40. I2. Id. 13. P. RAMSEY, WAR AND THE CHRISTIAN CONSCIENCE (I96I). 1 4.

It would instead be "mutual devastation."'5 This approach is, I believe, strikingly similar to Quinton's, and the risks are equally great. In part the problem is once again that the analysis just seems incorrect. Our sense of what it is that makes something a war does not readily rule anything out on the grounds that the weaponry employed is too destructive. But here, just as in the case of Quinton, there will be a point at which continued disagreement and argument concerning the cor- rect analysis of war will be neither particularly productive nor important. The danger of Ramsey's approach is not so much that he has got the nature of war wrong, as that he will lead us to neglect what may be the cen- tral concern of many of those who are most worried about the possibility of war today. What Ramsey has not resolved, of course, is the problem of the morality of nuclear conflict and of the widespread use of nuclear devices. And yet he gives the appearance of having done so by tacitly if not expressly assuring us that in considering the morality of war we need not worry about mutual thermonuclear destruction. To be completely fair to Ramsey, though, it may be that he means to argue that all nuclear conflict must be immoral. If so, he makes the point somewhat elliptically. It is important, therefore, for reasons that transcend mere philosophical curiosity, that we do say something more precise about the nature of war. Typically, if not necessarily, war is an inter-national phenomenon involv- ing the use of a certain amount of deadly force under a claim of right. Typically, too, the analysis of what constitutes a war may rest on the ana- lyst's choice between war as a highly refined and rule-encompassed, game- like activity and war as an all-out attempt by one country to dominate an- other. The manner in which these abstract features manifest themselves in any particular war will play a significant role in the moral assessment made of that war. In the first place, war is something that takes place between countries, nation-states, rather than lesser groups or individuals. Private wars, if there still are any, are anomalies, and wars against poverty or disease are such only in a secondary or metaphorical sense. Civil wars and some private wars that have taken place (as, for example, in China) are neither meta- phors nor anomalies. Rather, they are enough like the standard case of war to make it appropriate so to describe them. Thus, in most if not all civil wars what is at issue is a claim that what has hitherto been one country is more properly two. If this is correct, then civil wars are different in just this respect from other kinds of internal strife, which are seldom even called wars, such as insurrections (where there is 15. Id.</page><page sequence="7">June I969] THE MORALITY OF WAR I633 opposition to the enforcement of laws but no strong demand for rival nationhood) or revolutions (where it is assumed that there is one country and the fight is over who shall govern it and how it shall be organized). The second significant characteristic, and perhaps the most essential and distinctive one of all, is that wars almost surely involve the use of a variety of forms of violence under a claim of right. The same actions would in al- most any other context be regarded as the most reprehensible and immoral of acts. More specifically it is, I think, a minimal, necessary attribute of war that it involve a specialized group of persons-an army of some kind-and that persons making up this group must be prepared to kill the soldiers of the opposing army. They may perhaps be prepared to kill others besides soldiers of the opposing army, but for the moment we are speaking of a minimal condition. If these persons were not prepared both to use deadly force and to regard its use as appropriate in a variety of contexts, we would certainly be in doubt as to whether what was going on was a war.'6 This, it should be noted, is certainly not Ramsey's view, alluded to earlier, that if certain forms of mass destruction are used against everyone, what is happening is no longer a war. Nor is it identical with the view that war implies being prepared to do anything and everything that may be deemed helpful to achieve victory.'7 It is instead a necessary feature of war. The third and final characteristic is not really one feature but rather a choice between two different ones. For it is clear, I think, that in any discus- sion of the nature of war reference must at some time be made to two dis- tinct conceptions of war. Under one conception war is a circumscribed, clearly definable instrument of foreign policy; under the other conception, war is some indeterminate, indefinable, and unlimited fight or struggle between countries. In a real sense the concept of war is systematically am- biguous since it can and does simultaneously involve these two very dif- ferent notions. Quite often both of these conceptions are invoked by the same author at the same time, without any awareness of what is happening. One example of this can be found in the work of the famous German writer on war, Clausewitz. The first thing that we must do, Clausewitz tells us, is to define war: We shall not begin with a pedantic definition, but confine ourselves to war's essence: the duel. War is nothing but a duel on a larger scale. . . . Each [side] i6. This is very different from a general preparedness to use deadly force in defense of oneself; for what is distinctive about preparedness in war is that the use of deadly force is deemed appropriate in any number of contexts in which classical self-defense doctrines would not obtain. Thus, once a war is under way, it is perfectly justifiable, at a minimum, to kill any and all enemy combatants (although only with certain weapons) up to the moment they offer to surrender and even though they pose no direct or even serious threat to the lives of the soldiers on the other side. This surely distinguishes war from every other human practice and institution except possibly human slavery. I7. As a practical matter, of course, in most wars the accepted norms in respect to justifiable vio- lence are at least this permissive, and the criterion of helpfulness is often given such an extended meaning that almost no conduct is clearly impermissible if it succeeds.</page><page sequence="8">1634 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol.2I: Page I627 seeks by physical force to overthrow the other, render him incapable of further resistance, and compel his opponent to do his will. . . . War is an act of force, and there is no limit to the application of that force. . . . Thus there can be wars of all degrees of importance and energy, from a war of extermination down to a mere state of armed observation.18 On the surface, at least, this is surely a muddled view. It is hard to imag- ine a more fully rule-governed, rule-defined, stylized way of fighting than a duel. If war is a duel writ large, then war is a sort of game. War is one means-that of combat between competing armies-to decide which of two or more contesting countries shall win a particular dispute. When one side wins, this settles the dispute in the winner's favor and the war is over. Three things are important about this concept of war. First, it is an en- counter that directly involves only armies. Second, it is conducted in ac- cordance with reasonably well-defined and generally accepted rules that determine how the "game" of war is to be played. And third, it is conducted in accordance with less well-articulated but nonetheless identifiable rules or standards concerning when it is appropriate to engage in war. Illustrations of the formal rules relating to how a war is to be fought are plentiful. Two of the most famous are the Hague Convention Number 4 of 190719 and the Geneva Convention of I92g.2? These prohibit such things as the inhumane treatment of prisoners of war, the employment of poisoned weapons, and the improper use of flags of truce.2' Illustrations of rules that relate to the conditions under which war can be undertaken can also be found. One example is found in article I of the Hague Convention Number 3 of I907. It provides: "The Contracting Powers recognize that hostilities between them must not commence with- out a previous and explicit warning, in the form of either a reasoned decla- ration of war or of an ultimatum with a conditional declaration of war."22 An extreme example of this kind of rule is found in the Kellogg-Briand Peace Pact of 1928,23 which appears to rule out resort to war at all, at least for the settlement of disputes or as an instrument of national policy. The language of the Pact is: I8. Von Clausewitz, On War, in WAR, POLITICS, AND POWER 63-72 (E. Collins ed. I962). I9.

Article II The High Contracting Parties agree that the settlement or solution of all disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be, which may arise among them, shall never be sought except by pacific means.24 On this view, then, war is a reasonably carefully defined and circum- scribed kind of combative activity that one country can carry on in respect to one or more other countries. The circumstances under which war can properly be engaged in and the ways in which it may be carried on are both subject to identifiable rules, standards, and agreements of various sorts. It is not as easy to describe the other concept of war found both in Clau- sewitz and in history. One example is, no doubt, Nazi Germany. The Nazi leaders expressly repudiated the notion of "chivalrous warfare," and, in the words of the Nuremberg Tribunal, embraced in full that "conception of 'total war' with which aggressive wars were waged." [I]n this conception of "total war" the moral ideas underlying the conventions which seek to make war more humane are no longer regarded as having force or validity. Everything is made subordinate to the overmastering dictates of war. Rules, regulations, assurances, and treaties, all alike, are of no moment; and so, freed from the restraining influence of international law, the aggressive war is conducted by the Nazi leaders in the most barbaric way. Accordingly, war crimes were committed when and wherever the Fuehrer and his close associates thought them to be advantageous.25 If Nazi Germany constitutes a kind of paradigm case, the behavior of all of the countries involved in the Second World War appears to have come very close to embracing this concept of war. Even the United States ap- parently chose to ignore many if not all of the laws of war that it seemed imprudent to follow, on the grounds that being involved in a fight to the finish with the Axis powers, there was no behavior that could properly be ruled out except on strategic grounds.26 Even if the moral difference that separates these two notions of war and the attitudes, conceptions, and the like that accompany them is by no means 24.

The clearest examples are the saturation bombings of the cities of Europe and the dropping of the two atomic bombs on Japan. Given the fact that atomic and hydrogen bombing is not clearly proscribed by these "laws," it is certainly questionable whether they really do preclude any very significant behavior at all.

REV. 3 (I96I).</page><page sequence="10">i636 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 2i: Page I627 certain, it is clear that if a war were actually to be fought according to all of the rules and standards of the "game" of war, the task of moral assessment would necessarily be different from that presented by a relatively ruleless war like World War II. It is important, therefore, that, whenever relevant, we keep these two conceptions distinct. II Before we examine the moral criteria for assessing war, we must examine the claim that it is not possible to assess war in moral terms. Proponents of this position assert that moral predicates either cannot meaningfully or should not be applied to wars. For want of a better name for this general view, I shall call it moral nihilism in respect to war. If it is correct, there is, of course, no point in going further. It is apparent that anyone who believes that all moral predicates are meaningless, or that all morality (and not just conventional morality) is a sham and a fraud, will regard the case of the morality of war as an a fortiori case. This is not the position I am interested in considering. Rather the view I call moral nihilism in respect to war is, I think, more interesting in the sense that it is restricted to the case of war. What I have in mind is this: During the controversy over the rightness of the Vietnam War there have been any number of persons, including a large number in the university, who have claimed that in matters of war (but not in other matters) morality has no place. The war in Vietnam may, they readily concede, be stupid, un- wise, or against the best interests of the United States, but it is neither im- moral nor unjust-not because it is moral or right, but because these descrip- tions are in this context either naive or meaningless or inapplicable. Nor is this view limited to the Vietnam war. Consider, for instance, the following passage from a speech given only a few years ago by Dean Ache- son: [T]hose involved in the Cuban crisis of October, 1962, will remember the ir- relevance of the supposed moral considerations brought out in the discussions. Judgment centered about the appraisal of dangers and risks, the weighing of the need for decisive and effective action against considerations of prudence; the need to do enough, against the consequences of doing too much. Moral talk did not bear on the problem. Nor did it bear upon the decision of those called upon to advise the President in I949 whether and with what degree of urgency to press the attempt to produce a thermonuclear weapon. A respected colleague advised me that it would be better that our nation and people should perish rather than be party to a course so evil as producing that weapon. I told him that on the Day of Judgment his view might be confirmed and that he was free to go forth and preach the necessity for salvation. It was not, however, a view which I could entertain as a public servant.27 27. Acheson, Ethics in International Relations Today, in THE VIETNAM READER 13 (M. Raskin &amp; B. Fall eds. I965).</page><page sequence="11">June I969] THE MORALITY OF WAR I637 Admittedly, the passage just reproduced is susceptible of different in- terpretations. Acheson may be putting forward the view that even if moral evaluation is relevant to the "ends" pursued by any country (including our own) it is not relevant to the policies adopted in furtherance of these ends. But at times, at least, he appears to expound a quite different view, namely, that in the realm of foreign affairs moral judgments, as opposed to strategic or prudential ones, are simply misplaced and any attempts at moral assess- ment misdirected. Whatever may be the correct exegesis of this text, I want to treat it as illustrative of the position that morality has no place in the assessment of war.28 There are several things worth considering in respect to such a view. In the first place, the claim that in matters of war morality has no place is ambiguous. To put it somewhat loosely, the claim may be descrip- tive, or it may be analytic, or it may be prescriptive. Thus, it would be de- scriptive if it were merely the factual claim that matters relating to war uniformly turn out to be decided on grounds of national interest or ex- pediency rather than by appeal to what is moral.29 This claim I will not con- sider further; it is an empirical one better answered by students of American (and foreign) diplomatic relations. It would be a prescriptive claim were it taken to assert that matters re- lating to war ought always be decided by appeal to (say) national interest rather than an appeal to the moral point of view. For reasons which have yet to be elucidated, on this view the moral criteria are capable of being employed but it is undesirable to do so. I shall say something more about this view in a moment.30 The analytic point is not that morality ought not be used, but rather that it cannot. On this view the statement "The United States is behaving im- morally in the way it is waging war in Vietnam" (or, "in waging war in Vietnam") is not wrong but meaningless. What are we to make of the analytic view? As I have indicated, it could, of course, be advanced simply as an instance of a more sweeping position concerning the general meaninglessness of the moral point of view. What I find particularly interesting, though, is the degree to which this thesis is advanced as a special view about war and not as a part of a more general claim that all morality is meaningless.31 I think that there are at least four reasons why this special view may be held. First, the accusation that one's own country is involved in an im- 28. Acheson's view is admittedly somewhat broader than this since it appears to encompass all foreign relations. 29. Such a view could also hold, although it need not, that it would be desirable for matters relating to war to be determined on moral grounds, even though they are not. 30. See notes 36-38 infra and accompanying text. 31. Much of this analysis applies with equal force to what I call the prescriptive view, which is discussed more fully at notes 36-38 infra and accompanying text. Although I refer only to the ana- lytic view, I mean to include them both where appropriate.</page><page sequence="12">i638 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 2I: Page I627 moral war is personally very threatening. For one thing, if the accusation is well-founded it may be thought to imply that certain types of socially cooperative behavior are forbidden to the citizen and that other kinds of socially deviant behavior are obligatory upon him. Yet, in a time of war it is following just this sort of dictate that will be treated most harshly by the actor's own government. Hence the morally responsible citizen is put in a most troublesome moral dilemma. If his country is engaged in an immoral war then he may have a duty to oppose and resist; yet opposition and re- sistance will typically carry extraordinarily severe penalties. The pressure is, I suspect, simply too great for many of us. We are un- willing to pay the fantastically high personal price that goes with the moral point of view, and we are equally unwilling to plead guilty to this most serious charge of immorality. So we solve the problem by denying the pos- sibility that war can be immoral. The relief is immediate; the moral "heat" is off. If war cannot be immoral, then one's country cannot be engaged in an immoral war, but only a stupid or unwise one. And whatever one's obliga- tions to keep one's country from behaving stupidly or improvidently, they are vastly less stringent and troublesome than obligations imposed by the specter of complicity in an immoral war. We may, however, pay a price for such relief since we obliterate the moral distinctions between the Axis and the Allies in World War II at the same time as the distinctions between the conduct of the United States in 194I-45 and the conduct of the United States in i967-68 in Vietnam. Second, I think the view that moral judgments are meaningless some- times seems plausible because of the differences between personal behavior and the behavior of states. There are not laws governing the behavior of states in the same way in which there are positive laws governing the be- havior of citizens. International law is a troublesome notion just because it is both like and unlike our concept of positive law. Now, how does skepticism about the law-like quality of international law lead to the claim that it is impossible for war to be either moral or im- moral ? It is far from obvious. Perhaps it is because there is at least one sense of justice that is intimately bound up with the notion of rule-violation; namely, that which relates justice to the following of rules and to the con- demnation and punishment of those who break rules. In the absence of positive laws governing the behavior of states, it may be inferred (although I think mistakenly) that it is impossible for states to behave either justly or unjustly.32 But even if justice can be said to be analyzable solely in terms of 32. It is a mistake just because justice is not analyzable solely in terms of rule-following and rule- violating behavior. One of the genuine puzzles in this whole area is why there is so much talk about just and unjust wars. Except in this very limited context of the relationship of justice to rules, it appears that the predi- cates "just" and "unjust" when applied to wars are synonymous with "moral" and "immoral."</page><page sequence="13">June I969] THE MORALITY OF WAR I639 following rules, morality certainly cannot. Hence the absence of inter- national laws cannot serve to make the moral appraisal of war impossible. Third, there is the substantially more plausible view that, in the absence of positive laws and in the absence of any machinery by which to punish even the grossest kinds of immorality, an adequate excuse will always exist for behaving immorally. This is one way to take Hobbes' assertion that in the state of nature the natural laws bind in conscience but not in action. Even this view, however, would not render the moral assessment of the be- havior of states meaningless; it would only excuse immorality in the ab- sence of effective international law. More importantly, though, it, too, mis- states the general understanding of morality in its insistence that morality depends for its meaning on the existence of guarantees of moral conformity by others. Fourth, and still more plausible, is the view that says there can be no moral assessment of war just because there is, by definition, no morality in war. If war is an activity in which anything goes, moral judgments on war are just not possible. To this there are two responses. To begin with, it is not, as our defini- tional discussion indicates, a necessary feature of war that it be an activity in which everything is morally permissible. There is a difference between the view that war is unique because killing and violence are morally per- missible in contexts and circumstances where they otherwise would not be and the view that war is unique because everything is morally permissible.83 A less absolutist argument for the absurdity of discussing the morality of war might be that at least today the prevailing (although not necessary) conception of war is one that as a practical matter rules out no behavior on moral grounds. After all, if flamethrowers are deemed perfectly permis- sible, if the bombing of cities is applauded and not condemned, and if thermonuclear weapons are part of the arsenal of each of the major powers, then the remaining moral prohibitions on the conduct of war are suffi- ciently insignificant to be ignored. The answer to this kind of an argument requires, I believe, that we dis- tinguish the question of what is moral in war from that of the morality of war or of war generally. I return to this distinction later,34 but for the present it is sufficient to observe that the argument presented only goes to the question of whether moral judgments can meaningfully be made con- cerning the way in which war is conducted. Paradoxically, the more con- vincing the argument from war's conduct, the stronger is the moral argu- ment against engaging in war at all. For the more it can be shown that engaging in war will inevitably lead to despicable behavior to which no 33. See notes I6-17 supra and accompanying text. 34. See notes 39-46 infra and accompanying text.</page><page sequence="14">i640 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 2i: Page I627 moral predicates are deemed applicable, the more this also constitutes an argument against bringing such a state of affairs into being.35 There is still another way to take the claim that in matters of war morality has no place. That is what I have called the prescriptive view: that national interest ought to determine policies in respect to war, not morality. This is surely one way to interpret the remarks of Dean Acheson reproduced earlier. It is also, perhaps, involved in President Truman's defense of the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. What he said was this: Having found the bomb, we have to use it. We have used it against those who attacked us without warning at Pearl Harbor, against those who have starved and beaten and executed American prisoners of war, against those who have abandoned all pretense of obeying international laws of warfare. We have used it in order to shorten the agony of war, in order to save the lives of thousands and thousands of young Americans.36 Although this passage has many interesting features, I am concerned only with President Truman's insistence that the dropping of the bomb was justified because it saved the lives "of thousands and thousands of young Americans." Conceivably, this is merely an elliptical way of saying that on balance fewer lives were lost through the dropping of the bomb and the acceler- ated cessation of hostilities than through any alternative course of conduct. Suppose, though, that this were not the argument. Suppose, instead, that the justification were regarded as adequate provided only that it was reasonably clear that fewer American lives would be lost than through any alternative course of conduct. Thus, to quantify the example, we can imagine someone maintaining that Hiroshima was justified because 20,000 fewer Americans died in the Pacific theater than would have died if the bomb had not been dropped. And this is justified even though 30,000 more Japanese died than would have been killed had the war been fought to an end with conventional means. Thus, even though Io,ooo more people died than would otherwise have been the case, the bombing was justified because of the greater number of American lives saved. On this interpretation the argument depends upon valuing the lives of Americans higher than the lives of persons from other countries. As such, is there anything to be said for the argument? Its strongest statement, and 35. But suppose someone should argue that the same argument applies to the question of when and under what circumstances to wage war, and that here, too, the only relevant criteria of assessment are prudential or strategic ones. Again, my answer would be that this also constitutes a perfectly de- fensible and relevant reason for making a moral judgment about the desirability of war as a social phenomenon. 36. Address to the Nation by President Harry S Truman, Aug. 9, 1945, quoted in R. TUCKER, THE JUST WAR 2I-22 n.14 (1960).</page><page sequence="15">June I969] THE MORALITY OF WAR I64I the only one that I shall consider, might go like this: Truman was the President of the United States and as such had an obligation always to choose that course of conduct that appeared to offer the greatest chance of maximizing the interests of the United States."7 As President, he was obligated to prefer the lives of American soldiers over those from any other country, and he was obligated to prefer them just because they were Americans and he was their President. Some might prove such a point by drawing an analogy to the situation of a lawyer, a parent, or a corporation executive. A lawyer has a duty to present his client's case in the fashion most calculated to ensure his client's victory; and he has this obligation irrespective of the objective merits of his client's case. Similarly, we are neither surprised nor dismayed when a parent prefers the interests of his child over those of other children. A parent qua parent is certainly not behaving immorally when he acts so as to secure satisfactions for his child, again irrespective of the objective merits of the child's needs or wants. And, mutatis mutandis, a corporate executive has a duty to maximize profits for his company. Thus, as public servants, Dean Acheson and Harry Truman had no moral choice but to pursue those policies that appeared to them to be in the best interest of the United States. And to a lesser degree, all persons qua citizens of the United States have a similar, if slightly more attenuated, obligation. Therefore morality has no real place in war. The analogy, however, must not stop halfway. It is certainly both cor- rect and important to observe that public officials, like parents, lawyers, and corporate executives, do have special moral obligations that are im- posed by virtue of the position or role they fill. A lawyer does have a duty to prefer his client's interests in a way that would be improper were the person anyone other than a client. And the same sort of duty, I think, holds for a parent, an executive, a President, and a citizen in their respective roles. The point becomes distorted, however, when it is supposed that such an obligation always, under all circumstances, overrides any and all other obligations that the person might have. The case of the lawyer is instruc- tive. While he has an obligation to attend to his client's interests in very special ways, there are many other things that it is impermissible for the lawyer to do in furtherance of his client's interests-irrespective, this time, of how significantly they might advance that interest. The case for the President, or for public servants generally, is similar. While the President may indeed have an obligation to prefer and pursue the national interests, this obligation could only be justifiable-could only be 37. Other arguments that might be offered-such as that the President was justified because Japan was the aggressor, or that he was justified because this was essentially an attack on combatants-are discussed at notes 39-46 infra and accompanying text.</page><page sequence="16">I642 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 2i: Page I627 a moral obligation-if it were enmeshed in a comparable range of limit- ing and competing obligations. If we concede that the President has cer- tain obligations to prefer the national interest that no one else has, we must be equally sensitive to the fact that the President also has some of the same obligations to other persons that all other men have-if for no other reason than that all persons have the right to be treated or not treated in certain ways. So, whatever special obligations the President may have can- not by themselves support the view that in war morality ought have no place. In addition, the idea that one can separate a man's personality from the duties of his office is theoretically questionable and practically unbelievable. Experience teaches that a man cannot personally be guided by moral dic- tates while abjuring them in public life even if he wants to. It it also unlikely that a man on becoming President will try to adopt such an approach unless there is something about the office that compels a dual personality. Common sense indicates there is not. If there were, it would mean that the electorate could not purposely choose someone to follow a course not dictated by the "national interest" since, whatever his pre-election promises, the office would reform him. But the major problem with the national-interest argument is its as- sumption that the national interest not only is something immutable and knowable but also that it limits national interest to narrowly national con- cerns. It is parochial to suppose that the American national interest really rules out solicitude for other states in order to encourage international stability. Finally, national interest as a goal must itself be justified. The United States' position of international importance may have imposed on it a duty of more than national concern. The fact that such a statement has become hackneyed by constant use to justify American interference abroad should not blind us to the fact that it may be viable as an argument for a less ag- gressive international responsibility.38 III If we turn now to confront more directly the question of the morality of wars, it is evident that there is a variety of different perspectives from which, or criteria in terms of which, particular wars may be assessed. First, to the extent to which the model of war as a game continues to have a place, wars can be evaluated in terms of the degree to which the laws of war-the rules for initiating and conducting war-are adhered to by the opposing 38. It is probably a reaction to the parochial view of national interest that makes plausible move- ments that seek to develop a single world government and a notion of world rather than national citizenship.</page><page sequence="17">June I969] THE MORALITY OF WAR I643 countries. Second, the rightness or wrongness of wars is often thought to depend very much upon the cause for which a war is fought. And third, there is the independent justification for a war that is founded upon an appeal of some kind to a principle of self-defense. In discussing the degree to which the laws of war are followed or dis- regarded there are two points that should be stressed. First, a skepticism as to the meaningfulness of any morality wvithin war is extremely common. The gnomic statement is Sherman's: "War is hell." The fuller argument depends upon a rejection of the notion of war as a game. It goes something like this. War is the antithesis of law or rules. It is violence, killing and all of the horror they imply. Even if moral distinctions can be made in respect to such things as the initiation and purposes of a war, it is absurd to sup- pose that moral distinctions can be drawn once a war has begun. All killing is bad, all destruction equally wanton.39 Now, there does seem to me to be a fairly simple argument of sorts that can be made in response. Given the awfulness of war, it nonetheless ap- pears plausible to discriminate among degrees of awfulness. A war in which a large number of innocent persons are killed is, all other things being equal, worse than one in which only a few die. A war in which few combatants are killed is, ceteris paribus, less immoral than one in which many are killed. And more to the point, perhaps, any unnecessary harm to others is surely unjustifiable. To some degree, at least, the "laws of war" can be construed as attempts to formalize these general notions and to define instances of unnecessary harm to others.40 The second criterion, the notion of the cause that can be invoked to justify a war may involve two quite different inquiries. On the one hand, we may intend the sense in which cause refers to the consequences of waging war, to the forward-looking criteria of assessment. Thus, when a war is justified as a means by which to make the world safe for democracy, or 39. This may be what Paul Henri Spaak had in mind when he said: "I must . . . say that the proposal to humanize war has always struck me as hypocrisy. I have difficulty in seeing the difference from a moral and humane point of view between the use of a guided missile of great power which can kill tens and even hundreds of people without regard for age or sex, and which if used repeatedly will kill millions, and the use of an atomic bomb which achieves the same result at the first stroke. Does crime against humanity begin only at the moment when a certain number of innocent people are killed or at the moment when the first one is killed?" Quoted in R. TUCKER, supra note 36, at 78-79 n-7I. 40. This is the view put forward by Michael Walzer in his piece "Moral Judgment in Time of War," DISSENT, May-June I967, at 284. I purposely say "to some degree" because there are powerful objections to taking the "laws of war" too seriously, particularly if they are to be construed as laws or even binding rules. I have alluded to some of the problems already. Note 26 supra. More generally, there are at least four respects in which their character as laws seems suspect: (i) There is no authoritative body to make or declare them. (2) The distinctions made by the rules are specious and unconvincing (for example, the use of irregu- lar-shaped bullets and projectiles filled with glass violates our standards of land warfare, see U.S. DEP'T OF THE ARMY, THE LAW OF LAND WARFARE, art. 34 (Basic Field Manual 27-IO, I956), but the use of an atomic bomb does not). (3) The sanctions are typically applied only to the losing side. (4) The countries involved tend to regard their own behavior as lawful because falling under some exception or other.</page><page sequence="18">i644 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 2i: Page I627 on the grounds that a failure to fight now will lead to a loss of confidence on the part of one's allies, or as necessary to avoid fighting a larger, more destructive war later, when these sorts of appeals are made, the justification is primarily consequential or forward-looking in character. Here the dis- tinction between morality and prudence-never a very easy one to main- tain in international relations-is always on the verge of collapse. On the other hand, a war may be evaluated through recourse to what may be termed backward-looking criteria. Just as in the case of punishment or blame where what happened in the past is relevant to the justice of punish- ing or blaming someone, so in the case of war, what has already happened is, on this view, relevant to the justice or rightness of the war that is sub- sequently waged. The two backward-looking criteria that are most fre- quently invoked in respect to war are the question of whether the war was an instance of aggression and the question of whether the war involved a violation of some prior promise, typically expressed in the form of a treaty or concord. Two sorts of assertions are often made concerning the role of the treaty in justifying resort to war. First, if a country has entered into a treaty not to go to war and if it violates that treaty, it is to be condemned for, in effect, having broken its promise. And second, if a country has entered into a treaty in which it has agreed to go to war under certain circumstances and if those circumstances come to pass, then the country is at least justified in going to war-although it is not in fact obligated to do so. Once again, even if we pass over the difficult analytic questions that might be asked about whether countries can promise to do anything and, if they can, what the nature and duration of such promises are, it is clear that treaties can be relevant but not decisive factors. This is so just because it is sometimes right to break our promises and sometimes wrong to keep them. The fact that a treaty is violated at best tends to make a war unjust or immoral in some degree, but it does not necessarily render the war un- justified.4" The other backward-looking question, that of aggression, is often re- solved by concluding that under no circumstances is the initiation of a war of aggression justified. This is a view that Americans and America have often embraced. Such a view was expounded at Nuremberg by Mr. Justice Jackson when he said: [T]he wrong for which their [the German] fallen leaders are on trial is not that they lost the war, but that they started it. And we must not allow ourselves to be drawn into a trial of the causes of war, for our position is that no grievances or policies will justify resort to aggressive war. . . . Our position is that whatever 4I. I discuss this distinction between injustice and unjustifiability at notes 50-55 infra and ac- companying text.</page><page sequence="19">June I969] THE MORALITY OF WAR I645 grievances a nation may have, however objectionable it finds that status quo, ag- gressive warfare is an illegal means for settling those grievances or for altering those conditions.42 A position such as this is typically thought to imply two things: (i) The initiation of war is never justifiable; (2) the warlike response to aggressive war is justifiable. Both views are troublesome. To begin with, it is hard to see how the two propositions go together very comfortably. Conceivably, there are powerful arguments against the waging of aggressive war. Almost surely, though, the more persuasive of these will depend, at least in part, on the character of war itself-on such things as the supreme importance of human life, or the inevitable injustices committed in every war. If so, then the justifiability of meeting war with war will to that degree be called into question. To take the first proposition alone, absent general arguments about the unjustifiability of all war, it is hard to see how aggressive war can be ruled out in a wholly a priori fashion. Even if we assume that no problems are presented in determining what is and is not aggression, it is doubtful that the quality of aggression could always be morally decisive in con- demning the war. Would a war undertaken to free innocent persons from concentration camps or from slavery always be unjustifiable just because it was aggressive? Surely this is to rest too much upon only one of a number of relevant considerations.43 From a backward-looking point of view, the claim that a warring re- sponse to aggressive war is always justified is even more perplexing. One way to take this claim is to regard it as plain retributivism. A country is justified in fighting back because the aggressor hit first. Since aggression is wrong, it deserves to be thwarted and punished. The difficulty with this position is, in part, that retributivism generally is more plausible as a state- ment of necessary rather than of sufficient conditions. Thus, it would be one thing to claim that a war was only justified if undertaken in response to aggression, but it is quite another thing to assert that a war is justified provided it is undertaken in response to aggression. For reasons already stated, I think even this would be unsatisfactory, but it would surely come closer to being right than a view that finds aggression to be a sufficient justification for making war. A number of these issues reappear in the re- lated problem of self-defense as a justification. In order to understand the force of the doctrine of self-defense when invoked in respect to war, and to assess its degree of legitimate applicabil- 42. Quoted in R. TUCKER, supra note 36, at I2. 43. G. E. M. Anscombe makes the same point in her article War and Murder, in NUCLEAR WEAPONS-A CATHOLIC RESPONSE 45, 47 (I96I): "The present-day conception of 'aggression,' like so many strongly influential conceptions, is a bad one. Why must it be wrong to strike the first blow in a struggle? The only question is, who is in the right."</page><page sequence="20">I646 STANFORD LaW REVIEW [Vol. 2I: Page I627 ity, it is necessary that we look briefly at self-defense as it functions as a doctrine of municipal criminal law. The first thing to notice is that the doctrine of self-defense does not depend upon either typically retributive or typically consequential considerations. Instead, it rests upon the preven- tion by the intended victim of quite immediate future harm to himself. To be sure, the doctrine is backward-looking in its insistence that an "at- tack" of some sort be already under way. But the fact that it is not retributive can be seen most clearly from the fact that self-defense cannot be invoked in response to an attack that is over. In the same fashion, the doctrine is forward-looking in its insistence upon the prevention of future harm. Second, it is by no means clear whether the doctrine can be understood better as a justification or as an excuse. It can be understood to rest upon the notion that one is entitled to defend oneself from a serious and imminent attack upon life and limb. Concomitantly, the doctrine can be interpreted to depend upon the proposition that it is a natural, almost unavoidable- and hence excusable-reaction to defend oneself when attacked. In either case what is important is that we keep in mind two of the respects in which the law qualifies resort to the claim of self-defense. On one hand, the doctrine cannot be invoked successfully if the intended victim could have avoided the encounter through a reasonable escape or retreat unless the attack takes place on one's own property. And on the other hand, the doctrine requires that no more force be employed than is reasonably necessary to prevent the infliction of comparable harm. Now how does all of this apply to self-defense as a justification for en- gaging in war? In the first place, to the extent to which the basic doctrine serves as an excuse, the applicability to war seems doubtful. While it may make sense to regard self-defense of one's person as a natural, instinctive response to an attack, it is only a very anthropomorphic view of countries that would lead us to elaborate a comparable explanation here." In the second place, it is not even clear that self-defense can function very persuasively as a justification. For it to do so it might be necessary, for example, to be able to make out a case that countries die in the same way in which persons do, or that a country can be harmed in the same way in which a person can be. Of course, persons in the country can be harmed and killed by war, and I shall return to this point in a moment, but we can also imagine an attack in which none of the inhabitants of the country will be killed or even physically harmed unless they fight back. But the country, as a separate political entity, might nonetheless disappear. Would we say 44. Such a view certainly exists, however; we talk, for instance, about national pride and honor, insults to a country, etc. One real question is whether this way of thinking ought to be exorcised. In any event, however, countries do not respond "instinctively" in the way in which persons sometimes do, and, hence, the excuse rationale is just not appropriate.</page><page sequence="21">June I969] THE MORALITY OF WAR 1647 that this should be regarded as the equivalent of human death? That it is less harmful? More harmful? These are issues to which those who readily invoke the doctrine of self-defense seldom address themselves. Even if we were to decide, however, that there is no question but that a country is justified in relying upon a doctrine of self-defense that is es- sentially similar to that which obtains in the criminal law, it would be essential to observe the constraints that follow. Given even the unprovoked aggressive waging of war by one country against another, the doctrine of self-defense could not be invoked by the country so attacked to justify waging unlimited defensive war or insisting upon unconditional surrender. Each or both of these responses might be justifiable, but not simply because a country was wrongly attacked. It would, instead, have to be made out that something analogous to retreat was neither possible nor appropriate, and, even more, that no more force was used than was reasonably necessary to terminate the attack. There is, to be sure, an answer to this. The restrictions that the criminal law puts upon self-defense are defensible, it could be maintained, chiefly because we have a municipal police force, municipal laws, and courts. If we use no more than reasonable force to repel attacks, we can at least be confident that the attacker will be apprehended and punished and, further, that we live in a society in which this sort of aggressive behavior is deterred by a variety of means. It is the absence of such a context that renders re- strictions on an international doctrine of self-defense inappropriate. I do not think this answer is convincing. It is relevant to the question of what sorts of constraints will be operative on the behavior of persons and countries, but it is not persuasive as to the invocation of self-defense as a justification for war. To use more force than is reasonably necessary to defend oneself is, in short, to do more than defend oneself. If such non- self-defensive behavior is to be justified, it must appeal to some different principle or set of principles. There are, therefore, clearly cases in which a principle of self-defense does appear to justify engaging in a war: at a minimum, those cases in which one's country is attacked in such a way that the inhabitants are threatened with deadly force and in which no more force than is reasonably necessary is employed to terminate the attack. One might argue, of course, for some of the reasons discussed above, that this is too restrictive a range for the legitimate application of the prin- ciple. More specifically, it might be observed that I have provided an unduly restricted account of the cases in which the use of deadly force is permissi- ble in our legal system; namely, to defend certain classes of third parties from attacks threatening serious bodily harm or death, and to prevent the commission of certain felonies. These, clearly, would also have ostensibly</page><page sequence="22">I648 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 2I: Page I627 important applications to the justifiable use of deadly force in the interna- tional setting. I shall return to this point when I discuss the problem of war and the death of innocent persons in part IV. At present, however, I want to consider an argument for refusing to accord any legitimacy whatsoever to an appeal to self-defense. The argument is a version of what can ap- propriately be called the pacifist position. The formulation I have in mind is found in the writings of the nineteenth-century pacifist, Adin Ballou, and it merits reproduction at some length. What Ballou says is this: If it [self-defense] be the true method, it must on the whole work well. It must preserve human life and secure mankind against injury, more certainly and effectually than any other possible method. Has it done this? I do not admit it. How happens it that, according to the lowest probable estimate, some fourteen thousand millions of human beings have been slain by human means, in war and otherwise? Here are enough to people eighteen planets like the earth with its present population. What inconceivable miseries must have been endured by these worlds of people and their friends, in the process of those murderous conflicts which extinguished their earthly existence! . . . If this long-trusted method of self-preservation be indeed the best which nature affords to her children, their lot is most deplorable. To preserve what life has been preserved at such a cost, renders life itself a thing of doubtful value. If only a few thousands, or even a few millions, had perished by the two edged sword; if innocence and justice and right had uniformly triumphed; if aggression, injustice, violence, injury and insult, after a few dreadful experiences, had been overawed; if gradually the world had come into wholesome order-a state of truthfulness, justice and peace; if the sword of self-defense had frightened the sword of aggression into its scab- bard, there to consume in its rust; then might we admit that the common method of self-preservation was the true one. But now we have ample demonstration that they who take the sword, perish with the sword. Is it supposable that if no injured person or party, since the days of Abel, had lifted up a deadly weapon, or threatened an injury against an offending party, there would have been a thousandth part of the murders and miseries which have actually taken place on our earth? Take the worst possible view; resolve all the assailed and injured into the most passive non-resistants imaginable, and let the offenders have unlimited scope to commit all the robberies, cruelties and murders they pleased; would as many lives have been sacrificed, or as much real misery have been experienced by the human race, as have actually resulted from the general method of self- preservation, by personal conflict and resistance of injury with injury? He must be a bold man who affirms it.45 What is most interesting about Ballou's argument is that it is, in es- sence, an empirical one. His claim is not the more typical pacifist claim that there is some principle that directly forbids the use of force even in cases of self-defense. His assertion is rather that the consequences of re- garding the use of force as appropriate in self-defensive situations have been 45. Ballou, Christian Non-Resistance, in NONVIOLENCE IN AMERICA: A DOCUMENTARY HISTORY 3I, 38-39 (S. Lynd ed. I966).</page><page sequence="23">June 1969] THE MORALITY OF WAR I649 disastrous-or, more exactly, worse precisely in terms of the preservation of human life than would have been the case if the use of force even in such circumstances were always deemed impermissible. It is very difficult to know what to make of such an argument. In par- ticular, it is more difficult than it may appear at first to state the argument coherently. What precisely is Ballou's thesis? Perhaps he is saying some- thing like this: The principle that force may justifiably be used in cases of self-defense tends to be misapplied in practice. Persons almost inevitably tend to overestimate the imminence and severity of a threat of violence to themselves. They use force prematurely and in excess under an invocation of the doctrine of self-defense. And if this is true of persons generally, it is probably even truer of countries in their relations with other countries. The answer, therefore, is to induce persons and countries to forgo the resort to force even in cases of self-defense. This argument is something of a paradox. If everyone were to accept and consistently to act upon the principle that force ought never to be used, even in cases of self-defense, then there would be nothing to worry about. No one would ever use force at all, and we really would not have to worry about misapplications of the principle of self-defense. But Ballou's appeal is to persons to give up the principle of self-defense even if others have not renounced even the aggressive resort to force. In other words, Ballou's argument is one for unilateral rather than bilateral pacifism, and that is precisely what makes it so hard to accept. As I have said, Ballou's thesis appears to be an empirical one. He appears to concede that if only some persons renounce the doctrine of self-defense they certainly do not thereby guarantee their own safety from attack. In- nocent persons in this position may very well be killed by those who use force freely. Ballou seems to be saying that while this is so, the consequences have been still worse where self-defense has not been abandoned. But there is just no reason to suppose that unilateral pacifism if practiced by an un- specified group of persons would have resulted in fewer rather than more deaths.46 Perhaps, though, this is not what Ballou really has in mind. Perhaps instead the main thrust of his argument is as follows: People generally agree that force should not be used except in self-defense. But the evidence indicates that this principle is usually misapplied. Hence, a partial pacifism, restricted to the use of force only in cases of self-defense, is illusory and unsound. Even if all countries agreed never to use force except in self- defense, tlley would still be so prone to construe the behavior of other coun- 46. Still another argument against unilateral pacificism is, of course, that there are evils other than the destruction of lives. Suppose, for example, that unilateral pacifism would result in fewer deaths but in substantially greater human slavery. It is by no means clear that such would be a morally preferable state of affairs.</page><page sequence="24">i650 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 2I: Page I627 tries as imminently threatening that wars would be prevalent and the con- sequences horrendous. This is the reason why even self-defense cannot be permitted as an exception to pacifism. Everyone and every country should, therefore, renounce self-defense as the one remaining exception to pacifism. Again there is an element of paradox to the argument. Suppose it looks to country Y as though country X is about to attack it. Ballou would say country Y should not, under the principle of self-defense, prepare to fight back. Of course, if all countries do follow the principle of never using force except in self-defense, this makes good sense because country Y can rely on the fact that country X will not attack first. So there is no need to eliminate the defense of self-defense. But what if country X should in fact attack? Here Ballou's advice is that country Y should still not respond because of the likelihood of misapplying the doctrine of self-defense. Once again the case is simply not convincing. In any particular case it just might be that the doctrine would not be misapplied and that the conse- quences of not defending oneself would in fact be less desirable than those of resorting to self-defensive force. In short, the case against a limited doctrine of self-defense cannot, I think, be plausibly made out on grounds such as those urged by Ballou. Al- though a world without war would doubtless be a better one, it is by no means clear that unilateral abandonment of the doctrine of self-defense would have such beneficial consequences. If there is an argument against war, it must rest on something other than the harms inherent in the doc- trine of self-defense. IV The strongest argument against war is that which rests upon the con- nection between the morality of war and the death of innocent persons. The specter of thermonuclear warfare makes examination of this point essential; yet the problem was both a genuine and an urgent one in the pre-atomic days of air warfare, particularly during the Second World War. The argument based upon the death of innocent persons goes something like this: Even in war innocent persons have a right to life and limb that should be respected. It is no less wrong and no more justifiable to kill in- nocent persons in war than at any other time. Therefore, if innocent persons are killed in a war, that war is to be condemned. The argument can quite readily be converted into an attack upon all modern war. Imagine a thoroughly unprovoked attack upon another country-an attack committed, moreover, from the worst of motives and for the most despicable of ends. Assume too, for the moment, that under such circumstances there is nothing immoral about fighting back and even kill- ing those who are attacking. Nonetheless, if in fighting back innocent per-</page><page sequence="25">June I969] THE MORALITY OF WAR I65I sons will be killed, the defenders will be acting immorally. However, given any war fought today, innocent persons will inevitably be killed. There- fore, any war fought today will be immoral. There are a variety of matters that require clarification before the strength of this argument can be adequately assessed. In particular, there are four questions that must be examined: (i) What is meant by "inno- cence" in this context? (2) Is it plausible to suppose that there are any innocents? (3) Under what circumstances is the death of innocent persons immoral ? (4) What is the nature of the connection between the immo- rality of the killing of innocent persons and the immorality of the war in which this killing occurs? It is anything but clear what precisely is meant by "innocence" or "the innocent" in an argument such as this. One possibility would be that all noncombatants are innocent. But then, of course, we would have to de- cide what was meant by "noncombatants." Here we might be tempted to claim that noncombatants are all of those persons who are not in the army -not actually doing the fighting; the combatants are those who are. There are, however, serious problems with this position. For it appears that per- sons can be noncombatants in this sense and yet indistinguishable in any apparently relevant sense from persons in the army. Thus, civilians may be manufacturing munitions, devising new weapons, writing propaganda, or doing any number of other things that make them indistinguishable from many combatants vis-a-vis their relationship to the war effort. A second possibility would be to focus upon an individual's causal connection with the attempt to win the war rather than on his status as soldier or civilian. On this view only some noncombatants would be in- nocent and virtually no combatants would be. If the causal connection is what is relevant, meaningful distinctions might be made among civilians. One might distinguish between those whose activities or vocations help the war effort only indirectly, if at all, and those whose activities are more plausibly described as directly beneficial. Thus the distinctions would be between a typical grocer or a tailor on the one hand, and a worker in an armaments plant on the other. Similarly, children, the aged, and the infirm would normally not be in a position to play a role causally connected in this way with the waging of war.47 There are, of course, other kinds of possible causal connections. In par- ticular, someone might urge that attention should also be devoted to the existence of a causal connection between the individual's civic behavior and the war effort. Thus, for example, a person's voting behavior, or the degree of his political opposition to the government, or his financial contributions 47. For a fuller development of this point see Ford, The Morality of Obliteration Bombing, 5 THEOLOGICAL STUDIES 26I, 280-86 (I944).</page><page sequence="26">1652 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 2i: Page I627 to the war effort might all be deemed to be equally relevant to his status as an innocent. Still a fourth possibility, closely related to those already discussed, would be that interpretation of innocence concerned with culpability rather than causality per se. On this view a person would properly be regarded as innocent if he could not fairly be held responsible for the war's initia- tion or conduct. Clearly, the notion of culpability is linked in important ways with that of causal connection, but they are by no means identical. So it is quite conceivable, for example, that under some principles of cul- pability many combatants might not be culpable and some noncomba- tants might be extremely culpable, particularly if culpability were to be defined largely in terms of state of mind and enthusiasm for the war. Thus, an aged or infirm person who cannot do very much to help the war effort but is an ardent proponent of its aims and objectives might be more culpable (and less innocent in this sense) than a conscriptee who is firing a machine gun only because the penalty for disobeying the command to do so is death.48 But we need not propose an airtight definition of "innocence" in order to answer the question of whether, in any war, there will be a substantial number of innocent persons involved. For irrespective of which sense or senses of innocence are ultimately deemed most instructive or important, it does seem clear that there will be a number of persons in any country (children are probably the clearest example) who will meet any test of innocence that is proposed. The third question enumerated earlier is: Under what circumstances is the death of innocent persons immoral? One possible view is that which asserts simply that it is unimportant which circumstances bring about the death of innocent persons. As long as we know that innocent persons will be killed as a result of war, we know all we need to know to condemn any such war. Another, and perhaps more plausible, view is that which regards the death of innocent persons as increasingly unjustifiable if it was negligently, recklessly, knowingly, or intentionally brought about. Thus, if a country 48. This discussion hardly exhausts the possible problems involved in making clear the ap- propriate notion of innocence. I have not, for example, discussed at all the view that culpability is linked with the cause for which a war is fought. On this view, innocence might turn much more on the question of which side a person was on than on his connection with or responsibility for waging the war. I do not think this sense of innocence is intended by those who condemn wars that involve the deaths of innocent persons. Similarly, I have avoided completely a number of difficulties inherent in the problem of culpability for the behavior of one's country. To what degree does the denial of access to adequate information about the war excuse one from culpability in supporting it? Are children who are taught that their country is always right to be regarded as innocents even though they act on this instruction and assid- uously do what they can to aid the war effort? To what degree does the existence of severe penalties for political opposition render ostensibly culpable behavior in fact innocent? All of these questions arise more directly in connection with the issue of individual responsibility for the behavior of one's country and oneself in time of war. This issue is, as I have indicated, beyond the scope of this Article. As is apparent, however, a number of the relevant considerations are pre- sented once the problem of the death of innocent persons is raised.</page><page sequence="27">June I969] THE MORALITY OF WAR I653 engages in acts of war with the intention of bringing about the death of children, perhaps to weaken the will of the enemy, it would be more im- moral than if it were to engage in acts of war aimed at killing combatants but which through error also kill children.49 A different sort of problem arises if someone asks how we are to dif- ferentiate the death of children in war from, for example, the death of children that accompany the use of highways or airplanes in times of peace. Someone might, that is, argue that we permit children to ride in cars on highways and to fly in airplanes even though we know that there will be accidents and that as a result of these accidents innocent children will die. And since we know this to be the case, the situation appears to be indis- tinguishable from that of engaging in acts of war where it is known that the death of children will be a direct, although not intended, consequence. I think that there are three sorts of responses that can be made to an objection of this sort. In the first place, in a quite straightforward sense the highway does not, typically, cause the death of the innocent passenger; the careless driver or the defective tire does. But it is the intentional bomb- ing of the heavily populated city that does cause the death of the children who live in the city. In the second place, it is one thing to act where one knows that certain more or less identifiable persons will be killed (say, bombing a troop camp when one knows that those children who live in the vicinity of the camp will also be killed), and quite another thing to engage in conduct in which all one can say is that it can be predicted with a high degree of confidence that over a given period of time a certain number of persons (including children) will be killed. The difference seems to lie partly in the lack of specificity concerning the identity of the persons and partly in the kind of causal connection involved. In the third place, there is certainly a difference in the two cases in re- spect to the possibility of deriving benefits from the conduct. That is to say, when a highway is used, one is participating in a system or set of ar- rangements in which benefits are derived from that use (even though risks, and hence costs, are also involved). It is not easy to see how a similar sort of analysis can as plausibly be proposed in connection with typical acts of war. The final and most important issue that is raised by the argument con- cerning the killing of the innocent in time of war is that of the connection between the immorality of the killing of innocent persons and the im- morality of the war in which this killing occurs. Writers in the area often fail to discuss the connection. 49. There is a substantial body of literature on the problem of the intentionality of conduct in time of war. Discussion has focused chiefly on the plausibility of the Catholic doctrine of "double" or "indirect" effect. See, e.g., P. RAMSEY, supra note 13, at 46-59; Anscombe, supra note 43, at 57-59; Ford, supra note 47, at 289, 290-98.</page><page sequence="28">i654 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 2I: Page I627 Miss Anscombe puts the point this way: "[I]t is murderous to attack [the innocent] or make them a target for an attack which [the attacker] judges will help him toward victory. For murder is the deliberate killing of the innocent, whether for its own sake or as a means to some further end."50 And Father John Ford, in a piece that certainly deserves to be more widely known outside of theological circles, puts the point several different ways: At one place he asserts that noncombatants have a right to live, even in wartime;5" and at another place he says that "to take the life of an inno- cent person is always intrinsically wrong";52 and at still a third place: "[E]very Catholic theologian would condemn as intrinsically immoral the direct killing of innocent noncombatants."53 Now, leaving aside the question of whether Miss Anscombe has de- fined murder correctly and leaving aside the question of whether Father Ford's three assertions are equivalent expressions, the serious question that does remain is what precisely they mean to assert about the intentional killing of innocent persons in time of war. There are two very different ambiguities in their statements that have to be worked out. In the first place, we have to determine whether the im- morality in question is in their view "absolute" or in some sense "prima facie." And in the second place, we should ask whether the immorality in question is in their view to be predicated of the particular act of intentional killing or of the entire war. To elaborate briefly in turn on each of these two ambiguities: Suppose someone were to claim that it is immoral or wrong to lie. He might mean any one of at least three different things: (i) He might mean that it is absolutely immoral to lie. That is to say, he might be claiming that there are no circumstances under which one would be justified in telling a lie and that there are no circumstances under which it would, morally speaking, be better to lie than to tell the truth. (2) Or he might mean that it is prima facie immoral to lie. That is to say, he might be claiming that, absent special, overriding circumstances, it is immoral to lie. On this view, even when these special, overriding circumstances do obtain so that an act of lying is justifiable, it still involves some quantum of immo- rality. (3) The third possibility is that he might mean that, typically, lying is wrong. As a rule it is immoral to lie, but sometimes it is not. And when it is not, there is nothing whatsoever wrong or immoral about telling a lie. For the purposes of the present inquiry the differences between (2) and (3) are irrelevant;54 the differences between a position of absolute immoral- 50. Anscombe, supra note 43, at 49. 5 I. Ford, supra note 47, at 269. 52. Id. at 272. 53- Id. at 273. 54. For discussion of the differences between these two positions in other contexts see Wasser- strom, The Obligation To Obey the Law, io U.C.L.A.L. REv. 780, 783-85 (I963).</page><page sequence="29">June I969] THE MORALITY OF WAR I655 ity and either (2) or (3) are not. The question of the killing of the innocents should similarly fit into the foregoing categories and identical conclusions should obtain, although to some degree the differences among these views and the plausibility of each are affected by the type of activity under con- sideration. Thus, the absolutist view, (i), may seem very strange and un- convincing when applied to lying or promise-keeping; it may seem less so, though, when applied to murder or torture. Similarly (3) may seem quite sensible when predicated of lying or promise-keeping but patently defective when applied to murder or torture. In any event the case at hand is that of murder. It is likely that Father Ford and Miss Anscombe mean to assert an absolutist view here-that there are no circumstances under which the intentional killing of innocent per- sons, even in time of war, can be justified. It is always immoral to do so.55 At least their arguments are phrased in absolutist terms. If this is the view that they intend to defend, it is, I think, a hard one to accept. This is so just because it ultimately depends upon too complete a rejection of the relevance of consequences to the moral character of action. It also requires too rigid a dichotomy between acts and omissions. It seems to misunder- stand the character of our moral life to claim that, no matter what the con- sequences, the intentional killing of an innocent person could never be justifiable-even, for example, if a failure to do so would bring about the death of many more innocent persons. This does not, of course, mean that the argument from the death of the innocent is either irrelevant or unconvincing. It can be understood to be the very convincing claim that the intentional or knowing killing of an innocent person is always prima facie (in sense (2)) wrong. A serious evil is done every time it occurs. Moreover, the severity of the evil is such that there is a strong presumption against its justifiability. The burden, and it is a heavy one, rests upon anyone who would seek to justify behavior that has as a consequence the death of innocent persons. The second question concerns what we might call the "range" of the predication of immorality. Even if we were to adopt the absolutist view in respect to the killing of the innocent, it would still remain unclear pre- cisely what it was that was immoral. The narrowest view would be that which holds that the particular action-for instance, the intentional killing of a child-is immoral and unjustified. A broader view would be one 55. I offer this interpretation because the language typically used seems to support it. For example, Miss Anscombe says: "Without understanding of this principle [of double effect], anything can be-and is wont to be-justified, and the Christian teaching that in no circumstances may one commit murder, adultery, apostasy (to give a few examples) goes by the board. These absolute prohibitions of Christianity by no means exhaust its ethic; there is a large area where what is just is determined partly by a prudent weighing up of consequences. But the prohibitions are bedrock, and without them the Christian ethic goes to pieces." Anscombe, supra note 43, at 57-58 (emphasis added). And it is also consistent with what I take to be the more general Catholic doctrine on the intentional taking of "innocent" life-the absolute prohibition against abortion on just this ground.</page><page sequence="30">I656 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 2I: Page I627 that holds that the side that engages in such killing is conducting the war immorally. But this too could mean one of two different things. A moderate view would be that if one is helpless to prevent the death of the innocent, it is appropriate to weigh such a result against such things as the rightness of the cause for which the war is being fought, the of- fensive or defensive character of the war, and so on. While there is nothing that can justify or excuse the killing of a particular innocent, this does not necessarily mean that, on balance, the total participation in the war by the side in question is to be deemed absolutely immoral and unjustifiable. A more extreme view would hold that the occurrence of even a single instance of immorality makes the entire act of fighting the war unjusti- fiable. Thus, the murder of innocent persons is absolutely immoral in not one but two quite different senses. My own view is that as a theoretical matter an absolutist position is even less convincing here. Given the number of criteria that are relevant to the moral assessment of any war and given the great number of persons involved in and the extended duration of most wars, it would be false to the complexity of the issues to suppose that so immediately simple a solu- tion were possible. But having said all of this, the practical, as opposed to the theoretical, thrust of the argument is virtually unabated. If wars were conducted, or were likely to be conducted, so as to produce only the occasional intentional killing of the innocent, that would be one thing. We could then say with some confidence that on this ground at least wars can hardly be condemned out of hand. Unfortunately, though, mankind no longer lives in such a world and, as a result, the argument from the death of the innocent has become increasingly more convincing. The intentional, or at least knowing, killing of the innocent on a large scale became a practically necessary fea- ture of war with the advent of air warfare. And the genuinely indiscrimi- nate killing of very great numbers of innocent persons is the dominant legacy of the birth of thermonuclear weapons. At this stage the argument from the death of the innocent moves appreciably closer to becoming a decisive objection to war. For even if we reject, as I have argued we should, both absolutist interpretations of the argument, the core of truth that remains is the insistence that in war, no less than elsewhere, the know- ing killing of the innocent is an evil that throws up the heaviest of justi- ficatory burdens. My own view is that in any major war that can or will be fought today, none of those considerations that can sometimes justify engaging in war will in fact come close to meeting this burden. But even if I am wrong, the argument from the death of the innocent does, I be- lieve, make it clear both where the burden is and how unlikely it is today to suppose that it can be honestly discharged.</page></plain_text>
