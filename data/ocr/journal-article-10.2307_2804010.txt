<plain_text><page sequence="1">EILBERG- SCHWARTZ, HOWARD (ed.). People of the body: Jews and Judaism from an embodied per- spective, x, 392 pp., bibliogrs. Albany: State Univ. of New York Press, 1992. $59.50 (cloth), $19.95 (paper) This volume consists of fourteen articles about Jews, their bodies, and particular parts of their anatomy, e.g. feet, noses and penises. In his introduction the editor claims that for too long Jews have portrayed themselves as 'People of the Book', stressing the cerebral and spiritual dimension of ldentity, and, have ne- glected the corporeal element, hence his title, People of the body. This reviewer considers Eil- berg-Schwartz's dichotomy strawmannish as a peg on which to hang a fine collection of inter- esting, lively, occasionally humorous, and pro- found papers. The essays, which are arranged chronologi- cally, are based on a variety of sources, texts from the Bible, Talmud, kabbalah, sixteenth century Yiddish literature, twentieth-century novels, films and jokes. Only one paper is based on anthropological fieldwork. Anticipating and disarming the obvious criticism, the editor wryly notes that his volume falls within the 'people of the book' representation that (some) Jews up- hold of themselves. One recurrent theme is the challenge to rabbinical authority by those Jews, both men and women, who were less educated in Jewish scholarship. A second pervasive theme is the relationship between Jews and non-Jews manifest in attitudes towards the body of the Jew. Eilberg-Schwartz's interesting contribution confronts the question of whether God has a form, a body and what it means to say that man is made in the image of God. He shows that while one strand of Israelite religion denies the corporeality of God, other strands attribute a form and specific organs to ham, i.e. a male form is ascribed to the deity. The problem then arises of 'only one God but two sexes of human beings' (p. 36). He shows how the tradition that man is made in the likeness of God poses prob- lems about the nature of both the human and the divine body whereas the idea that a formless God created humans from the dust of the earth poses fewer problems. Anderson examines biblical texts to investigate diverse interpretations of human sexuality in early Judaism and to contrast these views with Christian theology. He considers whether Adam and Eve, a married couple, had sexual inter- course before or after they had entered the Gar- den of Eden. Anthropologists will appreciate this discussion of the origin of the institution of marriage and also the different rabbinical stances on whether sex is permitted on the sabbath. Boyarin's essay commences with a Talmudic quotation which measure the enormous penises of various, named rabbis and progresses to a dis- cussion of grotesque bodies and farcical stories about rabbis, their anatomies, their sexuality and the conundrum that brilliant scholars produce intellectually inferior sons. He shows how such scholars reproduced themselves not by filiation but by the recruitment of outstanding young students and he documents the homo-erotic at- traction between teacher and pupil, which is both sublimated and transformed in the process of studying the Torah. Weisler compares two literary forms, one from sixteenth-century Yiddish, the musar, writ- ten by men and intended to guide women in their religious commandments, and the tkines, devotional prayers, written a century later by both men and women and also in Yiddish. The tkines were for private recitation. She demon- strates that the musar literature treats women as a category for whom Eve is the paradigm, and that the male authors seek to know 'why women are the way they are' (p. 111) whereas the tkines prayers see women as individuals with bodies who wish to discover why they suffer. Sixteenth-century kabbalistic writings form the basis for Fine's discussion of the quest for spirituality by Jewish mystics. The human soul, whose source is divine, is contrasted with the material body which is impelled towards sin. Various rituals involving mortification of the flesh are prescribed, which should fortify the soul and purify the body. Using a variety of texts from the biblical to the medieval period Wolfson studies images of God's feet and considers whether the foot is a phallic symbol. Analysing the Shiur Komah (the Measurement of Divine Dimension) possibly a tenth-century book, Janowitz investigates anthropomorphic descriptions of God's body. By learning and re- citing this text, which with 'scientific' precision quantified the size of God's limbs, individuals acquired the power to transform themselves both in this world and the world to come.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 815 Yasif documents the conflict between the re- ligious, scholarly elite and the Jewish masses in attitudes towards the body, manifest in ninth- and tenth-century Jewish folklore. One such book was deemed so blasphemous and obscene that the rabbis considered it a religious duty to bum it even when the Day of Atonement fell on the sabbath. In a brilliant analysis Yasif shows how ordinaryJews in their folk tales demarcated themselves from both the Jewish elite and the Christian world in which they lived. In a collection of high quality one of the out- standing contributions is that of Gilman who examines the Jewish foot in niineteenth-century European culture, with particular reference to medical literature. He shows that when social, particularly religious, barriers to entry in the German and Austrian armies were lowered, so physical barriers focused on the Jewish foot, were raised. Gilman reveals how Jewish and non-Jewish medical men addressed the problem of the Jewish body and how a distinction was made between the western and the east Euro- pean Jews as (some) German Jewish doctors sought to distance themselves fronm their Eastern European- co-religionists. The quest for medical respectability by Jewish doctors - amongst others, Freud - in Christian medical circles of cen-tral Europe is tackled by Geller in his discussion of the Jewish nose and the association of Jews with1 the sense of smell which was lheld to be keener among animals and less developed humans, among whom Jews were numbered. Biale examines attitudes to the body by early Zionist writers who sought to create a new muscularJew in Palestine as opposed to the en- feebled, neurotic, EuropeanJew. He shows how the promise of erotic liberation that Zionism had offered as a revolt against European bour- geois andJewish society ultimately failed in the course of building the new nation, where com- rades were seen as brothers and sisters, so that an erotic relationship betweeni them would be deemed incestuLous. Wasserfall's ethnograph-y, based oni Moroccan immigrant womenl in anll Israeli co-operative vil- lage, examines their interpretation of menstrua- tion (niiddah) and subsequent purification in the ritual bath (miqve). She contrasts the women's explanation with that of rabbiniical authority. They and Wasserfall argue that menstrual blood converts the girl into a woman whilst the miqve turns the woman into a Jew (p. 317). She pro- ceeds to analyse the sexual politics between hus- band and wife over the manipulation of the rules of niiddah and subsequent attendance at the mniqve, without which ritual, conjugal relations may not resume. A scintillating essay is Prell's 'Why Jewish princesses don't sweat'. She commences with an exposition of popular cuLlture, especially jokes, about the middle-class, Jewish, American woman in the t970s and links this material to structural changes in American society. She fo- cuses onJewish participation in both the culture of consumption and in membership of the new managerial/professional middle class and shows the differential involvement of both men and women in these socio-economic processes. The final essay, Alpert's, sits uneasily with the others, since it is more a cultural and political programme for Jewish lesbianism than a socio- logical analysis. Overall these essays are of high quality, and three in particular (Boyarin, Gilman and Prell) are excellent. My quibble is with the editing, which seems to be minimal; for example, there is no translation of key Hebrew terms (p. 119) in Fine's essay, nor is there a glossary; elsewhere works are cited but not included in the bibliog- raphy.These cavils apart, the book should prove valuable in courses on the body, gender, race and Jewish studies.
