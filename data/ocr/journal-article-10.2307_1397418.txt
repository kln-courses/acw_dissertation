<plain_text><page sequence="1">HERBERT FEIGL Critique of Intuition According to Scientific Empiricism "Is there intuitive knowledge?" The answer to this question depends on which meaning we associate with the notoriously ambiguous term "intuition." In what follows I shall first attempt to list and discuss brief- ly the philosophically more important meanings of "intuition." Once these diverse meanings are differentiated, I shall proceed to assess the possibility and the validity especially of trans-empirical intuitive knowledge in the light of the epistemology of scientific empiricism. I realize fully that this is a typical Western point of view; and, although I have made sincere efforts to understand and to appreciate the roles assigned to intuition in Oriental (as well as in Occidental) philosophies, my Western bias and "scientism" will remain all too obvious. "Divide and conquer" is the maxim of analytic philosophy. However, we are not splitting hairs just for the enjoyment of the exercise. We distinguish between the various uses of the word "intuition" (and of related terms) in order to prevent confusion. And it is not merely clarity of discourse and com- munication, eminently desirable though it is in itself, which we are seeking. In the present context, just as in most other contexts of philosophy, clarity and univocality are prerequisites for making sure that credit is given only where it is due. If "intuition" in one of its many senses designates a way of knowing, it need nort, and indeed does not, designate such a way in some of the other senses. I shall try to show that the claims made for trans-empirical intuition are all too often supported by spurious reasons. These reasons are spurious, and in the end illegitimate, precisely because of shifts in meaning of the word "intuition." These shifts are, of course, made quite unwittingly. But it has always been, and will remain, an indispensable part of the Socratic- analytic technique to focus the spotlight of attention on the ambiguity of terms and the dangers of confusion. The word "intuition" lends itself easily to shifts in meaning because there is a common core, at least a tenuous one, in all its connotations. If these *This article is the first in a projected series on the question of intuition in Asian and Western philosophies. (It is based on a lecture at the University of Hawaii in May, 19 8.) 1</page><page sequence="2">2 HERBERT FEIGL connotations were as disparate as, e.g., in the case of the word "induction," the likelihood of confusion would be much smaller. The meanings of "in- duction" in the lingo of the Armed Forces, in the terminology of electro- dynamics, and in that of logic are so far apart that only a pedant would insist on affixing subscripts to the word or on inventing new terms for at least two of the meanings. The common core in the many connotations of "intuition" is, of course, immediacy. Intuition has thus been contrasted, traditionally and quite gen- erally, with indirect, mediate, relational, or inferential knowledge. Intuition is often identified with direct insight or immediate apprehension. The meta- phors of "apprehending" and "grasping" are as common among the syn- onyms of "intuition" as are "seeing," "beholding," etc. Directly seeing or grasping does not involve laborious reasoning. The idea of a "royal road" or perhaps of a "short cut" to truth or knowledge has been perennially tempt- ing to one type of philosophers. They have maintained, often with a venge- ance, that ordinary, labored, reasoned, discursive knowledge does not even penetrate to the heart of things, and that the essence of reality can be known only by intuition. But of this I shall have to say more after I have soberly listed, and briefly commented upon, the prominent usages of the word "in- tuition." First to be mentioned is awareness (and awareness of awareness) of: simple sensory qualia like, e.g., red and green, hot and cold, rough and smooth; relational and Gestalt patterns such as the configurations in the visual field,, or the experienced-sound patterns of music in the auditory field. Similarly "direct" are the images of recollection, and also the images of the creative imagination. We have reports about composers (like, e.g., Mozart) who were able to "hear" internally some of their musical compositions.be- fore they wrote them. Similarly with artists in other fields who behold the image of their work before they execute it-more or less along the lines "envisioned" by them. As Thomas Mann put it in his Death in Venice, it is a matter of "hot conception" and of (subsequent) "cool production." The essential feature of "intuition" in this first sense is, of course, direct experi- ence. We shall see later that it is imperative not to confuse direct experience as such with propositionally formulated knowledge-claims about it. Second, there is a strictly philosophical and technical use of the word "intuition" which we owe to Kant, or, rather, to the English translation of Kant, because in German it is "reine Anschauang" (i.e., "pure visualiza- tion," if I may translate literally, but the customary translation of Kant's German is "pure intuition"). According to Kant, we have a direct apprehen- sion of the forms of space and time. Plato long before Kant had already</page><page sequence="3">CRITIQUE OF INTUITION ACCORDING TO SCIENTIFIC EMPIRICISM 3 maintained that we are aware of certain fundamental ideas, forms, or essences. This idea has been revived in many other forms of philosophy, most recently perhaps in the phenomenological school, where vision or apprehension of essences is an alleged method of purely philosophical knowledge. There is not sufficient space to deal critically with all of these in one short essay, but I want to list them at least. Suffice it to note here that the ascription of apodic- tic truth to judgments of "pure intuition" has been severely criticized, and is in any case open to the charge of "psychologism"---the very mistake that Husserl exposed and opposed so vigorously in his Logical Investigations.' Third, there are the alleged judgments of direct knowledge, the "self- evident" truths. Here, again, it is claimed that there is a kind of knowledge that is not labored, that is not derived, that is not proved; it is supposed to be neither in need of proof nor capable of proof because it constitutes the very premises of our reasoning. So, we are told that we have intuitive or direct knowledge of the axioms of logic, of arithmetic, of topology; i.e., of the semi-quantitative structure of space, and even of some of the axioms of geometry such as the parallel axiom. This has been maintained by many philosophers. After the development of the non-Euclidean geometries, how- ever, some of these claims were toned down considerably. Also to be men- tioned here are the principles of common-sense knowledge, especially the much-used and often-quoted principles of sufficient reason, of causality, and the related principle of induction, all of which are supposed to be self-evident. In the ethical domain, we are told, there is moral intuition, or the "voice of conscience," which enables us to discriminate between right and wrong, good and bad, or good and evil. There is a whole school of intuitionist philosophers in ethics, with G. E. Moore as a prominent recent representative. The entire trend of empiricist philosophy, beginning with Hume, has cast serious doubt upon the validity of such knowledge by intuition. Fourth, we occasionally find claims to the effect that there is such a thing as "instinctive knowledge." But it is fairly clear that on the level of Homo sapiens there is precious little that is instinctive in the genuine sense in which the word is used by psychologists and biologists as referring to innate capaci- ties. In human beings, the innate capacities are so quickly overlaid by the products of learning, training, or imitation that only a few reflexes and a few concatenations of reflexes can be said to be instinctive. If we want to use the word "knowledge" in the case of animals, then certainly we could speak of the instinctive capacities of birds knowing how to build nests, of beavers knowing how to build dams, of bees and ants knowing how to 'Edmund Husseri, Logische Untersucbungen (Halle a.d..: M. Niemeyer, 1913-22).</page><page sequence="4">4 HERBERT FEIGL communicate with each other in certain ways. But the question is, can we call this knowledge? (The word "knowledge" is, of course, also extremely ambiguous.) In the case of human beings, this is highly questionable. Psychologists have suggested that empathy has an innate component; by the very fact that we are human beings, we understand each other on a rather direct level. Here the Germans have coined the term "Einfiihlung," which literally translated would mean "the act of feeling oneself into the other person's mind." (When one person says to another, "I know just how you feel," this is an act of empathy, and the speaker is participating imaginatively in the feelings and sentiments of the other.) To what extent the capacity of direct intuition is innate on the human level remains to be empirically examined. However, that we have the capacity of learning how to interpret certain clues given by behavior, such as voice intonation, posture, facial expression, etc., is granted, of course. The question is whether empathy is not wholly or at least largely a product of learning. I shall take this up further a little later under the "hunch." Fifth, we have reports of extrasensory perception, based on a great deal of evidence, but I shall not discuss the merits of the experimental studies at Duke University or the even more spectacular ones conducted in England. I am sufficiently impressed by the evidence to say that here is something that neither psychologists nor philosophers can any longer afford to ignore merely because it disagrees with their prejudices. In other words, I am strenuously going through the motions of an open mind. The point is that there is statistical evidence for the occurrence of clairvoyance, telepathy, and pre- cognition, which cannot be plausibly explained within the traditional scientific framework. It is important to note concerning extrasensory perception, as it has been experimentally and statistically verified, that the individual percip- ient does not know when he hits the "target"; there is no bell in his mind that rings and says, "Now this time you got it." There is no subjective indicator for the correctness of telepathy or clairvoyance. We certainly need further experimental investigations, and later perhaps an attempt at scientific theories, before we jump to any philosophical, let alone theological, con- clusions. Sixth, we come to the "hunch." I use this word from American slang for the simple reason that I cannot think of any other more expressive term to put this briefly. I could, of course, define it more fully. A social psychologist once gave me such formal definitions as these: "the intuitive process consists of a convergence of as yet unverbalized experiences organically included in a pattern of response below the threshold of critical attention, which pattern may emerge in part and when verbalized serve as a partial explanation of</page><page sequence="5">CRITIQUE OF INTUITION ACCORDING TO SCIENTIFIC EMPIRICISM 5 the problem which acted as the original stimulus." (A rather formidable definition.) A little more briefly: "Intuition is a judgment based on the convergence and integration of former impressions or memories into a pat- tern of explanation or expectation in which perceptual details are not on the threshold of critical attention." This can be elucidated by examples. Recall the older generation of doctors. The doctor enters the room of the patient, sniffs the air, takes the patient's hand, and says, "You have diabetes." How does he know? A clue probably paves the way for his diagnosis. If sniffing the air in a patient's room has, in the past, been a clue to him in acute cases of diabetes, now medical science knows that the breath of such a patient contains acetone, a fruity smelling vapor which the "intuitive" doctor recog- nizes without actually being aware of what he is doing. Similarly, an experi- enced engineer might, after one look at a bridge or other structure, say, "This is going to break down fairly soon." If you ask him how he knows, he says, "I just know." The first impression, based implicitly on his rich past experi- ence, is that the structure will not last. Later, perhaps, he could make the reasons for his belief explicit. Also, the experienced geologist in the field may suddenly say, "There is oil underneath here." How does he know? He does not smell it, he does not have clairvoyant capacities, but he has had a great deal of relevant experience. Moreover, clinical psychologists and, for that matter, everybody to some extent practices empathy. This is not neces- sarily innate, but was probably acquired by learning processes. We project ourselves into the other person's situation. Here, again, it is difficult to describe just what clues we utilize, but it stands to reason that if one does not have telepathic capacities, and if one does not see or hear the other person, one cannot practice this kind of empathy. But, even if we do see and hear the other person, it is very hard to describe the actual aspects or configurations in his facial expression, tone of voice, posture, and so on; but many of us have a certain subtlety in knowing immediately whether we bore our partner in conversation, whether we amuse, flatter, or insult him. However, what actually goes on in a case like this would be extremely difficult to describe. Take graphology, for example. From a philosophical point of view, I do not see why some personality traits or momentary moods might not express them- selves in handwriting. I think there is a good deal of scientific evidence that handwriting does express a number of these personality facets. There are some so-called "gifted graphologists" who, with just one glance at a piece of writing, can tell what kind of a character the writer has. These gifted graphol- ogists can read out of handwriting specific character and personality traits. Naturally, we ask how do they do it? We are told: "Well, they have a gift for it, that's all." But this is no answer, of course. An answer would have</page><page sequence="6">6 HERBERT FEIGL to be found scientifically. Again, we must ask, what are the dues, perhaps not so much in detail but in the total configuration of the handwriting that triggers the graphologist's judgment Now, even if we do not have a theory as to how such a graphologist achieves all this, we can glean certain empirical regularities by using him as a guinea pig in an experiment, ie., by confront- ing him with a variety of types of handwriting and noting how he reacts and to what. In this way we establish empirical correlations as to what his dues are, as to what stimuli he uses in interpreting handwriting by his "intuitive" procedure. This type of activity dearly falls in the rubric of the "hunch." We can define the "hunch," then, as "a product of learning from past experi- ence, which learning is not made explicit at the moment of the use of judg- ment." The judgment occurs like a flash of insight and therefore involves what has been rather precariously called "unconscious inference." We can hardly question the fact that in the understanding that we extend to each other in everyday life there is an element of this sort of subconscious learn- ing. How does the baby know that the mother is friendly? The mother smiles. There is a school of psychologists who maintain that there is some- thing inherent in the configuration of the smile which suggests friendliness. But psychologists have made experiments; they have had frowning and stern- looking mothers approach the baby, give it candy or milk, stroke it, etc., and, of course, the baby took the stern face as an expression of friendliness. Hence, it depends on the pattern that surrounds the experience and not on some innate capacity for the interpretation of facial expressions. Furthermore, there are other aspects of the "hunch," such as in problem-solving. There is the case of the scientific or technological genius who, after a long period of pondering about a problem, suddenly "perceives" a solution. Sometimes this happens even during sleep; the thinker awakes in the morning with the solution of which he had no idea on the previous evening. Minor instances of this sort of problem-solving occur in all of us in various life-situations. The final "clicking" of our mind is similar to that of the genius, and may not be fully intelligible even to ourselves. Seventh, and last, there is mystical or trans-empirical intuition. Here, in contradistinction to the hunch, the target or object of the intuition is claimed to be something that is absolutely beyond the reach of ordinary experience and reasoning, something which cannot be checked empirically. In sharp contrast, the empirical hunch and extrasensory perception have this much in common: their target, or the object of intuition, is empirical; statements about it can be confirmed or disconfirmed by ordinary observation. For instance, if I were a clairvoyant, I could say, "My house (many miles distant) is on fire now." If you ask me how I know, I might say, "I just know-it</page><page sequence="7">CRITIQUE OF INTUITION ACCORDING TO SCIENTIFIC EMPIRICISM 7 came to me in a flash." A house on fire is something we can check; we can go there, call up, find out, and so on. Similarly, if the geologist has a hunch that there is oil somewhere underneath the ground, we can drill for it (it might be expensive or hopeless, of course); we can find out whether the geologist is right or wrong. Likewise, in the case of crystal-gazers, if they have premonitions on the basis of crystal-gazing, we can find out whether or not they are right and in what percentage of cases. The hunch--be it that of the geologist or that of the physician who makes a flash diagnosis of diabetes which can be verified by a laboratory test--can be empirically tested. On the other hand, trans-empirical knowledge-claims, mystical intuitions, as I understand them, cannot be tested empirically. Mysticism, especially religious mysticism, claims to give us knowledge about something which cannot be independently reached through ordinary channels, knowledge which cannot be checked, which cannot be tested in the. usual empirical way. In other words, here, supposedly, we have a new and independent way of getting at truth. No doubt, some philosophers have been entranced by the hope of finding a "way of knowing directly" in contrast to the arduous and dusty way of the laboratory. It would be wonderful to get at the Absolute by a flash of insight Mystical intuition differs from the hunch and extrasensory perception in deliberately and avowedly aiming at a trans-empirical target. With religious mysticism, the target is God; with metaphysical mysticism, it may be the Absolute, as we find it particularly in some Eastern, but also in some Western, philosophies. Of course, not all philosophers try to attain a knowledge of God or the Absolute by intuition; there are some, to be sure, who try to construct rational proofs for the existence of one or the other. I am not talking about these philosophers. Here I am concerned exclusively with those philosophers who do maintain that we can get a knowledge of the Absolute or of God by intuition. With the list of the meanings of the word "intuition" now completed, I turn to a critique of the last-mentioned form, i.e., of trans-empirical intuition. In accordance with my bias toward the Western "rationalistic" tradition, I am naturally suspicious of the knowledge claims of trans-empirical intuition. As I often say (perhaps I borrowed this from Bertrand Russell), I prefer the "silent mystic," because, when a mystic begins to speak, he admits that he is not speaking directly, but indirectly; his language does not describe, it cir- cumscribes; he is not really giving an adequate account of what he actually experiences, of what he knows through intuition. The mystic can merely allude to what he has experienced, he can only hint at it; he is, in fact, almost helpless in expressing himself about the great blaze of glory that he beholds. Now, I think we must admit the occurrence of mystical experiences; there</page><page sequence="8">8 HERBERT FEIGL is a great deal of evidence that cannot be ignored. What we may question, however, from a philosophical point of view, is the interpretation of mystical experiences. I do not for a moment doubt that some people have very special, powerful, ecstatic experiences. However, even though such people cannot dearly describe what they experience, they nevertheless maintain that they apprehend the Absolute, or, in the case of the religious mystic especially, that intuitive insight provides a direct avenue to the knowledge of God, which cannot be reached in any other way. Of course, mystical visions differ widely, but, among the religious mystics, there is a large subgroup whose members, no matter how they diverge in detail, do perceive the Deity as a personal being; there is, one may say, a large measure of agreement among these mystics in regard to the apprehension of a personal God. To be sure, there are Eastern as well as Western mystical visions in which a purely impersonal absolute ground or all-embracing unity of reality is apprehended. In the light of the prevalent sequence, manifest in many cultures, from magic, animism, polytheistic mythologies, monotheistic creeds, to more abstract religions, it is not implausible that Brahman or the Absolute represents a final stage in the successive depersonalization (demythologization) of historically ante- cedent highly anthropomorphic deities. The skeptics throughout the ages have tried to account for mystical experi- ence in a naturalistic way. The mystic's reply to the skeptic is that mate- rialists, rationalists, positivists, empiricists, or whatever, have no justification, have no basis for talking about the knowledge-claims of mysticism, are talking like the blind man about the colors. To this I reply that the blind man can know something about the colors; and I urge that the claims of trans-empirical knowledge be more carefully scrutinized. In order to proceed with this strategy, it is necessary first to review the familiar distinction be- tween "intuitive" and "discursive" knowledge. This distinction has been noted in all ages of philosophy, but more especially in recent times. Among the philosophers of the twentieth century, this distinction is frequently made. William James, for instance, distinguished between "knowledge of" and "knowledge about." While the blind man may know nothing of the colors, he can know something about the colors. If someone does not have a sense of humor, says Eddington, he has no intimate knowledge of what a joke is; this may be reflected in his behavior in that he never laughs when exposed to a joke. However, one may still have a psychological theory about jokes and about the comical, even if he is lacking in the capacity of laughing about them. In Eddingron's terms, the distinction is between "intimate" and "symbolic" knowledge. According to him, psychological theory, just like any scientific</page><page sequence="9">CRITIQUE OF INTUITION ACCORDING TO SCIENTIFIC EMPIRICISM 9 account, gives us "merely" symbolic, but not intimate knowledge. Bergson, in a very similar vein, claims "absolute" character for intuitive knowledge, and "relative" character for discursive knowledge." F.S.C. Northrop stresses the fundamental difference between "concepts by intuition" and "concepts by postulation." Important features of his epistemology and philosophy of science are based on this contrast.3 Bertrand Russell's well-known distinction between "knowledge by acquaintance" and "knowledge by description" seems to aim in the same direction, but it is of the utmost importance not to con- fuse mere acquaintance, Le., the having, or living through of direct experi- ence, with knowing something about it. Moritz Schlick,' the leader of the Vienna Circle of Logical Positivists, drew this indispensable distinction with superb clarity. ("Erleben" and "Erkennen" were his key terms for this con- trast.) A description of immediate experience, be it in phenomenological or introspective terms, is genuinely cognitive in that it consists of statements which may be either true or false. But it simply does not make sense to ascribe truth or falsity to immediate experience itself. As merely "had," lived through, enjoyed, or suffered, it makes no truth claim; it does not assert or deny anything. It just occurs. (Mystics, as I understand them, do make knowledge claims, albeit of a very special kind; and they never restrict these knowledge-claims to a mere description of their direct experience. I shall return later to the problem of the justification of knowledge-claims transcend- ing direct experience.) The ambiguity just uncovered thus necessitates the distinction between two meanings of "intuition" to which I briefly referred but which was not as yet spelled out in the first item of the list presented above. But it should be obvious how much, by way of philosophical implications, hinges precisely upon a firm grasp of the difference between acquaintance and knowledge by acquaintance. There are a good many philosophers who have been alert to this difference. If I read John Dewey correctly, he certainly was; similarly, though possibly for different reasons, most of the critical realists emphasized the difference between direct experience and knowledge proper.5 We are now ready for the discussion of the blind man and his knowledge about colors. Let us assume that we deal with a congenitally blind person. 'See Henri Bergson, An Introduction to Metaphysics, T. E. Hulme, trans. (New York and London: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1912). 3See F. S. C. Northrop, The Logic of the Sciences and the Humanities (New York: The Macmil- lan Co., 1947). 4Moritz Schlick, Allgemeine Erkenntnislebre (Berlin: Springer, 1918, 1925). "More recently Albert Hofsauder, in a article "Does Intuitive Knowledge Exist?" Philosophical Studies, VI (1955), 81-87, formulates very clearly two senses of "intuicion" as follows: (1) intuition as immediate awareness of an object, content, or subject-matter, and (2) incuicion as a mode of knowledge developed on the basis of immediate apprehension.</page><page sequence="10">10 HERBERT FEIGL Let us assume, furthermore, that as a psychological matter of fact (which might be questioned, of course) such a person cannot have images of visual shapes or colors. He gets about in life by tactile and auditory sensations, but is completely lacking in the visual field. Regardless of this handicap, however, such a person could learn something about colors; he could learn to distinguish between, e.g., red and green, with the help of experimental devices. How is this possible? Is there a genuine substitute? I do not wish to mislead the reader. I am certainly not asserting that knowledge about, or knowledge by description, can be a substitute for immediate experience; by merely getting indirectly at the colors of physical objects, or of various colored lights, the blind man cannot obtain any direct visual experience. Neverthe- less, I do assert that the blind man can know all about the colors. I am argu- ing that the blind man can know all about the colors, both physically and psychologically, without ever having a color-experience himself. How? A blind man can be equipped with modern electronic apparatus--a spectro- scope, a photo-electric cell, an amplifier, earphones, or a loud-speaker-and the light waves that come from luminous sources or are reflected from physical objects may be transformed or "translated" into sounds in the ear- phones or the loud-speaker. Of course, it would be very misleading to say that he hears the colors, but he does get dues concerning the physical charac- teristics, such as the wave length, the frequency and intensity, etc, of the radiations impinging upon his apparatus. But it may be urged that this concerns the physical stimuli and not the psychological color-experience. Can the blind man investigate the psychology of colors? Of course he can, if he proceeds in the manner of a behavioristic psychologist In this case he could experiment with an individual who does have eyesight and hence reacts in a discriminatory way to various stimuli which the blind man estab- lishes independently by means of the photosensitive electronic gadgets at his disposal These devices may be even more sensitive than the human eye. The blind man, then, could be the psychologist of someone else; thus, while he cannot experience the colors, he can study color-perception in the other person. He does this in the way in which anyone might study the other person's mind in all domains of its experience. The advantage of the person with visual experience over the congenitally blind person thus consists simply in the greater scope of his acquaintance, and hence a broader basis for his knowledge by acquaintance. But it should by now be fairly obvious that, while this advantage is great from a practical and pragmatic point of view, it is nevertheless true that as long as one has a "foothold" somewhere in direct experience, any sort of existent may well be accessible through knowledge by description. This, after all, is the only</page><page sequence="11">CRITIQUE OF INTUITION ACCORDING TO SCIENTIFIC EMPIRICISM 11 epistemological view which renders plausible our knowledge of unobserved and unobservable entities, as, e.g., in modern physics. In regard to all electro- magnetic waves outside the narrow "octave" of visible light, all human beings are "blind." If we are not to commit the reductive fallacies of phenomenalism, the knowledge of physical fields, atomic and subatomic particles and events, must be reconstructed in terms of highly indirect confirmation. The evi- dential data of the confirmation may well be identified as the "postanalyt- ically given," i.e., as data of direct acquaintance. But knowledge proper is not limited to a mere description of these data. Common-sense knowledge, and to a much vaster extent scientific knowledge, goes beyond these data. It does so by connecting the data through postulated lawful relationships with in- ferred entities. For our present purpose, it does not matter much whether we analyze theoretical knowledge of this sort in terms of postulate systems and their empirical interpretation, or represent it more picturesquely in terms of a "nomological net" which is tied down to the data in a few places but includes besides a vast array of unobserved and unobservable entities. As long as these postulated entities are richly connected with each other as well as with various observation bases, the corresponding theoretical terms possess empirical significance as well as scientific "objectivity" (i.e., intersubjectivity). My main point should by now be fairly obvious. The "private," direct experiences of various persons have a place in the nomological net of science. They can be "triangulated" from various, and often quite heterogeneous, areas of evidence. That is to say, the "privacy" of first-person experiences is, at least from the scientific point of view, never absolute. It is the relative, contextual privacy connected with the difference between direct and indirect verification. What one person experiences directly can be known about, i.e., inferred, by another person. That is why and how a congenitally blind per- son can come to know about the color-experiences of persons equipped with eyesight. The case of mystical vision may prima facie appear analogous, but I shall now argue that it is fundamentally different. The analogy appears plausible at first because mystical vision is regarded as-"in principle"- just as intersubjective as is ordinary vision. It is crucially important, how- ever, to remember that "intersubjectiviry" in common life and in science does not mean merely a certain communality of experience. Communality of experience is neither necessary nor sufficient for intersubjectivity. It is not necessary because, as the example of the blind and the seeing person demonstrates, intersubjective knowledge concerning physical objects as well as concerning mental states can be achieved without similar ("communal") evidential data. And it is dearly not sufficient in that common (similar)</page><page sequence="12">12 HERBERT FEIGL experiences even of a large number of persons need not at all indicate what they are often believed to indicate. "Forty million Frenchmen can be wrong!" The preceding remarks apply to mysticism if mystical experience, or pos- sibly religious experience generally, is taken as evidence for trans-empirical or "supernaturalistic" knowledge-claims. This puts the mystic within the purview and jurisdiction of the criteria of the inductive or hypothetico-de- ductive methods. That is to say, the justification of knowledge-claims in this type of metaphysics or theology is conceived in analogy to the "transcendent" hypotheses' in scientific theories. Here it is always possible to ask whether these hypotheses are really necessary in order to account for the data of observation. And in the spirit of the well-known story about Laplace the an- swer may well be: "Nous n'avons pas besoin de cette hypothese." Within the framework of scientific method (and this is merely a refinement of the framework of sound common sense) we must ask as to whether certain com- munalities of direct experience (such as the religious or the mystical) cannot be explained in a perfectly "naturalistic" way. I am quite confident that this can be done. The many significant contributions that have been made toward a psychology of religion make this extremely plausible. I shall utilize here the general lines of argument as presented in the psychoanalytic theory of religious experience. Although I am by no means convinced that Freud (e.g., in his The Future of an Illusion) has rendered full justice to religion, and, although I seriously question many of the dogmas of the outlook of Freud and his disciples, I think there are sound and important points in the Freudian view which have not been sufficiently taken into consideration by many philosophers. Very briefly, what I think is valid and sound in these explanations of religious experience is simply that whatever communalities we find are explainable in terms of the natural condition of man, and do not require anything beyond that. Freud, like many another genius, has put his finger on something obvious that we should have discovered a long time ago, but which apparently was not obvious to philosophers or psychologists. What Freud points out is simply this: the reason so many people, in such varied cultural situations, believe in, or even have the experience of, a personal God, is that they were all helpless infants and children at one time, surrounded by comparatively all-powerful adults on whom they depended, at first for 6W.

Now, all this may sound quite atheistic, bur note that it is only a rejoinder to the argument from religious experience. Thomas Aquinas, for instance, did not pay much attention to this argument; he emphasized the cosmological and the teleological arguments. I am not discussing the issue of theology in general, but simply the fashionable argument from religious experience which maintains that it cannot be mere chance that so many people, under widely differing conditions, have had this sort of experience, and that therefore it must be due to the Deity. I do not claim that I can demonstrate definitively the invalidity of this argument, but the argument is highly questionable, and the advances in psy- chology indicate more and more that the father and mother images which play a leading role in many prominent religions of mankind may be ex- plained on a perfectly natural, all-too-obvious human basis. The point of all this is that while I do not for a moment deny the fact of intuitive experiences, I do question some of their interpretations. I am ques- tioning especially the sort of interpretations for which the "religious realists" have argued. At this point I am usually told that the tables may well be turned on the naturalistic atheist: his refusal to believe, his lack of religious experience, can equally well be explained on psychological or psychoanalytic grounds. His aversion to "father figures" of any sort may well be due to a strong Oedipus complex. To this I reply that if our psychology is to be ade- quate at all, it should be able to account for the atheist's attitude just as much as for the attitude of the theist (and, mutatis mutandis, for the metaphysi- cian's belief in Absolutes, as well as for the positivist's militant repudiation of Absolutes). But this is exactly as it should be. From a scientific point of view, both sorts of attitudes should be explainable'on the basis of the same type of psychological premisses. The argument which attempted to "turn the tables" on the naturalist is beside the point; it does not concern the issue un- der dispute. The question was: can the communalities of religious experience be explained without theological hypotheses? And to this question I have sketched an affirmative reply. Another counter-argument frequently used by metaphysicians and theologians accuses the naturalist or the scientific empiricist of presupposing a metaphysics of his own--viz., the belief that whatever is real (objectively or intersubjectively existent) can be cognitively attained in more than one way. This is indeed in keeping with the modern naturalist's view of reality (indicated above) as a "nomological net" within which all points can be</page><page sequence="14">14 HERBERT FEIGL logically "triangulated" from many different bases. If this be metaphysics, make the least of it! It is certainly not metaphysics in the sense of transcend- ent speculation which is proof against disproof by being immune to empiri- cal testing of any sort whatever. It is metaphysics--inductive metaphysics if you please-in the rather innocuous sense of a broad and admittedly ten- tative generalization based on the successes of the scientific method to date. We have come to expect a certain congruence of the epistemology of con- firmation with the scientific account of the processes of cognition. This is clearly the case with normal perceptual knowledge. The very view of the world which finds its empirical confirmation in perceptual data contains as one of its parts the physics, psychophysics, and psychophysiology of percep- tion, and thus provides at least in outline an explanation of the ways in which human organisms come to know their physical environment. Note now the contrast with the "transcendent" metaphysics and theology, Occidental as well as Oriental. Mystical intuition of the Absolute or of the Deity, just as much as revelation, must remain unexplainable mysteries if the objects of such intuitions or revelations are not accessible through any other avenue of evidence. And even if, along the lines of the customary arguments, other evidential avenues are adduced, there are at least sketches of natural- istic-empiricist explanations which explain the alleged evidence more simply and parsimoniously. The principle of parsimony, it should be remembered, is an essential aspect of all justifiable explanations. It is part and parcel of what we ail mean by the "rationality" of inductive or hypothetico-deductive inference. The theologian or the metaphysician usually terminates his ex- planations with the admission of "impenetrable mysteries"; whereas the adherent of the scientific method uses well-confirmed theoretical postulates as the premisses of his explanations, and acknowledges unsolved, but not unsolvable, problems, along the path of his advancing inquiries7. Let us consider one more argument in favor of the cognitive significance of mystical intuition. It may be said that in all the preceding discussions we have not considered an essential aspect of intuition, namely, intuition as total or partial identification of the knowing subject with the to-be-known object. Religious mystics speak of "identification" or "direct participation" as the essence of their vision of God. And Bergson---as well as many Asian mystics -refers to intuition as a way of directly knowing the Absolute and similarly describes it as an act of identification or coalescence. But Bergson rather help- 'A discussion of the "riddles of the universe" would take us far beyond the limits of the present paper. Elsewhere I have attempted to show quite comprehensively how the most perplexing of them all, i. e., the mind-body problem, may be disentangled, and that a monistic solution can be defended on epistemological and scientific grounds. See H. Feigl, "The 'Mental' and the 'Physical,'" in Con- cepts, Theories and ibe Mind-Body Problem, Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science. Vol. II (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1958), pp. 370-497.</page><page sequence="15">CRITIQUE OF INTUITION ACCORDING TO SCIENTIFIC EMPIRICISM 15 fully gives his case away by telling us (in his Introduction to Metaphysics): "Metaphysics... is the science which claims to dispense with symbols.... There is one reality, at least, which we all seize from within, by intuition, and not by simple analysis. It is our own personality in its flowing through time'." And, in what follows, Bergson gives us a superb phenomenological description of the stream of consciousness. Let us note two important points. First, and inconsistently with the first pronouncement, this description is given with the help of words and sentences (and these are surely symbolic). Sec- ond, the prime illustration for intuition by identification is self-awareness. If "identity" is understood in the strict sense of logical, numerical identity, then identification with one's direct experience can amount to no more than just living through one's experience; and, if our earlier analysis is accepted, this does not by itself constitute knowledge at all. Even such introspective or phenomenological descriptions as Bergson provides utilize analysis, classifi- cation, and symbolization. They are claims of knowledge by acquaintance, but not merely acquaintance in the sense of pure, direct experience. I conclude that the mystic is misled by the power of his experiences to regard them as genuinely cognitive insights. He thus confuses either raw experience with introspective knowledge concerning it, or he considers the data of mystical vision as evidence for a transcendent reality thus appre- hended. If he does the first, he relinquishes the claim of attaining an Absolute that is supposed to exist over and above his personal experience. If he does the latter, he cannot expect his critics to admit mystical visions as self-au- thenticating-, in this case his position is open to the criticisms advanced above, i.e., to the charge that he ignores what in all scientific plausibility his "evi- dence" indicates. It does seem to indicate, not a transcendent Absolute, God, World-Spirit, or the like, but, rather, that the belief in such overarching realities is one of the fondest illusions of mankind, engendered by wishful thinking on the part of human beings precariously embedded in a universe that they did not make, that they only very incompletely understand, and in which they still seek, like helpless children, some reassurance of superior moral guidance and ultimate salvation. And even if the motivation of wish- ful thought is completely detached from our moral anxieties and from the hopes or fears of a life after death, the impulse to know and to understand existence as whole may explain, though it does not justify, the belief that intuition can afford a glimpse of absolute reality beyond all appearance. Einstein's "cosmic religion," in which God is identified with the order or "rationality" of Nature, is a good example of this type of thought--on the 'P. 9.</page><page sequence="16">16 HERBERT FEIGL part of one of the most enlightened scientists that we may ever hope to en- counter. A world view that is in keeping with our new age of enlightenment has been proposed by scientific humanism and empiricism.' By contrast, the dogmatic views of many "enlighteners" of the eighteenth century and the equally dogmatic ("negativistic") doctrines of nineteenth- and twentieth- century positivism, such as scientific humanism, should not. claim that all problems have been solved by science, or that even the general frame of the present scientific outlook will never change. There may indeed be "more things in heaven and earth than our philosophy has dreamt of." But adopting the policy of the open mind of scientific humanism does not prevent us from criticizing what is fallacious in various philosophical doctrines which con- sider intuition as a way of justifying knowledge-claims. In sum, then, intuition in the sense of direct experience is never the fin- ished product of knowledge. It is, rather, either the raw material of knowl- edge, i.e., the confirmation basis of genuine knowledge-claims, or it is a way of arriving at hypotheses which may or may not be found tenable on the basis of further evidence. There is no doubt that intuition in the sense of the "hunch" is often helpful in providing suggestions for the solution of problems or for the diagnosis of various physical, and, in the case of empathy, mental, conditions."' But no matter how strong the "intuitive conviction" in these cases may be, it does not by itself justify the knowledge-claims which are made. Independent intersubjectively accessible evidence provides the only justification that can be accepted as "rational." Intuition (in the sense of direct experience) is neither rational nor irrational. What must be criti- cized as irrational is the use of intuitive experience in the justification of genuine knowledge-claims. If intuition provides the raw data of knowledge, then, in addition to it, principles of inference are needed. If "intuition" is taken in the sense of the hunch, then only a statistical study of the truth- frequency of these hunches on the part of a given subject and under given conditions could justify any sort of reliance upon it. And any claims for metaphysical or religious insight obtain their plausibility only by borrowing credit from other, and, as we have seen, very different processes which are unfortunately and indiscriminately also comprehended by the extremely ambiguous term "intuition."
