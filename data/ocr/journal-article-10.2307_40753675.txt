<plain_text><page sequence="1">D. H. LAWRENCE'S ANNOTATION OF OUSPENSKY'S TERTIUM ORGANUM By E. W. Tedlock, Jr. In the Taos, New Mexico, Public Library there is a copy of P. D. Ous- pensky' s Tertium Organum: A Key to the Enigmas of the World1 that has been rather extensively and vigorously annotated by D. H. Lawrence. On the title page, after the author's name, "&amp; D. H. L." has been irreverently added. The book is inscribed as a gift to the library by Mabel Sterne, later Mabel Dodge Luhan. It is probable that the book came to Lawrence's attention through her during one of his 1922-1925 sojourns in New Mex- ico, and that she was the audience for his remarks, though booknotes are always to some extent self-addressed. Her search for unconventional keys to the enigmas of the world had placed Lawrence in the position of possibly becoming one of her prophets, and he was not comfortable in the role. As the possessor of his own key, he was not apt to agree with either Ouspensky or her. His notes throw additional light on his relationship to the intel- lectual currents of the time, and on his depiction of human and animal psychology in his poetry and fiction/ Ouspensky, it will be recalled, was connected from about 1915 with George Ivanovich Gurdjieff and the Institute for the Harmonious Develop- ment of Man at Fontainebleau. In 1920 in London he formed groups to study Gurdjieff's ideas, and these were joined by a group led by A. R. Orage, editor of the London weekly The New Age, and by Dr. Maurice Nicoli, an exponent of Jung, who were advocating "psychosynthesis" rather than "analysis." The movement spread actively to America in 1924 when Gurdjieff and some of his students demonstrated sacred dances, and Orage organized study groups. The appeal of the Gurdjieff-Ouspensky-Orage movement to intellectuals dissatisfied with the status quo was quite strong just at the time of Lawrence's American venture. In 1924, almost certainly after Lawrence had annotated Ouspensky's book, Mrs. Luhan wrote to ask what he knew about the activities at the Institute at Fontainebleau. His reply was completely out of harmony. "I have heard enough about that place at F where K. M. [Katherine Mans- field] died, to know it is a rotten, false, self-conscious place of people play- ing a sickly stunt. One doesn't wonder about it at all. One knows. Now call into action your common horse-sense, of which you have your share, as I have mine, and use that."2 Readers of Lawrence will recall that he himself evinced a recurrent strong desire for a communal utopia, and that he was interested in the esoteric, as William York Tindall over-demonstrated in D. H. Lawrence and Susan His Cow. At the same time he exhibited a stub- 1 Translated from the Russian by Nicholas Bessaraboff and Claude Brangdon, with an introduction by Claude Branerdon.

Tedlock, Jr. 207 born common sense, stemming perhaps from his lower class origins - the importance of the daily business of life was strong in him - and from the feet-on-the-ground opposition of his wife. These and other characteristics of Lawrence should be borne in mind as one studies his comments on Ous- pensky. The impatient tone is that of the man who knows better in the face of elaborate argument, who detests complication of what to him is essen- tially simple and evident in his experience. He hates the view of the psyche as automatic, choiceless, and when Ouspensky countenances this view re- garding instinct, he strongly disagrees. Instinct is more than expedient, and diversity and beauty are more than the end-products of survival. His belief that emotion is precedent and basic to reason seems to lie at the center of his objections - he resents the familiar dichotomy, and leans the other way. Despite his own pleas for a new kind of man, and his belief in the necessity for an aristocracy of leaders, he finds Ouspensky's talk of men of a higher type (with more highly developed consciousness) "all himself." When the Goliath of formal argument is most disarmingly concessive to emotion, the intuitive and more agile David is suspicious. In debate they make a most in- teresting and contrasting pair. A transcription of Lawrence's notes, arranged in counterpoint to the re- marks by Ouspensky that prompted them, follows. Chapter VIII, 71-87. ouspensky: We may declare with entire assurance that instinct is a pleasure-pain which, like the positive and negative poles of an electro- magnet, repels and attracts the animal in this or that direction, compelling it to perform whole series of complex actions, sometimes expedient to such a degree that they appear to be sensible, and not only sensible, but founded upon foresight of the future, almost upon clair- voyance, like the migration of birds, the building of nests for the young which have not yet appeared, the finding of the way south in the autumn, and north in the spring, etc. But all these actions are explained in reality by a single instinct, i.e., by the subservience to pleasure-pain. Lawrence: Not so - this is hedonistic fallacy; "instinct" which makes a lark sing is neither pleasure (strictly) nor pain. ouspensky: Instinct is the guide of its (a species that survives) life, but only so long as instinct is expedient solely; just as soon as it ceases to be expedient it becomes the guide of death, and the species soon dies out. Lawrence: Tisn'ttrue. ouspensky: As regards two different species, one and the same influ- ence - say a certain temperature - may be useful and pleasant for one,</page><page sequence="3">208 Lawrence3 s Annotation of Ouspensky and for another detrimental and unpleasant. It is clear, therefore, that the subservience to "pleasure-pain" must be governed by expedience. The pleasant is pleasant because it is beneficial, the unpleasant is un- pleasant because it is harmful. Lawrence: The most beautiful creatures brought about their own rarity by their beauty, and the struggle towards that beauty was not expedient nor even strictly pleasurable - there is a deeper motive. ouspensky: Reflexes, instinctive and "conscious" actions, all may be regarded as reflected, i.e., as not self-originated. But these and others, and still a third class, come not from man himself, but from the outside world. Man is the transmitting or transforming station for certain forces: all of his actions in these three categories are created and de- termined by his impressions of the outside world. Man in these three species of actions is, in substance, an automaton, unconscious or con- scious of his actions. Nothing comes from himself. Only the higher category of actions, i.e., the intuitive, appear not to depend upon the outside world. But the aptitude for such actions is seldom met with - only in some few persons whom it is possible to describe as men of a higher type. Lawrence (opposite the fir st paragraph) : Pah, it is all himself . ouspensky: In reality the animal does not reason its actions, but lives by its emotions, subject at every given moment to that emotion which happens to be strongest. Lawrence (underlining "does not reason") : Nor does man. ouspensky (continuing) : Although indeed, in the life of the animal, acute moments sometimes occur when it is confronted with the necessity of choosing among a certain series of perceptions. At such moments its actions may seem to be quite reasoned out. For example, the animal, being put in a situation of danger acts often very cautiously and wisely. But in reality its actions are directed by emotion only. Lawrence (line drawn to "cautiously and wisely") : Man never acts solely by reason, until he is mad. ouspensky: The invention of the lever immediately divided primitive man from the animal, and it was inextricably bound up with the ap- pearance of concepts. Lawrence : It was a different emotion which led man to the discovery of the lever. It isn't the reason that makes the difference - it is the dif- ference in emotional range. A concept is another emotion form.</page><page sequence="4">E.W. Tedlock Jr. 209 ousPENSKY (continuing) : The psychic side of the understanding of the action of a lever consists in the construction of a correct syllogism. Without constructing the syllogism correctly it is impossible to under- stand the action of a lever. Having no concepts it is impossible to con- struct the syllogism. The syllogism in the psychic sphere is literally the same thing as the lever in the physical sphere. Lawrence : Bah, the syllogism is derived from the sensual experience of a lever, the lever is arrived at by sensual intuition, which is an effort of the emotional soul. A syllogism is a distilled bit of experience. ouspensky: The psychology of animals is in general very misty to us. The infinite number of observations made concerning all animals . . . and the infinite number of anecdotes about the mind, spirit, and moral qualities of animals change nothing of all that. We represent animals to ourselves either as living automatons or as stupid men. Lawrence : We don't. ouspensky: ... the logic of Aristotle ... is quite sufficient for obser- vation. But for experiment it is insufficient, because the experiment pro- ceeds in time, and in the formulae of Aristotle time is not taken into consideration. This was observed at the very dawn of the establishment of our experimental science - observed by Roger Bacon, and formulated several centuries later by his famous namesake, Francis Bacon . . . Briefly, the formulation of Bacon may be reduced to the following: That which was A, will be A. That which was not A, will be not A. Everything was and will be, either A or not A. Upon these formulae, acknowledged or unacknowledged, all our sci- entific experience is built, and upon them, too, is shoemaking founded, because if a shoemaker could not be sure that the leather bought yester- day would be leather tomorrow, in all probability he would not venture to make a pair of shoes, but would find some other more profitable employment. Lawrence (opposite the second paragraph) : Bosh and casuistry. ouspensky: Could we represent to ourselves the "logic" of an animal we would understand its relation to the outer world. Our cardinal error concerning the psychology of animals consists in the fact that we ascribe to them our own logic. We assume that logic is one, that our logic is something absolute, existing outside and independent of us, while as a matter of fact, logic but formulates the laws of the relations of our specific I to the outside world, or the laws which our specific I discovers in the outside world. Another I will discover other laws.</page><page sequence="5">210 Lawrence's Annotation of Onspensky Lawrence : Bosh about logic - neither men nor animals have logic till they sit down to be logical. (Note: characteristically Lawrence attacks in one place without acknowledging a possible agreement in another. He himself inveighs against the anthropomorphic view of nature and in his work seems to try, as in Birds, Beasts, and Flowers, to enter the consciousness of the animal.) ouspensky: The animal has no concepts; it has not that mental alge- bra by the help of which we think . . . The memory of an animal is more burdened than ours, and this is the principal hindering cause to the mental evolution of an animal. Its mind is too busy. It has no time to develop. Lawrence : An animal has no concepts because its range of emotion is limited - emotionally it has no need for concepts. ouspensky: To declare that manifest differences determine the "evo- lutionary grade," that animals of one type are "higher" or "lower" than those of another, would be entirely false. The dog and the monkey by their intellect y their aptness to imitate, and by reason of the dog's fidelity to man, are as it were higher than the cat, but the cat is infinitely superior to them in intuition, esthetic sense, independence, and force of will. The dog and the monkey manifest themselves in toto : all that they have is seen. The cat, on the other hand, is not without reason regarded as a magical and occult animal. In her there is much hidden of which she herself does not know. If one speaks in terms of evolution, it is more correct to say that the cat and the dog are animals of different evolu- tions, just as in all probability, not one, but several evolutions are simul- taneously going forward in humanity. The recognition of several independent and (mechanically) equiva- lent evolutions, developing entirely different properties, would lead us out of a labyrinth of endless contradictions in our understanding of man. Lawrence : It is profound emotional need which has led to the perfect- ing of the psychic mechanism in man - reason and logic. Reason, logic, mind are just expedient bits of mechanism by means of which man is able to cover ground and get to new emotional experience. (Note: in the essays Mornings in Mexico Lawrence uses the idea of separate evolu- tions for species of birds) . Chapter IX, 89-102. ouspensky: ... we receive the most incorrect impressions of the world as regards its outer form and aspect. We know that the world consists of solids, but we see and touch only surfaces . . . Perhaps it would be</page><page sequence="6">E.W. Tedlock Jr. 211 possible to call the complex sensation of surfaces, weight, mass, density, resistance, "the sensation of a solid," but rather do we combine mentally all these sensations into one, and call that composite sensation a solid. We sense directly only surfaces; the weight and resistance of the solid, as such, we never separately sense. Lawrence : That's not true. That is a mental abstraction too. We do sense the solid, even in mere touch. We don't analyse the sensation into concepts of weight etc. ouspensky: (To the statement that "a man at a long distance is pic- tured to us in silhouette" because "the eye has not been taught to discern the difference in surfaces which at short distances are felt by the finger- tips" Ouspensky appends this footnote, which concerns an account of the difficulties of a seventeen-year-old youth who recovered sight after removal of a cataract.) The cube, sphere, and pyramid, when placed before him seemed to him like the square, the flat disc, and the triangle. When the flat disc was put alongside the sphere he distinguished no difference between them . . . When he was allowed to take the cube, sphere, and pyramid in his hands he at once identified these solids by the sense of touch, and wondered very much that he was unable to recognize them by sight ... He was delighted with his recovered vision, but in the beginning it fatigued him to exercise it : the impressions op- pressed and exhausted him. For this reason, though possessing perfect sight, he sometimes turned to the sense of touch as to repose. Lawrence : Which shows that touch knows solids - it is eyesight only which is 2-dimensional - touch is 4 or 5 dimensional. Eyesight learns to be 3-dimensional - but it learns from touch - the basic sensuality. (Note: touch as the basic sensuality runs, of course, all through Law- rence's mature work.) ouspensky: We can never see, even in the minute, any part of the outer world as it is, that is, as we know it. Lawrence: (line drawn to the italicized phrase) : Because sight is the shallowest of the senses, &amp; our whole intellectual system is based too much on sight. ouspensky : It is clear that the ability to make corrections in that which the eye sees demands, undoubtedly, the possession of the concept, be- cause the corrections are made by a process of reasoning, which is impossible without concepts. Lawrence (underlining "demands9') : Reference to the other senses - after which, concept.</page><page sequence="7">212 Lawrence's Annotation of Ouspensky ousPENSKY : To how many more illusions should we be subject had we not the power of mentally analyzing their determining causes, but were obliged to believe that everything exists as it appears. Lawrence (striking through " mentally analyzing") : Referring to the other senses. ouspensky : To be true, it is necessary to say : / see it; therefore this does not exist - or at least I see it; therefore this is not so. Lawrence: Let me toucha know. ouspensky (continuing) : Although we can say the last, the animal cannot, for to its apprehension things are as they appear. It must believe what it sees. Lawrence (underlining the last sentence, and using both margins) : No! No! ouspensky: The animal lives in a world of two dimensions. Its uni- verse has for it the properties and appearance of a surface. Lawrence : no no ! ! ouspensky: Why should the world appear to the animal as a surface? First of all because it appears as a surface to us. Lawrence : Nonsense . ouspensky: We are able to measure in three mutually independent directions : the nature of our mind permits us to do this. The animal can measure simultaneously in two directions only - it can never meas- ure in three directions at once. Lawrence : On the contrary, the animal sees the world as a kind of deeps from which things emerge, or start, or sink : it sees flux not sur- face. That is, it doesn't really see, &amp; surfaces have never become defined toit. ouspensky (continuing) : This is due to the fact that not possessing concepts, it is unable to retain in the mind the idea of the first two direc- tions, for measuring the third. Lawrence: Rubbish. ouspensky: (continuing) Let me explain this more exactly. Suppose we imagine that we are measuring the cube. In order to measure the cube in three directions, it is necessary while</page><page sequence="8">E. W. Tedlock Jr. 213 measuring in one direction, to keep in mind two others - to remember. But it is possible to keep them in mind as concepts only, that is, associat- ing them with different concepts - pasting upon them different labels. So, pasting upon the first two directions the labels of length and breadth, it is possible to measure the height. It is impossible otherwise. As per- ceptions, the first two measurements of the cube are completely identi- cal, and assuredly will mingle into one in the mind. The animal, without the aid of concepts, cannot paste upon the first two measurements the labels of length and breadth. Therefore, at the moment when it begins to measure the height of the cube, the first two measurements will be confused into one. Lawrence: All bosh about cubes - the animal sees emotionally - sees only ghosts and presences - animism - but it sees in strange emotional complexes. ousPENSKY {continuing) : The animal attempting to measure the cube by means of perceptions only without the aid of concepts, will be like a cat I once observed. Her kittens - five or six in number - she dragged asunder into different rooms, and could not then collect them together. She seized one, put it beside another, ran for a third and brought it to the first two, but then she seized the first and carried it away to another room, putting it beside the fourth; after that she ran back and seized the second and dragged it to the room containing the fifth, and so on. For a whole hour the cat had no rest with her kittens, she suffered severely, and could accomplish nothing. It is clear that she lacked the concepts which would enable her to remember how many kittens she had altogether. Lawrence {drawing a line to the last statement) : Don't believe this. She knew what kittens she had, &amp; she knew where they were; but the pull was so distracting that she was bewildered. ousPENSKY : The great point is that the animal sees surfaces only. Lawrence {underlining the last three words) : It doesn't - the truth is it never sees a surface - it just doesn't see dit all, in our sense of seeing. It sees forces, spectres. {Ouspensky, continuing the "world as surfaces to animals" idea receives two "boshes" from Lawrence.) ouspensky: It has been previously shown that many properties of ob- jects remembered by us as general properties of genus, class, species, are remembered by animals as individual properties of objects. To orientate in this enormous reserve of individual properties preserved in the mem-</page><page sequence="9">214 Lawrence's Annotation of Ouspensky ory, animals are assisted by the emotional tone which is linked up in them with each perception and each remembered sensation. Lawrence: Bosh. ouspensky: (continuing) ; For example, an animal knows two roads as two entirely separate phenomena having nothing in common . . . We say that this, that, and the other are roads . . . For an animal the two roads have nothing in common. But it remembers in their proper se- quence all the emotional tones which are linked with the first road and with the second one, and it therefore remembers both roads with their turns, ditches, fences, etc. Lawrence : This is another matter. ouspensky: Thus the remembering of definite properties of observed objects helps the animal orient itself in the world of phenomena. But as a rule before new phenomena an animal is much more helpless than a man. Lawrence : Rubbish. A horse will walk through any gap, first time, &amp; will avoid any hole. ouspensky: An animal sees two dimensions; the third dimension it senses constantly, but does not see. It senses the third dimension as some- thing transient, just as we sense time. Lawrence : Rubbish - its limitation has nothing to do with dimension. ouspensky: The fact is that innumerable objects quite immobile for us - properly all objects - must seem to the animal to be in motion. AND THE THIRD-DIMENSION OF SOLIDS WILL APPEAR TO IT IN THESE MOTIONS : I.E., THE THIRD-DIMENSION OF SOLIDS WILL APPEAR TO IT AS A MOTION. Lawrence : Yes, and the fourth dimension too - &amp; the fifth. ouspensky : Let us try to imagine how the animal perceives the objects of the outer world. Suppose it is confronted with a large disc, and simultaneously with a large sphere of the same diameter. Standing directly opposite them at a certain distance, the animal will see two circles. Lawrence (underlining the last two words) : It won't. ouspensky: One thing is sure: it (the animal) will perceive the spher- ical surface differently from us. We perceive convexity or sphericality as</page><page sequence="10">E.W. Tedlock Jr. 215 a common property of many surfaces. The animal, on the contrary, be- cause of the very properties of its psychic apparatus, will perceive that sphericality as an individual property of a given sphere. Lawrence (as if summing up his whole objection) : How stupid &amp; un- imaginative this all is. A horse won't bother with form - it won't see form at all - it doesn't see. ouspensky: Could the animal think about those phenomena which have not yet entered into its life (i.e., angles and curved surfaces) it would undoubtedly imagine them in time only: it could not prefigure for them any real existence at the present moment when they have not yet appeared. And were it able to express an opinion on this subject, it would say that angles exist in potentiality, that they will be, but that for the present they do not exist. Lawrence : True the horse probably sees an single in terms of motion - but most objects have for it an animistic reality - neither form nor time, but apparition. ouspensky: Thus we see that the animal will perceive the properties of our third dimension as motions, and will refer these properties to time Lawrence : I don't believe a horse sees the corner of a street in terms of motion - it knows the third dimension. OUPENSKY {turning from the higher animals - dog, cat, horse - to the snail) : It always moves upon a single line, from the unpleasant to the pleasant, and in all probability except for this line it is not conscious of anything and does not sense anything . . . For the snail our entire uni- verse exists in the future and in the past - i.e., in time. In space only one line exists. All the rest is time. It is more than probable that the snail is not conscious of its movements. Making efforts with its entire body it moves forward to the fresh edge of the leaf, but it seems as though the leaf were coming to it, appearing at that moment, coming out of time as the morning comes to us. Lawrence : This is all argument from the eye - &amp; the snail's conscious- ness is hardly visual at all. It is this very body moving all together that knows what it is about - the eye hardly enters at all. ouspensky : The snail is a one-dimensional being. Lawrence : No - see a snail turn its head around &amp; up &amp; down. ouspensky : The cock (if it could think without losing its characteristic</page><page sequence="11">216 Lawrence's Annotation of Ouspensky psychology) could not believe in the appearance to-day of the same sun which was yesterday. This is purely human reasoning. LAWRENCE: No. ouspensky: For the animal a new sun rises every morning, just as for us a new morning comes with every day and a new spring with every year. LAWRENCE: No. ouspensky : The animal is not in a position to understand that the sun is the same yesterday and today, exactly in the same way that we PROBABLY CANNOT UNDERSTAND THAT THE MORNING IS THE SAME AND THE SPRING IS THE SAME. Lawrence : Rubbish - the spring is new because life brings forth new living creatures. Death and life are the supreme realities, in spite of mathematics and casuistry. The fourth dimension is vital &amp; creative. ouspensky: . . . discerning two kinds of phenomena, two kinds of mo- tion, the animal will explain one of them by means of some incompre- hensible inner property of objects, i.e., in all probability it will regard this motion as the result of the animation of objects, and the moving objects as animated beings. The kitten plays with the ball or with its tail because ball and tail are running away from it. The bear will fight with the beam which threatens to throw him off the tree, because in the swinging beam he divines something alive and hostile. Lawrence : The animal knows its own motions perfectly - without see- ing. A blind animal knows motion as well as we do. All too visual &amp; superficial. ouspensky: The horse is frightened by the bush because the bush un- expectedly turned and waved a branch. In the last case the bush need not even to have moved at all, for the horse was running, and it seemed therefore as though the bush moved, and consequently that it was animated. In all probability all movement is thus animated for the animal. Why does the dog bark so desperately at the passing carriage? This is not entirely clear to us for we do not realize that to the eyes of the dog the carriage is turning, twisting, twisting, grimacing all over. It is alive in every part. Lawrence (broadly in the margin) : Animism.</page><page sequence="12">E.W. Tedlock Jr. 217 ouspensky: Thus in all its relations to the world the animal is quite analogous to the imagined, unreal two-dimensional being living upon a plane. All our world appears to the animal as the plane through which phenomena are passing, moving upon time, or in time. Lawrence (in the low er margin) : Rubbish. ouspensky (approaching the end of the chapter) : If all this is so, then it is obvious that we have really proved the dependence of space upon the space-sense. And if we have proven the existence of a space- sense lower in comparison with ours, by this we have proven the possi- bility of a space-sense higher in comparison with ours. Lawrence : You haven't. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Lawrence's treatment of Ouspen- sky's book is his silence about Ouspensky's heralding of a new consciousness and a higher race of men. Within a few years Lawrence was to create in The Plumed Serpent his own conception of such a race, and to consummate their rebellion against and mastery of those aspects of modern culture that were inimical to his vision of perfected life. At first glance the terms of Ouspensky's prophecy seem compatible with Lawrence's. After paying tribute to Bucke's Cosmic Consciousness and its identification of the men possessing such consciousness with the founders of world-religions, prophets, philosophers, and poets, Ouspensky issues his manifesto : All this announces to us the nearness of the new humanity. We are building without taking into consideration the fact that a new master must come who may not at all like everything that we have built. Our "social sciences," sociology, and so forth have in view only man, while as I have several times shown before, the concept "man" is a complex one, and includes in itself two types going along different paths. The future belongs not to man, but to superman, who is already born, and lives among us. A higher race is rapidly emerging among humanity, and it is emerging by reason of its quite remarkable understanding of the world and of life. The sign of the men of this new race is a new consciousness, a new conscience. We shall know them because they will be conscious of more things, they will see more and know more than the ordinary man. They will not be able to close their eyes to what they see, and therefore will be able to see farther; they will not be able not to think about what they know, and therefore will know more; they will not be able to absolve themselves, and therefore will be more conscientious. These men will always see clearly their responsibility for that which they do, and</page><page sequence="13">218 Lawrence9 s Annotation of Ouspensky will be unable to put their responsibility upon others. They will not be satisfied with a simple discharge of "duty" and will feel themselves obliged to know first before they do anything. They will not be able to evade the dictates of their conscience by any means whatever; their actions will be guided by it alone. They will be without cowardice, and will not default from that which they regard as due. They will never be irresponsible executors of someone else's will because they will possess a will of their own. From themselves they will demand first of all a clear knowledge of what they are doing and why. Furthermore they will feel their responsibility to the very end toward everyone whom their activity affects. It will be truly a higher race - and there will be no possibility of any falsification, any substitution, or any usurpation at all. It will be impossible for anything to be bought, or appropriated to oneself by deceit or by might. Not only will this race be, but it already is. The men of the new race begin already to know one another: already are established pass-words and countersigns. And perhaps those social and political questions so sharply put forward in our time may be solved on quite another plane and by quite a different method than we think - may be solved by the entrance into the arena of a new race conscious of itself which will judge the old races.3 It is impossible to believe that this did not interest Lawrence. Perhaps his deepest trauma was his haunting sense of the failure of his English and European past. It was precisely this that had sent him on his hegira around the world to New Mexico, and that, aside from the demands of his health, caused him to search through Mexico for a place to found a colony. He was seeking a new place, a new kind of man, and a whole new way of life. It may be that he balked at Ouspensky's emphasis on consciousness, for this was a term that was anathema to him. For him the failure of the past lay in its development of the consciousness to the point of schizophrenic collapse. On the other hand, he would like Ouspensky's notion of cosmic unity. The rituals led by Don Ramon in The Plumed Serpent are attempts to link the microcosm with the macrocosm, though the method is a higher functioning of the unconscious rather than the consciousness. Running through Law- rence's novel also is a sense of responsibility for the lives of other men that has something in common with Ouspensky's talk of a new conscience. 3 Ouspensky, op. cit., pp. 331-332.
