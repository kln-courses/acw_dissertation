These sentiments became a powerful political force within Israel and provide a growing potential for violence. This book examines those Israelis who have become most identified with this violence. Its focus is upon the development of vigilantism and political deviance in the Gush Emunim settlements. "David Weisburd's empirical work on the Gush Emunim settlement movement in Israel reported in this volume reshapes the boundaries of several sociological domains-those of normative order, social control, deviance, and collective behavior. Focusing on Gush Emunim as a normative communal settlement move- ment viewed as deviant by both the Israeli state and the West Bank Arabs, Weisburd challenges and recasts current theories of value-oriented social move- ments and the societal reaction theory of deviance. The theory of social control likewise is remolded by explicating settler use of vigilantism as a communal strategy of social control." From the Preface by Albert J.
