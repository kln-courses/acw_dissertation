FAIRBANKS CENTERING in Georgia and extending to the adjacent portions of the states of Ten- nessee, Alabama, North and South Carolina are a series of archaeological complexes charac- terized by pottery with a complicated stamped decoration. These complexes have not yet been sufficiently defined. This paper will attempt a partial statement of the resemblances and differences between the major divisions of the group. It will not attempt to evaluate the ex- cavations in a detailed manner. This material is what Holmes (1903, pp. 130-137) called the South Appalachian Province in which he lumped all the stamped pottery from the southeastern area. The Swift Creek Compli- cated Stamped material as defined in a pre- liminary paper by Kelly (1938, pp. 25-31, P1. 11, a) will not be considered here. It has be- come evident in recent years that subdivisions of the rest of the material could be made and that they would have temporal or spatial signi- ficance. Various names have been used in the literature but the divisions have not been clear. Holmes' term of South Appalachian Province is perhaps still good for the whole area. The commonly used divisions of the later compli- cated stamped pottery materials are: Etowah, Savannah, and Lamar. The Etowah Complex is named for the Etowah site near Cartersville, Georgia, excavated by J. P. Rogan for the Bureau of American Ethnology (Thomas, 1887, pp. 96-107) and by Moorehead (1932). Specific names were not established for the pottery and subsequent examination has revealed a con- siderable mixture (Wauchope, 1948, pp. 204- 206). The Savannah Complex was named at the Irene site near Savannah on the Georgia Coast by Caldwell and McCann (1941, pp. 42-48). The Lamar Complex was first named by Kelly (1938, p. 50, P1. 12, a) from materials excavated at the Lamar site, a detached area of Ocmulgee National Monument near Macon in the central part of the state. Previously ex- cavated sites showing Lamar materials included Nacoochee (Heye, et al, 1918) and Peachtree (Setzler and Jennings, 1941). In neither case was the complex named as such. Recent ex- cavations by Sears (p. 137-142) in the Alla- toona Basin at the Wilbanks site have further cleared up the stratigraphy suggested by Wau- chope and should do much toward defining the three complexes. 142 [2, 1950</page><page sequence="2">SEGREGATION OF ETOWAH, SAVANNAH, AND LAMAR THE ETOWAH COMPLEX The Etowah site represents the largest and, in some respects, the most thoroughly reported site of the Etowah Complex, although there are at least two subdivisions present there (Thomas, 1887, Moorehead, 1932). There is also an Etowah component at the Nacoochee site (Heye, et al, 1918), but again the segrega- tion of material was not made. Wauchope (1948, pp. 204-206) found Etowah materials at the Wilbanks, Horseshoe Bend, and Long Swamp sites. The best hypothesis is that the Etowah Complex is the one which contains the flamboyant expressions of the Southern Cult. The most distinctive traits of the complex are perhaps these full expressions of the cult with its opposed anthropomorphic eagle figures on shell gorgets, copper repousse spotted eagle figures, flint ceremonial forms, bi-lobate arrows, copper plumes, sun disks in negative paint, etc. Platform mounds with ramps and a court ar- rangement are present. Burials may be either flexed or extended or stone slab boxes sporad- ically. The monolithic ax and copper ax blades are present. The most specific distinctions can be made on the basis of the pottery which was rather fully illustrated in the earlier reports. More recently Wauchope (1948) has established type names, which are: Etowah Stamped, Etowah Incised, and Etowah Plain (Etowah Plain is Wauchope's Etowah Plain Smoothed). There are in addition an un- named negative painted type, an unnamed red filmed type and Hiwassee Island Red-on-Buff. Etowah Stamped is predominantly a rectilinear stamped design composed of concentric dia- monds with a horizontal line or, more rarely, two lines crossing at right angles. Minority motifs are line-filled blocks and superimposed triangles, rarely and late, the filfot cross. Tem- per is usually grit, although shell does occur. Rims flare slightly, often with a slight thicken- ing or lip fold, but there is never an added and pinched or punctated rim strip. Etowah In- cised is decorated with a neat, broad, shallow, rounded incised line on the shoulder of jars or sometimes on rounded-shouldered cazuelas. Strap handles are fairly common sometimes with an added round button at the top. In both Etowah Incised and Etowah Plain the surface is- carefully smoothed and sometimes polished. The distinctive traits of Etowah In- cised are the area decorated, the shoulder of jars, and the motifs, usually arches or chevrons. This combination is quite distinctive in relation to the other incised types in Georgia. The best single criterion for the Etowah Complex is the rectilinear diamond stamp design. Sec- ondary criteria are the simple rim treatment, typical incising, and the strap handles when associated with other features. The elements of the Southern Cult paraphernalia are valu- able sorting characteristics, but are too sporadic to be dependable. THE SAVANNAH COMPLEX The Savannah Complex is not well known anywhere and shows considerable variation. It was first described from the excavations at Irene Mound, near Savannah (Caldwell and McCann, 1941, pp. 42-46). It appears to form a minor, and intrusive element in the Etowah River drainage of North Georgia at the Long Swamp, Horseshoe Bend, and Wilbanks sites described by Wauchope (1948). Sears in the article just preceding this one (pp. 137-142) describes a good stratigraphic series of Etowah, Savannah, and Lamar from the Wilbanks site. At Irene Mound, Savannah contained both burial and platform mounds, the latter with rectangular buildings and encircling banks. Burials were flexed, extended, cremated, or were placed in urns. Houses were rectangular, counter-sunk, or on the surface. Palisades were present. There was limited work in shell orna- ments but it lacks the elaborate features of the Southern Cult. The pottery at Irene consisted of: Savannah Check Stamped, Savannah Fine Cordmarked, Savannah Burnished Plain, and Savannah Complicated Stamped. The check stamped and fine cordmarked types are prob- ably restricted to the coastal components of the Savannah Complex. The burnished plain is found in a variety of shapes including oval bowls, caririated bowls, bottle forms and jars. There is usually no decoration except the burn- ishing, and lips are generally unmodified. Savannah Complicated Stamped seems to be the most consistent type in the complex. It is predominantly curvilinear in motif with bull's- eyes, concentric scrolls, loops, and figure-eights the observed elements. The stamp impressions frequently overlap to some extent but the designs are well cut and fairly well applied and usually legible. Rims are simple and flar- ing, in which they do not differ greatly from Etowah. The Savannah Complex as excavated by Sears at the Wilbanks site lacked the check FAIRBANKS] 143</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY stamped and fine cordmarked types and con- tained an orange filmed type and a plain type. The Savannah Complicated Stamped remains the only generally reliable sorting characteristic, but it is felt that the material does form a com- plex, and that future work will establish this more clearly. THE LAMAR COMPLEX The Lamar Complex is the most widespread in Georgia with regional differences not yet fully determined. It has been found at Peach- tree, North Carolina (Setzler and Jennings, 1941), Nacoochee (Heye, Hodge, and Pepper, 1918), Turnbull (Harris, 1940), the Lamar site (Kelly, 1938), and in collections now stored at Ocmulgee National Monument, from other sites in central Georgia. An expansion of Lamar into North Carolina is indicated by Coe (n. d.). The following trait list for Lamar has been largely derived from the excavations at the Lamar site, a detached area of Ocmul- gee National Monument, Macon, Georgia (Kelly, 1938; Jennings, 1939).

Palisades are present at the Lamar and Irene Sites, the only two ex- cavated with sufficient completeness to reveal village pattern. Many small Lamar sites do not have mounds, but all the large ones have at least one pyramidal mound. The majority of the sites seem to have an abundance of small clay pipe bowls. These are usually quite elaborate and so common as to suggest habit- ual, not solely ceremonial, use. Effigy pipes are present in the shape of birds, bird heads, human heads, and human skulls, and one phallic pipe. Various styles of noded bowls, boat-shaped bowls, and bowls with handles are apparently common throughout the area. 145 FAIRBANKS ]</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY The Lamar pottery types furnish the best group of sorting criteria. The decoration of Lamar Complicated Stamped (Jennings and Fairbanks, 1939) is predominately curvilinear, shallow, and over-stamped. Motifs include the filfot cross, multiple line loop, figure-eight, and bull's-eyes. The rim is always everted and almost always has an added rim strip which may be pinched or punctated. Those punc- tated generally have circular "hollow reed" punctates and rarely become small rosettes with reed punctate in the center. The base may be rounded or pointed and various vessel profiles are known, all being varieties of the slightly shouldered, deep jar. Irene Filfot Stamped has the filfot cross design exclusively (Caldwell and McCann, 1941, pp. 46-49). La- mar Bold Incised is a definite style with a bold, free, and pleasing incised decoration in the form of a frieze around the shoulder of cazuela bowls. These bowls are usually of the angular shouldered variety. The lines are fairly broad grooves, neatly done on a smoothed or polished surface. The shoulders of jars are not incised. The jars and bowls very rarely have handles. In some sites shallow bowls may have a notched band just below the lip or may have erect human or bird effigies on the rim. Effigy bottles are rare but do occur in at least three sites. One of these is a black human effigy bottle from the Lamar site, the other three are negative painted animal effigy bottles from the Neisler site on the Flint River and the Bull Creek site on the Chattahoochee River. There is also an effigy bottle from the Nacoo- chee site (Heye, Hodge, and Pepper, 1918, P1. 5i, highly similar to the Neisler and Bull Creek specimens, which is difficult to place due to the type of excavation and reporting in which the multiple occupation was not separated. The fact that it was found in a stone box grave suggests that it may belong to the Etowah Complex. Little is known about the shell work of Lamar except that it did exist and that frag- ments of shell gorgets were found at Lamar. They seem to have designs somewhat slovenly in execution and concept. Shell gorgets from Irene consist of one extremely carelessly exe- cuted Southern Cult snake design and several with geometric dot designs. Artistic effort in the Lamar Complex seems to be mainly con- fined to the incising of pottery and manufac- ture of pottery pipes. Copper work in the Southern Cult tradition is so far not known from Lamar sites. Urns were used for burial of infants or cleaned bones of adults quite sporadically in the Lamar Complex. The usual form is a Lamar Complicated Stamped jar covered by a Lamar Bold Incised bowl. Urn burials were found at Irene Mound (Caldwell and Mc- Cann, 1941, p. 48), Ossabaw Island (Holmes, 1903, p. 136), Colonels Island (Jones, 1873, p. 455), all on the Georgia Coast, at the Shin- holster's site on the Oconee River near Mill- edgeville, Georgia (Fairbanks, n. d. a), in the upper (Lamar) level of the Mossy Oak site on the Ocmulgee near Macon, Georgia (Fair- banks, n. d. b.), and in North Carolina (Coe, n. d.). It was not found in rather full excava- tions at Lamar, Peachtree, Bull Creek, or Nacoochee. COMPARISONS Etowah Complicated Stamped is the only one of the later complicated stamped types which is predominately rectilinear. Thus it seems to be related to Napier Complicated Stamped (Jennings and Fairbanks, 1939) and to Woodstock Rectilinear Stamped (Wau- chope, 1948, P1. 18, a), which are both earlier. The best parent would be Napier. The pres- ence of lined blocks in Woodstock, Napier, and Etowah suggests a rather close relation- ship and sets them off from the curvilinear Swift Creek-Kolomoki-Savannah-Lamar series (Jennings and Fairbanks, 1939; Caldwell and McCann, 1941; Sears, n. d.). Rectilinear motifs and especially the wide use of parallel straight lines to fill areas seem much more common in northern Georgia than in either the central or coastal areas (Wauchope, 1948). The Eto- wah Stamped rim is much simpler than the Lamar rim but does not differ so much from the comparatively simple Savannah rims. Eto- wah Incised is clearly distinct from Lamar Bold Incised in area of application and motif. In Etowah the incising is almost always on the shoulders of jars; in Lamar always on the rim of cazuelas. Etowah rarely does have cazuelas with incised rims but the form is usually a rounded shoulder, whereas in Lamar the shoulder is sharply angled in the majority of cases. The Etowah designs are usually mul- tiple line arches or chevrons, never the alter- nating tables and scrolls so typical of Lamar. 146 [2, 1950</page><page sequence="6">SEGREGATION OF ETOWAH, SAVANNAH, AND LAMAR Savannah seems to have little or no incising. The presence of negative paint and smoothed types in Etowah and the typical noded strap handle set it off from Savannah (Wauchope, 1948, P1. 19, b). The Etowah Complex as a whole does not differ widely from the others discussed in this paper. The use of pyramidal mounds, courts, possible defenses in the form of ditches or palisades, burial types, stone tools, etc. are generally like the intermediate and late Mis- sissippi levels in the Southeast. The presence of stone-box graves at Etowah (Moorehead, 1932, pp. 71-76) and Nacoochee (Heye, Hodge, and Pepper, 1918, pp. 18-26) indicates relation- ships with the major area of similar graves in central Tennessee (Bushnell, 1920, pp. 44-57). However, the occurrence of stone-box graves is somewhat sporadic and cannot be used as a diagnostic feature. The presence of objects of the Southern Cult is generally restricted to the Etowah Complex in its most full-blown expression. However, the stylistic periods of the Southern Cult are not yet worked out in full detail and it is hard to distinguish the slightly modified cult mate- rial of Lamar from that of Etowah. These items probably have chronological significance within the group of three complexes and even within the Etowah Complex itself, but the situation is still far from clear. Certainly the motifs and execution of cult objects at Etowah are more vigorous than in Lamar. The most distinctive feature of the Savan- nah Complex is the complicated stamped pot- tery. It is always curvilinear, in which it relates to Lamar and differs from Etowah. In respect to its execution it is somewhat more clearly stamped than Lamar. In addition it usually consists of bull's-eyes, concentric loops, scrolls, figure-eights, and seems to lack the filfot cross of Lamar, and thus shows fewer straight lines in the designs. It is perhaps, chiefly to be distinguished from Lamar by the absence of the folded and pinched or punctate rim. The inner surfaces tend to be matte in Savannah and smooth in Lamar. On the coast the Savan- nah Complex, as described by Caldwell and McCann (1941, pp. 40-46) contained the types Savannah Fine Cordmarked and Savannah Check Stamped, which do not form part of the complex in north Georgia. The Savannah Complicated Stamped figured by Caldwell and McCann (1941, Fig. 18) contained concentric diamond designs belonging to Etowah Compli- cated Stamped. It is evident that the Savannah Complex, as observed on the Georgia Coast, is mixed with Etowah, a cordmarked complex, and elements of the Deptford (check stamp) Complex. In north Georgia, Savannah Com- plicated Stamped is found with a plain ware and an orange filmed type (Sears, 1950). This indicates relationships with the later Missis- sippi period which cannot be specifically stated at the present time. Lamar is typified by its careless, blurred stamping, and its pinched or punctate rim fold. The designs are generally curvilinear with the filfot cross being the most common on the coast, and in North Carolina reaching the point of being the exclusive design. Other, and usually minority, designs are bull's-eyes, con- centric circles, figure-eights, and loops. The execution of the design, in general, can be dis- tinguished from Savannah by the fact that Lamar is always carelessly or sloppily done with a great deal of overstamping of large designs. There seems to be a constant increase in size of designs from Savannah to Lamar. The folded rim strip, present almost univer- sally in Lamar, is lacking from Savannah and serves as a good sorting characteristic for Lamar with both Savannah and Etowah. The sec- ondary treatment of this strip by pinching or punctating or even rosetting is an additional item of separation from both Savannah and Etowah. Lamar Bold Incised is quite distinctive in relation to Etowah Incised, both in designs and area decorated. The designs are about as carefully incised as Etowah, but are almost always composed of a band of alternate recti- linear motifs, such as nested tables, with curvi- linear motifs, such as scrolls or loops. Etowah does not seem to have this regular alternation of straight and curved lines. The Etowah trait of incising the shoulders of jars with nested arches is completely unknown from La- mar. In general, Lamar incising seems to relate well to the Late Mississippi incising on the rims of cazuelas. The absence of strap handles in Lamar is notable, as they are present in a well defined form in Etowah, but not, ap- parently, in Savannah. The negative painted effigy jars of Lamar are rare, but seem to fit in well with the Late Mississippi negative painting tradition. At Irene the large jars have, sometimes, an incised line or series of lines FAIRBANKS] 147</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY around the shoulder area. This is usually run- ning loops of three or four lines and is on the typical Lamar deep jar and cannot be confused with the Etowah Incised arches on shallower jars. The practice of sporadic urn burial in Lamar holds promise of yielding information on regional relationships. The use, for burial, of large jars with cazuela covers is common from central Alabama south to the Gulf Coast (Moore, 1899, Figs. 22-32; Brannon, 1938, pp. 228-235) where it belongs to the same chron- ological position as Lamar but to a different ceramic tradition, i.e., Fort Walton, the types being mainly Pensacola Incised or Fort Walton Incised (Willey, 1949, p. 464, Fig. 60). The Fort Walton Incised and Pensacola Incised pot- tery types are similar in vessel shape to Lamar Bold Incised, but the design motifs are quite different. That is, they are both facies of the widespread Late Mississippi vessel shapes and incised decoration, but differ in details. The urns and cover bowls are never stamped as is so common in Lamar, so that the trait of urn burial is evidently more widespread than the stamped tradition. In Alabama and the Flori- da Northwest Coast the designs very infre- quently contain a combination of incised lines and small solid punctates. The motifs seem to be derived from life forms in some cases (Willey, 1949, Fig. 60, a and b), and in others seem to be either abstract or purely geometric designs. The guilloche is shared by both Lamar and Fort Walton, but this is scarcely a solid basis for postulating a close relationship. In brief, both Fort Walton and Lamar share a common Late Mississippi influence but are not directly related to each other. CHRONOLOGICAL POSITION The Etowah, Savannah, and Lamar Com- plexes overlap in time to some extent, but in general have different chronological positions. Of these Etowah is the earliest. It was found in the Alatoona Basin stratigraphically under Savannah and Lamar by Wauchope (1948) at a number of sites, e.g., Wilbanks Farm, Horse- shoe Bend, and Long Branch sites. The Wil- banks Farm site was re-excavated by Sears (1950) and a good stratigraphic series of Etowah, Savannah, and Lamar, in that order, was found. Wauchope found at the Long Swamp site that Etowah was stratigraphically above Woodstock Stamped, Fabric Impressed, Check Stamped, Simple Stamped, and Napier Complicated Stamped (Wauchope, 1948, p. 205). This seems to put Etowah definitely later than the early group of stamps such as Napier, Woodstock, and Swift Creek. As it has been suggested that it is derived from Woodstock Rectilinear Stamped or Napier Complicated Stamped this would seem to check well with its stratigraphic position. The virtual absence of Etowah Complicated Stamped and the very simple expression of the Southern Cult at the Macon Plateau suggests that Etowah is slight- ly later than Macon Plateau. In spite of the similarity between Macon Plateau and Hiwas- see Island the elaborate pottery type, Hiwassee Island Red-on-Buff, again suggests that Macon Plateau is slightly earlier than Hiwasske Island. The presence of Hiwassee Island Red-on-Buff in Etowah contexts indicates that Etowah and Hiwassee Island are contemporary. An exam- ination of sherd collections from the Etowah and Peachtree sites at the Ceramic Repository of the University of Michigan shows a large proportion of poorly executed rectilinear de- signs of large size. The concentric diamonds become concentric ovals to some extent and the crossing lines become double. Wauchope (1948, p. 207) has also observed this tendency in Etowah. This large and careless stamping, and the occasional presence of filfot stamp in Etowah, may represent a late continuation of Etowah into Lamar times. Most of Hiwassee Island Complicated Stamped illustrated from the Hiwassee Island site is of this rather late variety (Lewis and Kneberg, 1946, P1. 51, ex- cept middle sherd, right row, which is Savan- nah Complicated Stamped. See also Table 19), and the pottery distribution indicates that it is found in Hiwassee and Dallas Foci. All of this indicates that Etowah is roughly con- temporary with Macon Plateau or, more prob- ably, slightly later, contemporary with part of Hiwassee Island and extends into Dallas times. The chronological position of Savannah Complicated Stamped is fairly well known, even though the complex is not yet thorough- ly worked out. At Irene Mound Caldwell and McCann found Savannah Complicated Stamped, along with Savannah Fine Cord- marked and Savannah Check Stamped and Savannah Burnished Plain, associated with the first stages of the mound construction and under Irene which is Lamar (Caldwell and McCann, 1941, p. 78). In the Alatoona Basin 148 [2, 1950</page><page sequence="8">SEGREGATION OF ETOWAH, SAVANNAH, AND LAMAR Wauchope described the presence of Savannah between Etowah and Lamar (Wauchope, 1948, pp. 204-206), an observation repeated by Sears at the Wilbanks Farm site (Sears, 1950). This would seem to fix securely the date of Savan- nah. In addition, there is some evidence, al- ready referred to, that Savannah evolves into Lamar, and that it does not evolve out of Etowah but out of Swift Creek. At Cowarts Landing site Willey (1939, pp. 140-147) found Lamar above Swift Creek, but there is reason to believe a considerable amount of time elapsed between Swift Creek and Savannah. The presence of check stamp and cordmarked types with Savannah at Irene suggests that it derived much of its content, on the Georgia Coast, from the preceding Wilmington period. However, Savannah does not seem to be simply a transitional phase between Swift Creek and Lamar; the possession of burnished surfaces, cazuela bowls, and orange painting indicates the intrusion of Mississippian elements into Georgia. The Lamar Complex represents a wide- spread cultural style lying above Etowah and Savannah and below Ocmulgee Fields. At Macon the Lamar site presents a fair stratig- raphy with Lamar superior to Macon Plateau (Jennings, 1939, pp. 51-53). At Irene Lamar was above Savannah within a very short sequence (Caldwell and McCann, 1941, p. 78). At the Wilbanks Farm site near Cartersville both Wauchope (1948) and Sears (1950) found Lamar at the top of the sequence. The stylistic similarity between Lamar Bold Incised and Ocmulgee Fields Incised clearly indicates a development from Lamar to Ocmulgee Fields, which, of course, means that it will be difficult in some cases to place some mate- rial wholly within either complex. In general, it is considered Lamar if the large jars or cazuela bowls have the body stamped. If the body of the bowl is brushed, stippled, or plain it is considered Ocmulgee Fields. There are also other pottery traits that serve to distinguish the two complexes. In central Georgia Lamar Complicated Stamped has not been found with historic materials. At the Tarver site just north of Macon some historic material is present along with some complicated stamped sherds but there is also Ocmulgee Fields pot- tery present, and the Lamar has a late ap- pearance. In north Georgia surface surveys of such sites as the Turnbull Mound, believed to be the historic Cherokee town of Tugalo (Harris, 1940), show Lamar Complicated Stamped and Lamar Bold Incised to be as- sociated with various eighteenth century trade materials. There seems to be good reason to believe that the Cherokee, in part at least, had a material culture of the Lamar type (Setzler and Jennings, 1941, pp. 50-57). The central Georgia Lamar material must be as- cribed to the Creek group, probably to the Hitchiti towns of the early part of the seven- teenth century and extending back an un- known time (Swanton, 1918, has an analysis of Creek distributions and sites). Thus we are faced with the proposition that one fairly co- herent body of archaeological material must be ascribed to two differing cultural groups with languages belonging to different stocks. That language does not correlate with other elements of culture is not surprising in itself. What is surprising is that both Cherokee and Creek should have a material culture so similar. Two features stand out at the present time which may serve as diagnostic features separating the Cherokee from the Creek Lamar materials. The presence of check stamp of small grid in the Peachtree site (collections at the Ce- ramic Repository, University of Michigan) seems to be fairly consistent and may be repeated in other northern sites. It has been noted in a series of surface collections. This check stamp is hard to separate into its var- ious components but future work with ex- cavated material may yield the answer. There is also a definite lagging of the complicated stamp in Cherokee sites and the whole Cher- okee area. Thus at Macon, in central Georgia, complicated stamping has given way to brush- ing and stippling by 1690, while it continued in the north well into the late eighteenth century. Lewis and Kneberg (1946, p. 98, PI. 55) describe material from the Cherokee oc- cupation of Fort Loudoun in 1760 and figure Lamar Complicated Stamp, Overhill Check Stamped and something that seems to be the late "Lamar-like" variety of Etowah referred to above. This same tendency for compli- cated stamping to hold on at the peripheries of the Georgia area has been observed on the Atlantic Coast. Caldwell (n. d.) excavated early eighteenth century material from the FAIRBANKS] 149</page><page sequence="9">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY vicinity of Fort King George, near Darien on the central Georgia Coast, which shows a modified Lamar which is still stamped, still curvilinear in part, and still has the Lamar pinched rim. The vessel shape is an aberrant conical bowl. Sherds from the fort moat, ob- served at Castillo de San Marcos National Monument, St. Augustine, Florida, and be- lieved to belong to the historic Timucua, show a modified variety of Lamar. This material has interesting Lamar resemblances in some of its stamped designs and in the pinched rims of Lamar type. The St. Augustine period is dated by Smith (1948, pp. 314-318) as from 1565-1750 and the Leon-Jefferson period from 1650-1725. Thus the Lamar Complex is seen to date from the end of Savannah times in central Georgia until about 1670, while in north and southeast Georgia it probably ex- tends until the latter part of the eighteenth century. In the latter period it becomes mixed with more Mississippi traits, such as incising in greater abundance, and also with a late variety of check stamp. This mixture with residual types may shed light on the nearly pan-southeastern spread of Lamar pottery. This was evidently a period of widespread level- ing processes among the various cultural ele- ments that had developed in the southeast or diffused into it. This cultural blending was evidently not extended to linguistic and po- litical spheres as the Creek and Cherokee re- tained their distinctive languages and political organizations. SUMMARY 1. Three archaeological complexes exist in the late prehistoric level of Georgia and the surrounding area: Etowah, Savannah, and Lamar. They are characterized by compli- cated stamped pottery, flat-topped pyramidal mounds, and a variety of other late cultural elements. 2. Etowah is the earliest and is character- ized by a rectilinear stamp, an incising on col- lars of jars, and elements of the Southern Cult. 3. Savannah is characterized by curvilinear stamped pottery, orange filmed pottery, and, sporadically, cordmarked and check stamped pottery. 4. Lamar is the latest and is characterized by a predominantly curvilinear stamped pot- tery (often the filfot cross motif is exclusive), a bold incising on the rims of cazuelas and a somewhat exhausted Southern Cult. 5. Lamar can be ascribed to both the Cher- okee and Creek, in northern and central Georgia respectively. 6. This period is one in which there oc- curred a widespread diffusion of Mississippian elements into the southeast and all three com- plexes partook of it in varying degrees. These Mississippi elements were first blended with the native complicated stamping tradition and then replaced the earlier elements almost com- pletely. This replacement proceeded more slowly in the peripheries of the area than in the center. BIBLIOGRAPHY BRANNON, PETER A. 1938. "Urn-Burial in Central Alabama."

Also, the sequential alignments are for the most part tentative. Only in rare instances has extensive field work established definitely the positions suggested. The McKern system of culture designation has been used to indi- cate groups and subdivisions of groups through- out, although the term aspect tends to have more of a temporal than spatial implication. Texas may be divided archaeologically into five generalized regions based on both cultural 151 STEPHENSON]</page></plain_text>
