MEYER University of Delaware OUR INTELLECTUAL INSTINCTS PULL US IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS, WILLIAM James observed in 1879. Once there was unity in higher thought: "Now our Science tells our Faith that she is shameful, and our Hopes that they are dupes; our Reverence for truth leads to conclusions that make all reverence a falsehood." James-who would, in the end, pronounce this a pluralistic universe- longed for unity. And if unity of truth were no longer possible, he would settle for unity of aspiration and purpose. The "miraculous achieve- ment" for which we hope "must be a metaphysical achievement, the greatest of all time- the demonstration, namely, that all our different mo- tives, rightly interpreted, pull one way." In this, as in many things, James spoke for his late Victorian age. Many desired unity, but could no longer find it in the universe about them. For James, unity and harmony are to be found, if at all, only in our heart and mind, our moral interior, our Binnen- leben, as he once called it. And even that will be a "miraculous achieve- ment."1 It is customary to think of "the Conflict between Religion and Science" as a distinguishing feature of the late nineteenth century, as we recall the dramatic confrontation over the theory of evolution between Thomas Henry Huxley, the champion of Darwinism, and Bishop Samuel Wil- berforce, his orthodox adversary, on June 30, 1860. The sides were clearly drawn that day, and the issue seemed plain. But as we look back over the years we find that things were vastly more complicated than this scene would suggest. There were, to be sure, many who agreed with John William Draper that the battle between science and religion had begun, and that "on 'James, "Clifford's 'Lectures and Essays,' " Collected Essays and Review (London: Russell and Russell, 1920), p. 140; "Is Life Worth Living?"

For, in joining a crusade for either Truth or Faith, they could enjoy the zest of certitude. For many serious thinkers, however, as for William James, the real issue lay inward, within one's own mind. The "war- fare" between science and religion was, for them, a matter of domestic tranquility, not of foreign policy. After the opening whoops and warcries of the 1860's and early 1870's, the clash between faith and reason stirred not jingo sentiments but a range of emotions, extending from the hopeful confidence that a new philosophical synthesis would create a truly scientific religion to deep anxiety and longing, what James called a mood of "speculative melancholy."3 This internal spiritual crisis as it affected American intellectuals in the late Victorian period concerns us in this essay. A word, first, is necessary to explain the term "intellectuals." In our century the word suggests many specific things, including an alienated elite attracted to esoteric ideas and, often, to radical politics. In the nineteenth century, although there were some alienated intellectuals, the person of ideas still typically regarded himself or herself as part of, indeed, as an exponent of, the wider culture. A term frequently used in the nineteenth century, the "educated class," perhaps serves better than "intellectuals," even though the term is, under- standably, not often used today. It was the self-imposed duty of the edu- cated class to recognize quality in life, thus to serve its society both as guide in matters of value and as critic of its society's goals and standards.4 This could be a vexing assignment, particularly in the gilded society of the late nineteenth century. More: though champions of their society's higher cul- ture, Victorian intellectuals frequently became sensitive to trends of thought and feeling of which the rest of the population was but dimly aware. For this reason because intellectuals experience cultural tensions early- they are never truly representative of their society's mood at the moment. Certainly this is true of those involved in the crisis of faith in the late nine- teenth century. Victorian intellectuals saw in the conflict between religion and science challenges and opportunities that were to become more widely evident only decades later. To probe this late Victorian crisis of faith, we must raise three sets of questions. First, what was the precise nature of the crisis? What were the main issues involved? Second, what, if anything, makes the American crisis 2Draper, History of the Conflict Between Religion and Science (London: Kegan Paul, 1874), p. 303. 3James, "Is Life Worth Living?"

Third, what were the central spiritual concerns of those late nineteenth-century Americans who sought to make their intellectual home somewhere between agnosticism and positivism, at one extreme, and simple, uncritical faith, at the other? Intellectually, the Victorian crisis of faith involved a peculiar mixture of doubt and confidence. The Victorians saw themselves as transitional figures, stranded between medieval and modern perspectives, people wan- dering, as Matthew Arnold put it, ". . . between two worlds, one dead,/ The other powerless to be born."5 The well-known "seriousness" and "earnest- ness" of the Victorians stem in part from their estimation of the worth of what they were losing and of the urgent necessity of replacing it. Among those concerned about religion and unwilling to abandon it altogether, there was a combined feeling of doubt, as old certainties vanished, and of hope that somehow, by dint of intellectual effort, a new unity of thought would be forthcoming. Until late in the nineteenth century it was widely assumed that truth is one. This assumption made the skeptics ferocious in attacking out- worn theology and believers adamant in refuting the latest "errors" of science. For those in between, however, it meant that, bad as things looked, some new synthesis would appear on the horizon. All sides seemed to agree, nevertheless, that, although doubt was nothing new to the western world, the nature of Victorian doubt was different from anything that had gone be- fore. In the Victorian period doubt, certainly, was more thoroughgoing and unsettling than that of the previous century. It has been rightly said that the eighteenth-century philosophes rejected the Christian theology but not the Christian metaphysic.6 They still needed God to explain the universe and ac- count for the natural order. The deists directed their scorn at the more fan- tastic Christian beliefs and at clerical authority. The unbelief of the nine- teenth century was more penetrating. "Doubt is mostly a modern thing," said the American liberal theologian Theodore Munger in 1887. In former times there was questioning and criticism but little "of what is now known as scepticism" and "not much mental perplexity." Modern doubt "destroys the sense of reality." It questions truth itself and "envelops all things in its 5"Stanzas from the Grande Chartreuse" (1855), Poems of Matthew Arnold, 3 vols.

To most nineteenth-century thinkers the answer was clear: science, and the critical attitude inspired by science, had come to dominate the western imagination, not only providing thinkers with a coherent description of the natural world, but also offering itself as the model for rational inquiry, the standard by which all claims to empirical trust were to be tested. After Darwin had successfully brought the study of living things, including man, into the orbit of the new science, the wider cultural implications of the scientific revolution became clear to the entire intellectual community. Meanwhile, the age-old assumption that nature is an intelligently and purposefully designed system-fabricated by a benevolent Creator to serve Higher Ends- had eventually to be consigned to the rubbish heap. Purpose and order were replaced by randomness, chance, and the blind operation of natural laws. The "old argument of de- sign in nature," Darwin himself concluded, "fails, now that the law of natural selection has been discovered." There is no more design in the varia- bility of life forms, "than in the course which the wind blows."9 More was involved, however, than natural selection and evolution, to which superficial accommodation could be and was made. Underlying the change in biological theory was a more fundamental and gradual change of mind among western thinkers. This change of mind involved the restriction of attention to natural phenomena, which provide science with its only data, and consequent neglect of (and even denial of) things supernatural. More than this, it involved an increasingly emphatic insistence that we support all our assertions by critical observation and experiment, and that we limit our inquiries to matters that may be settled by an appeal to empirical evidence. The first of these trends has been called "naturalism." The second has been variously called "scientism" and "positivism." Together, they manifest a disposition to restrict the range of rational inquiry, to limit, in other words, what we rationally "know." The brilliant English geometer and atheist, William Kingdon Clifford, used the term "ethics of belief," to call attention to "the universal duty of questioning all that we believe." No evidence, he 7Theodore Munger, The Appeal to Life (Boston: Houghton, Mifflin, 1887), pp. 33-34. 8See John Theodore Merz, A History of European Thought in the Nineteenth Century, 4 vols.

The nineteenth century discovered what few philosophes really understood: namely, how narrow the range of science really is. For some, the discovery of the narrow scope of science was a cause for celebration, for it promised to liberate the human mind, once and for all, from superstition and mystery, and to free man from the futile task of seeking answers to unanswerable questions. In 1869 Thomas Henry Huxley coined the term "agnostic" to identify his own attitude of resolute igno- rance about ultimate things, putting his trust in "the constancy of the order of nature." "Doubt," he once affirmed, because it helps free the mind of er- ror, "is a beneficent demon."1 One of Huxley's American supporters, Robert G. Ingersoll, exhibited the more militant aspects of agnosticism. He made it clear to believers that his agnosticism was more than an individual case of cosmic bewilderment: The agnostic does not simply say, "I do not know." He goes another step, and he says, with great emphasis, that you do not know.... He is not satisfied with saying that you do not know,-he demonstrates that you do not know, and he drives you from the field of fact-he drives you from the realm of reason-he drives you from the light, into the darkness of conjecture-into the world of dreams and shadows, and compels you to say, at last, that your faith has no foun- dation in fact. 12 "I do not know," and "you do not know." Like all moral principles worth their salt, the ethics of belief could be universalized and used to drive com- peting principles from the field. Doubt was no longer a matter of personal bafflement but a badge of intellectual honesty. Doubting was an obligation. Victorian faith may have been able to repulse the attack of Victorian science, but could it withstand the combined assault of Victorian science and Victorian moralism? There was a more moderate version of agnosticism that attracted the at- tention of many British and American thinkers in the late nineteenth century. Herbert Spencer's agnosticism may be called benign and even reverent in the sense that it was not hostile toward religion. He contended that man has a "religious consciousness" that leads him to concern himself "with that which lies beyond the sphere of sense" with a mixture of scientific '0"Ethics of Belief" (1877), in Leslie Stephen and Frederick Pollock, eds., Lectures and Essays of William Kingdon Clifford, 2 vols.

He used the term "the Unknowable" to identify this highly abstract common ground.15 That was about as far as Spencer cared to carry the matter. To many of his critics, it was not far enough. Spencer's Unknowable, one American critic observed, is "pure mystery and negation." It is, "at best," a blank "infinite, at which we can only stare."'16 Trying to relate or give significant content to Spencer's Unknowable was akin, for many, to beating back the ocean with one's fists, or measuring eternity with a pocket watch. Agnosticism, whether militant or mild, seemed anything but a liberating option to some thinkers. For them, moreover, doubt, though possibly de- monic, was hardly a "beneficent demon." Many of the later Victorians re- garded doubt less as a philosophical attitude than as a psychological dis- comfort-an emotion, as James put it, of "unrest." 17 As a pathological condition, doubt may intrude on a person's every mood, making it virtually impossible for one to trust in anything. Such doubt was a cultural ailment, not just a personal problem: it was the existential malady of the late nine- teenth century. Behind this doubt was the growing suspicion that the uni- verse was a far more strange and indifferent place than people formerly imagined. Thus, while some rejoiced in the limitations of science- its ac- knowledged incapacity to venture beyond the realm of natural phenom- ena- others were dismayed at the news. For to them it meant that, insofar as he remained committed to the standard of science and to the belief that truth is one, nineteenth-century man's universe had become incredibly shrunken. The major argument in James's famous essay, "The Will to Believe" (1896), is this: we have stopped proving things for which we cannot stop caring; are we, then, never justified in letting our cares carry us beyond our proofs? Have we no right to believe that which, as human beings with religious yearnings, we cannot help believing?18 13Spencer, "Religion: A Retrospect and Prospect," Nineteenth Century, 15 (Jan. 1884), 1- 12. 14First Principles (New York: Appleton, 1896; 1862), p. 23. 15Ibid., pp. 3-126.

The choice between belief and disbelief was a momentous one. The later Victorians had been brought up to take life, including life's ul- timate questions, seriously. Once John Tyndall, the British physicist, dis- agreeing with a friend's cosmology while confessing his own indecision on the subject, was greeted with a snort of astonishment and contempt: "You surely must have a theory of the universe," he was told.19 The later Vic- torians were perhaps the last generation among English-speaking in- tellectuals able to believe that man was capable of understanding his uni- verse, just as they were the first generation collectively to suspect that he never would. On this side of the Atlantic reflective American Victorians shared many of the religious concerns of their British cousins. In spite of the efforts of some Americans earlier in the century to erect a "barrier" against the "li- centious and infidel speculations" which threatened to pour in "from Europe like a flood,"20 there was no effective barrier against the scientific philosophy. In 1858 Horace Bushnell announced the appearance of a "new infidelity"-not the "rampant, crude-minded, and malignant scoffing" of the preceding century, but a naturalistic frame of mind that exhibits a con- cern for "genuine scholarship and philosophy," but insists on keeping "within the terms of mere nature itself." As a writer in Harper's Monthly observed that same year: "At present God is not so much denied as ignored."'2' The new infidelity was soft-spoken, serious-minded, and re- spectable. It did not flood the American mind; it seeped in. Aside from the siege mentality of the early nineteenth century, there were other things that worked to distinguish American religious thought from that of European countries. First, the influence of American democracy on the nation's intellectual life and the intimate relation between higher thought and popular culture impressed foreign visitors to this country since the time of Tocqueville. Our middle-class society produced a middle-brow civilization that was widely literate rather than profoundly literary. As far as religious thought is concerned, all this implies that, while challenging new '9Quoted in Houghton, Victorian Frame of Mind, p. 104. 20Francis Bowen, Lowell Lectures on the Application of Metaphysical and Ethical Science to the Evidence of Religion (Boston: Little and Brown, 1849), pp. xii-xiii. 21Bushnell, Nature and the Supernatural, as Together Constituting One System of God (New York: Scribner, 1858), pp. 16-18; Editor's Table, Harper's Monthly, 16 (Jan. 1858), 262-66.</page><page sequence="8">592 American Quarterly ideas might be regarded as dangerous to faith, morals, and social order, there would nonetheless be a tendency to accept them on a superficial level, blend them into mainstream thinking, and remain relatively unchanged by them. American philosophers, Morton White has argued, responding to the moral and emotional needs of their society, failed to develop a truly critical philosophical tradition. Instead, they tended to smooth away contradic- tions, stressing those features in any innovative system of ideas that would appeal to popular sentiments, comfort individual hearts, and support a general public philosophy.22 This process is well-illustrated in the remarkable career of John Fiske (1842-1901), the popular writer and lecturer, philosopher and historian, who was a follower of Spencer and an ardent champion of the theory of evo- lution-for which he gave Spencer a great deal of credit. Fiske especially in the final two decades of his life- was passionate in his effort to reconcile final causes and immutable truths with the theory of evolution; and to allay the fears of good and pious Americans that the new science might seriously upset old beliefs. Science, he affirmed in his many books, ultimately sup- ports both faith and morals. The theory of evolution, he reassured his audiences, "destroys the conception of the world as a machine. It makes God our constant refuge and support, and nature his true revelation.... The "lesson of evolution," Fiske soothed, ". . . is that through all these weary ages the Human Soul has not been cherishing in Religion a delusive phantom, but in spite of seemingly endless groping and stumbling it has been rising to the recognition of its essential kinship with the ever-living God."24 The case of John Fiske shows how potentially dangerous new ideas could be blunted, modified, and absorbed into a general liberal religious- ness. The challenge of nineteenth-century science could be successfully met because so few Americans were disposed scrupulously to spell out its im- plications. Second, American religion was itself unique. America not only lacked an established church, but the country proudly celebrated its tradition of re- ligious freedom and voluntarism, to the bewilderment of most British An- glicans who visited here.25 Although there was considerable sectarian con- troversy early in the nineteenth century, the Americans had successfully compensated for their religious diversity by cultivating a kind of generalized 22Morton White, Science and Sentiment in American Philosophy (New York: Oxford Univ.

On the institutional level, the Americans, regardless of "sect," gave com- mon allegiance to what has been called a "civil religion," an official and general faith in a Supreme Being whose appeal was interdenominational and whose guidance could be ritually invoked on all public occasions. Although we were a religiously diverse people, we remained one nation "under God."26 On the personal level, influenced by evangelical pietism and by a tradition of religious individualism that goes back to Jefferson and Franklin, many Americans became accustomed to thinking of "true" reli- gion more as an inward matter than as an ecclesiastical affair. By 1880 that great mediator between high and low culture, the Reverend Henry Ward Beecher, could celebrate the fact that the divisive sectarianism of an earlier generation had given way to a spirit of cooperation and good will. The Americans, he announced, had learned that religion is not a matter pri- marily of doctrine or of institutional loyalty, but an intimate affair "of the heart."27 Even as the intellectual and the common, or popular, life seemed to blend in Victorian America, so did the religious and the secular life. Nineteenth- century observers seemed unable to decide whether the Americans were the most pious people on earth or the most worldly. Church attendance was high, and most Americans seemed anxious to avoid skepticism and infidelity. Yet it became evident to the more astute observers that much of American religion was itself secular- soothing the soul and charging the conscience, but offering little of what Matthew Arnold called "the discipline of awe and respect."28 This kind of secularity, moreover, was noticeably on the increase by the middle of the century. The implication of all this for re- ligious thought is evident: a secular religiosity that gains real meaning only in the individual heart and is most solemnly expressed in national rituals is singularly well-suited to withstand intellectual challenges. For one's per- sonal faith is ultimately justified in one's subjective experience, despite "external" counter-evidence; and faith-in-general is a matter more of patriotic sentiment than of loyalty to some doctrinal system. 26Bellah's provocative essay of 1967 is reprinted in Russell E.

Counter-evidence to doctrines could be ignored, but the mood of uncertainty that it spawned could eat away at the experience that gave substance and meaning to re- ligious life. The real enemy, as we noted, was not infidelity and atheism but doubt. The mood of doubt went far beyond the religious agnosticism of Spencer, Huxley, or Ingersoll. Although the formal intellectual issue was the existence or non-existence of God, the God-question was really only a convenient symbol for the growing feeling that, as Nietzsche put it, the highest values were losing their value, and that certainty was no longer possible in matters of ultimate concern. The "quest for certainty" had dominated western philosophy since the time of the ancient Greeks. It is the search for immutable, rock-bottom Truths, manifested in Nature, on which we may confidently base all our most cherished beliefs. The scientific revolution that began with Copernicus and culminated in Darwin destroyed the connection between Nature and these Truths.29 For those thinkers who were, unlike Huxley and Ingersoll, unwilling to abandon the quest for certainty, the question was: how can we accept the new science and still make metaphysical sense out of existence? Among American thinkers in this category, three concerns were particu- larly prominent. For convenience's sake, we may call them the need for cosmic comfort, the demand for a sense of cosmic momentousness, and the quest for cosmic unity. Although all were, in the broad sense, spiritual con- cerns, the first-the need for comfort-expressed a psychological need, while the others-the demand for momentousness and unity-expressed needs that were respectively moral and aesthetic. Each is worth examining in detail. "Who are we? Who cares for us? Is it all a vast and brazen hollowness?" Newman Smyth's questions were those of his generation. "We seem to ourselves as strangers and pilgrims here," Smyth lamented in 1877. "We feel alone in an alien world;-the soul wandering in orphanage of spirit, it knows not whither."30 29See John Dewey, The Quest for Certainty (New York: Putnam's, 1960; 1929), pp. 1-73, and his Influence of Darwin on Philosophy (Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana Univ. Press, 1965; 1910), pp. 1-19. 30Smyth, The Religious Feeling: A Study for Faith (New York: Scribner, Armstrong, 1877), pp. 111-13.</page><page sequence="11">The Victorian Crisis of Faith 595 Americans of the late nineteenth century, like other Victorians, longed to feel at home in the universe, even in a universe described by Darwin. "The human soul," John Fiske said, "shrinks from the thought that it is without kith or kin in all this wide universe."'3' In an age when scientific analysis had put man out of touch spiritually with the world about him, the surest way to restore a sense of intimacy with the order of things seemed to lie within. When it became clear that natural theology was no longer capable of pro- viding man with cosmic reassurance, thinkers turned inward, constructing what may be called a natural theology of the mind.32 The case of Borden Parker Bowne (1847-19 10) nicely illustrates this shift in emphasis. Bowne, who taught at Boston University, was, like other American liberal theologians, influenced by Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768-1834), who had defended religion by tracing it back to the "inner life" and the feelings of utter dependence that one experiences. Bowne expanded Schleiermacher's description to include not only the feelings and emotions but all dimensions of human experience, intellectual, moral, and aesthetic, as well as emotional.33 Thus armed, Bowne argued forcefully that, by holding too rigorously to the "scientific method" as the standard of ra- tionality, in adhering too conscientiously to the ethic of belief, we are in fact restricting our right to make legitimate affirmations to confines that are narrower than our experience, in all its intellectual, moral, aesthetic, and emotional dimensions. Mankind is imposing a spiritual gag-rule on itself, denying its own nature-all in the name of science.34 Science cannot satisfy the soul's appetite, he declared in 1905: our soul "longs to find God, to believe that it has not fallen into life headlong, to feel that it is in the hands of him that made it, and that he is ever near."35 Rejecting naturalistic agnosticism, Bowne intended to restore "the per- sonal metaphysics" that the scientific philosophy had dismissed. He made human experience the starting- and end-point of thought, arguing that the universe is no vast machine but a living whole in which the natural and the supernatural join. The "cosmic order is no rival of God, but is simply the continuous manifestation and product of the divine activity."36 Once we 3'Fiske, The Idea of God as Affected by Modern Knowledge (Boston: Houghton, Mifflin Co., 1885), p. 138. 32In fact, natural theology had always looked in two directions-outward, to the natural order, and inward, into the human mind. The argument made in the present essay is merely that, after Darwin, the inward aspect of the natural-theology argument received greater em- phasis: if there is a higher purpose to existence, it is to be found within the mind of man. 33Bowne, Theism (New York: American Book Co., 1902; 1887), p. 9.

For the divine presence is within and about us. The inward emphasis in religion, of which Bowne's philosophy is but an example, reflects major themes in American evangelicalism and roman- ticism, and also illustrates the effort of western thinkers generally to retain a spiritual orientation in a world that was draining the supernatural of em- pirical significance, hence of meaning.37 Human nature, if not physical nature, pointed toward the infinite and reestablished a sense of familiarity with the cosmos. On another level, the quest for cosmic comfort reflects the prevailing nineteenth-century desire for stability and control in a time of rapid social change. As industrial society grew stranger and more inhospitable to human sentiments, Victorian people turned to institutions like the home and family for a reassuring and cozy sense of belonging, intimacy, and warmth. This feeling was, if possible, even more evident in America than abroad: in periodicals, novels, lectures, and sermons. Our greatest preachers-including William Ellery Channing, Henry Ward Beecher, Dwight L. Moody, and Phillips Brooks-in different ways all preached a message of acceptance and of intimacy between God and man. One senses an almost desperate quality in some of these statements, a kind of resolute coziness. In the social as in the natural order the old personal bonds be- tween man and his world were being broken, because of technology, in the first instance, because of science, in the second. The longing for reassurance and for a more personal relation with the universe clearly was no merely speculative matter. It expressed some of the deepest needs of the age. Can morality survive a decline in religious belief? This was the topic of a symposium in the first issue of the British literary journal, The Nineteenth Century, in 1877, and was a fundamental concern of the Victorian period. The French Revolution and its despotic aftermath had convinced the early nineteenth century that morality, hence the social order, depended on faith; that infidelity was as much a moral and social as a spiritual problem. By the mid-nineteenth century, however, the concern had shifted. Among the more thoughtful commentators, at least, the dread of godless anarchy dimin- ished, and writers began to take a more serious look at the relation between faith and morals. James Martineau expressed the thinking of the latter part 37See Vernon Pratt (London: Macmillan, 1970), p. 11; Harry Blamires, The Christian Mind (New York: Seabury, 1963), and Merz, European Thought, IV, 307-08.</page><page sequence="13">The Victorian Crisis of Faith 597 of the century when, in his contribution to the symposium, he observed that, should there be a decline in religion, morality "would lose, not its base, but its summit." Basic decency would probably remain, but moral grandeur would be lost: "To believe in an ever-living and perfect Mind, supreme over the universe, is to invest moral distinctions with immensity and eternity, and lift them from the provincial stage of human activity to the imperishable theatre of all being."38 The need to invest moral distinctions with immensity and eternity was, in part, a manifestation of the cosmic loneliness many felt. Were man's highest aspirations only vain illusions in a cold and indifferent universe? But more was involved than the dread that moral values are entirely earth- bound. The dominant mood of the Victorian age, after all, was active and affirmative. When we believe "that a God is there," said William James, and that He takes an interest in our moral life, the "infinite perspective opens out," giving our moral life the fullness and robustness we demand of it. The capacity ". . . of the strenuous mood lies so deep down among our natural human possibilities that even if there were no metaphysical or traditional grounds for believing in a God, men would postulate one simply as a pretext for living hard, and getting out of the game of existence its keenest possi- bilities of zest."39 This takes us well beyond the cosmic orphan's piteous search for reassurance and comfort. It is a feeling not of weakness but of strength-a strenuous, athletic mood. The demand for cosmic momentous- ness, in other words, concerns not our low periods and our dark nights of the soul, but our peak experiences and our most breathtaking hopes for a better tomorrow. Although the Victorians disagreed about the relation of faith and morals, by the latter part of the century many would have agreed with Martineau that religion is more important to morality's summit than to its base. Some took the matter a step further and, along with the American educator and moralist, John Bascom, argued that religion "is not so much the foundation of morals, as morals is the foundation of religion."40 The belief that morals are the foundation of religion was premised on the conviction that man is a moral being by nature, and that the universe is governed by moral laws that function and can be known in a way analogous to natural laws. This convic- tion, which was more systematically and elaborately set forth in America than abroad,41 assumed that man is possessed of a conscience and a free 38Martineau, "The Influence upon Morality of a Decline in Religion," Nineteenth Century, 1 (April 1877), 343. 39"The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life," Will to Believe, pp. 212-13. 40Bascom, "Atheism in Colleges," North American Review, 132 (January 1881), 38. 4'For more detail see: D.

All this provided what seemed a sound basis both for morality and religion, for, as one writer on the subject observed, in giving us a conscience, God "has not left himself without a witness, in the breast of every man."42 Indeed, it was a widely- shared conviction that the unbeliever, if he were open-minded, could be converted by an appeal to his own moral nature. More than this, for the believer himself the earnest pursuit of good character was one of the surest means of spiritual as well as moral growth. As we try to perfect our character, William Ellery Channing observed, we learn that human nature is "spiritual": the soul "is created to look beyond and above all material things." God has "imprinted on us the end of our being in giving us this central impulse towards himself." The idea of God, Channing said, is "an exhaustless spring of energy against weakness, of peace amid vicissitude, of courage to do and suffer, of undying hope, of immortal life."43 In their search for cosmic comfort and reassurance, it may be said, the Victorians cried out God's name in loneliness and desperation. In their pur- suit of the momentous, however, they sallied forth as soldiers prepared to do battle in His name. Met in this spirit, God is less a heavenly father than a cosmic partner. He is, as Matthew Arnold put it, an "enduring power, not ourselves, which makes for righteousness."" We serve Him by cooperating with Him in this grand cause. God, in turn, helps man by acting as he did for Job-as his witness and vindicator. We demand to know, Josiah Royce said, "that, when we try to do right, we are not alone; that there is some- thing outside of us that harmonizes with our own moral efforts by being it- self in some way moral."45 God supports us in our moral effort by giving our actions a significance that transcends our finitude, by placing them in the midst of eternity. In the final analysis it turns out that, although religion is founded on morals that is, on man's moral nature-the moral life itself takes on its fullest meaning only when one realizes how firmly morality is rooted in religious experience. Henry Ward Beecher summed it up in 1882: "Morality is the indispensable ground of spiritual fervor.... An elevated morality blossoms into spirituality. And eminent spirituality sends down the elaborated sap into every leaf, fiber and root that helped create it." The creeds of the future, he said, will begin where the old ones ended: "upon the nature of man, his condition on earth, his social duties and civil obligations, the development of his reason, his spiritual nature. . . ." Our creeds, thus, 42Archibald Alexander, Outlines of Moral Science (New York: Scribner, 1852), p. 66. 43Channing, "The Perfect Life," Works of William Ellery Channing (Boston: American Uni- tarian Association, 1903), pp. 979, 980. 44Arnold, Literature and Dogma (New York: Macmillan, 1908; 1873), p. 52. 45Royce, The Religious Aspect of Philosophy (New York: Harper, 1885), p. 219.</page><page sequence="15">The Victorian Crisis of Faith 599 "will ascend from the known to the unknown." Beginning with ourselves, our moral nature, we reach out toward God.46 Not all Victorians were able to retain or recover their faith in God. W. F. Clifford found it sufficient to hope only for a general, "cosmic emotion," a sense of awe in contemplating the universe and of reverence in considering human nature.47 His American critic, James, had to settle for an "as-if" posture and a sense of "on-the-wholeness," when faced head-on with the question of God-a vague sense of the personal responsiveness of at least some part of the universe to his strivings and defeats.48 For the freethinker, Minot J. Savage, God represented orderliness and morality-"a power whose laws are so much a part of the universe that all good hinges on knowledge and obedience... ."49 "God," for such people, was not the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, nor even the cosmic system-builder of the deists. If God existed at all, He existed as a vague hope to be acted upon or a principle of moral order. The point is that later Victorian thinkers were con- cerned that there be some moral responsiveness in the universe, or what Royce called a principle of "moral rationality" to existence, or at least something in the world worth getting excited about. Whether one was a believer, an agnostic, or an atheist, one wanted to feel that at least some of one's moral choices were still momentous. Stow Persons refers to the late nineteenth century as "an age of restate- ments." The doctrines of faith, many felt, could no longer be left to the clergy, who were ill-equipped to explain and defend them before the bar of science.50 Those who still believed that the fight of faith was a good one fre- quently sought in a scientific theology the way to a positive yet credible re- ligious affirmation. The advance of science, Octavius Brooks Frothingham declared in 1891, produced a "mental revolution" that made it necessary to reconsider all the fundamental questions of religion.51 Not just the meaning of life but the very description of the universe was at stake. Some, like Henry Adams, were even wondering out loud if it were any longer possible 46Beecher, "Progress of Truth in the Church," North American Review, 135 (August 1882), 115, 116.

Others chose to regard the mental revolution brought about by science as a unique opportunity to understand the uni- verse and to fathom its meaning for the first time. Among those who were confident that the universe is describable was Francis Ellingwood Abbot (1836-1903), the free religionist and would-be ex- pounder of a new faith, who tried both to save and to advance religion by translating it from its outworn Christian idiom into the language of scientific philosophy. Abbot regarded science as "the intellectual mediator between the finite and the infinite," since it is man's best way of receiving the "divine revelation" of the system of nature.52 He regarded nature as both an "intelligible" and "intelligent" order in which God is immanent. In studying nature in the various intelligible "relations" which constitute the natural order of things, we acquaint ourselves not merely with a limited range of predictable phenomena but with a vast system of meaning and purpose. Nature is not just a machine: it is a living organism, indeed a person. Thus, a full understanding of the universe involves the study of theology and mo- rality as well as of science.53 It is the noble task of philosophy, Abbot in- sisted, to bring together all the facts of science, and "to unite them in one harmonious, comprehensive, and trustworthy theory of the universe as a whole."54 Strongly denouncing agnosticism, Abbot looked to nature in order to know God, who is both immanent ("all is God," he said, and "God is all") and transcendent-an Unknown forever becoming known, thanks to the growth of man's scientific and philosophical imagination. Abbot's "scientific theism," as he called it, reveals what Isaiah Berlin once described as the "hedgehog" mentality-the disposition to seek "a single central vision" a "single, universal, organizing principle"-to which all things may be related and in terms of which they gain significance. (This in contrast to the mentality of the "fox," which pursues "many ends, often unrelated, and even contradictory.")53 Abbot wanted not just Truth but Unity, a sense of the spiritual togetherness of things. The ground of "all Art, Science, Philosophy, Ethics, and Religion, in strict accordance with the Scientific method," he wrote in 1890, "is proved to lie in the immanent rela- tional constitution of the Supreme Genus-in-itself, or Real Universe, and Absolute Divine Person...."56 The enthusiasm excited by apprehending this unity is not so much metaphysical as aesthetic: the cosmic beauty that was the achievement of the age of Dante and Aquinas may be recaptured in the age of Darwin.

This quest for unity, an important feature of Vic- torian thinking,57 is one of the things that accounts for Spencer's fol- lowing-for many, beside Spencer himself, regarded him as the Aquinas of the modern age. Nineteenth-century thinkers longed for a universe that was not just intelligible, reassuring, and morally challenging, but symphonic as well. In the United States Spencer had a following, although it is likely that, despite the promotional activities of his American publisher, E. L. You- mans, he was never as much in vogue as some historians have urged.58 Abbot himself never attracted a following. In fact, Stow Persons has described his career as "one of the most colossal failures in American his- tory."59 If any synthesizer enjoyed a significant (though limited) following in America, it was probably John Fiske, whose language was intelligible to many of his generation, unlike Abbot's, and whose philosophical system, as we observed, was more accommodating to traditional Christian beliefs than was Spencer's. Although Fiske replaced the old, "anthropomorphic" theism with a depersonalized, "cosmic" theism,60 his cosmic deity still had more solidity, personality, and humanity than Spencer's Unknowable or Abbot's Supreme Genus-in-itself. Fiske offered a cosmic unity that was for all of its intellectual shortcomings spiritually comforting and morally challenging to many. Although never the popular success he had once hoped to be, John Fiske managed, at least partially, to make up for in energy and high hopes what he lacked in critical intelligence and mass appeal. For Americans who wanted to educate themselves, Fiske helped make the new science intelligible;6' moreover, he placed it within a reassuring philo- sophical and religious context that inspired confidence in the human pros- pect and made the universe seem friendly, ethically vital, and coherent. Ideas do not exist of themselves. They have to be thought; they are the creations of human minds. Agnosticism, positivism, naturalism: these are the products of human intelligence and probing. Seen in this light, it is clear that the Victorian crisis of faith was, in significant part, a creation of the Victorians themselves. Expecting to reconcile religion and science, and re- 57As an example, of course, one may note the fascination with Hegelian idealism in both Britain and the United States in the 1880's and 1890's. 58See, for example, Richard Hofstadter, Social Darwinism in American Thought (Boston: Beacon, 1955; 1944), pp. 31-50. 59Free Religion, p. 32. 60Fiske, Idea of God as Affected by Modern Science, pp. 81-96. 61On Fiske's popularity and the limits thereof, see Berman, Fiske, pp. 220-71.</page><page sequence="18">602 American Quarterly joicing in the promise of a new, rational faith, the late Victorians helped create their own problems. They were confident that they could resolve what, in their own terms, was irreconcilable. They sought empirically to comprehend what Fiske called the Unseen World. The Victorian crisis of faith marks the breakup of an intellectual system that had endured from the beginning of European civilization, a system of faith and reason in which the culture's central myths were shared and sup- ported by the entire community, including its intellectual class. Revision of those myths began in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and many were confident that western religion could, to use the term of a later day, be "demythologized," thereby bringing faith and reason into closer harmony. Those Victorian thinkers who sought an accommodation between science and faith, whether they were liberal Christians like Newman Smyth, philo- sophical system-builders like Fiske, or seekers like James, either did not know or came sadly to the conclusion that faith without its myth-faith abstracted and reduced to its "essence"-is both more vulnerable and less appealing to the imagination than faith ensconced in a system of unbroken myths. (This is not to make a modern case for Scriptural literalism, which, in a scientific age, can be maintained only by tenaciously denying most of modern culture.) The Victorians of the late nineteenth century replaced the medieval alliance of faith and reason with a combination of sentimentalism and intellectualism, producing a statement of belief which was tenuously es- tablished, floridly expressed, elaborately vague. Such faith could perhaps reassure those who articulated it, but it would attract few converts. By the twentieth century it was evident that the old system had been wrecked. People would still believe, worship, and hunger for things spiritual. Theology even some very good theology would still be written. But there would no longer be intellectual consensus in western culture, there would no longer be a common metaphysic and a shared mythos. The educated class, traditionally the custodians of culture, would cease to function as a class, and certainly could no longer be counted on to support the faith of the com- mon people. If, as some contend, ours is a secular society, it is secular not in the sense that we lack a concern for things of the spirit, but in the sense that we no longer have a common language for speaking of such things. In this sense, the Victorian crisis of faith, whatever else it meant, marked the end of the Christian era in western culture. In the United States, where intellectual life and popular culture have been less distinct than elsewhere, where democracy has had its impact on thought as well as on society, and where the relation between the sacred and the secular had become blurred, the effect of the Victorian crisis of faith was distinctive. To be sure, the common intellectual language of the shared myths were gone. But this loss dramatized in the Scopes Trial of 1925-</page><page sequence="19">The Victorian Crisis of Faith 603 was counterbalanced by the persistence of the civil religion in which all Americans participated, the continued growth of organized religion as churches competed like businesses to reach new members, and the rise of a pseudo-intellectual religiousness in which sentimentalism and popular philosophy combined to produce an inspirational literature designed for a middle-brow culture.62 The Victorian concerns that we have examined-the quest for unity, comfort, inspiration-remain prominent in the history of twentieth-century popular culture. They can be found in the cult of positive thinking, the promise of peace of mind, the search for new harmony through a variety of mental disciplines and occult nostrums all designed to restore to life some of that cosmic purpose and moral urgency that have been lost. Although we may scorn these modern efforts to redeem us, we can still appreciate the human needs they try to serve. And we must con- clude that the American intellectuals of the later Victorian age sensed the general directions in which their culture was moving, and anticipated many of its deepest problems. Lacking their self-confidence and hopefulness, we are nevertheless still Victorians in our moral searching and our cosmic homesickness. 62This theme is developed in Donald B. Meyer, The Positive Thinkers (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1965).</page></plain_text>
