This book sets out to answer two large and interesting questions. How was it that intangible entities such as literary texts and technical inventions came to be recognised in law as objects of property? And how did 'Intellectual Property Law' come to assume the shape that is now so widely taken to be natural and necessary to it: a distinct area of law divided into the familiar sub-categories of copyright, patents, designs and trade marks? The peculiarity of the authors' approach to the first of these questions is that it leaves aside the issue of how intellectual property rights can be justified in order to focus on the apparently more prosaic and technical matter of how they became legally manageable. Remarking, rightly, that too little attention has been paid to this matter by intellectual property theorists - who by and large remain preoccupied with the loftier, but now rather tedious, philosophical problem of justification - the authors revisit the 'literary property debate' of the 1760s and 1770s for the full and candid airing it gives to the practical question of how an intangible entity like a literary composition could be identified as an object of property. They discern a pattern in the way 'the law', then and since, has approached this problem: a tendency to oscillate between reducing the intangible to some observable manifestation (eg, the precise words of a printed text, or the literal form of a patent specification or trade mark registration) and viewing it more expansively in terms of a deeper substance of which the manifestation is merely an appearance. The authors argue that this movement 'from the concrete to the abstract, from the relative security of the text '... to the shadowy ephemeral world of the essence of the creation' (p 56) is oriented towards balancing the requirements of certainty in the law's definition of the protected object and flexibility in its capacity to guarantee that the object is protected from non-literal appropriations: without the former, legal protection would be impracticable; without the latter, it would be worthless. Their general point, however, is that this balance is incapable of attainment, and that the movement beyond the manifestation, necessary though it is, fatally undermines the law's project of propertising the intangible. '[D]espite all its best efforts' (p 200), modern intellectual property law has been unable to curb the resistance of the intangible 'essences' that it attempts to grasp to techniques oriented towards ensuring the closure and stability of the proprietary res: 'the law has been unable to close the property' (p 203). Yet whereas eighteenth century jurists owned up to this structural incapacity and directly confronted the limits of their own discourse, contemporary lawyers dodge and disguise it with circular reasoning or the 'trite and unhelpful comment that [the location of the boundary around the object] depends on the facts of each case' (p 202). The process by which 'the law' has attempted to 'close 468 C The Modem Law Review Limited 2000</page><page sequence="2">May 2000] Reviews the property', moreover, shows how law actively (and autopoetically (p 57)) creates its own objects, and 'alerts us to the important role played by speculation, intuition and insight' (p 204) in legal reasoning. The authors' treatment of the second of their two major themes also begins with the eighteenth century literary property debate - a key moment, they argue, in the development both of a broad conception of property rights in the products of mental labour, and of a way of differentiating between these products and so between the varieties of property interest that could subsist in respect of them. They argue that this debate initiated a tendency to allow the form of the property right to be dictated by the nature of its object, such that different objects - inventions, literary works and so forth - were understood to attract different types of right. The authors suggest, further, that although this tendency has remained a constant feature of intellectual property law since the 1760s, a variety of inflections have been given to it over the years: where initially intellectual products were differentiated in terms of the quantity of creative labour invested in them, subsequently they began to be distinguished in terms of the quality of the invested labour, and ultimately (the crucial development in the emergence of 'modem' intellectual property law) by reference to the character and value of their contribution to the wider economy (Chapter 9). This account of 'the rise and fall of creativity as an organising concept in intellectual property law' is highly speculative and not entirely persuasive. Sherman and Bently are on firmer ground when they turn to highlight some of the 'mundane pragmatic concerns' (p 216) that have produced the categories of intellectual property in their modem form: the concerns of Foreign Office bureaucrats in negotiating bilateral treaties relating to copyright and trade marks, of textbook writers in representing these and the other categories of intellectual property law as ordered, self-contained and coherently grounded in principle; of Benthamite law reformers in codifying the chaotic profusion of mid-nineteenth century legislation; of patent and trade mark agents for recognition of their practices as professional specialisms; of the civil servants charged with standardising the opaque routines of the various registries; and of legal publishers in identifying/inventing 'patent law' as a discrete field meriting its own series of law reports. The authors are surely right to pay close attention to the role these humble and generally unsung mechanisms and personages have played in rendering patent, copyright and the other categories of intellectual property law thinkable as legal categories. Yet The Making of Intellectual Property Law never quite resists the temptation to subsume the low-level practices and details that it uncovers within a much more grandiose (and generally unconvincing) account which attributes the making of intellectual property law to 'epistemic shifts' (p 39), overarching 'logics' (p 73), or seismic transformations in its 'ontological status' (pp 62, 119). Thus the assumption underlying the book's two major themes is that the history of intellectual property law is organised into two more or less distinct periods - the 'pre-modem' (ending around 1850) and the 'modem' (continuing to the present day) - which in turn are accompanied by two 'very different ways of thinking about and dealing with intangible property' (p 3). This assumption is inadequately theorised and the alleged distinction is incoherently drawn. The authors argue, on the one hand, that the shift from pre-modern to modemrn intellectual property law was characterised by the displacement of metaphysical speculation about the nature of property in the products of mental labour by consequentialist arguments for protection based on utilitarian principles. Yet they simultaneously account for the difference between pre-modern and modern law in terms of a distinction between 'subject-specific and reactive' measures determined 'by the environment in which the law operated' (p 3), and ?

The rather clumsily executed turn to systems theory here simply highlights the implausibility of the authors' thesis - from a systems-theoretic perspective, consequentialism is the very opposite of a mode of reasoning oriented towards producing outcomes by invoking legal rules as autonomous norms - and seems thoroughly at odds with their avowed aim of undoing the prevailing sense of the necessity and inevitability of intellectual property law (p 6). Indeed the authors' recourse to systems theory appears to be directly responsible for their persistent tendency to attribute legal change to something like the developmental dynamic internal to a living organism: the text is replete with oddly anthropomorphic characterisations of 'the law' as having feelings (p 5), beliefs (p 9), sensibilities (p.20), interests (pp 4, 61, 74), experiences (p 183), and even a self- consciousness (p 61). A related problem is that it is never clear what Sherman and Bently actually understand by the term 'law'. Although they claim that their 'primary interest lies in '. .. the doctrine of intellectual property law' (p 2, emphasis in original), their analysis involves practically no reference to legal doctrine as conventionally understood. There is little here in the way of a sustained exegesis of what tend to be called 'primary' legal materials: cases and statutory provisions relating to property rights in intangibles. Instead the focus is almost entirely on other kinds of sources: reports of select committees, civil service correspondence, parliamentary debates, papers of the Board of Trade, textbooks, scholarly articles and polemical tracts written by non- lawyers. This departure from the exegetical orthodoxy is very much to be welcomed, and the authors' exhumation of these largely neglected archives has uncovered a wealth of fascinating material, but it is not immediately clear how their near-exclusive concentration on these documents supports the many generalisations they make about 'the law'. (Even systems theory's peculiar conception of the kinds of communications that constitute the legal system cannot accommodate many of the propositions the authors attribute to 'the law'). For no good reason, these generalisations obscure important distinctions - such as those between the common law of intellectual property and the statute-based regimes of copyright, patent, design and trade mark law; between judicial, parliamentary, academic and bureaucratic discourses about intellectual property; between administrative routines and legal rules; between descriptions of legal rules and polemics about what ought to be done to reform them - and are pitched at such a level of abstraction that they often fail to connect with the rich historical material that the authors have worked so hard to uncover. In summary, it can be said that this book succeeds reasonably well in drawing attention to the 'complex and changing set of circumstances, practices and habits' (p 6) which have enabled the emergence of intellectual property law in its current form. As such it performs an invaluable role, not least as a corrective to those 'histories' which represent this ramshackle apparatus as the realisation of a singular doctrinal principle, economic function or philosophical ideal. The archival research is impressive and the authors' handling of this material alone presents a refreshingly new picture of the history of the field. As a theory of history it is clearly flawed, but there is no doubt that it does at least break decisively with the theoretical presuppositions animating the bulk of intellectual property scholarship and to that extent is consistently thought-provoking.
