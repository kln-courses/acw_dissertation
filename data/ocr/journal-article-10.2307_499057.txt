<plain_text><page sequence="1">FORTY-SEVENTH GENERAL MEETING OF THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE AMERICAN PHILOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION CINCINNATI, OHIO, DECEMBER 27-29, 1945 SUMMARIES OF PAPERS PRESENTED BY AUTHORS A NEW HEROIC AGE AND ITS ARCHAEOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS: Samuel N. Kramer, The University Museum, Philadelphia. One of the more fundamental problems con- cerning the early history of Lower Mesopo- tamia, the land now commonly known as Babylonia, is this: were the Sumerians the first people to settle there, or were they preceded by one or more other ethnic groups. In the course of the past twenty-five years, as a result of a number of particularly significant excava- tions, Mesopotamian archaeologists have ac- cumulated a not inconsiderable quantity of material remains pertinent for this "Sumerian" problem. Unfortunately, this archaeological evidence has proved to be ambiguous and has led to diametrically opposite conclusions. The new evidence presented in this paper is alto- gether of a literary and historical character, and granting, of course, that it has been cor- rectly adduced and constructively interpreted, may help to settle the "Sumerian" problem. The evidence begins with the uncovering of the existence of a Sumerian Heroic age in Lower Mesopotamia not unlike the Teutonic, Greek, and Indian Heroic Ages (cf. "Heroes of Sumer: A New Heroic Age in World History and Literature," PAPS. 90, pp. 120-130). Now the evolution of the three Indo-European Heroic ages shows the following pattern. For a considerable period prior to its Heroic age, a relatively primitive people had carried on a military struggle with a civilized power on whose outermost fringes it was settled. Finally it broke through the frontiers of this power and carved out numerous kingdoms and prin- cipalities within its territory, amassing con- siderable wealth in the process; this is the period which marks the floruit of its barbaric cultural stage commonly known as a Heroic age. If now we assume that the Sumerian Heroic age is the result of an analogous historical process, we may conclude that the occupation of Lower Mesopotamia by the Sumerians, which gave birth to their Heroic age, must have marked the culminating stage in a mili- tary struggle which had begun several cen- turies earlier between some civilized power which had its seat in Lower Mesopotamia and the relatively primitive Sumerians settled somewhere along its outer fringes. In short, we seem justified in concluding that not only were the Sumerians not the first settlers in Lower Mesopotamia, but that they were preceded there by a civilized power of considerable mag- nitude. ON INFLECTION IN LINEAR CLASS B: SOME MINOAN NOUN CASES: Alice E. Kober, Brooklyn College. (This paper is printed in this issue of AJA.) PERSONS NAMED ON THASIAN AMPHORA STAMPS: Virginia Grace, The Institute for Ad- vanced Study. (Printed in AJA. 1946.) POTTERY IN CHICAGO: Franklin P. Johnson, University of Chicago. Seven pieces in the Classical Collection of the University of Chicago were shown. A My- cenaean kylix, very like those found at Zy- gouries, probably came from Attica. A bowl of the early seventh century is of Boeotian type, though possibly made in Attica. A vase in the form of a ram is said to have come from Boeotia and may well have been made there, though close parallels are few. A Daunian libation vase, with a priestess, is one of only five known. A fragmentary Faliscan kylix is surely by the same hand as some in the Villa Giulia. A small bowl, probably made in Italy, has several close companions, but the series is not easy to locate precisely. This paper will be published in full. 285</page><page sequence="2">286 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY GEOMETRIC POTTERY FROM SARDIS: George M. A. Hanfmann, Harvard University. Reliable written tradition about Lydia be- gins with the rise of the Mermnads, but pot- tery found at Sardis provides important in- formation about pre-Mermnad culture. Strati- fied pottery found in a trench north of the temple of Artemis may be utilized for that purpose. (Cf. Sardis i, pp. 149 ff. and AJA. 1914, p. 436 f.) Five strata were encountered. The lowest, Level 1, contained coarse, hand- made ware. Similar ware occurred under the basis of the Artemis temple. It is also illustrated by a vase found in 1922 by T. L. Shear. This pottery appears to belong to the Late Bronze or Early Iron Age. Levels 2 and 3 contained polished black and grey wares as well as two varieties of painted wares, one with orange, the other with yellowish white slip. Loose shapes and rather careless placing of ornaments (con- centric circles, hatched maeanders and tri- angles) characterize this Early Geometric ware of Lydia. It appears to run parallel to the Early Phrygian phase of Boghazktii dated before 700 B.C. Levels 4 and 5 show better organization of design and more carefully profiled shapes. The typical "streaked" tech- nique is introduced. Some of the later Geo- metric vases combine traditional ornament with ornaments of Rhodo-Naucratite or North Ionian Orientalizing character (imitation of "floral bowls" similar to those of Larissa and Naucratis; concentric circles combined with "Rhodian" animals). Level 4 is dated to ca. 630 B.c. by the Horsemen Vase (AJA. 1945, pp. 571 ff.). Lydian Geometric represents the western- most outpost of Anatolian wares, hitherto fre- quently called "Phrygian," but better de- scribed as Asiatic Geometric. While Lydian vases show some resemblance to Phrygian and develop in a parallel manner, broad resemblance of technique and ornament suggest that Aegean influence transmitted from the southern coast (Tarsus, Mersin) played an important part. Greek Geometric imports seem to start about 700 B.C. (deinoi, skyphoi), but intensive Greek influence does not set in until the time of the "Rhodo-Naucratite" Orientalizing vases. It is likely that these Greek vases belong to various factories of the Ionian cities. The persistent monochrome wares represent a native tradition. The relative lateness of Ionic Geometric wares and the absence of continuity from Mycenaean to Geometric on the coast of Asia Minor poses a problem, as the archaeological data appear to contradict the traditional foundation dates for the Greek cities of Asia Minor. The possibility must be considered that the material culture of the early Greek settlers was not substantially different from that of the local population. THE INFLUENCE OF BASKETRY ON ATTIC GEO- METRIC POTTERY: H. A. Thompson, The University of Toronto. The pottery of the Geometric period in Attica marks an interlude between the freer styles of the Bronze Age and of the Orientaliz- ing period. The unusual shapes and the close- knit decoration appear to derive from basketry. Comparison with baskets, ancient and modern from all parts of the world, shows that typical Geometric shapes, such as the pyxis, the kalathos and the tripod-stand, are clearly imitations of basketry. Similarly, the designs, based on even distribution of light and dark elements, and patterns such as maeanders, frets, and zig-zags in zone treatment obviously derive from basket weaves. Details, like the stitching of rims or the binding on of handles are so exactly copied in paint on the vases as to leave no doubt of the conclusion that the peoples invading Greece during the Dark Ages must have, like most nomads, brought with them their native basketry. THE EAGLE OF ZEUS: George E. Mylonas, Wash- ington University. The eagle is generally considered by scholars as the emblem of Zeus associated with him from the very beginning. A survey of the exist- ing literary and archaeological evidence, how- ever, will prove that only in the late eighth or early seventh century the eagle came to be associated intimately with Zeus, and perhaps in the sanctuary of Mount Lykaion. From that sanctuary it was introduced to Olympia, whence it spread to the rest of the Hellenic world in the late sixth or early fifth century. A REDISCOVERED ANCIENT HEAD: Otto Brendel, Indiana University. (This paper will be published in the AJA.)</page><page sequence="3">FORTY-SEVENTH GENERAL MEETING 287 A FOURTH CENTURY A.D. IVORY STATUETTE: Marvin C. Ross, Walters Art Gallery. A small ivory statuette of a child holding a bunch of grapes in the Walters Art Gallery, possibly intended for a knife handle, has re- cently been cleaned and appears in renewed beauty. The modelling of the figure and espe- cially of the hair places it in the first half of the fourth century A.D. This is one of the few small objects datable to that time. (Printed in Art in America, Jan. 1946, pp. 105-108.) THE BARBARIAN AS AN ATTRIBUTE OF THE EM- PEROR: Annalina Levi, L. I. The meaning of the representations of the Roman emperor or Victory with a small bar- barian who does not take any active part in the action, at or under their feet has been rightly understood by several authorities. It is a sym- bolical representation of the victory of the emperor over his barbarian enemies and the smallness of the barbarian is a device which has the purpose of emphasizing the moral differ- ence between the two. However, a study of this motive, as it appears on coins, has not yet been made. Such a study gives a fuller under- standing of the motive. The coin types confirm the view that this symbolical representation has nothing non-Roman in its nature; the term Oriental is therefore wrongly used. The coin types show from M. Aurelius on, a constant increasing of figures of "small bar- barians." The "small barbarian" becomes the almost constant companion of nearly every emperor and of Victory; the connection with an actual victory becomes gradually less evident. He is no longer the symbol of a people defeated by the emperor and of a single victory of the emperor; he becomes the symbol of the vic- torious power of the emperor and the attribute of the emperor and of his most celebrated virtue, Victory. On the coin types, the bar- barian as an attribute is transferred from the emperor to several divinities: some of these divinities are virtues of the emperor, or gods closely associated with all emperors or espe- cially associated with one or more emperors. The "small barbarian" is also to be inter- preted as an attribute of the emperor or Vic- tory on products of official sculpture; we have several indications that, as on the coins, there was a continuity of such motives on official sculpture also. The barbarian as an attribute of emperor or divinity appears more frequently on coins than in other arts. The reason for this is apparent. The die-maker, limited by his medium, would naturally choose a symbolistic device. It was the most economical way of depicting the emperor as "semper invictus" or of depicting the association of emperor and a divinity. In the other arts the barbarian as an attribute of the divinities also occurs, although in a limited way. (Among other examples, Jupiter is represented with a small captive at his foot on a group of Limoges, to be dated to the age of Diocletian or of Constantine; Mars appears with a small barbarian on a relief of the Museum of the Saalburg.) It is well known that the Roman emperor took many of his emblems from the gods; however, attention enough is not generally being paid to the fact that the emperor himself greatly influenced the iconography of the gods. THE DILEMMA OF THE BARBARIANS: Clark D. Lamberton, Western Reserve University. This paper centered on the struggles of the mediaeval barbarians with the tradition of naturalistic rendering in Christian art which they could understand but which they could not create, and the abstract flat designs of Byzantine style which they could follow (since akin to their own usages) but which they could not understand because beyond their mental resources. A short note follows on the renuncia- tion of Byzantine models in the transition from Italian-Byzantine style to the Renais- sance as well as in the International style. THE WEST FA9ADE OF SUGER'S CHURCH AT ST. DENIS: Sumner McK. Crosby, Yale Uni- versity. SOME PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS ON A NEW INSCRIPTION PERTAINING TO THE ELEU- SINIAN MYSTERIES: Eugene W. Schwei- gert, Cincinnati. The speaker began with a few introductory remarks that were largely speculative in char- acter, inasmuch as certain parts of the text and many similar texts are still subject to discus- sion. The new inscription (Agora Inventory No. I, 5733) was concerned with legislation about the Mysteries; fortunately, the text con- tains a verbatim quotation from the law about</page><page sequence="4">288 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY the Mysteries dating before 460 B.C. (IG i2, 6, B, 10 sqq.=Meritt, Hesperia xiv, 1945, p. 78, Face B, 10 ff.; cf. also Dittenberger, Sylloge3, 42, b). As the text is inscribed in a normal stoichedon style, the quotation is chiefly instru- mental in establishing a certain line-length of 56 letters, as well as in indicating that part of the decree, at least, was directly concerned with state legislation based on the said provision, which stated that "the sacred truce was in effect for the initiates, for the higher graduates in the Mysteries and the attendants, and the properties of (foreigners ?), and every Athe- nian." Much of the later discussion was con- cerned with linguistic and stylistic observations on the text. Since the new decree was inscribed in Ionic letters, while the earlier law had been written in Attic characters, it provided occa- sion for contrasting the two texts from a sty- listic point of view. Likewise, a "paradoxical" appearance of two types of dative of the same declension, namely, OrzoetoONraLs (line 12) and the [ivwr]TrrlLaLv of line 15 also gave opportunity for a lengthy linguistic analysis of criteria for dating. The former dative is clearly later in date than the latter, which, as one might ex- pect, in a verbatim "quote," merely preserves the archaic form (cf. similar archaisms in laws cited by Lysias, for example). The rest of the paper discussed tentative occasions for the legislation; since no person nor event that is specifically identifiable is mentioned in the preserved part of the text, analysis must seek by eliminative procedures to arrive at a suit- able time and cause. Some further attention was paid to linguistic similarities between this de- cree and that pertaining to the "Law about the First-fruits" IG i2, 76, which not only presents a similar stylistic group of parallel imperatives and infinitives, but also has some provisions which might be connected with those of the new decree from certain points of view. A citation in the rider of that decree mentioning an inter- calation of Hecatombaeon is probably merely a coincidental mention of that month and should not be connected with the phrase 78 'EKar[op fatWUvos in line 17 of the new decree. This seems likely, as inscriptions in Attica of the fifth century B.C. appearing on Hymettian marble are a great rarity, and this would work against trying to equate the occasions of IG. i2, 76 and Ag. Inv. 5733. Reasons were also presented briefly for think- ing that a hidden occasion for the general provisions in the law lay in the dispute that took place in 367/6 B.C. between Athens and Aetolia involving the arrest of two spondo- phores (cf. Schweigert, Hesperia viii, 1939, pp. 5-12). Many subsidiary lines of digression are concerned with the r6les of the hierophant, the thesmothetae, and various kinds of dokimasiai alluded to in the text. THE STYLISTIC DEVELOPMENT OF CLASSICAL SCULPTURE ACCORDING TO THE RED- FIGURED VASES: Cleta Olmsted Robbins, The University of Rochester. ATTIC ONOI OR EPINETRA: David M. Robinson, The Johns Hopkins University. (Pub- lished in AJA. 1945.) THE SCULPTURED METOPES OF THE HEKA- TOMPEDON: William B. Dinsmoor, Co- lumbia University. (This paper will be published in the AJA.) OSTRAKINA TOREUMATA: D. B. Thompson, The University of Toronto. A mould found in Corinth in 1938 gives us a hint of the "ostrakina toreumata" which Strabo describes as found in the Roman excava- tions of the cemteries of Corinth. It was evi- dently taken from a metal object which had a curvature and may well have been of vase shape. An impression shows a Giant hurling a stone at an adversary, while a creature, a leopard, bites his leg. The relief is very high, most delicately modelled in a violent style. The turn of the body, the uplifted glance, the wild hair are in the style of the Melos amphora and of Epidauros sculpture and can be dated ca. 375 B.C. It is a masterpiece which gives us a hint of the brilliant metal-work for which Corinth was famous. FIELD EXCAVATIONS IN ECUADOR: Edwin N. Ferdon, School of American Research. THE KUAUA MURALS PRESERVED BY A SPECIAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL TECHNIQUE: Bertha P. Dutton, School of American Research. Archaeologists of the School of American Re- search and the University of New Mexico, ex- cavating at Kuaua, a Pueblo ruin on the west</page><page sequence="5">FORTY-SEVENTH GENERAL MEETING 289 bank of the Rio Grande near Bernalillo, New Mexico, a few years ago unearthed a square kiva with mural decorations. The remarkable thing about this discovery is that these very fragile records of the past were preserved. After the plaster and exposed murals were specially treated, such walls as remained were com- pletely jacketed, and the massive segments re- moved to a laboratory at the University. There the extremely delicate work of uncovering the murals took place. A total of 85 plaster layers came to light, at least 17 of them bearing cere- monial paintings: costumed deities wearing masks and accompanied by ritualistic para- phernalia; altars and niches: anthropomorphic beings; birds, animals, fish; snakes and insects; and elements symbolic of all aspects of Pueblo life-shown in black, grey, white, red, yellow, tan, and turquoise colors. As each decorated layer was exposed, scaled drawings were made; then replicas were painted on canvas. Finally came the preservation of the kiva paintings themselves. Commercial pressboard was em- ployed as the base material, and was painted with a mixture of adobe with sizing. To the paint- ings, a hardening solution with tensile strength was applied. After a second application, muslin was placed over the paintings, and more of the solution was added. When almost dry, the muslin was rolled away from the wall, and the painted layer of plaster adhered to the cloth. This was then treated and mounted on the permanent base. A solvent was next applied to the cloth, which was rolled off, leaving the original paint- ings on the mount, very much as they had ap- peared in the kiva. By this means, every possible figure and motif was recorded and preserved. CONFERENCE ON FUTURE AIMS AND METHODS IN ARCHAEOLOGY (a) The Near East; and the Conference in Jerusalem. (b) Egypt.

The subject of the address was the state of the cultural, historical, and educational monuments and institutions of the city of Rome at the time of its liberation by the American Fifth Army on June 4, 1944, and the measures taken by the military authorities to provide for their protec- tion and rehabilitation while the city was under military control. In planning for the administration of Rome, the speaker, Lt. Col., CMP, Education Officer of the Rome Area Command, and Lt. Perry Cott, USNR, Fine Arts Officer, listed all monuments and institutions which should be put "off-limits" to all military personnel in order to prevent them from being requisitioned for military pur- poses and to protect them from inadvertent damage by troops. The list included all museums and galleries, libraries and learned academies both Italian and foreign, scientific institutions, the University and schools. Each building was marked clearly on maps of the city intended for distribution to the military and civil police authorities. The list was approved by General Mark Clark and distributed in the form of an order addressed to all military personnel placing the buildings in question "off-limits." The speaker and Lt. Cott entered Rome on the morning of June 4th. The city itself presented an appearance which was in marked contrast to that of the seriously damaged Alban towns through which they had just passed. Rome ap- peared at first sight to have suffered no material damage from the war. Later and more detailed investigations brought out the following facts: 1. No bombs had fallen within the parts of the city enclosed by the Aurelian wall; 2. In attack- ing the freight yards of San Lorenzo, the church of San Lorenzo, as well as a number of the build- ings of the Citti Universitaria in the same vicinity, had been badly damaged; 3. A bomb which had exploded very close to the Protestant Cemetery had done slight damage to some of the</page><page sequence="6">290 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY tombs, but those of Keats and Shelley were untouched. All academies were in excellent physical condi- tion. The American Academy and the British School had been placed under Swiss protection which was respected by the Germans. In turn, the Germans had placed their corresponding in- stitutions under the same protection before evacuating the city. Before evacuation, however, the Germans had managed to remove the books of the German Archaeological Institute. On the whole, museums had come off well. The more important objects had been trans- ferred to places in the country less likely to be bombed, and those of less value had been stored amidst sandbags in cellars and under- ground repositories. Only a few outstanding paintings were thought to have been seized and removed to Germany by the Germans. The main task would be to set up the collections again in their proper places. In view of the terrible destruction of books and libraries in Germany, the speaker was particu- larly happy to report that the libraries of Rome had suffered no losses. Here again the civil libraries had sent their most precious possessions (manuscripts, first editions, etc.) to the country for safe keeping. Allied Military Government soon began to aid the civilian authorities to effect the return of such books and museum objects to Rome. The speaker found Italian officials in the Ministry of Education and the Department of Fine Arts all eager to resume their normal ac- tivities. Only a few at the top had been active Fascists whom it was necessary to suspend for political reasons. The rest needed principally material facilities such as electricity, means of transportation, gasoline or glass to carry out re- habilitation. The speaker and Lt. Cott attempted to furnish these materials within reason from sup- plies controlled by the Army. It was emphasized that Italian scholarship in the field of Classical Antiquity had not lain fallow during the war years. At the same time, Italian scholars had been cut off for many years from the publications appearing in England and America in their fields. They seemed eager above all that the usual international exchanges of books and periodicals should be resumed at the earliest possible moment. In closing the speaker urged all who were present to reestablish their pre-war relations, both personally and through their respective in- stitutions, with Italian scholars and friends and to assist the Italians in regaining their due place in the world of classical learning. FROM SYRACUSE TO BERLIN: Mason Hammond, Harvard University. The Roman sites of Tripolitania suffered little during the Desert Campaigns, thanks to the efforts of a British archaeologist, Major John Ward Perkins, who was serving with the Eighth Army and who secured the support of the British Military Governor to place the sites off limits to troops and to reinstate the Italian custodians to care for the ruins. Similarly, during the Allied occupation of North Africa, the French administration continued to function and the French service for historic monuments secured the whole-hearted support of General Eisenhower for the protection of the Roman sites in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. Both in Tripolitania and in North Africa, the threat to the archaeological sites was not so much from combat, which largely passed them by, as from careless or wanton trespass by Allied troops after the occupation and the police measures indi- cated above sufficed to prevent any serious damage. Despite the heavy Allied bombing of Sicily and the severe fighting during the landings along the south coast and during the advance up the eastern side around Etna, the great ruins of classical antiquity were spared. The Greek temples and other buildings at Syracuse, Agri- gento, and Selinunte along the south coast and at Segesta and Himera on the north escaped harm. The magnificent Norman churches, with their brilliant mosaics, at Palermo, Monreale, and Cefalii stand unscathed. The Cathedral at Messina has only its walls standing, but it had been severely damaged in the earthquake of 1908 and largely rebuilt. The Italian govern- ment, both in Sicily and elsewhere, did an ex- cellent job of removing and storing in safety the contents of the museums so that these largely escaped battle damage. In general, the serious cultural destruction in Sicily was to its elaborate baroque churches, notably to three fine examples in Palermo. In southern Italy, the classical remains like-</page><page sequence="7">FORTY-SEVENTH GENERAL MEETING 291 wise suffered little hurt. The landings below Salerno spared the Temples of Paestum. Though nearly two hundred small bombs were dropped in a raid on Pompeii, the damage can to a con- siderable extent be repaired. However, some frescoes and the contents of the small museum are irretrievable. Naples was heavily bombed and its important mediaeval and Renaissance churches suffered. In particular the great church of Santa Chiara, burial place of its kings, was gutted. However, Naples contains few classical ruins and the famous collections of its museum were evacuated. In a large part these treasures were stored at Monte Cassino. The Germans re- moved them thence before the battle to the Vatican City and in the process stole a certain number of the outstanding paintings and some of the gold objects and bronze statues from Herculaneum and Pompeii. Part of this loot, however, has already been recovered in Austria and it is expected that a careful check of the German repositories will reveal the rest. In due course, after the restitution of cultural materials to liberated countries is well under way, these Italian possessions will be returned to the Italian government. Professor Hammond had no personal knowl- edge of the fate of classical remains in Italy north of Campania or in southern France. His impres- sion is that a certain amount of damage was done during combat in central Italy but that post- occupation harm from the use by Allied troops had been reduced to a minimum by the prompt action of Monuments Officers who, profiting from the lessons learned in North Africa and Sicily, got in early to control billeting and institute necessary controls. He understands also that the invasion of southern France passed so rapidly through the Roman area, containing Nimes, Arles, and Orange, that these were wholly spared, as were also such mediaeval monuments as Aigues Mortes and Avignon. England's Roman sites were unaffected by the long bombing which she endured. In fact, the destruction in the City of London cleared the Romano-mediaeval wall of encumbering build- ings and it is hoped that before rebuilding begins, archaeologists may have an opportunity to in- vestigate the Roman and mediaeval levels. The great classical sculptures, such as the Elgin Marbles, and other treasures of the British Museum had been removed to safety before the bombing. Similarly, the French had stored the treasures of the Louvre outside Paris and,have already brought back and put on display much of the classical sculpture, including the Venus di Milo and the Victory of Samothrace. In general, the Germans, anxious to conciliate the French, did not loot her public collections and confined themselves to confiscating the collections of wealthy Jewish families or to the sort of indi- vidual looting by officers or troops which always happens when an army is billeted on the civilian population. Though France suffered no loss in its classical antiquities, naturally the invasion of Normandy was disastrous to some Norman and Gothic churches. In Germany itself, Trier was terribly hit but the Porta Nigra and the walls of the Roman Basilica still stand. Germany's important classi- cal antiquities are, in general, the contents of her museums and these, except in the case of Berlin, had been stored in scattered repositories so that while in most cases the museum buildings them- selves are more or less destroyed, their contents are safe. In Berlin, the ethnographic and pre- historic collections had been evacuated but the art objects, both ancient and modern, had been placed in big concrete airraid shelters within the city. Only towards the last was a small portion of these evacuated and eventually discovered by U. S. troops. This small proportion, fortunately, contained some of the best objects, such as the choice Egyptian sculpture, notably the head of Nofretete, and the finest mediaeval and Renais- sance sculpture, and some two hundred master- pieces of paintings, whose removal to the U. S. was recently announced by the National Gallery of Art in Washington. The objects which re- mained in Berlin survived the bombing only to be almost totally consumed by fire during the dis- turbed days immediately following the occupa- tion. This loss bids fair to be the most important, in the cultural field, of the whole war, not exclud- ing the destruction of such cities as Munich, Nuremberg, Dresden, Warsaw, or Leningrad. A certain number of the stored art objects which escaped destruction have been removed from Berlin by the Russians, notably the famous Hellenistic sculptures from the great altar en- closure at Pergamum. Professor Hammond felt that the protection</page><page sequence="8">992 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY and preservation of cultural buildings and ma- terials under Allied military government had been an outstanding success. This was in large measure due to the foresight of interested archae- ologists and art historians in this country and in England. Two preparatory programs initiated in the U. S. had been particularly valuable; the preparation for the use of Monument Officers of lists of important cultural sites, buildings, and collections, and the recommendation to the War Department of qualified art historians or mu- seum personnel to serve as Monuments Officers in the field. While these programs were initiated before the formation of the American Commis- sion for the Protection and Salvage of Artistic and Historic Monuments in War areas under Justice Roberts, this Commission integrated the previous work into a coherent program and, in its advisory capacity to the U. S. Government, con- vinced the War Department and other high officials of the importance of putting the program into effect. The program had the full and under- standing support of President Roosevelt. This preparatory work, and the high personal ability and character of the Monuments Officers in the field, made it possible for the program to be carried through successfully. This work, more- over, won the enthusiastic support of the liber- ated governments and conciliated great good will for the Allied Military Government. The whole- hearted cooperation between U. S. and British and later the other liberated governments made the final operation truly international.</page></plain_text>
