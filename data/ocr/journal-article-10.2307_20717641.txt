<plain_text><page sequence="1">Truth and Lies in the Early Nietzsche Robert Pippin I Nietzsche is well known for a critique of the classical philosophical tradition. But there is an obvious problem in understanding this critique. At points it seems completely dismissive, to hold that philosophy itself is pathological, always a symptom or sign of a kind of spiritual and ethical degeneration, a self-destructive hatred of life. (Just as there cannot be a "good" version of alchemy, astrology, or misogyny, there cannot be an improved or better version of such a sickness.) At other points, this critique only seems aimed at essentialist or metaphysically realist, or dualist, or Platonic-Christian philosophy, naturally raising the question of the Nietzschean philosophical alternative, the nature of the authority with which Nietzsche proclaims it, and the relation of such an alternative to the much criticized asceticism. There are scores of ways of considering Nietzsche's texts in order to raise this question. I shall concentrate on an early version: the contrast between the tragic and the Socratic point of view, and its implications in Nietzsche's work of the early 1870's. I raise this question because of some dissatisfaction with many widely known and influential characterizations of Nietzsche's relation to traditional philosophy. These include characterizations of Nietzsche as: 1. The last metaphysician of the Western tradition. By being wedded to a radical and unprecedented metaphysics of the will to power, according to Heidegger, he supposedly reveals the underlying assumptions of all modern philosophy and so the unavoidable nihilism which is the fate of all post-Platonic philosophy. 2. A psychological "underminer," and therapist; someone who reveals the true or secret motivations of philosophical activity; perhaps even a naturalist, an instinct therapist. 3. An aesthete or litterateur; someone who understands philosophical world-views and normative claims as, let us say, poems, matters of taste or style, and whose final normative assessments of life are and must be based on aesthetic criteria. 4. Some sort of armchair cultural anthropologist or ethnologist, for whom philosophical and religious claims and the political and moral practices they sustain, are the mere integrating, conformity-inducing tribal rituals or mythic practices of our clan; an ethnologist who can reveal the essentially practical function of such rituals in our community. 5. A provocateur, experimenter, shock therapist, dismantler. This is a Nietzsche capable of revealing the immoralism of all morality, the cruelty in Christian pity, the fear and cowardice 35</page><page sequence="2">in modern egalitarianism, not because of any grand theory of immoralism or cruelty, but just because of an intense sensitivity to the actual cruelty in Christianity, the immoral arbitrariness and brute contingency in moral evaluation. This Nietzsche is as internalist a critic as there ever was; the Nietzsche who merely wears masks, assumes roles, inhabits philosophical views more authentically and intensely than their adherents can. A deconstructive force of nature, if such a thing is possible: at once "every name in history" and "dynamite." 6. There is finally the surface meaning; that Nietzsche is not a critic of philosophy, but himself a philosophic critic; not someone dissatisfied with metaphysics as such, but only a metaphysics bewitched by the stability of language and logical form; himself an exponent of a metaphysics of radical flux, of unstable, shifting, provisional identity; a proponent of cyclical, mythic time (the Nietzsche of L?with, Klossowski); the Deluezean Nietzsche of active forces; the theorist of Moc/if-quanta, of life as the senseless and ceaseless expression of force (G?nther Abel's quasi- Leibnizean); the linguistic and conceptual idealist and relativist epistemologist so favored by Anglophone commentators; the moralist whose own moral recommendations seem grounded on how things really are, not how we would like them to be. This last Nietzsche has a theory of forces, or drives, of Dionysean reality, of values, of language, of will, of appearance; lots and lots of theories, and no general position against theory. The tragic point of view relies on the philosophy of the Dionysean; genealogical critique on the nature of any possible evaluation and on human nature in general; psychological critique on a displacement of naive and distorted views of human desire and the soul, in favor of a true view. By contrast, the more radical, contemporary Nietzsche is anti-theory and anti-philosophy altogether, an enemy of the ascetic ideal and suspicious of any value to truth, simply because, for this Nietzsche, there just is no truth. Moreover, there is also the merely philosophic Nietzsche who is no "master thinker," or great philosopher, just generally philosophical, perhaps even slightly sub-philosophical. This is the Nietzsche who belongs with Voltaire, LaRochefoucauld, Heine, Emerson, Carlysle, Huxley, even Spengler; as powerful an essayist as ever there was, but essentially a moralist; a Camus, not a Heidegger, as a philosopher, a Schopenhauerean-Wagnerian echo, not some new voice, some Wittgenstein. But the question of these various Nietzsches, raised like this, would have to lead into the complexities of Nietzsche reception, and the function "Nietzsche" has served in modern European intellectual history; it would require a compilation of the many valuable books now appealing in what seems to be the "Nietzsche in..." series. Nietzsche in Germany, in England, 36</page><page sequence="3">in France, in Italy, in Russia (I think there are books with all those exact titles). My own view is that there is ample textual evidence, in the standard scholarly sense, to support any of these versions. I hope to make some progress in exploring in what sense they could all have come to be influential by exploring the contrast mentioned above in detail. My orienting question is the one that emerged in Nietzsche's explosive first work and remained with him throughout his life: what it means to see philosophy (and eventually science, morality and art) all "from the point of view of life," and especially from the point of view of a "possible" (or by contrast, "impossible") life. Although Nietzsche would not pursue the "artist's metaphysics" he originally proposed as the most adequate to the possibility of life, he never abandoned as his central question the question of what was necessary for an affirmable or sustainable life, and never abandoned his claim that traditional philosophy, religion and the moral point of view had turned out to be inadequate answers to such a question. (It is typical of Nietzsche that the most concentrated statement of his own final answer occurs only parabolically, in the tension between Zarathustra's two "mistresses, "life" and "wisdom," the original contrast with Socraticism set up in BT, and that what appears to be Zarathustra's resolution of this issue is "whispered into life's ear," and that we are never told what Zarathustra said! 1) But framing the issues this way forces us to ask just what the question is which Socraticism was an inadequate response to, this question of the possibility of life. As I hope to begin showing, Nietzsche's view of this matter is far more complex and elusive than it might first seem. Accordingly, I propose simply to plunge right in by first simply summarizing what appears to be the thesis of BT, at least the thesis relevant to us and to this question. That thesis concerns the origin and demise of Greek tragedy in the classical period; a familiar and profoundly interesting question (why, under what circumstances, what does it mean, that at some point in the orgiastic and largely feminine rights associated with Dionysus (the goat dance or goat sacrifice, tragoidia), an individual character would begin to speak as the great suffering god Dionysus; why would then, eventually, the practice of corning together in the dark, in some continuing sense of religious sanctity and quiet, in order to watch human beings pretend to be all sorts of other human beings and gods, suffering horrible, painful fates, come to be a central cultural experience, to inaugurate the Western dramatic tradition itself.) Nietzsche presents his own answer to this question in a way connected to claims about music and contemporary culture which betray the deep influences of Schopenhauer and Wagner. In a sense, thanks to these influences, the surface claims made by Nietzsche appear typical of late Romantic disaffections. BT seems to celebrate the more deeply revelatory nature of 37</page><page sequence="4">pre-reflective, even pre-rational and pre-verbal primary experiences, an individuality dissolving, Dionysean intoxication. He claims that living remnants of this original Dionysean, musical experience are present in the early function of the chorus and choral odes, and in the horrific failures of tragic heroes. Something in both the horror and the heroism of the excessive things which Agamemnon or Orestes must do, of Oedipus's failed attempt at wisdom, of Prometheus's suffering, figure what true "Ur-eine" chaos, arbitrariness, chance lies behind our feeble, if beautiful, attempts at order, nomos, intelligibility. (The true figure for Dionysean wisdom, requiring an indifference to all norm, limit, is thus, as Nietzsche claims, Oedipus's incest, a desire he both must and cannot have. The same is true of Prometheus in Nietzsche's account, whose "sacrilege" is "necessary" but who must also, paradoxically, himself demand justice and measure. Hence tragic wisdom: Alles Vorhandene ist gerecht und ungerecht und in beidem gleich berechtigt. All that exists is just and unjust and equally justified in both. (GT, 71; BT, 72) In fact, in Nietzsche's unusual "theory of acting," characters represented in front of the chorus are collectively experienced as the projections of this intoxicated mass; dream like images, whose instability, fragility and even arbitrary inhabitability by all are actually experienced as such in the collective dramatic experience. This is all by contrast with the limitations and foolish optimism of the Socratic search for meaning through logos, definition, and the hope for an intelligible structure beneath or beyond the appearances. And, as noted, this appears a predictable contrast between the romantic-expressive lamp and the classical-reflecting mirror, between intuitive insight and the limitations of reflective or rational or empirical approaches. But Nietzsche goes well beyond such standard polarities by treating the tragic itself as a complex ethical category, by understanding the dramatic experience in terms of very broad questions of affirmation and evaluation, the very sustainability of life itself. (The word he uses to characterize tragedy's function is Rechtfertigung, justification, and for reasons that will soon become clear, it is important to recall the resonances that term would call to mind in Nietzsche's German audience: Rechtfertigung durch die Gnade or im Glauben, or the sense of justification relevant to Luther and the justification or "live-ability" of existence by grace and faith, not some notion of a metaphysical or philosophical foundation.)2 There is, in his account of tragedy, hardly just intoxicated selflessness in an unstable tension with dream like individuals and resolutely if irrationally cheerful Olympian gods. There is also a full tragic point of view, a way of appreciating and judging which is best understood by contrast with the Socratic and eventually the moral point of view. These evaluative issues involve the problem of suffering and justification in the largest sense. The question he takes tragedy to be answering is, he says, a possible response to the wisdom of Silenus: Silenus, who says, the 38</page><page sequence="5">best is never to have been born; next best, to die young. This is what will lead him, as we shall see, to such a radical contrast with Socratic philosophy. The contrast shall turn on questions significant for the rest of Nietzsche's work: the problem of appearances or illusions (here the question of aesthetic justification, and an artist's metaphysics) and the larger question introduced by Socrates, in contrast to such justification, what Nietzsche calls "the value of truth." n Historically, BT is cobbled together from 3 essays which Nietzsche, the 26 year old Wunderkind, gave as public lectures in Basel in 1870 and then worked up into his momentous first book. "The Greek Music Drama" ; "Socrates and Tragedy"; and the "Dionysean World View. "3 Because Nietzsche, the much heralded student of the great Leipzig scholar Ritschl, was supposed to be the next great name in German philology, the spectacularly unorthodox nature of the claims in classical scholarship, and its unprecedented form (no footnotes!), dominated the book's disastrous reception. This was especially true because of Nietzsche's refusal to accept those aspects of Greek culture which for so long seemed to comfort German intellectuals, the edle Einfalt and still Gr?sse of Winckelman. Not simplicity, form, clarity, sculpture, architecture and light (order) made the Greeks Greek for Nietzsche, but sex, violence, blood, lust, alcohol, orgies, music and the darkness of the human soul (excess). Nietzsche took extremely seriously the historical origins of tragedy in Dionysean festivals, and linked the meaning of tragic experience to these orgiastic intoxications, and made use of Schopenhauer's theory of the will, the collapse of the principium individuationis into pure, selfless will, and the experience of music, to explain what such a Dionysean experience would be like and what its significance might be. In making these points, BT would introduce a major player in the Nietzschean drama from now until his last days of sanity, Dionysus, the greatest god of the Hellenistic Greek world, celebrated at hillside orgiastic festivals, largely by women, the Maenads, (frenzied ones). Dionysus was the patron god of the two great Greek dramatic festivals, the Lenaea and the City Dionysia, or eventually, comic and tragic drama festivals and the stories of his origin were unusual, even by Greek standards. In one, Zeus had impregnated Semele. Hera disguised as nurse found out from Semele that Zeus was father; she (Hera) pretended to refuse to believe it unless Semele could get Zeus to appear in true form; Semele complied but was blasted into nothingness. (Dionysus was thus born as a result of the impossibility of life without illusion. We can tolerate the undisguised Zeus as little as a 39</page><page sequence="6">wholly Dionysean life, something that would dismember us.) Zeus though plucks Dionysus from Semele's womb before death and inserted him into his thigh, using it as a womb. (The story is thus full of ambiguities about male-female and life-death dualities that will show up again in Nietzsche's major Dionysean-Apollonian duality; it also means that the source of our Zerissenheit can also be the source of our birth.) Other accounts also stress the twice born character of Dionysus (Demeter, impregnated by Zeus, is destroyed by Hera, but the heart of Dionysus is saved and eaten by Semele, who eventually gives birth to him). Dionysus is thus a figure of death and dissolution who can nevertheless produce or sustain life, something important both in the ritual eating of the sacrificed goat at the festival and in Nietzsche's account of tragic affirmation.) Likewise, in his account of Apollo Nietzsche insisted on something common in much nineteenth century German treatment of Greek religion: that it was fundamentally an aesthetic, not a doctrinal or sectarian phenomenon. The Greeks experienced the Olympian world as a delightful as well as frightening dream world; sacrifices and rituals were more a communal aesthetic festival, where notions of a god's will, appeasement, forgiveness etc. could not have played the roles they were to play later in the West. (A point in Nietzsche's favor, pointed out by Blumenberg among others: there is no evidence of doctrinal or scriptural controversies. Several differing accounts of Prometheus, Dionysus, Odysseus, Pandora, etc. could co-exist comfortably, with no evidence that anyone was much concerned about which one was true.4 This is exactly what seemed to upset Socrates in the Republic so much; poets could say whatever they wanted about the gods and no one seemed to imnd, no one seemed to care what was "true." As we shall see, on this and the issue of Socrates's criticism of imitation, of poets pretending effectively to be whomever they please, Nietzsche will claim that Socrates makes a gross category mistake, failing or refusing to see that poets are not bad or incomplete philosophers.) What got Nietzsche into so much trouble was this suggestion in BT that the Greek tragic experience was not fundamentally religious or politically cautionary, not a way of depicting excess, in order to reconcile us to limits. It was just the opposite! Where Aristotie might see in Prometheus or Oedipus excess as hybris, Nietzsche saw a "titanic love of man," and "excessive wisdom" that could not be restrained or avoided (at least not without the consequences of the moral point of view he will come to hate); "The 'titanic' and 'barbaric' were in the last analysis as necessary as the Apollonian." "Excess (?bermaass) revealed itself as truth." (GT, 41; BT, 46) (The nature of this necessity is really the main issue of BT and in its treatment of Socrates.) 40</page><page sequence="7">Tragedy was treated as a way of revealing the inevitable, necessary (even in some sense welcome) dissolution of limit, form, even the very sustainability of individual characters, and yet a way of affinning life anyway, a "once more, de capo," in spite of all that, a heroic pessimism. Tragic drama was thus said to involve the perennial opposition between two natural drives, or "art-impulses," the Dionysean and the Apollonian, representing both the inevitability of the Greek dream world of the plastic arts, sculpture, and the heroic attempts by individuals to establish identity, norm, measure, limit, within such dream-like orders, as well as the inevitable disintegration of such illusory stability, reclaimed by Dionysean formlessness. The tragic experience itself, by refusing to deny or avoid such inevitability both revealed and helped create a distinct mode of courageous affirmation, a tragic affirmation, even an aesthetic justification of existence. Finally, to complete this brief summary (I shall pass over the "rebirth of tragedy," Wagnerian issues beginning in section #16), Nietzsche also proposes an account of the end of tragedy, and the loss of cultural authority, for the tragic point of view. The main villain is, of course, Euripides, though his decadence is frequently traced to Socrates. To separate this original and all-powerful Dionysean element from tragedy, and to reconstruct tragedy purely on the basis of an un-Dionysean art, morality, and world-view - this is the tendency of Euripides as it now reveals itself to us in clear illumination. (GT, 82; BT,81) What is sometimes described as the sexual coupling of the Dionysean and Apollonian, or the "expression of two interwoven artistic impulses," is now perceived as unacceptable or impossible. The Dionysean risks, religious fervor, heroic excess of Oedipus, Prometheus, Antigone, now look, from a wholly Apollonian, "cool" perspective, simply irrational, imprudent, unjustified and so unjust. Chance, random suffering, the pre-history one inherits and cannot control, now look simply unjust and unacceptable, now a reason, if unopposable, unredeemable, to accept the Silenus wisdom. The Dionysean is "scared off the stage" by a "demonic power speaking through Euripides": Socrates. Even the "sliining" images of the Apollonean dream world now appear as mere "lack of insight and the power of illusion," from which Socrates infers "the essential perversity and reprehensibility of what exists." (GT, 89; BT, 87) Virtue must now be knowledge, formulable in definitions; the unexamined life is not worth living; no one does evil knowingly: ...after Socrates, the mystagogue of science, one philosophical school succeeds another, wave upon wave...the hunger for knowledge [Wissensgier] reached a never 41</page><page sequence="8">suspected universality in the widest domain of the educated world, became the real task for every person of higher gifts, and led science onto the high seas from which it has never again been driven altogether...we cannot fail to see in Socrates the one turning point and vortex of so-called world history. (GT, 99-100; BT, 96) m As noted before the important aspects of this contrast with Socraticism, to return now to the critique of philosophy theme, have to do with two themes, and the relation between them is not clear-cut. The first concerns the general question of the possibility of Socraticism. Let us assume there is something like tragic wisdom: some distinctive sort of appreciation of Dionysean instability and "real" disorder in the cosmos; a kind of enjoyment, delight in the formative Apollonian activity of human culture, a delight which can, by virtue of the kind of attachment and allegiance to existence it promotes, be called a Rechtfertigung or justification.5 Its replacement presupposes the possibility of some sort of philosophical truth-claim. Actually, it presupposes two things, both that a reasoned logos, informed in some way by what there truly is, can be achieved, and that achieving it is essential in the justification and the ultimate sustainability of life itself; the examined life and only the examined life is "worth living." Nietzsche is often taken to have denied this possibility and to have done so by making a number of philosophical counter claims in his own voice. He is somewhat cautious about his doubts concerning Socratic optimism in BT, though. That is, he makes mostly a historical not a theoretical point: that the post-Socratic philosophical tradition has undermined its own optimism (he makes clear later that he is talking mostly about Kant); "logic coils up at these boundaries and finally bites its own tail - suddenly the new form of insight breaks through, tragic insight, which, merely to be endured, needs art as protection and remedy." (GT, 101; BT, 98) But in other works of this period, one of which we shall look at in a minute, he appears to attack Socratic optimism more directly. No philosophical language could be adequate to (unstable, chaotic, formless) reality as it is in itself; language is a tissue of metaphors and linguistic tropes in no possible way adequate to the real; terms are always metaphors whose metaphorical character has been forgotten; every claim to say something true in some philosophically useful sense, the sense Socrates requires, is, by the criteria Socrates accepts, false. He appears even to claim that any truth claim is necessarily false. (This counter-Socratic metaphysics would appear invoked in BT in passages where Nietzsche 42</page><page sequence="9">speaks of the "Olympian magic mountain opening up" revealing its "roots to us." 'The Greeks knew and felt the terror and horror of existence. That he might endure this terror at all, he had to interpose between himself and life the radiant dream birth of the Olympians" He goes on to talk of "the titanic powers of nature." (GT, 35; BT, 42)). But the other question implied by Nietzsche's doubts about Socraticism is different. It addresses not so much the question of the inherent possibility of the Socratic quest itself, but what we think it will all do for us, what sort of redemptive function knowing what Socrates wants us to know, will or could serve. This question, the one I think Nietzsche is overwhelmingly most interested in, despite many appearances and rhetorical flourishes, he calls the question of the "value of truth." Trying to understand what Nietzsche means by a "justification" that is not "Socratic" will depend a great deal on which sort of question one takes to be paramount in the development of Nietzsche's remarks about "philosophy" (the very possibility of Socraticism, or the possibility that Socraticism could achieve the redemptive and sustaining function claimed for it.) To state my own view baldly, I think that even when Nietzsche wants to raise the question of the possibility of truth, he does so much more phenomenologically, internally and historically, asking about the "fate" of the Socratic promise, rather than about its mtrinsic possibility. I don't think he believes in the any such "intrinsic possibility" or transcendental question, as classically conceived, because of how he understands the relation between assessments of such questions (the possibility of truth) and "evaluations of life," commitments and attachments to what he loosely called "values" in any such assessment. His main, over-arching or Master Question is always the value of truth, or what we think "the truth" will accomplish, and more generally always the question of the various ways in which attachments to various possible lives come to be and are sustained. Admittedly, these two questions are hard to keep separate and seem, in Nietzsche's works, logically implicated in each other. After all, one good reason to attack the Socratic proposal (to replace tragic wisdom with self-knowledge) as naively optimistic is that it is simply impossible; not that, even if it were possible, it could not do for us what Socrates promises. Or, to come back to the usual paradox, there is finally no way to explore what could serve what sort of function in "life" without a "true account of life," and its "conditions," perhaps not true in the Socratic realist sense, but true in some sophisticated post-Kantian, anti-realist, satisfaction-of-our-best-cognitive-criteria, fallible, perspectival-but-not-necessarily-false just-the-best-we've-got sense of truth; perhaps not true in the sense of the great 43</page><page sequence="10">Normalizations and Substantializations he objects to in post-Platonic philosophy, but true in a way that still leads us away from the radical implications of the attack on the value of truth itself (such as those expressed in Part DI of OGM) and back to Nietzschean truths, the will-to-power-radical-flux metaphysics, eternal return cosmology, and self-aggrandizing, power psychology, those "truths." I don't think either such suspicion accurately reveals the problem Nietzsche is dealing with (the paramount nature of the value of truth question), but defending that will take some time. IV We can begin by noting that the Nietzsche-as-counter-Socrates philosopher-of-Becoming does not fit well with BT. For one thing, the passage just quoted from section #3, about the "Olympian magic mountain" opening before us and "revealing its roots" is itself presented at least somewhat conjecturally and as an image. It reveals its roots, "gleichsam," "as it were." For another the Dionysean side of tilings in BT is treated, to use Nietzsche's later language, perspectivally. The Titanic gods are as much aesthetic artifices as the Olympians, and the Dionysean is never presented as "life in itself," but, as he puts it as a "terrifying view of the world" (Weltbetrachtung). (GT, 37; BT, 43) The point Nietzsche makes against Schiller's view of "naive" poetry is meant to be a general one about an aesthetic experience: "it is by no means a simple condition that comes into being naturally and as if inevitably." (Ibid.) Indeed from the beginning of the essay (#2), the Dionysean is treated as an artistic energy or power (Kunstm?chte) or art impulse (Kunsttriebe), not the state of "things in themselves" unsuccessfully resisted temporarily by Apollonian formative powers. As Nietzsche's invocation of these mythic powers proceeded in later years, any appeal to the distinct force of the "Apollonian" dropped out, and both the necessity of and resistance to form in the sustainability and "justification" of life was, he obviously concluded, capturable in a single term: Dionysus. (Something which makes the view of art proposed in BT remarkably modernist, in even the post-Impressionist sense, as has been noted by some recent German aestheticians.6) There is no invocation of an "original," chaotic "real life"; all life, the suggestion is, is and must be lived, or as we say "led" (even, in TS2^, "whipped"), only in its being justified in some way or other, intoxicating festivals, together with the making of music, are ways of leading a life and so justifying. But the main evidence for denying that Nietzsche is essentializing Dionysean reality, or treating such a "view of the world" as the horrifying "truth" which Socrates is simply fleeing in some bad faith creation of a counter-world, can be found in the way Nietzsche describes the demise of tragedy. His basic view is not, contrary to most readings and the surface of 44</page><page sequence="11">many of his own formulations, that Socrates and Euripides are somehow personally responsible, thanks to their decadence, or thanks to what we would now call their bourgeois timidity, for killing off tragedy and undermining the tragic point of view. From their point of view, it might be possible to see the issue as one of "scaring" Dionysus off stage, and post-facto it is possible to claim that it looks like "Euripides combated and vanquished Aeschylean tragedy" (GT, 83; BT, 82), but a much greater transformation must have taken place earlier for such a contestation to have been possible. Nietzsche states the nature of this prior transformation directly at the beginning of the turning point of the essay, section #11. Greek tragedy met an end different from that of her older sister arts; she died by suicide [Selbstmord], in consequence of an irreconcilable conflict [unl?sbaren Conflictes]; she died tragically, while all the others passed away calmly and beautifully at a ripe old age. (GT, 75; BT, 76) The "event" of Euripides is called the "long death struggle" of tragedy itself. In the previous section, Nietzsche had already treated the Dionysean myth, and its sense-making and justifying function, as possible at a time, for a time: For it is the fate of every myth to creep by degrees into the narrow limits of some alleged historical reality and to be treated by some later generation as a unique fact with historical claims...For this is the way in which religions are wont to die out...the feeling for myth perishes and its place is taken by the claim of religion to historical foundations...Through tragedy the myth attains its most profound content, its most expressive form; it rises once more like a wounded hero, and its whole excess of strength, together with the philosophical calm of the dying, burns in its eyes with a last powerful gleam. (GT,74; BT, 75)7 (This is the same sentiment expressed much later in the discussion of "The Problem of Socrates" in G?tzend?mmerung: "The old Athens was coming to an end. -And Socrates understood that all the world had need of him - his expedient, his cure, his personal art of self-preservation." (G, 71; IT, 32)) Whatever Nietzsche wants to claim is unduly optimistic about Socraticism, it does not appear to have much to do with a metaphysical truth Socrates is avoiding or distorting. However, it might appear from other works of the early 1870's that Nietzsche's deep skepticism about Socrates is based on a general view about the nature of things in themselves and the inevitably "false" or "distorting" effects of all language, or on claims, much quoted in many recent works, against "truth," not just against "faith in truth." All of these are concentrated in the 1873 essay, "On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense." Here it might appear that Nietzsche is presenting a sweeping rejection of the possibility of any 45</page><page sequence="12">true proposition, claiming that there is a world in itself which we could never capture in language, which is itself only a practical instrument in no sense capable of corresponding to the world. Thus, it is only be means of forgetfulness that man can ever reach the point of fancying himself to posses a 'truth' of the grade just indicated [in dem eben bezeichneten Grade. I note the qualification on the kind of "truth" Nietzsche is interested in.] (WL, 878; TL, 81) All concepts are mere "arbitrary assignments" and falsifications: We believe that we know something about the things in themselves when we speak of trees, colors, snow, and flowers; and yet we possess nothing but metaphors for things - metaphors which correspond in no way to the original entities [Wesenheiten].(%2-3) And finally the most famous passage: What then is truth? A moveable host of metaphors, metonymies, and anthropomorphism: in short, a sum of human relations which have been poetically and rhetorically intensified, transferred, and embellished, and which, after long usage, seem to a people to be fixed, canonical, and binding. Truths are illusions which we have forgotten are illusions; they are metaphors that have become worn out and have been drained of sensuous force, coins which have lost their embossing and are not considered as metal and not as coins. (WL, 880-1; TL, 84) Well, if "truths are illusions which we have forgotten are illusions" then Socrates's attempt to justify life by understanding it, by appeal to the truth, would certainly be a non-starter. But if this is the basis of Nietzsche's proposal for some alternate "justification" of life then, first, that basis seems to be simply bad philosophy, rather than an alternative to philosophy. There is no very good reason given in the essay to believe that just because there is a metaphorical dimension to language, quite reliable truth-conditions for the utterance of expressions cannot be given. There is no particular reason to think that one needs some direct realist theory of reference or any theory of reference or even of meaning to establish truth conditions, and certainly no good reason to believe that we know that what we say is and must be "false." That possibility seems manifestly inconsistent with the thesis itself. And, secondly, it seems grossly inconsistent with Nietzsche's later work, which, say in his Genealogy, claims to have discovered many "unpleasant" truths about the origins of morality. We can deal with the latter problem in the usual way of scholars: there are different periods in Nietzsche's development. He changed his mind; ceased to believe there was a truth in itself which no one could get at or that all assertions had to be "false"; in some perspective relative sense, some things could be said to be true, in some sense of improvable warranted assertability, etc. (Maudmarie Clarke has gone about as far, in as much detail, as one can go in this direction, arguing that the decisive break comes in 1882, in #54 of the Gay Science, 46</page><page sequence="13">where the very conceivability of any thing in itself is rejected.)8 But already in this work Nietzsche claims that "The 'thing in itself is likewise something quite incomprehensible [unfasslich] to the creator of language and something not in the least worth striving for." (WL, 879; TL, 82) (Strictly speaking, this already means that the claim that language must get things, things in themselves, wrong, is already itself "incomprehensible.") As in much other work of this period, however, the object of his attack seems not to be a general theory of the possibility of truth. It is concentrated on the sort of truths which "the man of truth, the scientist, the philosopher" (Ibid.) want to establish, and why they want to establish them, and which provoke Nietzsche's scorn and skepticism. Some realist claim about "essential qualities" and the redemptive hopes for knowledge of the real, not the appearances, remains his target throughout, and he particularly takes aim at those who think that such truths can be established by examining linguistic commitments. It is philosophical and potentially redemptive (or life-"justifying") truths which are better understood as "really" a "moveable host of metaphors," etc. It is by virtue of such aesthetic qualities, he continues to argue in this essay, that they can justify (in the unique sense in which "life" can be justified), although we "forget" that and try to link such claims about "honesty" and "essence" to use two of his examples, to real properties in the world. Without such reassurance and realist confirmation, the redemptive function of such truths would, we have come to believe, or been led to believe "after Socrates," fail. This is the point, after all, of the parabolic beginning to the essay, which I shall quote from the full 1872 version for Cosima Wagner: Once upon a time, in some out of the way corner of that universe which is dispersed into numberless twinkling solar systems, there was a star upon which clever beasts invented knowing. It was the most arrogant and mendacious minute of world history, but nevertheless only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths the star cooled and solidified, and the clever beasts had to die. The time had come too, for although they boasted of how much they had understood, in the end they understood to their great annoyance that they had understood everything falsely. They died and in dying cursed truth. Such was the nature of these desperate beasts who had invented knowing. (PW, 759-60; PT, 65) like BT, this passage speaks of a kind of natural (or historical) death for the Socratic hopes for knowledge. One minute of knowledge and we find that we do not know what we need to know in order to live, and die cursing truth. In this and many other essays of this period, Nietzsche's attention is directed to the expectations for philosophical knowledge and his comments always try to show that, in so far as such claims can fulfill redemptive, justifying 47</page><page sequence="14">functions, respond to Silenus, answer the basic question "Wozu lebenV they do so aesthetically, not by providing some cognitive answer. It is, in other words, only under the assumptions common to the Socratic-philosophical tradition, that a redemptive knowledge of reality in itself, and so of the Idea of the Good, is what most needs attaining, that such claims would eventually have to look "false." That this is the issue which interests Nietzsche - what sorts of "truths" could "do" what Socrates claims for them, make life worth living; and are such truths possible - is apparent from the other discussions of this period. Li his 1872 essay on the Philosopher ("Reflections on the Struggle between Art and Knowledge"), Nietzsche wrote: The philosopher of tragic knowledge. He masters the uncontrolled knowledge drive [the entfesselten Wissenstrieb often identified as the problem with philosophical hopes, not the drive for truth itself], though not by means of a new metaphysics. He establishes no new faith. He considers it tragic that the ground of metaphysics has been withdrawn, and he will never permit himself to be satisfied with the motley whirling game of the sciences. He cultivates a new life; he returns to art its rights. (P, 11-12) Later in the essay, he writes: Man's longing to be completely tmthfiil in the midst of a mendacious natural order is something noble and heroic. But this is possible [and I note emphatically that according to Nietzsche, it is possible] only in a very relative sense. That is tragic. That is Kant's tragic problem! Art now acquires an entirely new dignity. The sciences, in contrast, are degraded to a degree. The tmthfulness of art: it alone is now honest. Thus, after an immense detour, we again return to the natural condition (that of the Greeks) It has proven impossible to build a culture upon knowledge. (P, 28-9) V But, finally, how, by contrast, could some aesthetic or religious or non-philosophic "justification" be the basis of a "culture"? Why "now," a question that requires some attention to Nietzsche's treatment of Christianity? These are questions that lead us again to the general issue: what Nietzsche thinks the possible justification of life involves and what is especially involved when it fails. A few things about his approach are clearer, though not enough, are clear. It is clear enough that Nietzsche is treating the problem of a possible life (a life that can be affirmed, sustained "strongly" over time) as a general problem of practical teleology and so of purposiveness. To "lead" a life is to have some comprehensive sense of 48</page><page sequence="15">what is worth enduring, risking, sacrificing etc., a sense that can provide hierarchy, make decisions coherent. (Again the clearest example is for Nietzsche the strangest: philosophers, who desire intently, their whole lives, what may not even exist, wisdom, and who thus can be said to love death, what must be after or beyond life, not life.) It is also very clear that he does not think that this orienting "sense" can be a principle or a rational norm or achieved by some philosophical truth. To quote G?tzerui?mmerung again: Judgments, value judgments concerning life, for or against, can in the last resort never be true: they posses value only as symptoms - in themselves such judgments are stupidities. One must reach out and try to grasp this astonishing finesse, that the value of life cannot be estimated. (G, 68; TT, 30) It is, though, still only initially clear why Nietzsche thinks that such principles, moral laws, rational norms, philosophical insights into natural hierarchy could not provide this orienting sense. For one thing, he thinks the evidence is in, historically. They have not been able to fulfill such an orienting and so life-sustaining function. And after Kant, the prospects are much worse. The Socratic experiment has terminated in nihilism. For another, he implies, it is only if, already, how "things really are" or what the nature of universals is or what God really wants, has come to matter to me, that such an enterprise could sustain and help affirm my "life." Knpwing what law could be said to be unavoidably binding on all rational agents might be something interesting to determine, but there is nothing in such a determination, Nietzsche keeps insisting, which would explain why such a result should matter to me. (In fact, he always suggests, if we try to explain such "mattering" in such cases, we always detect, or smell, a psychopathology; we are forced to the language of fear, ressentiment, cowardice, etc.) And it is also, finally, clear that at least Nietzsche's intention is to frame this problem of how purposes and tele could come to matter not "naturally" or "individually" but in broad cultural and historical terms, in terms of the Greeks, or the West, or Christianity. The aesthetic language of his early essays suggests that he thought there must be some kind of distinctive "aesthetic effect" in the experience of tragic drama, a "showing" or presentation or appearance that was orienting and "justifying" of itself; in participating in such experiences and only in so experiencing, could there be such an experience of the sense of things; and that he thought that no moral or political principle could be "effective" or motivating without such an "effect" (without what Schiller and even Kant promoted as the Versinnlichung of ideas). So in the Second Untimely Meditation, "On the Use and Abuse of History for Life," there is said to be a way in which our own understanding of history can be "for life" or hostile to or irrelevant to life, and Nietzsche struggles to make clear that this has nothing to do with what we would like to be true about the past, as if we could pretend that some events occurred or 49</page><page sequence="16">didn't, and nothing to do with any general skepticism about objectivity in history, or with any claim that all writing of history is merely a matter of exercising power in the service of a particular view of life. In fact, antiquarian and monumental history require us to be able to get a great deal right about the past, and critical history must be able to be genuinely liberating to be critical. The problem concerns the function of a "historical sense," or occurs when some attitude about the past begins to function in some "life-justifying" way, to assume a role which is not justified or undermined by any fact about the past, or when the historical sense begins to function "aesthetically," in the same way as the "tragic point of view." Accordingly, The historical sense, it rules without restraint [ungeb?ndigt] and unfolds all its implications, uproots the future because it destroys illusions and robs existing things of their atmosphere in which alone they can live.Historical righteousness, even when it is practised truly and with pure intentions [I note that Nietzsche conceded the possibility of such virtues] is a terrible virtue because it always underrnines the living and brings it to ruin: its judging is always annihilating [ihr Richten ist immer ein Vernichten]. (VNN, 295; UA,38) When "justice alone rules," he goes on, "the creative instinct is enfeebled and discouraged," and, especially, "only with love, however, only surrounded by the shadow of the illusion of love, can man create..." "Each man who is forced no longer to love unconditionally has had the root of his strength cut off," and "only if history can bear being transformed into a work of art...may it perhaps preserve instincts or even rouse them." (VNN, 299; UA, 40) This "atmosphere" which must "surround every living thing" for it to live, a "mysterious circle of mist," or "enveloping madness...a protective and veiling cloud," is not treated as wishful thinking, or self-projected illusion, but is presented in the language of organic growth, of what will "nurture" or help "ripen," and so as the problem of eros, not will or creation in the romantic sense. The problem is a problem because, Nietzsche keeps suggesting, the basic "possibility of leading a life" turns fundamentally on the issue of eros, and we understand so little under what conditions desire can be roused and sustained. It is clear enough that it is not by arguments that such eros is excited and sustained and clear enough that Nietzsche wants to invoke again the old Platonic contrast between justice and eros, conceding that there is some deep (or tragic) incompatibility between them, but insisting that this cannot be simply "resolved" in the Republic's fashion, in favor of justice, without the poets, with naked exercising, eugenics, marriage numbers, with eros assumed to be the "many-headed monster" of Book DC.9 Even for this, he suggests, we require an eros for justice, for greatness, for an absolute measure, which eros itself cannot be justiy measured, 50</page><page sequence="17">but must be spontaneous, daimonic. Hence again the deepest truth of these early works: "All that exists is just and unjust and equally justified in both." University of Chicago Footnotes 1. I refer here to what is, in effect, the climax of TSZ, the last two sections of Part HI, "Der andere Tanzlied" and "Die sieben Siegel." When Zarathustra whispers whatever he docs in "life's" ear, she says only, "Du weisst Das, Oh Zarathustra? Das weiss Niemand.-" (ASZ. 285, TSZ, 227.) Cf. Michael Platt, "What does Zarathustra Whisper in Life's Ear,'' Nietzsche-Studien 17 (1988): 179-194. See also the account in Lawrence Lampert, Nietzsche's Teaching (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1986), pp. 238-40. As both claim in different ways, Zarathustra does appear to be finally "affirming life" even as he acknowledges his own mortality, but that does, not help much unravel the mystery of what is involved in affirming life, or in, apparently turning from "life" to "eternity" in The Seven Seals. 2.

In fact, as the Selbstkritik indicates, Nietzsche himself came to believe that he could not answer it within the assumptions he accepted at the time. Art alone, certainly Wagner's art alone, cannot accomplish such a re-orientation without much, much else having also changed. 6. Cf. Volker Gerhard, "Nietzsches ?sthetische Revolution," in Pathos und Distanz, op.cit, 12-45, and Dieter J?hnig, "Die Befreiung der Kunsterkenntnis von der Metaphysik in Nietzsches Geburt der Trag?die," in his Welt-Geschichte: Kunst-Geschichte (K?ln, 1975), 122-60. 7. Nietzsche is not entirely consistent in these characterizations. Right after the passages quoted, he says both that the myth was itself dying, and that it died under Euripides' "gewaltsamen H?nden." (GT, 74; BT, 75) 8. Maudemarie Clark, Nietzsche on Truth and Philosophy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990). 9. It is just as important to realize that Nietzsche does not resolve this issue the other way, by "banishing" the historians here, or the just, the objectivists more generally. Even though the very title of the essay can lead to the belief that Nietzsche means to encourage some unhistorical spontaneity as necessary for life, the text makes clear that "to be human" is to be "the remembering" or the historical animal, and that while "action" can never be simply based on a proposition about history, it can neverfor that reason be "unhistorical," it must take place within the "horizon" of some kind of historical connectedness with the past and some "stretching forward" into an imagined future. How one might think of the "uses" as well as the "disadvantages" of history for life are explored in a valuable essay by Volker Gerhardt, "Leben und Geschichte: Menschliches Handeln und historischer Sinn in Nietzsches zweiter 'Unzeitgem??er Betrachtung," in Pathos Und Distanz op.cit., pp. 133-62.
