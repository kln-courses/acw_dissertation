BRIEF NOTICES GENERAL BIOLOGY A CONTRIBUTION TO TIE THEORY OF THE LIVING ORGAMSM. By W. E. Agar. Melbourne University Press, Mel- bourne; Oxford University Press, London. 12s. 6d. 8i x 5j; 207; 1943. Theoretical biology has been preoccupied in the last few decades largely with the aspect of unity (wholeness) that is so characteristic of living organisms. The study of animal behavior and sensory reception, on the one hand, and morphogenesis, on the other, have con- tributed the most striking examples of this unity of organization. It is therefore not astonishing that theoretical biology today is building largely on the results of psychology and experimental embryology. W. E. Agar, the well known Australian student of cytology and animal behavior, bases his discussion mainly on concepts of animal psychology. The study of the organism becomes the study of the behavior of cells and cell aggregates on different levels of integra- tion, and thus a striking unification of the biological and psychological level s made possible. To let the author speak: "The main thesis of this book is that all living organisms are subjects; that all but the simplest organisms (and possibly even these also) are organizations or nexus of subjects; that the charac- teristic activity of a subject is the act of perception; and that perception is the establishment by the subject of its causal relation with its external world." Is it, however, justifiable to introduce psychical factors into the study of cells and tissues? "A biologist, unless he takes the position that he is radically unique among living organisms, is concerned with experiencing sub- jects whether they be his fellow men, lower animals, tissue cells or even simpler organisms. Therefore it is not only legitimate but, as we shall maintain, necessary, for him to include in his explanatory schemes factors which are unnecessary for the explanatory schemes of the physicist-namely, such concepts as memory, anticipation, purpose, final causation-in a word per- ception." Indeed such mental factors are not more mysterious than physical concepts. Even pre- dominantly experimental workers like Spemann have used psychological concepts for the interpretation of embryological processes. Basing his thought largely on the Gestalt theory of Koehler and Koffka and on Whitehead's philosophy of the organism, Agar develops a picture of the living organism as a psycho-physical system. The organism develops into a subject through concrescence of subjects (cells and organs) during em- bryogeny. Any nexus of activity acting as a unit is called an "agent." A cell, an organ, the organism as a whole are agents. The behavior of the organism as a whole is due to the "Central Agent," which is the expression of the activity of the nervous system. The action of this Central Agent leads to two important phenomena: the experience of continuity of existence and of unity. "Once constituted the continuity of experience of the Central Agent is due to the feeling by each actual occasion of feelings of its subagents, and also of the preceding actual occasion of the Central Agent itself." Perception is the fundamental characteristic of every subject. "An act of perception is the establishment by the subject of its causal relation with its external world at that moment." It involves cognition, conation, and affective tone, and has anticipatory character. Thus the response to a stimulus is appropriate to a future situation; for instance, the avoidance response to a painful stimulus is appropriate to anticipation of a future relief of pain. Perception is present wherever life is present. Consciousness is not necessarily con- nected with it, but is rather a late evolutionary addition. The animal as a whole is a subject, and its actions may be interpreted on the basis of the theory of per- ception. This Agar undertakes in a chapter on animal behavior in terms of perception. But cells are also 236</page><page sequence="2">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 237 subjects, and the author devotes a chapter to inter- preting embryonic development in terms of perception. Cells perceive like organisms and act like organisms; they "behave." Biological fields provide stimuli, genes determine the type of reaction. In instinctive be- havior organisms strive toward a "hormic goal" (e.g., act of mating) without being aware of or considering the "biological consequences" of their action (e.g., con- tinuation of the species). In a similar way cells behave actively during morphogenesis, attain certain hormic goals (e.g., lens formation, gastrulation) without con- sidering the biological consequences (e.g., differentiation, maintenance of the individual). As developed in the final chapter, on evolution, it is random variation and selection that account for the organized interplay of hormic goals leading to the development and main- tenance of individual organisms as well as of types of organisms. The discussion is often not easy reading. Yet the ideas developed in this book should be carefully thought through by all those interested in the theory of the living organism, as well as by the students of behavior and morphogenesis. The arguments are certain to provoke debate and also disagreement, but undoubtedly should prove stimulating in many fields of biology. MAURICE ARTHUS' PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENTIFIC IN- VESTIGATION. Preface to "De l'Anaphylaxie d l'Im- munite," Paris, 1921. Translated from the French, with an Introduction, by Henry E. Sigerist. Foreword by Warfield T. Lotg- cope. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Balti- more. 75 cents. 10 x 7; 26; 1943. In 1921 Maurice Arthus, for twenty-five years pro- fessor of physiology at Lausanne, and one of the first and most original workers in the field of anaphylaxis, felt the urge to introduce one of his technical treatises with a general preface, where he gave, to the profit of the younger generation, the quintessence of his thought about the basic technical and moral approach necessary for a young research worker. The short manifesto contains nothing new; fundamentally it paraphrases the ideas which have found their classic expression in Claude Bernard's Introduction a la Medecine Experi- ment ale. Whether the strong opposition between "peaceful and solid classifying of facts" on the one hand and "quarrelsome elaboration of theories" on the other hand, established by Arthus, is justified or not, is open to doubt. And there may be some causal connec- tion between the victory of the author's ideas and the fact he already complained of in 1921, that the "scien- tific work of our young people today is often so dull, so colorless and so sad." Nevertheless, because of its sincerity, conciseness, and beauty the little essay de- served well to be saved from oblivion and made accessi- ble to a larger public. It is so necessary to think over, once in a while, our fundamental methods and ap- proach; and rare are the occasions to do so. The older generation will enjoy finding in this little book a masterful formulation of its creed; the younger genera- tion will be touched by its faith and will be able to learn much from it. The introduction and the transla- tion of Prof. Sigerist are both equally excellent. , Tik HIPPOCRATIC OAnr. Text, Translation and Inter- pretation. Supplement to the Bulletin of the History of Medicine No. 1. By Ludwig Edelstein. The Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore. $1.25 (paper). 10 x 61; vii + 64; 1943. Dr. Edelstein has submitted to historical analysis a document which has played an enormous role in the crystallization of medical ethics up to this day. He shows that injunctions of the oath, like the interdiction of giving poison for suicidal purposes or abortive drugs, do not at all agree with the general attitude of ancient physicians but point to one philosophical sect as the originators of the oath: the Pythagoreans of the fourth century B.c. He makes the same point for the attitude towards dietetics and surgery, justice and continence, the relation between pupil and teacher, as they are formulated in the oath. The oath obtained general validity only when a new religion, in agreement with Pythagorean ethics, became dominant. This was Christianity. In throwing new light on an obscure question, and in giving a concrete historical sense to precepts which have often been taken as eternal attributes of medicine, the author has not only made a valuable contribution to our knowledge of ancient medicine, but to a sound analysis and reformulation of medical ethics. His scholarly and eloquent presentation of the problem will captivate all scientists and physicians whose interests transcend the narrow limits of their specialty. COLLEGE BIOLOGY. Third Edition. By Walter H. Wellhouse and George 0. Hendrickson. F. S. Crofts and Company, New York. $3.25. 8x51; 391; 1944. The present edition of this fine text follows closely the pattern of presentation exhibited by the earlier edi- tions. It has been written especially for use by general college students, although ample provision has been made for students who desire a broader and deeper knowledge of biology. The discussions cover the structures, functions, and interrelationships of a large series of organisms ranging from the simplest one-celled forms through the more complex forms to the primates. Various type organ- isms, such as the leopard frog, are presented in great detail in outlining the important biological principles.</page><page sequence="3">238 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY Chapters on such related topics as taxonomy, paleon- tology, behavior, heredity, and evolution are included. The brief topic headings at the beginning of each chapter, and the list of references at the end of each chapter enhance the value of the text for review work or collateral study. The illustrations are pertinent and well chosen. A detailed index is provided. SimrLE EXPERimENTS IN BIOLOGY. Compiled by Cyril Bibby. William Heinemann, Ltd., London. 7s. 6d. 71 x 4*; xii + 164; 1943. Much careful thought and planning have gone into the preparation of this little volume. Since it has been written to fill a specific need in wartime Britain, it wil probably find greater usefulness there than in the United States. The scope of the experiments herein outlined is of sufficient breadth to accommodate a considerable range of student abilities and classroom techniques. Thus, we note a number of exercises which could be selected for use in Senior high school work, while there are others which appear more suitable for Freshman or Sophomore college courses. Some of the experiments can be carried out best by students singly, others are more adaptable to students working in pairs or groups, while still others are best suited for lecture-demonstrations by the teacher. The work is intended for use not as a laboratory manual to accompany any specific text, but as a guide and handbook to be used in conjunction with any good standard biology text, in helping the student obtain a working knowledge of the materials and principles of biology. The exercises are built up around broad physio- logical and biological principles, and ample use is made of both plant and animal forms in demonstrating these principles. The work is devoid of any illustrative material, but a helpful list of references is appended.

Special Publications of the New York Academy of Sciences, Volume I. By William Diller Matthew. Arranged by Edwin Harris Colbert. Preface by William King Gregory. Critical Additions by the Author and Others, and Bibliography of Matthew's Scientific Works by Chales Lewis Camp and Vertress Lawrence Vanderhoof. New York Academy of Sciences, New York. $2.00. 9 x 6; xii + 223; 1939. In 1915 the late paleontologist Matthew published his classic essay on "Climate and Evolution," for which there has been so continuous a demand that the first edition has long ago been exhausted. The present, highly welcome volume was planned primarily as a reprint of the 1915 paper, carefully revised by Dr. E. H. Colbert on the basis of later annotations by the original author. To this monographic publication have been added a few short studies by Matthew, bearing on the same general topic. The following titles have been reprinted from other journals: "Affinities and Origin of the Antillean Mammals" (1918); "The Dispersal of Land Animals" (1930); and "Tables Showing Past and Present Zoogeographical Distribution of Land Mammals" (1928). A "Note on the Wegener Hypoth- esis, Etc. Supplementary to Climate and Evolution" had been found among Matthew's manuscripts and is here printed for the first time. Included in the volume are also "Some Remarks upon Matthew's Climate and Evolution" by Thomas Barbour, and the reply to the latter critique by Matthew, first published in 1916. This book has been further enriched by a biographical sketch, written by Dr. W. K. Gregory, by an excellent portrait, and by an annotated bibliography of William Diller Matthew's works. In these various studies Matthew demonstrated that secular climatic changes have been the principal cause of the evolution and present distribution of all major groups of terrestrial vertebrates. The main migration routes of the latter all radiated from centers in the northern continental regions. According to Matthew there is no need for assuming the numerous hypothetical bridges between tropical and southern land masses which have frequently been advocated in explaining the geographical distribution of verte- brates. The paleontological facts, assembled here, strongly support the theory that "it is the environment itself, biotic as well as physical, that migrates, and the primitive species are those which have followed it, while those which remained have had to adapt them- selves to a new environment and become altered thereby." This fundamental thesis of Matthew's original study has been ably and consistently upheld in his later writings, which furnish additional evidence and illustrate the complexity of the entire fascinating problem of the connection between cyclic changes in climate and the evolution and distribution of land animals. SAN FRANCIScO BAY AS A FACTOR INFLUENCING SPECIATION IN RODENTS. AMiscellaneous Publications, Museun of Zoology, University of Michigan, No. 59.</page><page sequence="4">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 239 By Emmet T. Hooper. University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor. $1.25 (paper). 10 x 61; 89+5 plates; 1944. Major geographical barriers are well known to have important influences on zoological distribution, but minor barriers often provide better opportunity for basic studies of environmental effects and speciation in general. The present one is restricted to the San Francisco Bay area of west-central California. Ro- dents were collected from around this area and were then intensively studied with respect to coloration, surface dimensions, size and shape of skeletal parts, ecological distribution, and other pertinent compara- tive criteria. As a result of the distribution of the 43 species and subspecies recorded, the author recognizes two rodent faunal areas, four faunal subareas, seven districts, and nine ecologic associations. Each faunal division has two or more rodents and a set-of environ- mental conditions peculiar to it. Of primary interest is the division between the humid coastal belt, which extends inland a considerable distance because the Bay acts as a highway over which cool moisture-laden winds travel unimpeded, and the drier inner coast region. Each of these is divided into a northern and southern half by the Bay. The Bay itself is surrounded by marshlands which con- tain three endemic species of rodents and therefore forms a fifth major district. "In environmentally different coastal and inland belts in the bay area, the intraspecific differential characters of at least 5 species of rodents parallel the latitudinal gradients which are apparent as between those coastal and inland areas. The differential characters are principally of size and color and appear to have evolved in response to some selective force in the environment that governed the direction of their evolution." The Bay itself acts as a barrier to north and south distribution, as eight of the species north of the Bay are absent from the south side, and five are limited to the south, although in each case some of the species may range to the water's edge. Distinct subspecies are also isolated by this barrier. The differences be- tween the forms north and south of the Bay have no apparent adaptive significance and no environmental correlation can be discerned, hence "the evolution of most of the differential characters apparently has rested mainly on chance fixation... .." The differen- tial characters distinguishing the coastal and inland species, on the other hand, appear to be adaptations to the differing environments. The present physiography and climate of the area, as well as its geologic history, are described. Within the account of each species are included its range, its habitat, and cogent remarks about it that often in- clude tables of measurements. Maps facilitate quick comprehension of the distributions. BOTANY GARDEN ISLANDS OF THE GREAT EAST. Collecting Seeds from the Philippines and Netherlands India in the Junk "Cheng Ho." By David Fairchild. Charles Scribner's Sons, New York. $3.75. 91 x 6-; xiv + 239; 1943. In 1939, when Mrs. Anne Archbold offered to outfit an expedition, using a specially designed Chinese Junk, for the exploration of the Moluccas, the "Spice Islands," David Fairchild realized a lifelong ambition. Everyone who has read Exploring for Plants and The World Was My Garden will delight in this book, which is an adventure story as well as a recording of scientific exploration in strange and beautiful places. Dr. Fairchild's energy and enthusiasm have always been directed toward the introduction and adaptation of those tropical plants which can be used as sources of food in other countries. This particular collecting trip was to have started from Manila in the fall of 1939, but just as the Fair- child party was about to cross the Pacific, war broke out in Europe. In spite of the hazards which con- fronted them, the Fairchilds decided to continue, and for several months they roamed the southern Pacific waters. Then the Germans invaded Holland in May, 1940, and the Japanese tide began to roll over the islands of the Great East, forcing the "Cheng Ho" to head back to the Philippines. The story of this expedition is told with bits of typical Fairchild philoso- phy, a quaint and quiet humor, and a sincerity that leaves the reader with a warm and friendly feeling for the author. Dr. Fairchild is not only distinguished as a botanist, but as a weaver of interesting tales of far-off and fascinating places. He describes things that the ordinary traveler looks at but never really sees. The book is profusely illustrated with exquisite photographs, mostly by Dr. Fairchild, some by Edward Beckwith; the ingenious and decorative end papers are the work of Professor Raisz of Harvard University. Just as the author here followed the trail of his 19th century naturalist, Alfred Russell Wallace, so other young biologists cannot fail to feel the urge to emulate Dr. Fairchild. May they succeed as well as he has succeeded. PLANTS OF THE NIAGARA PARKS SYSTEM OF ONTARIO. By George H. Hamilton. The Ryerson Press, Toronto. $4.00. 1(4 x 7M; xiii + 233; 1943. This book is a very useful by-product of the activities of the Niagara Parks Commission, which since its es- tablishment sixty years ago has developed a system of parks and boulevards extending along the margin of the Niagara River from Lake Ontario to Lake Erie, including well planned and extensive gardens of various types, and developing the unsurpassed scenic beauty</page><page sequence="5">240 THE Q&amp;AJRTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY of the region, preserving its natural features and pro- tecting and fostering the wealth of wild plant life. The school for apprentice gardeners established by the Commission some eight years ago, following the basic principle of collaborating with nature, has offered training in practical gardening and awakened a realiza- tion of the value of the native flora and the need for its preservation. The author, botanist of the Parks Commission, during his years of service on the staff of this school has catalogued the native flora of the Park system, and mindful of the fact that the system is a natural center for nature-loving tourists who come in great numbers through Niagara Falls as the principal gateway into Canada, has offered this book to the public as a popular contribution in response to re- peated demands for information regarding the flora of the vicinity. The purpose of the book is primarily to enable visitors to become acquainted with the unusual abundance of plant life which flourishes in the park system by furnishing descriptions chiefly of the more conspicuous and important of the wild plants, without any attempt to include the thousands of varieties of ornamentals which the park contains in its more formal plantings. Nearly 900 species in about 422 genera are here described with a minimum of technical terms, their distinctive features are noted, and their names are given according to the nomenclature of standardized plant names of the American Joint Committee on Horticultural Nomenclature. Since common names differ in different regions, those of the Province of Ontario are included in many cases and it is probably to this that we owe such gems as the "Spearleaf Fat- Hen Saltbush" and the "Stinking Clammyweed." The illustrations are a valuable feature of the book. The introductory chapter on plant structures has line cuts showing outlines of leaves and diagramming the parts of typical flowers as well as types of inflorescences, while three other line cuts show effectively the dis- tinctive leaves and fruits of species of oak, the leaves of maples, and the structure of composite flowers. There are four colored plates, two of them showing more formal gardens and two wild flowers, while over seventy half-tones excellently supplement the descrip- tions. These are for the most part excellently illus- trative, whether they show close details of floral structure or general views of the habits of trees. Some, unfortunately, are slightly vague; some, such as the cattail, distinctly decorative. The descriptions occupy most of the book. The characteristics of the families are given briefly, the features of predominant members described, the presence of additional species noted. In addition an introductory chapter on plant protection asks the cooperation of the visitor, and notes that since the last catalogue of 1894 a number of genera can no longer be found, while other species, formerly common, only occur in remote spots where their inaccessibility has saved them. There is also a brief discussion of plant structure helpful to the non-botanical reader, while toward the end of the book a glossary is included for his benefit, and a list of fourteen references to other floras and texts that will prove helpful. The general index is a useful one, species names being set in italics, those of families in full capitals, and common names in lower case. Especially interesting to the botanical reader is the index of farnilies, genera, and species, which shows their proportionate repre- sentation in the flora. The book is notably free from errors, only two typo- graphical errors being apparent in careful reading. But such definitions as "oval, outline like that of a rugby ball" and "lanceolate, shaped like a lance," might prove somewhat disturbing to followers of Asa Gray. Also the characterization of the mustard family as a "large family that contains many of our most obnoxious weeds, a few ornamentals, and some plants of economic importance" hardly does justice to the agriculturally valuable Cruciferae. Although designed primarily for popular use by the nature-loving visitor, this book should find a wide sphere of usefulness. A,w SHRUBS OF MICHIGAN. Cranbrook Institute of Science, Bulletin No. 20. By Cecil Billington. Tke Cranbrook Press, Bloom- field Hills, Michigan. $2.50. 9 x 6; [249]; 1943. This handy manual contains a description of nearly all the shrubs of Michigan. We say nearly, as the writer adopts a conservative viewpoint and does not attempt to include all the named forms of uncertain validity. For instance, he lists only four species of Crataegus; anyone wishing to pursue this genus further is wisely advised to consult the more technical publica- tions. All the species are illustrated by line drawings of the leaves, fruits, and flowers. There are keys to the families and genera, and to the species when more than one belongs to the same genus, as well as outline maps of the State which indicate distribution by counties. The text contains precise descriptions of each shrub, its leaves, fruits, and flowers, the time of fruiting and flowering, and its general range. Following a definition of a shrub, which the writer admittedly reveals is not very accurately determined, there are useful discussions on identification, collecting and preserving, brief notes on distribution and ecology, a list of shrubs attractive to the birds (although with- out stating which birds), and the etymology of generic names and the more common specific ones. The writer confesses that he is not a professional botanist; this fact has certainly not been a drawback, as this worthy and practical handbook ranks with the better state lists.</page><page sequence="6">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 241 A, REviS1ON oQ THEn GENUs FUcuSIA (ONAGRACEAE).

California Academy of Sciences, San Francisco. $1.75 (paper). 10i x 61; 105 + 16 plates; 1943. Although the plants of the genus Fuchsia are commonly used for horticultural purposes in this country, no recent taxonomic study has been made of them. Since many new importations have been propagated and are being used for hybridization and culture, the writer feels that it would be important to know what these species are and where they come from. Following a key to the species, each form is described, and its leaf and flower illustrated. The writer recognizes 100 species, some of which are here described for the first time. PLANT VIRUSES AND ViRus DisEASES. Second Edi- tion, Entirely Revised. By F. C. Bawden. The Chronica Botanica Company, Waltham, Massachsetts; G. E. Stechert and Com- pany, New York. $4.75. 10i x 61; xi + 294; 1943. This second edition is especially welcome, since the first was out of print within a year after its publication in 1939 and its type was lost in the invasion of the Netherlands. Moreover, the rapid accumulation of considerable significant material gave additional reason for a revised edition, and it is more credit to the author that under wartime conditions he has brought the book up to date so successfully, extensively revised throughout, and over half completely rewritten. The general arrangement of the subject matter is as in the first edition: a brief introductory survey; the symptomatology, extemal and internal; the relations with insect vectors; the complications of strains, mutants, acquired immunity, and serological reac- tions; the methods of purification and the properties of purified viruses; the inactivation of viruses; size of particles; physiology of diseased plants; classification of viruses; and control of virus diseases. Throughout, the emphasis is on the -viruses them- selves rather than on the virus diseases as pathological complexes,, the nature of the viruses as investigated in vtro being especia-lly stressed. The controversial question of the classification of viruses is carefully weighed, and the advantages and disadvantages of each of the several warmly supported systems are judiciously evaluated. The conclusion is reached that classification on the basis of the biochemical nature of the viruses themselves as nucleo-proteins may prove the most helpful and dependable. Control measures are well covered; the limitations imposed by the fact that infection is systemic and en- during are emphasized; the possible therapeutic proce- dures, such as heat treatment of cuttings, dependent on a differential between the resistance of the host protoplasm and the virus, are discussed; general pre- ventive measures, such as roguing, the use of immune varieties, and the control of insect vectors, are con- sidered. The final discussion of certain theoretical aspects is stimulating and of general biological interest. Here are considered the nature of viruses, whether living or non-living, and the properties of viruses, compared with those of organisms, as well as the hypotheses as to their origin and their multiplication. All this leads to the conclusion that much more needs to be known of the activities of viruses in va rather than in vitro, before these questions can be answered. The 48 half-tone illustrations adequately supple- ment the text; the vignettes of the first illustration of potato curl and of Clusius' 1583 woodcut of the tulip break, the oldest known plant virus disease, fittingly embellish it. AN INTRODUCTION TO POLLEN ANALusis., By G. Erdtman. Foreword by Roger P. Wodehouse. Chronica Botanica Company, Waltham, Massa- chusetts; G. E. Steckert ad Copany, New York. $5.00. 10i x 6-; xv + 239; 1943. A brief introduction discusses the historical back- ground of this relatively recent field of scientific work and traces the start of modern investigations in 1916 and the rapid growth which has followed, growth in which Erdtman himself has played an outstanding part. As a basis for better understanding of the structure, endurance, and characteristics of pollen, the second chapter on the chemistry of peat, written by the author's brother and revised by Dr. Waksman, serves as a valuable introduction. Two chapters on the technique of preparing pollen for examination give in careful detail the equipment needed and the proce- dure followed in the complicated but successful method of acetolysis, which yields ideal material for study both in the case of recent pollen and in the case of fossil, pollen-bearing material from peat and brown coal. A detailed description of pollen morphology, fully explaining the technical features of the sculpturing and conaposition of the wall, and supported by a glossary of three pages, prepares the reader for the study of representative types of pollen of monocotyle- dons, dicotyledons, gymnosperms and pteridophytes, occupying the major part of the book,-about 100 pages. Following this there are two chapters: one on the graphic presentation of the results of pollen analysis, giving the principles for computing the fre- quency of different categories encountered, the tech- nique of presenting pollen spectra and the significance</page><page sequence="7">242 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY of pollen diagrams and of isopolls; the other, a brief chapter on the stratigraphic correlations made possible by using pollen spectra in the manner of index fossils in their bearing on paleoclimatology and geology. Following these essentially detailed chapters, the more theoretical and fundamental aspects of pollen analysis are discussed. Chapter 13 covers the output and dissemination of pollen and its differential buoy- ancy and consequent rate of sinking, with interesting data from Erdtman's own studies made with his modified vacuum cleaner conimeter while crossing the Atlantic from Gotenburg to New York. In the follow- ing chapter he discusses surface samples, comparing the different methods used and results obtained in pre- senting the pollen pictures of typical regions, empha- sizing the accuracy with which they represent the flora of the present, and their applicability in evaluating the analyses of the flora and ecology of the past. The pollen of peat is then discussed in reference to such problems as the differential resistance of pollen, the significance of pollen frequency, and the difficulties presented by the presence of secondary pollen in allocthonous sediments. A comprehensive view of the progress in the pollen analysis of Quaternary deposits in different countries is afforded by the geographical survey compiled from the author's well-known and extensive lists. The work on the pollen analysis of Tertiary deposits is well covered, and the increasing accuracy and effectiveness of the investigations in recent years are noted. The brief discussion of pollen analysis of honey and drugs reveals unexpected potentialities, such as the scien- tific detection of falsified labelling and paleomelito- logical evidence from honey in Egyptian graves. A list of 41 recent publications, chiefly American and not yet seen by the author because of war condi- tions, supplements the pertinent references that follow each chapter. The illustrative material is excellent, and the inclusion of 3 portraits of out-standing Scan- dinavian workers makes the reader wish that the editor had included here a portrait of Erdtman himself. TirE CITRus INDusTRY. Volume I. History, Botany, and Breeding. Edited by Herbert John Webber and Leon Dexter Batchelor with the collaboration of Elbert Thomas Bartholomew, Homer Dwight Chapman, Howard Brett Frost, Walter Tennyson Swingle, Archibald Dixon Shamel, Howard Sprague Reed, and Walter Pierson Kelley. University of California Press, Berkeley. $7.50. 91 x 6; xx + 1029; 1943. This book, one of a series commemorating the seventy- fifth anniversary of the founding of the University of California, is a milestone in its own right. It repre- sents the first comprehensive treatment by Americans of a tropical or subtropical plant industry. Until now we have depended largely upon the Dutch, the British, the French, and the Germans for authentic studies upon the economic plants of the warmer regions of the world. The reason for this is obvious- the United States has had no colonial empire-but the condition is nonetheless deplorable and, in time of war, sometimes tragic. The situation in the case of the citrus fruits is exceptional. These can be and are grown in the United States on an enormous scale; much research has been done upon them, and the accumu- lated knowledge and experience that must serve as the foundation for a treatise of this kind is available. The Citrus Industry marks still another important trend-a maturation in the standards of scholarship of the state agricultural experiment stations. Es- tablished almost seventy-five years ago, these institu- tions have grown and flourished. They have been eminently successful in solving many of the agricul- tural problems of this country and in establishing American agriculture upon a sound basis of applied science. The results of their research, however, have for the most part been published piecemeal in station bulletins and technical journals. This is the first attempt, in the reviewer's knowledge, to assemble in a thorough fashion all of the facts bearing upon a large and important American agricultural enterprise. The present volume, the first of a series of three, is concerned with history, botany, and breeding, and is complete in itself. There are ten chapters, each written by a specialist on the subject. One of the most interesting chapters is the first, on the history and development of the citrus industry, by H. J. Webber. It illustrates in an incomparable fashion the way in which the history of economic plants is inex- tricably entwined with the history of mankind. The story of the citrus fruits touches upon the history of China, Europe, and America; upon the barbaric inva- sions, the rise of Mohammedanism, the migrations of the Arabs, and the discovery of the New World. It becomes obvious that one of the most fascinating approaches to history is that of following the peregrina- tions of an important food plant. A most valuable chapter is that on the botany of citrus, by Walter T. Swingle. Here is the first com- plete treatment of the family in more than a century, written by a botanist who has devoted a lifetime to its study. Thirty-three genera and 203 species are considered. More than a quarter of a million micro- tome sections have been studied in arriving at the present basis of classification. The species are con- sidered not only from the standpoint of their botanical relationships, but also from that of the useful charac- teristics which they have to offer for breeding purposes. Seldom has an economic plant received such competent taxonomic treatment. Other notable chapters are those on reproduction aid genetics and breeding, by Howard Frost. These two chapters constitute a miniature handbook on the</page><page sequence="8">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 243 problems and techniques involved in citrus breeding, and provide adequate treatment of the special, in some cases unique, problems encountered in this group of plants. The chapter on mineral nutrition, while excellent, strikes one as being out of place in this volume, and probably would be more appropriate to the second volume: The Production of the Crop. The bibliography of more than a thousand titles is especially useful, for it has drawn extensively not only upon American literature, but has also brought to- gether the less accessible literature of Italy, Japan, Palestine, Brazil, and other countries where the citrus fruits are economically important. The index is comprehensive and detailed. It is to be hoped that the two additional volumes will meet the high standards set by the first, and that the completed work will serve not only as an incentive, but as a pattern, for other groups of agricultural scholars. TIHE EMBRYOLOGY oF LAix. Illinois Biological Monographs Volume 19, Number 4. By James Morton Schopf. University of Illinois Press, Urbana. $1.50 (paper). 101 x 74; 97 + 6 plates; 1943. The study of plant embryology is an extremely difficult undertaking, requiring much skillful colecting, pains- taking observation, and careful analysis of available materials. Using the larch as the experimental organ- ism for the present study, the author has made a worthy contribution to our knowledge of the gymnosperms. The discussions cover the methods of collecting and preparing the experimental materials, the process of fertilization among the gymnosperms, the rate of growth and the sequence of embryonic development as related to the phylogeny of the gymnosperms, and the relationships between Larix and other members of the Pinaceae. The author concludes that although the cellular structure of the gymnosperm embryo is relatively simple, its physiology must be extremely complex. Since the embryogeny of Larix differs only slightly in its early stages from that of the pine, the cleavage type is designated as "delayed cleavage polyembryony." The work is carefully illustrated, and carries a bibliography of some 70 titles. CONTRIBUTIONs D L'INSTITUT BOTANIQUE DE L'UNIVERSITPi DE MONTRPAL. No. 44.

Hoeber, Inc., New York. $6.00. 91 x 6i; xix + 534; 1944. As the title implies, this book covers a broader field than the usual textbook of parasitology. In addition to discussing the protozoa, worms, and arthropods responsible for human diseases, the author also con- siders the coelenterates, mollusks, fishes, snakes, and lizards that are harmful to man. The presentation of each subject is clear and concise, and as complete as possible for a textbook of convenient size. The subject matter is free of extraneous data that would tend to confuse and alienate the student. Even useful relevant information has been removed from the main body of the text and placed in the appendix, to avoid distracting the student's attention from the essential aspects of the subject. In the appendix, one finds such topics as microscopic techniques, staining and cultivation methods for protozoa, procedures for con- centrating eggs and cysts in feces, preservation of parasitological material, and a list of poisonous snakes found in the Western Hemisphere. Ninety-five figures illustrate the morphology, life cycles, and geographical distribution of the organisms described in the text. Most of the figures depicting life cycles have been taken from Kourl and Basnuevo, Lecciones de Parasitologia y Medicina Tropical. A particularly valuable feature of the book is the lengthy glossary. It is divided into two parts, 1st, Classifica-</page><page sequence="9">244 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY tion of Animal Parasites and Arthropods, and 2nd, Definition of Terms. There is also a bibliography of original literature, standard texts, and periodicals. In all, this book should prove to be a worthwhile text for an undergraduate medical school course in para- sitology. A MANUAL OF MEDICAL PARASITOLOGY. By Clay G. HIIfJ. University of Chicago Press, Chicago. $1.50. 9' x 61; x + 88; 1943. This manual is an outgrowth of a mimeographed out- line used in the course in Medical Parasitology at the University of Chicago for several years. Although it is, no doubt, particularly adapted to that course, it has been organized in such a manner that it can probably be used in most courses of parasitology offered in medical schools. Each of the first ten chapters is concerned with a group of parasites that are morphologically similar or are located in the same organ of the host: (1) Trematodes, (2) Cestodes, (3) Nematodes, (4) Intes- tinal Protozoa, (5) Hemoflagellates, (6) Malarial Parasites, (7) Mosquitoes, (8) Flies, (9) Other Blood Sucking Insects, and (10) Ticks and Mites. In these chapters, such topics as morphology, life cycles, classifi- cation, and pathology are presented. Although the limited size of the book has made it impossible to include a complete account of any subject, it should serve as a helpful laboratory guide if the students have standard text books of parasitology readily available. A few sample keys are given in order to acquaint the student with that method of identifying various organisms. The final chapter is devoted to laboratory methods of diagnosing parasitic diseases. The student is briefly instructed in the procedures for examining blood, cerebrospinal fluid, feces, and biopsy material for the presence of parasites. Serological and immuno- logical methods of diagnosing certain parasitic infec- tions are given some consideration. The Manual is well organized and written. It contains ten excellent plates; however, its usefulness could have been greatly increased had there been more figures to illustrate the morphological details described in the text. The colored plate of the human malarial parasites clearly indicates the main differ- ential characteristics of the three common species. A list of reference books and an index are included. A HANDBOOK FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF INSECTS OF MEDICAL IWPORTANCE. By John Smart, with chapters on Fleas, by Karl Jordan, and on Arachnids, by R. J. Whittick. British Museum (Natural History), London. 15s. 91 x 71; x + 269 + 13 plates; 1943. In the preface, the author relates a present-day condi- tion that makes this book exceedingly important and timely. Before the war if a person was faced with the problem of identifying an insect of medical importance, only one of two things could be done. He could ob- tain the necessary literature on the subject and identify it himself; or he could send it to an institution and re- quest the aid of a specialist. Now lack of time and facilities usually prohibit solution of the problem by either of the customary methods. This is particularly true for those individuals concerned with identifying the insects that endanger the health of military per- sonnel in remote corners of the world. In view of this situation, the author has endeavored to accumulate the information necessary to enable a person with an elementary training in entomology to identify those insects that produce or transmit diseases in the Old World. The correct identification of an insect responsible for a disease in a given location is absolutely essential for effective control. Nevertheless, many books on parasitology and even entomology only superficially consider this phase of the subject. Here on the other hand, major emphasis is placed on identification and only bare mention is made of the diseases and their methods of control. Although the author states that he assumes that the reader has an elementary knowledge of general entomology, he begins his book with an introductory chapter that presents most of the prerequisites neces- sary to understand the pages to follow. This opening chapter has the following subdivisions: Structure of Insects, Development and Life History of Insects, Classification and Nomenclature, and Zoogeography. With this information as a background, he proceeds to discuss the identification of the various groups of insects important in the field of medicine. These dis- cussions are profusely illustrated by 178 figures and 13 plates (three coloVed). The keys for identification have been carefully organized and probably contain relatively few mistakes. The chapters on fleas and arachnids were not written by Dr. Smart but by two specialists, Dr. Karl Jordan and Mr. R. J. Whittick, respectively. In keeping with the importance of malaria, one hundred pages are devoted to the identification of mosquitoes. The keys of the fourth stage larvae and adults are divided according to the four zoogeographical regions of the Old World, thus making eight keys in all. Whenever a new group of insects is considered, the author presents any special techniques that may be needed in order to handle properly the specimnens during their identification. In addition to this in- struction in entomological technique, the last chapter is devoted to methods of collecting and preserving insects. Unfortunately, the book is almost exclusively concerned with insects of the Old World. Neverthe- less, it would be a valuable addition to the library of</page><page sequence="10">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 245 even those entomologists primarily interested in species of the Western Hemisphere. TiHE ORGANIZATION OF PERMAN-ENT NATION-WIPE ANTI-AEDES AEGYPTI MEASURES IN BRAZIL. By Fred Soper, D. Bruce Wilson, Servulo Lima, and Waldemar S4 Antunes. The Rockefeller Foundaion, New York. 11 x 81; vii + 137; 1943. This volume contains a comprehensive report of the Cooperative Yellow Fever Service, which was main- tained jointly by the Brazilian Government and the International Health Division of the Rockefeller Foundation for eleven years, 1929-1940. Before the organization of this Service, there were control measures in operation against yellow fever which were clumsy, expensive, and relatively ineffective. In spite of anti-mosquito campaigns in the principal cities, periodic epidemics of the disease continued to occur. By 1926 it was apparent that yellow fever transmitted by Aedes aegypti was still endemic in Northeast Brazil between, and including, the states of Bafa and Piaui. Through the efforts of the Co- operative Service, since August, 1934, no focus of yellow fever has been found within that region. As a matter of fact, no aegypti-transmitted yellow fever has been seen in Brazil since that date. Jungle yellow fever transmitted by other mosquitoes sporadically appears.in certain localities. The success of the program resulted not from the institution of radically new control methods, but from the careful, systematic application of accepted methods. The Service believed in the efficacy of species eradica- tion rather than mere reduction in the number of mosquitoes. This eradication was extended from the cities and towns to the rural areas where aegypti- transmitted yellow fever was found to prevail. In 1940 the entire program was taken over by the Bra- zilian Government and is now being continued by the National Yellow Fever Service. The book presents a detailed description of theorgani- zation and procedures of the Cooperative Service. It includes many photographs and drawings of various phases of the work, and numerous forms that were used for collecting and recording data. This record should be very helpful to those engaging in similar work. THE CATFISIES OF VENEZUELA, WITH DEscRIPTIONs OF THIRTY-EIGHT NEW FoRMs. Proceedings of the United States National Museum, Volume 94. (No. 3172.) By Leonard P. Schultz. Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C. (paper); 91 x 6; 173-338 + 14 plates; 1944. This report on the catfishes of Venezuela is based on collections made by the writer in the Maracaibo Basin and in other localities of the country, totaling 9920 specimens, as well as on additional specimens housed in the collections of the United States National Museum. Catfishes belonging to 11 different families, comprising 51 species and subspecies from the Mara- caibo Basin, and 8 species and subspecies from the Orinoco system, were collected. Of these, six genera, 16 species, and 17 subspecies are described as new from the Basin, and four species and one subspecies as new from the Orinoco system. All specimens collected are described in great detail in the text; in addition the new forms are illustrated. There are extensive keys to genera and species, and numerous tables of measure- ments comparing closely related forms. Species not collected, but reported from Venezuela in the literature, are included with the others. NORTHERN FIsHEs with Special Reference to thKe Upper Mississippi Valley. By Samuel Eddy and Thaddeus Surber. University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis. $4.00. 9 x 6; xi + 252; 1943. More than 150 fresh-water fishes of the Northern Mississippi Valley area are described, over half of them illustrated by photographs, in this useful and in- formative manual. Keys are provided for the families, genera, and species to aid the interested sportsman, as well as the better trained ichthyologist, in identifica- tion. For each species there is a -brief diagnostic written description, a summary of its range, and notes of interest on its biology. The need for this book was created by the numerous requests for information about fishes and fishing made by fishermen and others in Minnesota. Since appar- ently half the resident population of the state are active anglers, and about 95,000 non-residents visit its fishing grounds annually, fresh-water fishing as a recreation and as a commercial enterprise is of major importance. Several chapters are therefore devoted to the conservation and management of fish, streams, lakes, and to the dynamics and ecology of an aquatic environment. The area included in this systematic survey comprises mostly Minnesota with its three great drainage systems, the Hudson Bay, the Great Lakes basin, and the Upper Mississippi River basin. Parts of Ontario, Manitoba, northern Iowa, Wisconsin, northern Illinois, North and South Dakota fall within the boundaries of the study. TiE FRESH-WATER FIsHEs OF CuNA. Natural History of Centtral Asia, Volume IX. By John Treadwell Nichols. American Museum of Natural History, New York. $9.00 (paper); $10.00</page><page sequence="11">246 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY (cloth, available after the war). 107 x 8K; xxxvi + 332 + 10 colored plates; 1943. This is the sixth volume of the proposed twelve to be published as the Natural History of Central Asia. It conforms to the high standards set by previous vol- umes. The report is based on collections made by the Central Asiatic Expeditions, and on smaller collections donated by individual collectors. Species listed in the literature as occurring in China are also included to make the review comprehensive. No attempt has been made to include marine species, or brackish- water species with marine affinities, though such may at times occur in fresh water. The area considered includes China proper, excluding such outlying terri- tories as Manchuria and Mongolia. The introduction discusses faunal relationships, and the history of the Ostariophysi which dominate the fish fauna of China. China proper appears to be a more or less unit faunal area, divisible into a southern and north-central subfauna, undoubtedly containing smaller subareas which only more extensive collecting will delimit. There is provided a list of fish whose identity can not be ascertained due to improper and incomplete original descriptions. At the end there is a supplement containing taxonomic changes and addi- tions made from the time the manuscript was originally completed in 1935 to 1938. There is an extensive bibliography, 143 text figures, and ten plates of ex- cellently rendered colored drawings. In spite of numerous delays, this important review has finally been completed to furnish a valuable survey of Chinese ichthyology.

At Johns Hopkins, Harvey Cushing not only became the brain surgeon of world fame, but, like so many others, he was "inoculated" by Osler with the love of medical history and old medical books. For forty years he studied and collected the works of Vesalius, father of modern anatomy. He prepared this bio-</page><page sequence="12">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 247 bibliography for the Four-hundredth Anniversary of the Fabrica. Cushing's death in 1939 left the book unfinished; but, under the general editorship of J. F. Fulton, the work has been completed by Arturo Castiglioni, W. W. Francis, E. C. Streeter, Mrs. John P. Peters, and Miss Madeline Stanton, and has been published on the occasion and in the year for which it was intended. The editors have done a remarkably good job. Unlike so many posthumous books, this bio-bibliography appears as a harmonious and lively whole. Harvey Cushing himself regarded M. Roth's biogra- phy, F. M. G. de Geyfer's bibliography, and Spiel- mann's iconography as the fundamental works on Vesalius. Cushing's bio-bibliography is nevertheless, especially for the English-speaking countries, a very valuable addition to these books. The bibliographical analysis of each work of Vesalius is each time preceded by an essay on those episodes of Vesalius' life which surrounded the creation'of the work under discussion. The bibliographical sections proper give detailed descriptions of all editions of every work (title in full, collation, summary of contents, commentarial notes, list of existing copies, and description of the copy used). An exhaustive bibliography of Vesaliana is added. The book will be an indispensable tool for all those who intend to work on Vesalius. By its lively and personal style it will captivate far beyond these limits all those who are interested in Vesalius or Harvey Cushing. The splendid binding, print, and illustra- tions of the book enhance its value greatly. A TEXT-BOOK OF HISTOLOGY Arranged upon an Em- bryological Basis. Sixth Edition of "Lewis and Stohr." By J. Lewis Bremer: Rewritten by Harold L. Weather- ford. The Blakiston Company, Philadelphia. $7.00. 9 x 6; ix + 723; 1944. This text actually represents the sixth edition of the original Lewis and Stohr text-book of histology. It has been re-edited and extensively rewritten by Harold L. Weatherford of Harvard University. Of the nearly six hundred illustrations, 302 are new; they are well chosen, and their reproduction is uniformly excellent. The developmental approach to histology continues to be emphasized, based upon the belief that this is essential for an understanding of structure and func- tion. In line with this, a section on placentation, written by Dr. George B. Wislocki, is included. The developmental aspect of histology is one that too often is neglected in current texts. The adult structure, although possessed of paramount interest for the student, is merely a phase, and its morphology and physiology cannot be truly understood unless this is appreciated. The book is attractively printed, well indexed, and contains a literature list of more than seven hundred titles. In its new form, it continues to be one of the outstanding histological texts, and no doubt will find wide use. THE SKULL OF SINANTHROPUS PEKINENSIS: A Com- parative Study on a Primitive Hominid Skull. Palaeon- tologia Sinica, New Series D, Number 10; Whole Series Number 127. By Franz Weidenreich. Geological Survey of China, Pehpei, Chungking: G. E. Stechert and Company, New York. $10.00. 10 x 7T; xxxviii + 229 + 23 plates; 1943. The remains Qf Sinanthropus pekinensis unearthed at Choukoutien, China, constitute perhaps the most important recent discovery of fossil man. Their study was begun by the late Davidson Black. Following his untimely death, the investigation was taken over by Franz Weidenreich, who since has published a number of papers dealing with the material. A monograph devoted to the mandible appeared in 1936, one dealing with the dentition in 1937, and another describing the skeleton of the extremities in 1941. An account of the skull, generally regarded as the piece de resistance by anthropologists, was reserved for the last. It is with this part of the material that the present monograph deals. And, one may hasten to add, there seems but little doubt that this monograph represents the most significant single contribution to the recent literature on human evolution. It is a stimulating, challenging contribution, for many of the author's arguments and conclusions are anything but orthodox. The 278 pages of text are divided into three parts: (1) An enumeration of the material (19 pages), (2) a detailed description of the material, including measure- ments (196 pages), and (3) a comparison of the skull of Sinanthropus with those of other hominids and anthropoid apes (63 pages). The material described consists of 14 skulls, none of which is complete. Five are calvaria with or with- out basal parts, 4 are represented by more than one piece, and the remaining 5 are fragments of a single bone. The general features of the sinanthropoid skull-a cranial capacity (estimated average, 1075 cc.) inter- mediate between those of Pithecanthropus (estimated at 775 cc. and 935 cc. for 2 specimens) on the one hand and Neanderthalians (estimated average, 1400 cc.) and modern man (average, ca. 1350 cc.) on the other, extraordinary thickness involving both tables and diploe, human orientation of the foramen magnum, and exceedingly prominent supraorbital ridges- already are well known. The many morpbological details, which have been studied by Weidenreich with meticulous care, cannot be discussed here.</page><page sequence="13">248 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY The following major conclusions of the author are of particular interest, and some of them no doubt will provide fuel for violent controversy: (1) There is "danger of confusing anthropological facts with geological facts. In determining the character of a given fossil form and its special place in the line of human evolution, only its morphological features should be made the basis of decision; neither the location of the site where it was recovered nor the geological nature of the layer in which it was imbedded are important" (p. 1). (This is a cardinal tenet in Weidenreich's reasoning.) (2) Sinanthropus and Pithecanthropus are the most primitive known hominids. The former, although closely related to Neanderthal types, is more primitive than any of that group. It is much closer to Pithecan- thropus, differing in only 4 of 61 main characters. (3) Eoanthropus (Piltdown man) should be erased from the list of human fossils. It is a "chimaera"-an artificial combination of a modern human calvarium with a mandible of the orang type. All recent dis- coveries show that characteristic primitive features persist much longer in the calvarium than in the mandi- ble. This is a strict correlation or "law." (4) The Swanscombe skull is not that of a primitive hominid, but is of modern human type. (5) Africanthropus njarasensis is not the African form of either Sinanthropus or Pithecanthropus. (6) Sinanthropus and Pithecanthropus are repre- sentatives of about the same evolutionary stage. Their differences are of the same kind and magnitude as modern racial differences. (Weidenreich calls the two forms by different generic names, although he regards them as belonging to one and the same species! Indeed, he doubts that there is a species difference between them and modern man. In defense of his terminology, he naively states that "I never imagined that anthropological names were tantamount to generic names or were considered as such by those familiar with the history of palaeoanthropology" (p. 246).) (7) Homo soloensis (Ngandong skulls) represents the next evolutionary step in the line leading from Pithecanthropus to modern man. It less closely resembles Sinanthropus. While the equivalent of the European Neanderthalian, it is more primitive. (8) The various Neanderthal forms-of which Rhodesian man is the most primitive-are inter- mediate between the Sinanthropus-Pithecanthropus group and modern man. (9) Human evolution was not limited to one locality but occurred over a vast area comprising possibly the whole Old World. It took place over a long period of time-from Middle Tertiary to Upper Pleistocene- and was subject to interruptions. (Thus the author explains away the fact that modern human types of skulls unquestionably antedate many neanderthaloid remains.) (10) One line of human evolution led from Pithecan- thropus to Homo soloensis to the modern Australian aborigine. A second line led from Rhodesian man- who was closely related to H. soloensis and thus to Pithecanthropus-to Florisbad man to Boskop man to the modern South African. Sinanthropus gave rise to certain Mongolians. The European Neanderthals evolved-via the Skhul group of Palestine-into Whites. (11) The limb bones of all fossil hominids are per- fectly human in character. This indicates that the adoption of erect posture far preceded the transforma- tion of the skull. (12) It is concluded that .... the organization of the human body, whether studied as a whole or in detail, is that of an anthropoid. No fact has become known which has the power to shake this statement" (p. 260). (The reviewer has read and repeatedly re- read this statement in a vain attempt to decide just what the author means.) (13) The limb bones of the anthropoid apes attained their special form and proportions at a very early period. Thus there must have been an early separa- tion of hominids and anthropoid apes proper. Facts certainly suggest that the common primitive stem split into two final branches, one forming the apes, the other the hominids. This must have occurred before Dryopithecus and related forms were differentiated, at least (apparently) in the Lower Miocene. (14) The Australopithecinae (Australopithecus, Plesianthropus, Paranthropus) seem to be closely re- lated to the gorilla stem. Weidenreich rigidly believes in the continuity of all fossil hominid forms. He will not admit the possi- bility that any represent collateral branches which became extinct without having given rise to more advanced types, although this point of view would reconcile the existing geological and anatomical evi- dence quite as well as does his polyphyletism. Many of his conclusions undoubtedly will be challenged, perhaps even demolished completely, yet his solid contribution of descriptive data remains. No other group of fossil human skulls has ever received, more thorough and more competent treatment. LABORATORY ANATOMY OF TE: CAT. By Ernest S. Booth. Illustrated by Carl Petterson.

In doing so, he produced one of the finer contributions to recent biological literature. The new, second edition has undergone extensive and thorough revision so as to include recent advances in the field. A number of topics-such as the vitamins of lower organisms, vitamins and oxidation, and the intracellular localization of enzymes-have been added. Newer technical procedures-such as electron micros- copy and tracer elements-are discussed. There are about four thousand citations of the literature, of which over half are new. This is more than a text-book, for it is so well docu- mented that it serves as a source book for the many aspects of the subject. Furthermore, the author has avoided any tendency toward dogmatism and over- simplification, but, rather, has been at pains to empha- size existing gaps and uncertainties in our knowledge. The result is a book that can be read with profit by all who term themselves biologists. THE PERMEABILITY OF NATURAL MEMBRANES. By Hugh Davson and James Frederic Danielli. With a Foreword by E. Newton Harvey. Cambridge: at the University Press; The Macmillan Conpany, New York. 25s. 8k x 58; x + 361; 1943. No subject is more fundamental to our understanding of living systems than a study of the movement and control of substances entering and leaving the indi- vidual cells. The study of permeability has been advancing very rapidly, and although the recent work has come in for much discussion and has been the topic for a number of symposia, no general books on the subject have appeared for many years. There is, therefore, a definite need for a volume such as this. In recent years the study of cell permeability has become truly quantitative, and the authors of this book place considerable emphasis upon this point. Most of the book is devoted to experimental results, with only enough discussion of theory to present them in a coherent manner. However, the chapter on "Impedence and Potential Measurements and Per- meability" contains a more complete discussion of the theory of membrane potentials, and the last chapter of the book deals exclusively with the theories of cell permeability. All of the discussions are based upon the assumption that the permeability characteristics of a given cell are determined largely or exclusively by a very thin "splasma membrane." Recent work showing the iin- portance of contact exchange and surface migration of ions in cell penetration has been omitted. Although much remains to be done in this field, these exchange phenomena serve to account for the rapid transfer of ions shown by isotope studies, and point to the partici- pation of a much thicker protoplasmic layer than the plasma membrane usually postulated. It is very unfortunate that these adVances were not fully discussed. Many of the experiments presented do not allow a clear-cut interpretation of their significance, but an effort has been made to evaluate critically both the methods employed and the results obtained. The discussions do not cover a given subject exhaustively, but are based on work selected by the authors as of primary importance. The bibliographies accom- panying each chapter are also selected and do not attempt to review completely the literature on any given subject. The book has a subject, but not an author index. On the whole, the authors have handled a difficult subject in an admirable manner. THE SOURCES or LIFE. By Serge Voronoff. Bruce Hlumphries, Boston. $3.50. 93 x 6; 236; 1943. The wide spread publicity that followed the spectacular result of Dr. Voronoff's gland grafting work made this book inevitable. Voronoff was not the first surgeon to attempt gland grafting, but he was the first to achieve any considerable success. The earlier at- tempts were mostly failures owing to the resorption of the glands. Dr. Voronoff's success was due to three discoveries made by experimentation on mammals other than man. First, such grafts can succeed only when made be- tween closely related species. In the case of man, only the glands of higher apes can be used. Second, the body which receives the graft must be prepared about 24 hours before the operation by being stimu- lated to produce new capillaries. Unless a connection can be made between the circulatory system and the gland the latter will die of malnutrition. Third,</page><page sequence="15">250 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY glands are very sensitive to changes of temperature and the implantation must be made in a location having a temperature nearly equal to that from which the gland was taken. The most striking of Dr. Voronoff's accomplish- ments is the restoration of a congenital idiot to a state of normal mentality. The "before and after" photo- graphs of the subject are most impressive. This miracle was accomplished by grafting a piece of thyroid tissue. The thyroid can be divided so that the donor suffers no impairment of mentality. However, con- genital idiocy is definitely an abnormal condition and those who exhibit this trait constitute a very small proportion of the population. On the other hand, senility is a normal condition that confronts all of those who live long enough, and the hormones which pre- vent it come from the genital glands, which cannot be divided like the thyroid, but which must be trans- planted in their entirety. Human glands therefore cannot be used, and recourse must be had to those of the higher apes. The human population of the world today greatly outnumbers that of all species of apes taken together. Consequently, if all senescent old men demanded gland grafts, the result could only be extinction of the apes, with resulting loss of hope for the future. To antici- pate such a situation Dr. Voronoff suggests the do- mestication of the apes. Domestic cattle, he quite justly observes, are more numerous than wild cattle; if we can domesticate cattle for the use of their flesh as food, why can we not domesticate the apes for surgical purposes? This is a radical idea, but Voronoff is a thorough revolutionist and does not hesitate to throw a "monkey ranch" into the established social ma- chinery. The purpose of his book is to appeal for support of this idea. It is frankly propagandistic and is addressed to the laity, not to the medical profession. Probably there is no statement in it of any fact that has not been known to the medical profession for at least one generation. In this book the author crusades on behalf of yet another cause. The opposition of humane societies to vivisection, as it has only too frequently been prac- ticed in the past, is well known. Dr. Voronoff is whole-heartedly in sympathy with the humane socie- ties in their efforts to suppress cruelty to animals and takes pride in the fact that in his laboratory all opera- tions are performed under full anesthesia, and that the convalescent ape receives the same care that would be given a human being. The gelding of stallions for commercial purposes is a different proposition, and the description of a gelding which Dr. Voronoff witnessed is enough to nauseate any right thinking person. Cer- tainly practices of this sort should be suppressed by law, the more stringent the law the better; Dr. Voronoff's protest will probably win for him the confi- dence of many potential clients who might be inclined to distrust an operator who was merely a clever surgeon and nothing more. One statement in the book is not likely to meet with universal acceptance. This is, that if grafts are per- formed on several successive generations the improve- ment will be permanent, and no further grafts will be required to maintain it. Apparently Voronoff accepts the doctrine of the inheritance of acquired charac- teristics. Two questions are likely to come to mind when gland grafting is contemplated. The first is: Is it possible for a man grafted with monkey gonads to have simian progeny? The answer is most emphatically no. The gametes are discharged through the genital ducts, and by tying the grafted duct the gametes are prevented from leaving the grafted gonads. (The hormones do not traverse the ducts, but pass directly from the glands to the capillaries.) The second is: Will gland grafting on a large scale tend to lengthen the span of life? Again the answer is no. The duration of an individual life may be increased, because the grafted individual may acquire resistance to diseases that ordinarily take a large toll of human life, but natural death from the running down of the living machinery of the human body will come at the same age in both the grafted and the ungrafted. The old man who submits to a grafting operation cannot add to the number of his days, but he will renew his strength like the eagle and preserve his youthful vitality to his deathbed, and he shall see his sons and his son's sons, even unto the fourth generation, and they shall call him "glandpa." FOOD AND PLANNING. By J. R. Marrack, with a Preface by Sir John Boyd Orr. Victor Gollancs, Ltd., London. 15s. 71 x 5; 285; 1943. THE PROBLEM OF CHANGING FooD HABITs. Buletin of the National Research Council, Number 108. A Col- lection of Twenty-four Papers. Report of the Committee on Food Habits, 1941-1943. National Research Council, Washington, D. C. 91 x 61; 177; 1943. These books are extremely timely. In days of meat shortages and ration stamps everybody is interested in food, but most of the available literature is not characterized by either clarity of expression or lucidity of thought. The present works are exceptions to this general rule. As an illustration of the meticulous care which Dr. Marrack has taken to make his book really readable, it may be pointed out that he has resolved the paradox that has baffled so many radio dietitians and arm- chair experts-why is a man's daily caloric output apparently so much greater than his intake? The</page><page sequence="16">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS -251 explanation is that the nutritional calorie, in terms of which the intake is expressed, is equal to one thousand calories of the physicist, which are used for the output. The author suggests that the resulting confusion might be obviated by the use of either term, megacalorie or kilocalorie, for the larger unit, but if the experts refuse to adopt this sensible suggestion, the least they can do is to spell it with a capital initial. The author has assembled a great deal of data about nutrition, such as the classification of food stuffs, the way in which they are utilized in metabolism, some for building body structures, others for conversion into energy, and still others for the prevention of deficiency diseases. Each one of the twenty-odd vitamins now known, with the specific condition for which each is a preventative, is described in detail. (Incidentally, the difference in meaning between vitamin and vita- mine is explained; some writers have implied that there is no difference.) The book contains page after page of tabulations of food analysis from various origins- in fact, practically all the experimental work ever done on nutrition is displayed in concise and systematic form. Different peoples are characterized by the kind of food they eat-we need think only of chow mein, chili con carne, or Yorkshire pudding to realize the validity of the slogan of a well known breakfast cereal, "Tell me what you eat and I will tell you what you are." In times of war there are of necessity fluctuations in diet with consequent changes in national health. Numerous statistics are available that deal with the public health of the leading nations on both sides in the present conflict during the twentieth century, and all of these are carefully analyzed in an unprejudiced manner. All told, this book by Marrack is the best general presentation of modern knowledge of nutrition that the reviewer has as yet come across. The book by the national research council is of a somewhat different nature. It is a symposium by fourteen different writers, all of whom write on a highly specialized phase of the subject. While Food and Planning, although obviously compiled for British perusal, is of such a generalized nature that it can be read with profit and interest by any one, The Problem of Changing Food Habits is a highly technical and micro- scopic examination of a small part of the field covered by the former work. It is intended for the specialist in public health in the United States, and is not likely to have much appeal outside this narrow circle. It is the fruit of an investigation undertaken as a national defense project, and the author of the preface implies that it is frankly propagandistic. A comparison between the two books shows very clearly the differ- ence between the British and the American mind- a difference which is all in favor of the British. There is one detail in which the British writer suc- cessfully defies the imagination of the reviewer. Among the foodstuffs analyzed for protein, fat, and carbohydrate content appear "boiled Swedes." Can it be possible that the food shortage in Britain is so acute that our cousins across the pond have been re- duced to anthropophagy? The feelings of the reviewer when this shocking item caught his eye can be appre- ciated only by the Englishman who, when travelling in the States, encountered for the first time baked Indian pudding. Rosn's FOUNDATIONS OF NUTRiTION. Fourth Edition. Revised by Grace Macleod and Clara Mae Taylor. The Afacmillan Company, New York. $3.75. 81 x 5 ; xi + 594; 1944. This book is written for those who wish to live more intelligently. An effort has been made to present within a small space some of the fundamental princi- ples of human nutrition in terms which call for no highly specialized training in those natural sciences upon which the science of nutrition rests. The selec- tion of topics and the relative amount of space devoted to each are based on the authors' wide experience in presenting the subject of nutrition to those beginners whose object is to be well informed as to the significance of food in daily life. Each essential factor in an ade- quate diet is discussed in detail, with many references to animal experiments which help to make clear the reasons why this essential factor must have a place in the daily program. The foods which serve best as sources of these essentials have been indicated, and a very practical method of comparing foods, on the basis of the amount of a given dietary essential to be ob- tained from each in relation to the total day's require- ment, is set forth. The reading references at the end of each chapter are noteworthy for their availability and clearness. Throughout the text some references to original investigations have been included as foot- notes, for the sake of those who wish to get a little more of the experimental point of view. Those familiar with the earlier editions of the book will note a considerable amount of reorganization in this one. The chapters on the vitamins, on energy, protein, water, and the minerals, and on dietary plan- ning have either been completely rewritten in the light of newer knowledge, or they have been extensively reorganized and rearranged. Several new tables have been added to the extensive list of those already in- cluded. The figures for the construction of adequate dietaries on the basis of the percentage distribution of calories among the different food groups have been brought together in tables for different age groups in the appendix. There is a complete and well-arranged general index. Here is a book that has proved itself completely ever since the first edition was published in 1927. It can be heartily recommended to dietitian,</page><page sequence="17">252 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY nurse, clinician, and layman alike, and should enjoy a wide circulation among all those wishing to be well- informed on this all-important subject. NumTON IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. Ninth Edition, Revised. By Lenna F. Cooper, Edith M. Barber and Helen S. Mitchell. J. B. Lippincott Company, Philadelphia and London. $3.50. 8 x 53; xiv + 716; 1943. Long association with medical institutions has led the authors to believe that the present status of the subject of dietetics demands a somewhat different emphasis from that formerly placed upon it. The continuing success of this textbook has demonstrated the correct- ness of the authors' convictions. Here is a single volume which may serve as a handbook on the sub- jects of nutrition and diet in disease, two subjects so intimately and vitally connected as to necessitate their being inseparably united in the mind of the nurse, for whom this text is primarily intended. The book pre- sents the newer ideas in both the principles of nutrition and the practice of dietetics, based upon the most recent experimentation and study as well as upon the established knowledge of earlier research findings. It includes the prevailing practices of leading physicians in the field of nutrition as applied to health and dis- ease. Wherever physicians differ greatly in their dietary practices, the authors have endeavored to present the consensus of opinion, where such exists, or the prevailing regimens, with the scientific principles involved. Throughout the book the preventive and remedial aspects of nutrition have been emphasized. Not only the needs of the bedside nurse have been kept in mind, but also the problems of the public health nurse, who must cope with poverty, racial preferences, and established food habits as complicat- ing factors. The present edition, like the two previous ones, is arranged to conform closely to A Curricudum Guide for Schools of Nursing, published by the National League of Nursing Education. The contents of the book are arranged to cover several nursing courses. There are seven principal divisions, as follows: principles of nutrition, diet in disease, feeding of mother and child, nutrition and health service, food selection and cookery, cooking for the sick and the convalescent, and tabular material and special tests. The excellent and well-chosen illustrations, including a number of color plates, are a very distinct feature of the text and of genuine value to the student or lay reader. The chapter on "Food and Nutrition Problems in Wartime" is especially timely and helpful. A new feature of the ninth edition is the glossary which gives a concise definition of the technical words appearing in the text and their pronunciation. There is also a list of reference books and scientific journals and a complete index. Nurses, teachers of nurses, dietitians, homemakers, and all those whose responsibilities include planning meals and buying and preparing food will profit by the use of this fine text. APPLIED DIETETICS. The Planning and Teaching of Normal and Therapeutic Diets. Second Edtion. By Frances Stern. The Williams and Wilkins Com- pany, Baltimore. $4.00. 10 x 6-; xx + 265; 1943. The material presented herein is based on methods developed and constantly refined in the Food Clinic of the Boston Dispensary, the pioneer clinic of its kind, organized 26 years ago. This second edition has been enlarged and improved to meet changing needs, and in order to include the results of the accelerated research in nutrition and their applications to modern dietetics. Normal diet is considered in relation to normal physiol- ogy, whereas the therapeutic diet is conceived as a deviation from the normal, calling for an increase or decrease in the amount of a food constituent, or the omission or change in consistency of foods as used in the normal diet. The bulk of the information is pre- sented in tabular form. There are 57 coordinated tables to simplify the computation of the diet, serving for reference and interpretation, much as do the tables on which an engineer relies. Typical menus and diets are set down in detail in 20 pairs of full page tables. Tabular summaries provide quick surveys over the material dealt with in various sections of the book. Dietary outlines, concise and complete, greatly aid and simplify the dietary treatment of such conditions and diseases as food allergy, constipation, peptic ulcer, obesity, diabetes, liver disorders, nephritis, and the vitamin deficiencies. This book is somewhat unique because it tends to promote a closer interdependence of physician, dietitian, social worker, nurse, and public health worker, and because the methods described for planning and teaching make it unnecessary to memorize formulas. The author's presentation em- phasizes the relation of personality to food: environ- mental factors that influence the effectiveness of the diet, food preferences of different nationalities, and education of the patient on the normal and thera- peutic diet. This excellent book is highly recommended for teachers of dietetics, and will be a most useful refer- ence book for physicians, hospital and clinic dietitians, public health workers, nurses, and all others who have a special interest in this field. NUTRITiON OF T DOG. By Clie M. McCay. Comstock Publiszing Com- pany, Ithaca. $1.50. 9 x 5i; v + 140; 1943. This book will find favor not only with the pet owne</page><page sequence="18">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 253 but also with the kennel breeder, the veterinary, and the research worker on nutrition. In a simple yet thoroughly authoritative manner, the writer explains the carbohydrate, fat, protein, and mineral require- ments of the dog. 'The topic of vitamins is well pre- sented; many dog owners will be surprised to learn that these animals do not need vitamin C, since it is apparently synthesized within the dog's body. The subject of dog feed is discussed in great detail and con- tains much useful information, for the writer is a con- sultant in the preparation of dog foods. All the data offered are based on personal research or on informa- tion culled from the literature; in the latter case, cita- tions are given for those desiring further information. The role dogs have historically played in research on human nutrition is described in the introduction and interspersed throughout the text. This valuable contribution, at so reasonable a price, should induce every dogowner to own it. CIvILIZATION AND DsEASE. By Henry E. Sigerist. Cornell University Press, Ithaca. $3.75. 9 x 6; xi + 255; 1943. Dr. Sigerist's new book is based on a series of six Messenger lectures delivered at Cornell University in November and December, 1940. In these Dr. Sigerist examines the impact of every single element of civiliza- tion on disease, from the most elementary and humble, such as food, clothing, housing, and occupation, to the most noble and complex, such as music, religion, science, and philosophy. On the other hand, he shows the formative influence of disease on civilization, its history, its laws, its art, its literature. He illustrates from his encyclopedic knowledge of history how civiliza- tion deals with disease and fights disease. The tre- mendous advance of civilization in this struggle, during a relatively short period, inspires Dr. Sigerist with an unlimited faith in future progress. As can be seen from this short resume, the book covers an extremely large field. Each of the twelve chapters could easily have been the subject of a whole volume. It is therefore very difficult to argue what else should have been mentioned, and it is rather sur- prising and a sign of a judicious choice of materials that the reader actually almost never has any feeling of omission. Nevertheless, the reviewer feels that Balzac rather than Victor Hugo, Flaubert, or the Goncourts should be regarded as the true father of the "scientific" novel; and that the fact that Flaubert and Proust were the sons of outstanding clinicians is significant enough in this context to be mentioned. The reviewer does not agree with the author's wholesale condemnation of the romantic medical school, which left some important clues and some astonishing "pre- monitions" to posterity. Some of the problems of the book have already been touched upon by Dr. Sigerist in earlier publications, but the bulk of the book consists of highly interesting, new and original material. Although erected on the same philosophical foundations as the author's earlier books and using historical analysis always in close connection with our present and future, Civilization and Disease seems less liable to provoke controversy. Although a very learned and thoughtful treatise, the book is by no means written only for the specialist, but is popular in the best sense of the word and easily intelligible to the educated layman, not only because of its fascinating subject but also because of its ex- cellent craftsmanship. It still retains the lively and personal diction of the original lectures. A wealth of characteristic, carefully chosen illustrations enhance its value. HUMAN CONSTITUTION IN CIJMCAL MEDICINE. By George Draper, C. W. Dupertuis and J. L. Caughey, Jr. Paul B. Hoeber, Inc., New York. $4.00. 9j x 6; xi + 273; 1944. "The purpose of this book is to discuss with medical students the fact that there is an essential relationship between each individual person and the disease which at any moment he or she may suffer. It is therefore primarily an essay concerned with clinical medicine, yet one which deals especiaLly with the nature of the man within the patient." Toward this end the authors have utilized morphological, psychological, immuno- logical, and physiological characters to elucidate the constitutional factors in disease. Their theory of constitution in relation to disease originated from observations made during an epidemic of infantile paralysis in 1916 when it was discovered that children susceptible to paralysis showed some consistent differences in constitution from children who had not succumbed to the trouble. fllness is best studied from the standpoint of (1) the human subject, (2) the disease process, and (3) the specific environmental stress. The constitutional studies are an illumination of this first item. There are chapters on history-taking, which stress the im- portance of spontaneity in method rather than devotion to question and answer methods; on genetics and clinical medicine, with excellent studies showing the hereditary factor in disease; on growth, development, decline, and death; on the mosaic of androgyny; on problems of observation, correlation, and interpreta- tion; on anthropometry; on somatotypes; and on constitutional physiology and the clinical use of con- stitutional studies. In this last named chapter the authors illustrate the clinical application of constitu- tional studies, including personality factors, in polio- myelitis, diabetes, and peptic ulcer. There are two final chapters considering the unity of the organism and embodying conclusions concerning the entire</page><page sequence="19">254 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY problem. The authors state that "There is no final formula, however, which can be generally applied in this matter of understanding the man within the patient. We believe that certain technical methods can be efficiently brought to the hard problem of appraising the nature of a human being. Certain of these procedures have been set down in the foregoing pages. They have dealt with morphology, physiology, immunity and emotion.... The final technique of the initial approach to the patient must be wrought from special qualities within the personality of the doctor, and through his cultivated talents. The common source from which each physician must draw his raw materials is mankind itself." There is an extensive bibliography. The book is well written and presents an excellent statement of the modern viewpoint of constitution in relation to clinical medicine. ON THE INFLUENCE OF TRADES, PROFESSIONS, AND OCCUPATIONS IN TEE UNITED STATES, IN THE PRO- DUCTION OF DISEASE. Reprinted from Transactions of the Medical Society of the State of New York. Vol. III, Albany, 1837. By Benjamin W. McCready, M.D. 1837. With an Introductory Essay by Genevieve Miller. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore. $1.75. 7 2 x 52; 129; 1943. This little book is Volume IV in the Fourth Series: Bibliotheca Medica Americana, representing the publications of the Institute of the History of Medicine of the Johns Hopkins University. For those who are interested in or are engaged in industrial hygiene, medicine, and health work, this book represents one of the most important volumes in the history of the development of industrial and occu- pational medicine in this country. The original material was written as an essay in a contest sponsored by the Medical Society of the State of New York in 1835. Dr. McCready wrote the book at the age of 23, only two years after he had been graduated from the College of Physicians and Surgeons, having meanwhile served a term as house physician at the New York Hospital. The author was considerably influenced by a book published in England in 1831 by Dr. C. Turner Thackrah, which was the second all-inclusive mono- graph on occupational diseases, following Ramazzini's immortal work in 1700. Included as chapter headings in the McCready book are those with reference to agriculture, laborers, housing, seamen, factory opera- tives, artisans, professional men, literary men, and the general causes of poor health. This essay represents a remarkably mature and realistic approach to the problem of occupational diseases as it was in the early 19th century in America. Particularly- foresighted was the author with respect to health education for the masses, the principles of which are not even yet extensively and generally applied in industrial groups. References are given as footnotes. There is no index. The book deserves the attention and should provoke the reflection of industrial physicians, physiological hygienists, and all others who would understand the economic and social background of American industry. MEDICINE AND THE WAR. Edited by William H. Taliaferro. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago. $2.00. 8 x 5'; vii + 193; 1943. In few fields of man's endeavor so much as in that of medicine does war so evidently leave behind it some things of worth in exchange for the supreme values it steals from civilization. Need, patriotism, skill, and humane desire join with the abundance of sick and wounded men in days of armed strife to bring progress in medical science and practice. Fewer men, in pro- portion to the numbers engaged in fighting, are dying from wounds in this war than in World War I or in any previous war in recorded history. Every day medical miracles take place on battle fronts, in isolated jungle camps, in every spot in the world where armed forces are located. The new sulfa drugs and the modem treatment of shock have been of major importance in the saving of lives. As a result of modern psycho- therapy, it is estimated that 70-80 per cent of the battle-zone casualties due to psychiatric disorders can be returned to duty. These are only a few of the astounding strides that medicine is making in this war. This little volume describes in nontechnical language some of the important work that is being done today in connection with the medical care of the armed forces. After a brief review of the history of war medicine, the topics dealt with include: food, the basic fuel for the human part of the war machine; chemotherapy, the wonder science of modern medicine; malaria, the most important infectious disease in the present conflict; the dissemination of diseases and disease-carrying in- sects by modern rapid transportation; aviation medi- cine; brain injuries; psychiatric disorders; surgical shock, which is the common danger in all types of severe wounds and makes the establishment of blood banks so urgent; and chemical warfare. In addition, some unsolved problems are mentioned and by their nature indicate why research is assuming such an important position in this war. The authors are al members of the faculty of the Division of the Bio- logical Sciences of the University of Chicago. Bibliog- raphies are given at the ends of most of the chapters and there is a good index provided. This book can be highly and heartily recommended to all those, scien- tists and laymen alike, who wish to know more about the increasingly important and amazing role that the</page><page sequence="20">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 255 art and science of medicine has assumed in modern warfare. ARE You ALLERGIC? By Jessamine Hilliard and Charles C. Coghlan. M. Barrows and Company, Inc., New York. $2.50. 77 x 53; vi + 248; 1943. The material herein included is rather timely for everyone. Most people are allergy-conscious and while this volume is not intended as an outline for the treatment of allergy, enough knowledge can be ob- tained from it to enable many people to detect their sensitivity by a process of trial and error. It will help the reader understand his own strange sneezing, his skin "infections," the hay fever, hives, watery eyes, restlessness, and more serious ills which beset him and which may be caused by the bed on which he sleeps, the food he eats, the place in which he works, the clothes he wears, his wife's hair combings, his pet dog or cat or canary. The authors have presented in an interesting, readable style hundreds of examples of allergy. They include men and women in the higher income levels, with seemingly every advantage which money and the best of medical care can provide; they embrace workers in factories and mills, in the field and the home; they extend to the allergies of children, from the youngest baby to school and teen-age youngsters. These allergies are described in detail so that the average person may recognize the sufferings of scme member of his family or of friends, and know them at least for what they really are. While the authors have kept this book free of heavy medical terminology, so that practically every- one can read and understand it and be helped, yet by its thoroughness in covering the scope of the entire field of allergy, it constitutes a valuable resum6 for physicians, nurses and other specialists. Included is much material on the research methods of the past and present. Incidentally, the physician or public health worker who has not specialized in allergy and who is only beginning to apply new findings regarding it will find this book especially helpful. An extensive bib- liography and an index are appended to the volume. Lay reader and scientist alike should find much of interest, and value in this well-written book. HEALTI AND HYGIENE. A Comprehensive Study of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. By Lloyd Ackerman. Jaques Cattell Press, Lancaster. $5.00. 9- x 6'; xii + 895; 1943. To a population battered incessantly by the drug concerns advertising patent medicines for achieving health, this latest in the series of "Humanizing Science Books" should have an instant appeal. And to college hygiene teachers, as well as to the freshmen who take their courses, an up-to-date book which copes with the basic problems of the field, however controversial, in a comprehensive and objective way, should mean a new stimulus to the whole subject of personal health and social responsibilities in health. The author "has attempted to provide a book that will appeal to mature, inquiring minds in all circles: nonscholastic as well as scholastic, lay as well as professional, and legal, political, engineering, social service, journalistic, pedagogical, and religious as well as medical." In the opinion of this reviewer, he has been remarkably successful in this attempt. In the preliminary discussion of the hygienic con- cept, the author recognizes that it embraces both personal endeavor and organized effort on the part of society. This boqk is mainly concerned with personal hygiene, and although some discussion is given to professional health services, social (not to be confused with socialized) medicine, with its modern views of regional health centers and so on, is not part of the subject matter of the book. The book is divided into ten main parts, with several chapters in each. The main subjects include: Intro- duction (which discusses fundamental concepts and a statistical survey of the health problem); Evolution of Health Concepts and Health Practices; Evaluation and Importance of Health Concepts and Practices; Parasitism and Hypersensitiveness; Hygiene of the Mouth; Hygiene of Nutrition; Hygiene of the Emotions and the Intellect; the Hygiene of Mating; Exogenous Poisons; and Physical Agents and Their Relations to Health. These subjects are developed from the point of view of the basic knowledge with regard to them. The evidence on the many controversial issues is pre- sented, but the discussion is always distinguished by objective evaluation and freedom from dogma and emotionalism. A bibliography accompanies every chapter. In order to give some idea of the breadth of view with which the subject matter is presented, it may be well to give a brief discussion of one section. The third part, on the evaluation of health concepts, opens with a discussion of the complexity of evaluation in this field, first, because of the adaptability of man, and the difficulty of knowing what would have happened in the absence of the hygienic or therapeutic aid to be evaluated, and second, because of the influence of the psychology of the investigator. There follows a discussion of the importance of controlled experi- ments and the pitfalls one may encounter in getting a control and in interpreting the results. This is fol- lowed by a discussion of the contribution of demo- graphic studies to our knowledge of health practices, so that the epidemiological approach to health studies is introduced. Thus the student is presented with a bird's-eye view of the sources of knowledge and scien- tific methods, and with cautions concerning critical</page><page sequence="21">256 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY evaluation of the evidence. In the sections on specific problems of hygiene, the type of sound judgment advocated in this part is characteristically used by the author in evaluating the evidence presented. The book will perform a real service for any adult wanting to learn the historical background of our health practices, the present status of our knowledge, and the physiological and psychological factors im- portant in achieving positive health. THE FUNDAMENTALS OF PERSONAL HYGIENE Including Their Practical Application to Healthful Living. Fourth Edition, Revised. By Walter W. Krueger. W. B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia and London. $1.75. 73 x 5X; xi + 315; 1944. This text, intended for high-school levels, provides the fundamentals of hygiene for a healthy and wholesome life. Proper nutrition, the significance of over- and underweight, the value of exercise and posture, care of the feet and skin, correct clothing, the effects of mental attitudes, recreation, sex, and preventive measures against disease are some of the topics intelli- gently discussed. Quacks, patent medicines, harmful drugs, and false advertising claims are properly evalu- ated and their dangers and weaknesses pointed out. Following each chapter is a series of questions for oral discussion and topics for written reports, as well as a selected bibliography. The volume is illustrated with numerous charts, diagrams, and photographs. Some of the latter are conspicuously carry-overs from previous editions and tend to give the impression that the text may also be somewhat out of date. This is the more unfortunate, as the text has been completely revised and brought into line with the latest facts and findings of medicine and physiology. CLINICAL TROPICAL MEDICINE. Edited by Taylor Bercovitz, with a Foreword by Wilbur A. Sawyer. Paul B. Hoeber, Inc., New York and London. $14.00. 10 x 7; xvii + 957; 1944. Quoting from the foreword of Dr. Wilbur A. Sawyer, "The rank and file of American physicians and medical students have until now felt no urge to familiarize themselves with exotic and tropical diseases and have had little encouragement or opportunity to do so. War has suddenly brought a departure from this medical isolationism. There is now a pressing demand for authoritative and practical instruction in the treat- ment and prevention of the diseases of the warm countries. Medical men who have seldom seen malaria or dysentery and have never encountered yellow fever or typhus are now facing the prospect of caring for troops and civilian workers in the tropics of America. Africa. and the Far Eant." In this large volume, Dr. Bercovitz has attempted to assemble for the medical man the information necessary to cope with his new problems resulting from the present world conflict. He has included all types of tropical diseases; those produced by infectious agents (viruses, rickettsiae, spirochetes, bacteria, protozoa, and worms), by poor nutrition, by heat, or by poisonous snakes and insects. Due to the many fields concerned with tropical medicine, the author has solicited the aid of a distinguished advisory board composed of Dr. W. W. Cort, Col. Charles F. Craig, and Col. Edward B. Vedder. In addition to this assistance, twenty-six outstanding authorities contributed to the volume by writing chapters on their specialized fields. Of the seventy-three chapters, seventeen were written by Dr. Bercovitz and the re- mainder by the other contributors. Although major emphasis is placed on the clinical phases of the diseases, information on epidemiology, prevention, and laboratory diagnosis is also amply presented. If the reader is familiar with the subject of a particular chapter, he may find that some of the, more recent details have not been included. These omissions can perhaps be explained by the following statement from the author's preface: "This volume has been planned to give the medical student a definite picture of tropical diseases, their symptomatology, pathology, and the most authentic and effective thera- peutic and preventive measures, before he plunges into specialized monographs and controversial articles on the manifold aspects of tropical medicine." The text material is well illustrated with numerous plates and figures. Here again the author has followed a wise policy of presenting the typical rather than those rare manifestations of the diseases which too often grossly exaggerate the importance of a particular condition. At the end of each chapter, a list of references is presented; and at the end of the book there is a complete index. THE JOHNS HOPKINS HOSPITAL AND THE JOHNS Hop- KINS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. A Chronicle. Volume 1. Early Years, 1867-1893. By Alan Af. Chesney, with a Foreword by William H. Howell. The Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore. $3.00. 91 x 6; xviii + 318; 1943. The first volume of Dean Chesney's history of the Johns Hopkins Hospital and Medical School was a most timely gift for the School's Fiftieth Anniversary. This first volume takes us from the incorporation of the hospital in 1867 up to the opening of the school in 1893. We become acquainted with the founder, the trustees of the hospital, many of them members of the Society of Friends like Johns Hopkins himself, and with the first president of the Board of Trustees, Francis T. King, whose great merits are for the first time emphasized by Dr. Chesney. We observe the</page><page sequence="22">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 257 important role of J. S. Billings and D. C. Gilman in the making of the hospital. We are informed of the financial difficulties, which protracted over such a long period the building of the hospital and the opening of the school. We see the beginnings of teaching by the physiologist H. N. Martin, who himself died too early to participate in more than the "prehistory" of the school. We learn that the trustees were in favor of the full-time system already in 1884, and that the resident system originated in the hospital. Shortly before and with the opening of the hospital in 1889, the "big four," Osler, Halsted, Kelly, and Welch enter the scene-soon to be surrounded by men like H. M. Hurd, W. S. Thayer, J. WV. Williams, G. H. F. Nuttall, J. Hewetson, and later F. P. Mall, J. J. Abel, WV. H. Howell, and all those other men who were destined to leave their mark upon American medicine, too numer- ous even to be listed here but all characterized by Dr. Chesney. The episode of the "XVomen's Fund Com- mittee" and the gift of Miss M. E. Garrett which eventually made possible the opening of the medical school, is given in detail and illustrated by many documents. There is something extremely charming and fascinating in these early years of the hospital and of the preparation of the medical school where a group of young enthusiasts, most of them still in their thirties, set out to build a new medical world in the "New World." The story shows that the history of hospital and medical school are so closely interwoven that indeed they hardly could have been treated separately. The form of a chronicle chosen by the author seems to be best adapted to events which are still rather close to the present. Nobody could be better prepared to write such a chronicle than Dean Chesney, who has at his disposal not only the long and rich personal experience of a life-long connection with Hopkins, but ex officio documents otherwise perhaps inaccessible or likely to be overlooked. The reader will greatly appre- ciate not only the first-hand publication of such docu- ments, but also that all the essential facts, until now so widely dispersed in biographies, autobiographies, articles, and other publications, have been eventually concentrated and synthesized by the author. The book will be most welcome to all who are interested in the history of American medicine and American education. THE HARVEY CUSHING COLLECTION OF BooKs AND MANUSCRIPTS. Issued under the Auspices of the Historical Library, Yale Medical Library. Schuman's, New York. $8.50. 11 x 7 ; xvi + 205; 1943. The Harvey Cushing Collection is one of the pillars of that great treasury of old medical books, the His- torical Library of the Yale Medical Library. The publication of a short title catalogue of Harvey Cush- ing's books, compiled by the late H. H. Schaltenbrand, Miss M. Brinton, and Mrs. H. T. Perkins is therefore most welcome to all working or interested in medical history and the history of science. The most impor- tant and most complete parts of Cushing's library were those on early anatomy (Vesalius) and surgery. But as the catalogue shows, it also contained a surprising num- ber of valuable books, especially of the 17th and 18th century, covering other fields of medicine and science. Whether the inclusion in the catalogue of twentieth century books and especially of reprints, accumulated in a rather haphazard way, was particularly useful or necessary, may be doubted. PAPERS OF A PIONEER. By Sir Pendrill Varrier-Jones. Collected by Peter Fraser. Preface by Lord Hlorder and Introduction by Sir Humphry Davy Rolleston. Iutchinson' and Company, Ltd., London and New York. 6s. 71 x 4j; 107; 1943. In this little book Mr. Peter Frazer, for long years the collaborator of Sir Pendrill Varrier Jones, has collected and arranged the most significant utterances of the late, great English sanitarian. Sir Pendrill not only clearly saw that tuberculosis is a sociological and economic as well as a medical and psychological prob- lem; but in founding Papworth, a village-settlement for the "after-cure" of tuberculosis he set a milestone in tuberculosis treatment, admired and imitated all over the world. The selections, taken from papers published between 1915 and 1941, make very good reading and can be highly recommended to everyone interested in tuberculosis or public health. THE JEWS AND MEDICINE: Essays. In Two Volumes. By Harry Friedenwald. The Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore. $7.50. 91 x 6*; Vol. I, xxiv + 390; Vol. II, vii + 391-817; 1944. In these essays Dr. Harry Friedenwald, professor emeritus of ophthalmology at the University of Mary- land, himself member of a Jewish medical "dynasty" and a famous book collector (more about the back- ground of the author is told us in Dr. Sigerist's sub- stantial preface) gives us the fruit of almost fifty years of historical research. The relations of the Jews to medicine offer indeed material enough for more than one life-span of study. Medicine being during centu- ries one of the few creative activities open to Jews, they have amply used this opportunity and have been faithful to a great tradition in spite of all difficulties up to this day. Although dealing occasionally with all aspects of the problem, Dr. Friedenwald has wisely concentrated his efforts mainly on two periods of Jewish medical history less known and perhaps more interesting than</page><page sequence="23">258 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY others: The Middle Ages and the Renaissance. While Mosaic medicine has somewhat the character of a tribal medicine, and while with the great Jewish Doctors of the 19th century the fact of their being Jews appears rather unspecifc and incidental, the Jewish doctors of the Middle Ages and Renaissance form an important part of Western medical history and are at the same time still a living part of Jewish religious and literary tradition. Together with the Arabs, as their coworkers, their translators into Latin, Spanish and other European tongues, spreading Hebrew translations of Arab works wherever Jewish doctors practice, the Jews truly enter the great western medical tradition which reaches down from Hip- pocrates to our days. Dr. Friedenwald has attacked his problem from all sides and in every possible form: giving biographical sketches from Maimonides to Zacutus Lusitanus, Amatus Lusitanus, Garcia da Orta and Jean Astruc, writing extensive chronicles of the Jewish physicians in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Southern France, and after their expulsion from these countries at the end of the fifteenth century. Dr. Friedenwald has made cross sections: showing these Jewish physicians as book lovers, apologists, satirists, ophthalmologists, at the universities; in East India; showing their attitude towards witchcraft. He has composed interesting bibliographies, analysed their case histories, etc. One may regret some errors of detail, such as a repetition of the Juan Lopez de Vega legend, who did not bring the cinchona bark to Europe because he never returned from Peru, and one may judge the bibliography of diseases of the Jews too sketchy, but the fundamental fact is that throughout his book the author has maintained the highest standards of scholar- ship, a fact unfortunately not general in medico- historical writing. In spite of the incredible sufferings which this book is obliged to report, it never becomes cheaply melodramatic. The history of the medical theory and practice of the Jewish physicians is an important illustration of the medicine of their time in general. The varying ways in which society treated them illustrates the ups and downs of progressive thought in society during the last one thousand years. Dr. Friedenwald's book is a most valuable contribution to the history of medicine and civilization. PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR PxINcipLEs OF BEHAviOR: An Introduction to Be- havior Thry. By Clark L. Hull. D. Appleton-Century Company, New York and London. $4.00. 8- x 5-; vii + 422; 1943. Every serious student of psychology will want to read Professor Hull's new book, if only to bring himself up to date on the complexities of Hullian system making. For many years now, it has been nearly impossible for critics to grasp with any firmness the intricacies of Hull's theories, since the assumptions and the evidence basic to certain conclusions were often widely scattered and occasionally available only in a narrowly circulated mimeographed form. Now there should be little excuse for any psychologist to throw up his hands in despair, as so many have done in the past, when Hull's theories are mentioned, for the author has written a painstaking exposition of the development of his system and has, for the most part, succeeded in making it abundantly clear. Whether the reader will be satisfied with the result will depend on his individual interests and critical standards. Hull has started out with a discussion of the nature of theorizing in psychology and has pro- ceeded to show that his method is logically a sound one. Many readers who were skeptical about what Hull has been attempting will now be convinced that his aim is lofty and that his premises are unassailable. This part of the book is particularly valuable to the general reader. As Hull proceeds to unfold the theory itself, a num- ber of objections will occur to many readers. The author, for example, has tried valiantly to wash his hands of traditional stimulus-response connectionism. There has been too much experimental evidence tend- ing to refute such notions for Hull to avoid paying lip-service to "molar phenomena." But it is only lip- service, and Hull must still be criticized for trying to get along with outmoded scientific constructs. The key to Hull's confusion is to be found on page 27, where he discusses the value of considering the prob- lems of behavior dynamics that must be solved in the design of a truly self-maintaining robot. Despite its intellectual challenge, this is a scientifically stultifying exercise. Hull's purpose is to avoid "anthropomorphic subjectivism," and such avoidance is surely praise- worthy, but the attempt to explain rat behavior in terms of the psychologist's knowledge of machines is at least as fallacious as any explanation in terms of human behavior-and for the same logical reasons. In some ways, the danger is greater, for unless the theorist is exceedingly well versed in the most ad- vanced branches of physics, chemistry, and biology, he tends to construct his robot in terms of primitive push-pull mechanisms. The seductive lure of such thinking has hounded psychological theory since Descartes, and Hull seems unable to avoid it even when he disclaims "molecular" explanations. Thus, on pages 68 and 69, Hull writes: "Just as the inherited equipment of reaction tendencies consists of receptor- effector connections, so the process of learning consists in the strengthening of certain of these connections as contrapted with others, or in the setting up of quite new connections." In one sentence, the author has begged the whole question of learning theory! Tolman, KIhler, and all the others who have inveighed against</page><page sequence="24">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 259 connectionism for good and sufficient experimental reasons are thrown a sop in the early pages and then forgotten. On page 95, Hull has written: "It follows from the conditions of compound selective learning assumed above that the organism by sheer trial-and-error will work blindly down through the series until ... etc." Has all the evidence concerning the importance of perceptual factors in learning been lost on Hull? That evidence cannot be detailed here, but improvements in rate of learning which result from using elevated mazes, Lashley jumping stands, or 'obtrusive' cues in puzzle boxes have long since convinced many psychologists that the animal cannot be said to work "blindly." The reader can only conclude that, despite his pro- testations to the contrary, the author is an incorrigible connectionist whose predilection for robots leads him to ignore all the evidence which is really difficult to fit into his preconceptions of the nature of animal behavior. Hull's publishers claim that this book presents the "first genuine theory of primary motivation." Many readers will feel that Hull has not even raised the questions that are fundamental to an understanding of motivation. The fact is that motivation, for Hull, is nothing but a pattern of stimuli, and eidence which contradicts such an assumption is ignored. The experiments of Wiesner and Sheard, to take but one example, are not even mentioned. The criticisms presented here are culled almost at random from a list that is much too long for a short review. Hull has compiled a theory that is difficult to assess seriously because it exists in an experimental vacuum. The past thirty years have provided us with a mass of data which apparently conflicts with Hull's basic position. If it can be interpreted to fit S-R theory, we should be shown how. The reader of Hull's book might never know these data exist. It is necessary to point out, however, that this is an important book: first, because it now offers in one place the body of an influential theory that has not previously been available as a unit; and second, because it is an exceedingly capable piece of exposition. Hull has written a stimulating argument, well-knit, clear, and stylistically pleasing. It is marred by a minimum of errors in proof-reading (though there is one serious one on page 154), and is in general a well-made book. The reviewer hopes that it will be carefully and critically read so that its influence on the graduate students of the next few years may be the more effectively combatted. MAN AND His WoRKs. Edward Lee Thorndike. Harvard University Press, Cambridge. $2.50. 7- x 5j; 212; 1943. This little book comprises the William James Lectures that were delivered at Harvard University. The lectures, like Thorndike's research interests, are diverse, and yet they have been moulded into a mean- ingful series leading up to a general view of the relation of psychology to society. The subject matter of the individual lectures will not be new to those who are familiar with the main currents of Thorndike's work. It is a matter of some regret, though certainly not of surprise, that Professor Thorndike describes the process of learning in the same terms of glowing simplicity that he has used for many years. His discussion of the development of language is equally familiar and equally subject to the criticisms which greeted it when it was newer. The lectures on measuring attitudes, on the 'goodness' of cities, etc., are similarly unaffected by theoretical controversy. Thorndike has been content to present to his new audience a mass of old material in a new and charming dress. Few readers will fail to enjoy this discussion of how men acquire their social traits and how social relation- ships may be measured and bettered. If it is not new, it at least contains much that was new not so long ago and it is quite enough to demonstrate Thorndike's fertility and originality. As a sort of summary chapter to many years of valuable work, it is at once a milestone and a monument. It should be read with profit by psychologists and laymen alike. THE INTERPRETATION OF DREAMS. New Developments and Technique. In Two Volumes. By William Stekel. Authorized translation by Eden and Cedar Paul. Arranged for American publica- tion by Emil A. Gutheil. Liveright Publishing Com- pany, New York. $10.00. 81 x 51; Volume I, xi + 308; Volume II, v + 311-618; 1943. This volume, the latest to appear of Dr. Stekel's monumental work on "Disorders of the Instincts and Emotions," is an able presentation of the author's theories, dealing with their practical application in dream interpretation. While accepting the Freudian dogma that dreams constitute the royal road to an understanding of neuroses, which Stekel calls parapathy, it discards the strictly Freudian passive method of free associations and has developed a method of active interpretation of dreams. Stekel asserts that it is unfair to allow patients to wander about in passive free association to dream material, that it is the business of the physician to offer an interpretation of life problems to which the passive associations certainly point. The patient "has come to us because he has a scotoma ... our business is to discover the scotoma and to cure it." From this it is clear that Stekel's method diverges sharply from the strictly Freudian method in the injection of the physician into the situation. Stekel claims the discovery of the</page><page sequence="25">260 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY symbolism of religion and the personification of parapathy. He gives numerous instances of both of these discoveries, and indicates how the patient clings to his parapathy and at every turn tries to defeat its cure by the analyst. Long continued analysis of dreams is often nothing more than the patient's suc- cessful evasion of efforts at cure on the part of the physician, and this process can be halted abruptly by calling the patient's attention to the fact or by refusing further analysis. The dreams of patients are very much influenced by the attitude and the particular interests of the analyst, and the very first dreams in an analysis are therefore the most important, since they are as yet uninfluenced by the analyst's personality and more clearly portray the structure of the neurosis. In the chapter on the religious symbolism of dreams Stekel shows that religious feelings are the source of important conflicts in the lives of patients and that not all dreams are reducible to terms of Freudian psychosexuality. There are chapters on the representation of para- pathic symptoms, individual dream symbols, and symbols of the mind. A chapter on the progress of dream interpretation is especially important because it contrasts the "material interpretation," in which the dream material is reduced to Freudian sexual terms, with "the functional interpretation," in which the dream material is reduced to a symbolic repre- sentation of the neurosis and its interference with normal functioning. The analysis of dream series completes Volume I. Volume II is devoted to the patient's relation to analysis as expressed in his dreams, to dreams and intuition, to the analysis of a case of dyspareunia, to the dreams of a homosexual man, and includes a final chapter on the technique of dream interpretation. Stekel lays great emphasis on the manifest dream content, insisting that from this material alone it is possible to get an adequate functional interpretation of parapathy. Critics have claimed that his method is intuitive and not teachable. The purpose of the book is to show that the method is teachable, and to a considerable extent this reviewer would say that he has fulfilled his objective. It may be only a dearth of experience and a lack of the proper kind of imagination on the reviewer's part that make it impossible for him to follow easily several instances of dream inter- pretation. This text, like other volumes on dream analysis, serves to emphasize the important contribution of psychoanalysis to the incorporation of dreams into the continuum of mental functioning. I have no doubt that the author has had notable success in handling dream material by his method. There is no doubt either of the success attendant on Freudian methods-all of which goes to show that the influence of the analyst on the patient is the essential curative element. Whether this is to be accomplished by active or passive means must surely depend upon the patient and the analyst. The translation is excellently done, and the volumes are pleasantly readable. They should be in the hands of all serious practising psychiatrists. PsYcnosoMATic DIAGNOSIS. By Flanders Dunbar. With a Foreword by Leonard G. Rowniree. Paul B. Hoeber, Inc., New York. $7.50. 9i x 6k; xix + 741; 1943. In this book Dr. Dunbar has brought together the results of a number of years of research and practice in the field of psychosomatic medicine, a term which she herself coined, if I am not mistaken. The book is divided into parts dealing with psychosomatic history- taking, special techniques and examinations, special psychosomatic syndromes, personality profiles in the different syndromes, general theory and criteria for treatment, and some considerations for further re- search and basic principles. The special syndromes include fractures, hypertensive cardiovascular disease, coronary occlusion, anginal syndrome, rheumatic fever, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiac arrhythmias, re- current decompensation, and diabetes. Clearly a large number of psychosomatic difficulties have not even been touched on in this volume, including the whole group of gastro-intestinal disorders, skin dis- eases, headache, etc. In the chapter on psychosomatic history-taking, Dr. Dunbar quite rightly stresses the spontaneous pro- duction of patients. She decries the questionnaire method. One may gather that her critique of ques- tionnaire is directed to psychiatric procedures which are not based on psychoanalytic understanding. If this is so, there is a grave misunderstanding on her part, because even so-called questionnaire methods are never as rudely applied in the hands of experienced psychiatrists as the reader might be led to believe. Any experienced psychiatrist will follow his nose in the investigation of the material and will depend largely upon the spontaneous production of the patient. Even Dr. Dunbar in her examination manages adroitly to lead the patient on, as any other psychiatrist would. This is said in no carping sense whatever, but through- out the book there is the insistence that unless a physician is psychoanalytically trained he cannot possibly understand fully the material under his view. It is impossible to give all the conclusions arising from the investigation of each one of the specific syndromes, and it would be unfair to reduce the material to a matter of contrasting profiles, so that what follows must be taken, as I am sure Dr. Dunbar would wish, only in the sense of useful hints from the material. She states, "Coronary occlusion and hypertensive cardiovascular disease seem to occur particularly frequently among top-dogs and would-be-</page><page sequence="26">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 261 top4dogs. Anginal syndrome is a frequent finding among prima donnas or big frogs in small puddles. Rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease occur among teachers! pets and martyrs. Patients with cardiac arrhythmia, although they have something of the prima donna, give the impression of being children in the dark. Patients with diabetes can generally be characterized as muddlers." Anyone who has worked with psychosomatic prob- lems for any length of time must be forted to the conclusion that the validity of theories in this field rests to an enormous extent on the historical chronology of events, on the juxtaposition of special items which through the physician's attention or the patient's attention come to assume cause and effect relationship. The literature on the subject is amazingly meager in more accurate definition of the actual relationship of psychic to physiological events. Dr. Dunbar's use of statistical method bolsters the assumptions derived from historical material, but even such a thorough in- vestigator as Dr. Dunbar can be too enthusiastic over her own findings, one may surmise. When a patient who has had several fractures is reported, after an episode of personal chagrin, to have gone out and acquired himself another fracture, one can only recog- nize that the author has accepted her own conclusions entirely too readily. It remains to be proven, for example, that the guilt reactions of fracture patients have any more importance than a casual consequence of the fracture. For example, "A married Irish-born housewife ... fell off a step-ladder, fracturing the os calcis of the right foot. She said she had been having a queer feeling that she had done something wrong. She wasn't sure what. 'I always tell my children if they get hurt it's a punishment because they have done something wrong and they'd better confess.'" This statement of the patient would seem to me to throw more light on her cultural background than any actual illumination on the causes 'of her accident. Maybe Dr. Dunbar doesn't think so, but there are various ways of looking at this material. The book is an impressive piece of work, and the author and her colleagues have done a remarkable job in ferreting out personality profiles and actual pre- cipitating situations in each one of the psychosomatic syndromes. The summaries that they have arrived at may be taken as representing a distillation of general expectations in such cases, pointing the way to things that need to be inquired into and 4etermining special attitudes in treatment, and special treatment proce- dures. The material on the Rorschach test is valuable and needs further expansion, such as it is receiving at this moment. In spite of the excellence of the work, this reviewer feels that it would be better yet and exercise a more profound influence among physicians generally if the material were presented in a less dogmatic way from the psychoanalytic viewpoint. There must be plenty of physicians who are willing to accept a formu- lation of psychosomatic material couched in terms of universal acceptance. This kind of a book is yet to be written. When it is, Dr. Dunbar's experience will be one of its basic pillars, but it will be a different edifice than her's. INTRODUcTiON TO EXcEPTIONAL CHILDREN. By Harry J. Baker. The Macmillan Company, New York. $3.50. 8' x 5j; xiv + 496; 1944. Here is a text for teachers, having to do with the prob- lems of exceptional children of all types: those physically handicapped, those victims of neurological or mental diseases, those with behavior difficulties, those with educational retardation, and those exceptional for other reasons or for a combination of reasons. It is an eminently practical text, dealing with experiences in actual practice in the Detroit school system and other situations, and gives a broad view of the problems to be met and methods for their management. The author makes a telling point in stressing that the exceptional child commonly puts forth a very unusual effort to gain what training he acquires; further, that if normal children in normal situations put forth the same efforts that the exceptional children have to, no one knows what the effect of this would be on the general cultural development. He makes a plea for humane enlightened treatment of the exceptional child from the physically handicapped and subnormal to the gifted child. The author, however, is too much swayed in his chapter on psychotic conditions by the seeming erudition exhibited in the American Psychiatric Association's official classification of mental diseases. As a matter of fact very few mental diseases are at- tributable to neurological disorders, but this is a minor item and of no great importance for the purposes of this book. It seems to be an excellent text on the subject. THE RIGHTS OF INFANTS: Early Psychological Needs and Their Satisfaction. By Margaret A. Ribble. Columbia University Press, New York. $1.75. 81 x 51; x + 118; 1943. It has long been known that many of the social and psychological maladjustments of later life have their origin during infancy, and can be traced to certain social and psychological patterns of behavior in early life. The present study is concerned with the behavior of the very young infant: his tensions, his satisfactions, his instinctive reactions to his earliest surroundings, as related to his development as a normal integrated individual. A close and loving mother-child relation- ship is stressed throughout, and many instances are cited to show that lack of affection for the child, on the</page><page sequence="27">262 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY part of the mother, with the consequent lack of fond- ling, caressing, and stimulating, in a hundred ways results in a thwarted and psychologically maladjusted individual, incapable of reacting normally to his surroundings, even in later life. From her interestingly recorded observations of infant behavior, Dr. Ribble has drawn the following conclusions: (1) that crying is not simply the infant's method of letting his elders know he is unhappy, but rather its method of increasing the oxygen supply re- quired to maintain its feeling of well-being; (2) that sucking is not merely for the purpose of supplying the young infant with food (since, during the first week of life, the quantity of food involved is very insignificant anyway), but rather its method of stimulating one of the most sensitive regions of the body, while at the same time discovering something of the environment; and (3) that the infant's bath is not nearly so necessary as a measure of cleanliness as it is for stimulating the baby's body, and thus satisfying the innate desire for being fondled, caressed, and handled. The author makes a final plea for the careful develop- ment of the emotions during early infancy, so that by the time the individual is old enough to control them intellectually, they will not be thwarted or dormant, or completely lacking. For those interested in child behavior and develop- ment, as well as for those concerned with general human psychology, this volume will prove both stimulating and enlightening. An index and a bibliography are provided. ENCYCLOPEDIA Or CHILD GUIDANCE. Edited by Ralph B. Winn. The Philosophical Library. $7.50. 9 x 6; 456; 1943. A total of 74 authors have contributed to this excellent 456-page compendium of the latest scientific knowledge concerning child guidance. Some 215 topics including such items as anger, competition, fear, lying, phobias, punishment, imitation, and hobbies are discussed authoritatively, and in the light of the research and experiences of the contributors of the various topics. The contributions touch every conceivable phase of child guidance from medicine, pediatrics, psychology and psychiatry, through hygiene, health and dietetics to education, sociology, and even anthropology. The editorial work, which included the selection of entries as well as the organization of the entire body of material, has been skilfully handled. The result is a reference work which will prove extremely useful, not only in the university, child clinic, or child welfare library, but in the home as well. MODERN WAYS WITH CHILDREN. By Elizabeth B. Hurlock. Whittlesey House, New York and London. $2.75. 8 x 51; vii + 393; 1943. The impact of war, probably more than any other single factor, has renewed the emphasis on the need for more and better child care and guidance. With so many fathers away at war, and so many mothers taking important places in industry, the care of count- less children is left to inexperienced nursemaids, board- ing schools, or haphazard arrangements of pooling or sharing caretakers. It is felt that under such condi- tions, too many children will, like Topsy, just grow up, with no concept of their obligations to society, or of society's obligation to them. In the present volume, the author has attempted to bring to the lay public the latest scientific knowledge on child training in clear, precise, and non-technical language. Such problems as eating, sleeping, playing, habit formation, and discipline are discussed from an entirely sympathetic, yet intelligent point of view. The author's closing sentences depict the straight- forward common sense displayed throughout the volume: "By guiding the child's behavior, by en- couraging him to develop wholesome attitudes, by correcting any distorted points of view that he may have, and by checking any behavior which gives promise of being undesirable, you will help to lay the founda- tions of a well adjusted personality. That is all you can hope to do in the childhood years." For mothers, fathers, and nursemaids-in fact, for anyone vitally concerned with the care and guidance of children, this work should prove to be a funda- mental source of help and encouragement. A list of suggested readings and an index are appended. MENTAL HYGIENE IN SCHOOL PRACTICE. By Norman Fenton. Stanford University Press, Stanford University; Oxford University Press, London. $4.00. 9 x 6; xvi + 455; 1943. Professor Fenton has here compiled a most challenging book on mental hygiene in the school. The book is divided into five parts: How mental hygiene serves the school; Fundamental points of view in the practice of mental hygiene; Individual guidance, the theory and practice of school case work; Mental hygiene and the teacher; Mental hygiene and community life. In addition there is an appendix which includes a very good selection of books on child guidance for parents and an extensive bibliography. The author haS taken a very sensible attitude toward the whole problem of mental hygiene in the school and sees it as a program to be fostered by the joint efforts of teachers, parents, physicians, and other interested parties, and to be promoted perhaps by the training of specialists in mental hygiene taken from the ranks of school teachers themselves. He gives constructive examples of how such a program has been achieved in various situations, the obstacles that had to be overcome, and the practical methods employed in their resolution. Nowhere in the text is there any</page><page sequence="28">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 263 evidence of any special bias concerning methods to be employed. The book remains on a very practical ground and must rank as a first rate presentation of mental hygiene work, as it is actually practiced in schools today and as it could be promoted in different settings throughout the country. Part three, entitled "Individual guidance, the theory and practice of school case work," includes chapters on "The origins of symptoms and problems," and on "Symptom-formation as adjustment." In these two chapters the author gives a very good presentation of the issue of symptoms and their formatibn and meaning, without in any wise allying himself with those special interpretations which, whatever their provocation in a strictly medical setting, would no doubt be met with too much skepticism by the non- medically trained and by those who with medical training Wvould still object to scientific bias. In part four, "Mental hygiene and the teacher," the author presents some instructive case records of successful and unsuccessful teachers, showing what practical measures were applied in the treatment of personal difficulties in the lives of teachers. These are very abbreviated accounts, and the reader might get an erroneous impression of the ease with which favorable results were obtained. Altogether the book is a most welcome text on the subject and should stimulate the spread of mental hygiene programs throughout the country. HUMAN BIOLOGY SOCIETY AND NATURE. A Sociological Inquiry. By Hans Kelsen. University of Chicago Press, Chicago. $4.00. 9 x 6; viii + 391; 1943. The author's purpose in writing this book seems to be to show the debt that our modern philosophic and scientific theorists owe to the thoughts of their primi- tive ancestors. The first part of the book reads like an excerpt from Fraser's Golden Bough. The final chap- ters are devoted to expounding the parallelism between primitive folk lore and advanced philosophic thought. The author's thesis is well summarized in his closing sentence as follows: "After the complete emancipation of causality from retribution in the modern notion of law, society is- from the point of science-a part of nature." The rest of the book is -like a discourse developed from this text. There are 118 pages of bibliographic references and other notes, and 7 pages of index. SOCIAL THERAPY. An Introductory Study. By M. B. Hale and S. M. Hale. Williams and Norgate, Ltd., London. 5s. 71 x 4; 96; 1943. This is a handbook for the use of social service case- workers, compiled from the experiences of the London Charity Organisation Society. It is an excellent little book dealing with equipment, interviewing, the back- ground of the whole problem of social therapy, visiting, treatment, conference and committee work, and recording. The book is eminently of a practical nature and avoids all kinds of isms which have tended to dominate the field in various settings. The authors acknowledge the indebtedness of the movement in England to American methods of social care, and the adaptation to English soil seems to have resulted in a thoroughly practical and useful work. It is a volume which tells its story simply, and might easily be a useful handbook for American, as well as English, case- workers. CRIMINAL CAREERS IN RETROSPECT. By Sheldon and Ekeanor Glueck. The Common- wealth Fund, New York. $3.50. 91 x 6; xiv + 380; 1943. This is the report of the third five-year follow-up of five hundred criminal careers, and is actually a sum- mary of the progress upward or downward in the careers of the five hundred original criminals, treated statistically and treated at length in illustrative sample. Briefly, some of the five hundred improved their status; for some of them matters stood defi- nitely worse. In summarizing the differences between success and failure, the authors point to the age of the first delinquency as the one most significant factor. "A greater proportion of those who responded well to each form of peno-correctional treatment were further along in years when they first became delinquent than of those who did not respond satisfactorily to treat- ment; among the latter delinquent trends became evident very early in childhood. It is to be stressed that this is the only factor in respect to which all the treatment failures were consistently and uniformly inferior to the successes. This finding would seem to suggest that inability to adapt to peno-correctional treatment is somehow related to biological difference between successes and failures." The authors then proceed to the most provocative part of the work, namely, the construction of a table from which a prediction concerning the behavior of delinquents may be made with substantial chances of the prediction turning out accurately. Without going into the detailed construction of the prediction table, it may be stated that the authors feel that if such a table is applied in the proper spirit, namely, not as a slide rule to indicate automatically the proper type of peno-correctional treatment, but as an index to guide the sentencing authority in his choice of sentence, a great deal more might be expected of peno-correctional treatment than is the case today. ". . .it becomes clear that the sentencing process must be transformed</page><page sequence="29">264 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY into systematic and informed fitting of the offenders to treatment.... the prediction tables as well as illus- trative analyses of their choice have demonstrated that Justice need not be blind in an undesirable sense." Actually, this means that authorities who sentence must have considerable latitude in imposing the sentence and that its nature should be determined after joint consultation between legal authorities, psychia- trists, psychologists, and criminologists. The authors state, "We are thus led to the conclusion that it isn't primarily or fundamentally the fear of punishment, but rather the presence or absence of certain traits and characteristics in the constitution or the early environ- ment of the different offenders which determine their respective responses to the different forms of treat- ment, and determines also what such offenders will become and what will become of them. Those who behaved well, either during or after treatment, were as a class more favorably endowed by nature and cir- cumstances, by nurture, than were those who did not respond well." The prediction tables are the transla- tion into mathematical formulae of the material whose analysis led to the above conclusion. The authors are in the process of applying the prediction tables to some of the cases with the hope of checking up on the actual outcome at a later date. RACE AND RUMOaRS oF RACE. Challenge to American Crisis. By Howard W. Odum. University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill. $2.00. 7j x 53; + 245; 1943. The problem of race discrimination (which some will always refuse to recognize as a problem) and bi- racial culture in the United States must have an early settlement if the principles for which the present war is being fought overseas are to be realized here at home. The threat of open riots between whites and Negroes in various parts of the country during the first year of the present war has served to emphasize the seriousness of the problem, and has prompted the present attempt to collect and scrutinize some of the underlying factors and relationships. The unusual circumstances brought on by the war (for example, the crowded transportation facilities and the resultant difficulties in enforcing the Jim Crow laws) have placed the South on the defensive with respect to its treatment of Negroes. The South has fought for a hands-off policy, and has insisted on its ability to cope with a problem which it feels is no concern of any other part of the country. The author believes that the South can no longer consider itself isolated from the rest of the United States, any more than the nation can consider itself isolated from the rest of the world. In other words, the problem is no longer localized, nor is it any longer a problem of primary concern only to the United States, but it is a world problem which will certainly have its solution in the culmination of the present world conflict, if not before. Meanwhile, for those of us who face the problem at close range the author makes a plea for an intelligent and realistic analysis of the situation as it exists. He clearly indicates the need for careful sifting of the pertinent elements of the problem to determine which is truth and which is rumor; which is real and which is only apparent; which is related and which is not re- lated to the basic difficulty. In the words of the author, the work is .. . literally an affectionate appeal to all the people of the Nation and a challenge to its leadership for wisdom and maturity, bottomed in the facing of truth wherever found; in the asking of essential questions; in the search for correct answers. The eager quest for a new covenant through scientific and cooperative endeavor on new high levels leaves no place for bitter- ness and hate, for name-calling and blame, for flight from that reality which is America's heritage and opportunity." CHARACTERSnCS OF TH AMERIcAN NEGRO. Edited by Otto Ilineberg. Harper and Brothers, New York. $4.00. 9i x 6i; xii + 409; 1944. In this volume are collected several of the monographs which were submitted to Dr. Gunnar Myrdal in his study of the Negro in America, recently published under the title, An American Dilemma. The contents in- clude: "The Stereotype of the American Negro," by Guy B. Johnson; "Tests of Negro Intelligence" and "Experimental Studies of Negro Personality," by Otto Klineberg; "'Race' Attitudes," by Eugene L. Horowitz; "The Hybrid and the Problem of Miscegena- tion," by Louis Wirth and Herbert Goldhamer; and "Mental Disease Among American Negroes: A Sta- tistical Analysis," by Benjamin Malzberg. Johnson collected popular beliefs and assumptions among American whites concerning the American Negro, and when one reads this compilation, one can only blush at the high rate of assumption and the low rate of proven fact at its base. A final summarizing list of Negro personality and cultural traits is presented as a basis for further discussion and research. Klineberg's study of Negro intelligence is based largely on material from the Army tests of 1918, which shows the northern Negroes making a much better performance on the tests than southern Negroes, and northern Negroes doing somewhat better than southern whites, differ- ences which Klineberg relates to the cultural setting and opportunities for self-development. The problem of Negro personality runs into the same difficulty that all personality studies do, with the added factor tha-t the Negro has not as yet been the object of extensive study. Horowitz' contribution on "race" attitudes</page><page sequence="30">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 265 is very interesting and shows clearly that there is no spontaneous race attitude in young children; that this begins to develop in about the 5th grade in school, clearly as a consequence of cultural social pressure. Wirth and Goldhamer discuss the hybrid and the problem of miscegenation, reaching the important conclusions that the possibility that the Negro will be absorbed into the white population through thorough miscegenation has little to support it in actual trends today, that the mulatto is apt to disappear as such from the American scene, and that the Negro "race" will become fairly stabilized. Malzberg shows that Negroes have the same mental diseases as whites, and their tendency to have certain mental diseases in greater proportion than whites is most likely closely related to social and cultural factors. This is an important book, and its reader cannot help but be appalled at its revelation of the pathetic poverty of actual fact as opposed to the plethora of assumption, for the most part prejudicial to the Negro, which make up the conception of the American Negro most whites in this country definitely possess. Every page points to the need for further systematic, carefully controlled observation of one of our most important social, economic, political, and biological problems. AN AMERICAN DILEMMA: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy. In Two Volumes. By Gunnar Myrdal, with the Assistance of Richard Sterner and Arnold Rose. Harper and Brothers, New York. $7.50. 91 x 6k; Vol. I, lv + 705; Vol. II, xii + 709-1483; 1944. This excellent work gives not only a well-rounded presentation of the American Negro and his impact upon American society, but it is at the same time a penetrating sociological study of the United States. Gunnar Myrdal, Swedish social economist, was chosen to make the study because the Carnegie Corpo- ration, which financed the work, felt that only a scholar from a country with no traditions of imperialism could approach the problem with the requisite impartiality. In the collection of factual material and its interpreta- tion Dr. Myrdal was aided by a large staff of assistants, headed by Richard Sterner and Arnold Rose; but the evaluations and conclusions are the product of the author's scientific analysis, and not a compromise between various racial and regional viewpoints. The result is a cohesive and thoroughly readable book. At the same time, divergent views on most phases of the question are quoted and analysed. The book is encyclopedic in scope. It embraces attitudes, beliefs, NTegro ancestry, population, and migration; economics, politics, justice, education, religion; treats of every form and variation of dis- crimination and the reactions thereto; describes the NTegro community and individual achievements and contributions. Although the names and often the faces of celebrated Negro artists and athletes are generally known, the white American is, as a rule, totally unacquainted with the educated Negro. Myr- dal testifies to the warm, deep, and rich personalities of educated Negroes. "Whether they know it or not, white people are dwarfing their minds to a certain extent by avoiding contacts with colored people." Organizations of and for Negroes are painstakingly analysed. Myrdal points out that "some of the most capable statesmen in the United States are Negroes," but their tact and ability, sorely needed by the country as a whole, are completely absorbed by the struggle to get the white man to live up to the letter and spirit of the law. As a social scientist, Myrdal of course makes no attempt to add to our biological knowledge of race. In the biological field he is concerned chiefly with the effect of false beliefs about race as a rationalization for discrimination. Every phase of the life of the American Negro is comprehensively treated. The historical past is reviewed, and here the author takes issue with the popular practice in scholarly histories as well as in school texts of ignoring the accomplishments of the Reconstruction Period that followed the Civil War. Myrdal finds that the Southerner cherishes the memo- ries of the "horrors" of the Reconstruction govern- ments as a vital defensive in order to condone the "legal trickery, unfair administration, intimidation and forthright violence" he uses to disfranchise Negroes in the South today. The Northerner, "in ord-er to rationalize the national compromise of the 1870's and the condoning, since then, of the South's open break with the spirit of the Constitution," supports the Southerner's interpretation. The Negro's economic, political, religious, and social life are given exhaustive treatment. Of equal, if not greater, interest is the analysis of what effect our attitude towards the Negro has on American economy and politics as a whole and on our moral character. Several years of research and field investigations (the inquiry was started in September 1938 and ended in September 1942) brought Dr. Myrdal to the con- clusion that there is no Negro problem except in the heart of the white American. Once the white American accepts the Negro as the equal human being that science proves him to be, the Negro problem as such will disappear and all Americans could then start working together for better housing, cleaner politics, and for every common problem that faces the nation. In the meantime "personal and local interests; economic, social, and sexual jealousies; considerations of com- munity prestige and conformity; group prejudice against particular persons or types of people; and all sorts of miscellaneous wants, impulses, and habits" are re- sponsible for our living, thinking, and acting in direct</page><page sequence="31">266 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY violation of the American Creed of liberty, equality, justice, and fair opportunity for everybody. It is his strong and genuine belief in the American Creed that has forced the Southerner to build up an amazing edifice of rationalization for his inhuman treatment of the Negro. He has convinced himself that he is the guardian of the "purity of the white race." The white Southerner claims to refuse social equality because it would lead to "intermarriage." Myrdal, however, believes that actually it is the other way around: "intermarriage" is resented because it would be a supreme indication of "social equality," and "what white people really want is to keep the Negro in a lower status." Thus "the great majority of non-liberal white Southerners utilize the dread of 'intermarriage' and the theory of 'no social equality' to justify dis- criminations which have quite other and wider goals than the purity of the white race." The author blasts the myth of Negro contentment, even when applied to the most apathetic of the poverty-stricken masses: "If a multitude of first-hand random observations, such as we have made over the whole country, are any evidence, the contented Negro... is a rare phe- nomenon." Myrdal points out that the findings of anthropo- logical research are making it increasingly hard for the white Southerner to live with his conscience. The conffict between the American Creed and his preju- dices "makes the prejudiced white man nearly as pathetic as his Negro victim." It is interesting that Myrdal's conclusion that the white Southerner is suffering from a "deeply split personality" is identical with that of Lillian Smith, editor of the Georgia periodical, South Today. Miss Smith, a native-born Georgian, is a child psychiatrist whose work with the children of prominent Southern families has led her to the conclusion that the Southern mind and soul have been warped by a teaching which tacitly implies that no matter what wrongs a white child commits he is superior to the best Negro child. Myrdal, too, points to many disastrous consequences of our illegal treatment of the Negro. For example, contempt of the law in this sphere breeds general contempt of law; miscarriage of justice towards one group breaks down ojir entire judicial machinery. The international aspects of our prejudice are of course well known to serious students of world affairs. Myrdal reiterates their plea that we come to good terms with colored peoples before the white minority in the world's population is in its turn humiliated and subjugated. As to the physical makeup of the book, it is deplora- ble that the footnotes of both volumes (which are as interesting and as readable as the text itself) have been included in Volume II, thus making it necessary for the reader to have both volumes beside him if he wants to read Volume I intelligently, and also cutting in half the possibilities for circulation among library borrowers. THE AMERiCAN WoMAN. The Feminine Side of a Masculine Civilization. Revised and Enlarged Edition. By Ernest R. Groves. Emerson Books, Inc., New York. $3.50. 81 x 51; 465; 1944. Some years ago the reviewer was given a book called "What Every Man Knows About a Woman." Inspec- tion of the book disclosed that every page was com- pletely blank. How does it happen that a mere man can presume to produce a work on this subject of the magnitude of the volume under consideration? A glance at the table of contents reveals the answer. This is not so much a book about women as about what men have thought of, and have done to, women in the past twenty centuries. The opening chapter begins with the admonitions to women concerning their demeanor in public places of worship from the letters of Paul to the Corinthians, and recounts the results of the mutual impacts between women and civilization ever since. The author enlarges upon the cultural influence of all women, from those who enter convents to those who follow another profession, more ancient but less honorable. The reader who glances over the 27 pages of index will doubtless be surprised at the proportionate space accorded to some of the significant women of history. For instance, Frances Wright, Louisa May Alcott. Mary Baker Eddy, and Marie Curie are mentioned but once; Lucretia Mott and Amelia Bloomer but twice, and Nancy Hanks and Sarah Josepha Hale not at all. The most prominent figures appear to be Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Dorothy Dix. At first sight this seems to be a strange selection, but a careful reading of the text seems to confirm the author's choice. To the reviewer the most interesting chapter is that in which the cooperative venture of Robert Owen at New Harmony is discussed. This neglected phase of American social history deserves more attention than it commonly receives, for it made many significant contributions to other phases of the intellectual development of the republic as well. But other readers may feel differently, since every phase of United States history is covered equally well, and the story is brought down to date by a discussion of the problems of employment that confront Rosie the Riveter. The author even goes so far as to maintain that the difference in the social position accorded to women of the two groups of nations participating in the present war is the most fundamental difference in the two competing social philosophies. bw ITALIAN OR AMFRIcAN? The Second Generation in Conflict. By Irvin L. Child. Yale University Press, New Haven. $2.75. 91 x 6; vii + 202; 1943. The psychological and social adjustments of a genera-</page><page sequence="32">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 267 tion whose parents have migrated to a new country are complex, particularly when the cultures in the old and new country differ in language, family patterns, and community life. This study deals with the process of acculturation in such a group, the male second-genera- tion Italians in New Haven, Connecticut, being chosen for study. First- and second-generation Italians con- stitute about one-quarter of the city's 160,000 popula- tion, approximately equalling the fraction of the city which is native white of native parentage. A community of this constitution presents an excel- lent opportunity for such a study, but the material on which this study was based is exceedingly meagre. It consists of standard interviews with fifty-three persons, informal interviews with twelve persQns, life histories obtained from three informants, and general observations made after boarding for several months with Italian families and participating in their daily social life. Three types of reaction to the problems of accultura- tion are described in detail: the rebel reaction (based on ten cases), the in-group reaction (nine cases), and the apathetic reaction (twelve cases). The remaining group of informants (nearly half of the total) showed reactions which were not predominantly in any of these classes and are not discussed to any extent in the book. The people in the first class attempt to affiliate themselves with the Americans in the community, those in the second maintain their identity as members of the Italian group, and those in the third cultivate an indifference to national distinctions. The conflicts and achievements associated with these various reac- tions are discussed. The book presents interesting ideas upon which to speculate regarding important social problems, but in view of the limited amount of evidence supporting any of the ideas, it can hardly do more than suggest issues toward which a real community study might be directed. THu DISPLAcEMENT OF POPULATION IN ETJROPE. By Eugene M. Kulischer. International Labor Office, Montreal and London. $1.50. 9t x 6J; iv + 171; 1943. One of the most serious post-war problems will be the resettlement of the millions of people who have been transplanted from their homes and homelands. Any sensible reconstruction requires knowledge of the extent and nature of these population movements. The International Labour Office has undertaken to assemble such knowledge as is at present available. Such a project presents enormous difficulties, first in amassing figures which will give even a reasonable approximation to the true values, and second in organizing them in such a way that important pat- terns in the situation emerge. In collecting the figures, Dr. Kulischer has received the assistance of a large number of official and private organizations. In cases where wide discrepancies in estimates from different sources appear, he presents the discordant figures and brings collateral evidence to bear in an attempt to get as good approximations as possible. He makes allowances for the duplication of persons, which must inevitably occur in recording movements of people under such chaotic conditions. In all, he estimates that some thirty million people in Europe are living away from their pre-war homelands- exclusive of the men in the armed forces who are abroad and the axis soldiers who have been taken prisoner. Other large groups that are omitted, such as the evacuees from German and Italian cities sub- jected to recent bombings, make the estimate given above conservative. The movements of the populations are described under three heads: migration movements of the German people; movements of non-German popula- tions; mobilization of foreign labor by Germany. The first class includes the transfer of German minori- ties to Germany or the new border provinces under a repatriation scheme (750,000) and the migration of Germans out of the Reich to conquered or occupied countries (2 to 3 million). The second class includes an enormously varied set of migrations, which are analyzed country by country. It involves some 14 to 15 million non-Jews and 3 to 4 million Jews. The third class, again analyzed country by country, con- cerns between 6 and 7 million persons brought into Germany for the labor market between the end of 1939 and the beginning of 1943. The text that presents the figures is very well written, presenting the forces behind the various movements, both according to the official statements, and according to the probable facts. This is done without emotionalism, but with an understanding of the implications for the peoples involved. It is a book which should interest any person concerned with the world picture, and even though the report is of necessity provisional, it should be a very valuable aid to those who are in any way responsible for post-war settlements.

After a brief sketch of the geography, natural re- sources, and history of the area the author discusses at length the economic and cultural development since the Russian revolution. The Buriat Mongols of Lake Baikal have been organized into the Buriat Mongolian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (BMASSR) with Ulan Ude, formerly Verkhneudinsk, as capital. The nomadic and semi-nomadic Mongols were settled on collective farms, and the vast steppe and taiga lands are now dotted with new villages. The economy of BMASSR was incorporated into the national economy of the USSR. At Ulan Ude the Soviets constructed the largest locomotive and railroad car factory of the USSR. It repairs rolling stock as well as turning out new equipment for the Far Eastern and Siberian railroads. This and other newly constructed plants use local raw materials such as coal and natural gas. At Ulan Ude the largest meat combinat of the USSR, a part of which is the first meat canning factory of Siberia, is also located. The Buriat Mongolian alphabet was latinized in 1930 and has since been used in schools, business, and public life. Literacy rose very rapidly, especially among the Buriats, as a result of the expansion of the school system in the fall of 1936 to include all children of school age. SOCIAL CHANGE IN SOUTHWEST CHNA.

These three mimeographed studies of the changing social conditions in Yunnan prove to be deeply inter- esting. Made by sociologists of the National Yunnan University who have been forced to the interior from their coastal universities by the war, they are a product of that opening up of southwest China to industrializa- tion and modern influences brought about by the conffict with Japan. Of this southwestern area, Cressey has said, "The southwestern tableland is the most diverse region in all China in its human make-up. Only about half of the population consists of real Chinese and the remainder is made up of a great variety of primitive peoples.... Perhaps few parts of the world contain such a complicated racial mixture or offer such a fertile field for the study of anthro- pology as this region and the adjoining mountains" (China's Geographic Foundations). The opening up of this region will inevitably alter and obliterate much of the existing pattern of social organization. At the same time, the seeds of China's uture as a great political and industrial power are here, along with many difficulties and problems that lie in the way. The enthusiastic young sociologists who have made these studies have eschewed the bird's- eye view, believing that it is better to look "at the subject from the lower strata, and within a limited field, giving an intensive and rather detailed picture of the unit covered, a microscopic view, without how- ever losing sight of the wider implications." To the reviewer, who grew up in China, the result is illuminat- ing beyond almost anything, within his knowledge, that has been written about that land. The first study compares the rural economies of three communities. The first of these is a mixed community of Chinese and Lolos, lying in the hill country, and scarcely removed from a feudal state. The second is a wholly Chinese community of petty landowners on the fertile riceland of the plateau. The third is a riverside community in an area of poor agricultural resources, where primitive industry, in the shape of basket-weaving and papermaking, is necessary to support the population. The second report deals with labor conditions in two of the new wartime factories in Kunming, one factory employing wholly male labor and the other female. The investigation includes a survey of the character of the labor supply, the origins of the laborers, and the factors leading to their employ; the existence of a social dichotomy in the factory personnel, and the problem of efficiency; the role of management and its special difficulties in attempting to apply the imper- sonal labor system of mass production to people for whom personal relations are all-important and tradi- tions of hand labor and craftsmanship are strong. Students of the Industrial Revolution who would like to see, at first-hand, situations paralleling those in England and Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries will find them in western China today. The third report will be of most interest to biologists in general, for it deals with the reactions of a town of about 8000 population to an epidemic of cholera. The town possessed several missionary churches and a college, a modern 20-bed hospital with two doctors and a nurse, a public library, and three schools en- rolling 1400 students. Contrary to the generally accepted theory that "magic fills the gaps of science" (Malinowski), it is clear that in this town there is no replacement of traditional practice by that dictated by scientific knowledge. On the contrary, scientific knowledge is merely fitted into the traditional pattern of magical doings and superstitions without any</page><page sequence="34">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 269 rupture in the fabric of the latter, and without any true understanding. The scientific remedy comes to be regarded as but one of a number of possibly effective traditional methods to be tried. The author con- cludes that "In a society of slavery, or of caste, or of fate, even with all the industrial development of the world, sound scientific reasoning can never really hope to take a permanent root. Only in a free and in- dustrialized society will education on a large scale (i.e. mass education) be possible and become of real social value, for then education will receive the sup- port of the mass of the people." There are certain faults in the studies, faults prob- ably unavoidable in view of the methods used and the circumstances surrounding the investigations. The data are rather frequently too scanty for statistical treatment, and conclusions that are unreliable are sometimes drawn. Notwithstanding these defects, it is vastly encouraging for the future to see scientific case studies of such merit appearing from China during its present ordeal, and the translation and appear- ance of the full reports, of which these bulletins are but summaries, will be awaited with eagerness. BALINESE CHARACTER. A Photographic Analysis. Special Publications of the New York Academy of Sciences, Volume II. By Gregory Bateson and Margaret MIead. New York Academy of Sciences, New York City. $3.75. 12 x 9; xvi + 277; 1942. The beautiful, small island of Bali, off the east coast of Java, is inhabited by one million people. These Balinese possess an Indonesian culture that has been considerably influenced by Buddhist and Hindu sources, while Chinese and Mohammedan contacts have played a minor role. Balinese diet consists chiefly of rice and sweet potatoes, fish and meat being consumed only in small quantities. A variety of domesticated animals are kept, the dog, acting as scavenger, being perhaps the most important one. Support of life is no heavy burden in Bali, hence the people enjoy an abundance of leisure, and were con- tent and gay under Dutch rule before the Japanese invasion. The authors of this monograph have spent two years in Bali, mostly in one mountain village, study- ing and photographing the daily life of the natives with special emphasis upon many aspects of behavior which would have seemed unimportant to the older generation of anthropologists. This volume is not primarily devoted to Balinese customs, but concerns itself chiefly with the inhabitants as personalities- how they stand, move, sleep, dance, eat, make love, get married, bury their dead, organize their com- munity life, paint, carve, act in their puppet plays, learn, grow to adulthood, and endless other forms of detailed behavior that reveal the basic cultural and emotional life. The bulk of this volume consists of 759 photographs accompanied by brief explanatory notes. These candid camera pictures were not posed, they are well reproduced, and have been selected and arranged to illustrate the following main topics: Introductory Subjects (Village and Temples, Agriculture, Irriga- tion, Industrialization, etc.); Spatial Orientation and Levels (Sharing and Social Organization, etc.); Learn- ing; Integration and Disintegration of the Body (e. g., Trance, Hand Postures); Orifices of the Body (e. g., Eating, Suckling, Body Products); Autocosmic Play (e. g., Toys, Cock-fighting); Parents and Children (Stimulation and Frustration, Tantrums, Fear, Sleep, etc.); Siblings; Stages of Child Development; Rites de Passage (e. g., Tooth-filing, Marriage, Funerals, Ex- humation, Continuity of Life). With this wealth of pictorial records and their brief psychological analysis and interpretation, the complex Balinese character is described effectively and thoroughly. This scholarly work closes with an "Ethnographic Note on Bali," a brief bibliography, and a glossary and index. CRoss SECTIONS OF NEW WoRL PREEISTORY. A Brief Report on the Work of the Institute of Andean Research, 1941-1942. Smithsonian Miscellaneous Col- lections, Volume 104, No. 2. By Wm. Duncan Strong. Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C. (Paper). 93 x 61; 44 + 33 plates; 1943. In 1937 a group of American scholars organized the Institute of Andean Research to promote and co- ordinate-anthropological explorations and studies in the Andean area and in related regions for the purpose of advancing our knowledge of the origin and develop- ment of the native American civilizations. This is a very condensed account of -the organization, as well as of the chief results of the archeological program of this young and promising Institute, which has a list of thirteen distinguished research members and many associated experts, aiding in specific projects. During its brief activities in the field, the Institute of Andean Research has already made numerous and signific;ant contributions to New World prehistory. These are briefly mentioned and illustrated with many excellent photographs. In a chapter on "Future Vistas" the author comments as follows on the present and future status of his specialty: ". . . it is a strange thing that most social scientists and even some archeologists, who certainly should know better, often dolefully lament the fragmentary nature of the human pre- historic record at a time when they have not yet even begun to exploit systematically its available riches. Certainly in Middle and South America the day -of scientific archeology is at its very dawn, and one has</page><page sequence="35">270 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY reason to suspect that this is probably true of most of the world. The time is coming when the rich ethno- logical and archeological record of the New World can be compared in full detail and time perspective with similar records from Europe, Egypt, Mesopotamia, India, China, and Siberia. When such comparative data are in hand the generalizations that will emerge may well revolutionize our concepts of culture history and culture process over the millennia." Appended are an interesting, tentative "Relative Chronological Chart of Middle and South America" and an impressive list of the publications resulting from the 1941-1942 program of the Institute. BIOCHEMISTRY THE CnMMISTRY OF PLANT CONSTITUENTS. By Ole Gisvold and Charles H. Rogers. Burgess Pub- lishing Company, Minneapolis. $4.25 (paper). 10' x 81; xiii + 484; 1943. Extensively revised to keep up with the many ad- vances which have occurred in this broad field since the first edition appeared in 1938, this multilith- printed volume contains a vast amount of material useful to the student or investigator in the fields of chemistry, biology, or pharmacy. The introduction outlines briefly the organs of the plant-laboratory in which the many constituents are built up and mentions the raw materials necessary for its efficient functioning as a factory. As is wholly fitting, the treatment of the carbohydrates, expanded in the chemistry of the monosaccharides and otherwise revised, is the most extensive of all the chapters, covering in 100 pages the chemistry of the sugars and their derivatives, of the pectins, cellulose, starch, gums, and the other members of this important class of plant constituents. The chapter on sterols has been revised, with con- siderable expansion of the portions dealing with the sterol nucleus, and with the chemistry of the saponins, while the treatment of the large and highly important class of the alkaloids has been completely revised in the light of recent work in this complex and significant field. Less extensive chapters adequately cover vegetable fats, plant and insect waxes, carotinoids, tannins, terpenes, glycosides, and the anthocyanins and an- thoxanthins, that on the last of these having been enlarged from the first edition to include additional material on the chemistry of their structure and on the isoflavones. To keep pace with the rapid advances in other important and active fields, the discussion of the vitamins has been revised and expanded, while the next chapter on enzymes has been extended by a more detailed treatment of coenzymes and biological oxida- tions and reductions, with new material on the respira- tory enzymes. The final chapter on products of fermentation, although brief, presents the chemistry of most of the microbiological processes used in- dustrially. The extensive index of 17 pages, from Acactechin to Zymosterol, is apparently restricted in reference to the chemical constituents, neglecting most of the numerous source plants, yet for some reason including a few, such as sea-weeds, Persea gratissima, and Pyrus aucuparia. It also lacks any reference to penicillin, although this vitally important antibiotic therapeutic agent is mentioned in the text. The 26 tables, many of which effectively assemble and summarize material extended through the text, add materially to the usefulness of the book. The system of placing pertinent references in condensed and abbreviated form at the bottom of each page, although admittedly saving of space, is open to criti- cism here because it deprives the student of the back- ground and perspective on a chapter or phase of a subject that assembled lists of references afford. Inci- dentally, in the 2-page list of abbreviations used in the bibliography, plant pathologists will be astonished to find their official journal designated as "Felix Phytopath," a euphonious and personified "abbrevia- tion" somewhat mystifying to the reader until the source of the error is traced to carelessness in transcribing a reference on page 2. VEGETABLE FATS AND OILS: Their Chemistry, Pro- duction, and Utilization for Edible, Medicinal and Technical Purposes. Second Edition. By George S. Jamieson. Reinhold Publishing Com- pany, New York. $6.75. 9 x 6; 508; 1943. Fats and oils not only are an essential part of the diet of men and animals, but also play an important role in many industries. Consequently, the life and progress of a nation depend in no small measure on its supply of these products. The demand for fats and oils increases with the growth of population, and through the discovery of new uses for these sub- stances. An attempt has here been made to bring within the compass of one comparatively small volume as much information as possible in regard to the vegetable fats and oils. Those readers requiring other or more detailed information will find the available references under each subject treated. The fats and oils here presented have been divided into three classes: the non-drying, with iodine numbers up to 100; the semi-drying, with iodine numbers from 100 to 130; and the drying, with an iodine number of 130 or more. Whenever feasible, the fats or oils from plants of the same family are grouped together. Al- though the methods in common use for the extraction of fats and oils are discussed in the first chapter,</page><page sequence="36">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 271 further attention is paid to methods of expression under the heading of individual products, such as cottonseed, linseed, and olive oils. Under cottonseed oil, caustic soda refining, bleaching, deodorization, hydrogenation, and the preparation and distillation of fatty acids recovered from refinery soap stock are dis- cussed. These methods are applicable as such, or with slight modification, to the treatment of a large number of other fats and oils. There is a separate chapter devoted to methods, in which several standard procedures are given for each determination or test, including those for the determination of the diene and the thiocyanogen values. The appendix contains data on the seeds and oils found in a number of ornamental (besides some other) trees and plants, and a series of tables containing pertinent information. For convenience, there are both an alphabetically arranged table of the plant families under which the species are listed, and a botanical index which contains in alphabetical order the species mentioned in this book. There is also a complete subject index. This book should enjoy a wide reading by chemists, technologists, nutritionists, and others concerned with the material it contains. METABOLISM OF FAT. By Ida Smedley-Maclean. Methuen and Company, London. 4s. 61 x 4i; vi + 104; 1943. In spite of its brevity, this survey of the biochemistry of the lipids serves to indicate the progress that has been made in our knowledge of the constitution, synthesis, and functions of the fats and related substances. In those sections that probably represent the author's major fields of interest (synthesis, composition, and oxidation), the discussion is especially lucid and critical; and the reader is given a perspective of the accomplishments and the still unsolved problems. The remaining parts are rather perfunctory in treatment, but as the preface states: "Within the limits of the present volume, it would be impossible to give any complete survey of the field." The reader searching for a more intensive treatment of the entire field will have to refer to Bloor's recent monograph. LABORATORY MANUAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY. Second Edition, Revised. By Benjamin Harrow, Gilbert C. H. Stone, Harry Wagreich, Ernest Borek and Abraham Mazur. W. B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia and London. $1.50 (paper). 9 x 51; v + 132; 1944. A laboratory manual is a peculiar entity intended to aid a student toward a more complete mastery of the subject matter of some field of science. Implicitly, it is associated with the methods and aims of teaching; and since these methods and aims in biochemistry are unstandardized, the laboratory manual in this field represents a more or less individualized product, the merit of which cannot be fairly judged. The laboratory manual by Dr. Harrow and col- laborators follows the traditional path of touching on the carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, on certain enzymes, on saliva, milk, bile, blood, and urine. There are sections on colorimetry and on chromatographic analysis. The directions are given in some detail, with emphasis upon the quantitative aspects. The book is clearly and neatly printed. THE CHEMISTRY OF SYNTHETIC STJBSTANCES. By Emil Dreher. Philosophical Library, New York. $3.00. 81 x 58-; 103; 1943. The chemistry of macromolecular organic compounds, rapidly developed in science and industry, has up to now been considered in existing literature chiefly in the realm of technical application, especially in so far as it concerns the treatment of high molecular weight substances. The present volume, highly technical and limited in its appeal almost solely to chemists and engineers, is designed to give information regarding the underlying theoretical questions involved in the synthesis of those diverse macromolecular compounds of which the synthetic substances being manufactured today consist. The author feels that absorption in such fundamental questions of organic chemistry is indispensable for those interested in the production and manufacture of synthetic substances. This little book really presents a survey, authentic and concise, of the principal questions of macromolecular chemistry. The subject-matter discussed includes: high molecular weight organic compounds; a survey of the relations of synthetic high molecular weight compounds to drying oils; principles of the processes of polymeriza- tion; various types of polymerization products; the influence of the constitution and of substituents on the capacity for polymerization of low molecular weight compounds; principles of the processes of polycondensation; and some information on the cognizance of solubility of high molecular weight film-forming substances. A selected bibliography is given at the end of most of the individual chapters. There is no index, which is an unfortunate omission. SULFONA1MES. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences. Volume 44, Article 5. By Coln M. MacLeod, Paul H. Bedl, Henry Irving Iohn, J. S. Lockwood, Richard 0. Roblin, Jr., James A. Shannon, and H. B. vanDyke. New York Academy of Sciences, New York. Paper; 9i x 6i; 445-538 + 4 plates; 1943.</page><page sequence="37">272 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY The sulfonamide drugs have so revolutionized the field of chemotherapy in the past few years that it is not surprising to learn of the tremendous scientific effort being put forth in an attempt to learn more of their exact chemical nature, their structural and functional relationships to each other, and their effects on the physiology of bacteria as well as the physiology of the host organism. In this series of five papers, the most recent pertinent scientific facts concerning the chemistry, pharmacology, and therapy of the sulfonamides have been discussed in an authoritative manner from the standpoint of current, as well as past, experimental evidence. The first paper deals exclusively with the apparent relationship between the molecular structure of the sulfonamides and their anti-bacterial activity. Al- though the authors have not included a detailed dis- cussion of this relationship in the present abstract, they have introduced a considerable amount of experi- mental and mathematical data in support of their basic theory, which is stated as follows: "the more negative the S02 group of an N1-substituted sulfan- ilamide derivative, the more bacteriostatic the com- pound will be." The knowledge of the relative positive or negative character of the NL-substituent provides a wide margin of accuracy in predicting the chemotherapeutic activity of any new sulfanilamide derivative. The second paper describes several experimental studies on the physiological disposition (distribution, excretion, resorption) of a number of selected sulfan- ilamides. Most of the experimentation was carried out on the cat, but sufficient observations were made on the dog to indicate that the fundamental principles are probably more generally applicable. In general, it has been shown that the facility with which the sulfanilamides pass through the cell membrane is largely determined by the amount of disassociation they exhibit in the hydrogen-ion concentration en- countered in the blood. The authors make no claim for their work as the final word in the relationship between the chemical structure of the sulfonamides and their physiological disposition, but rather point out the value of their method of experimentation in obtaining more exact information on the subject. The third study is concerned with the toxic effects of the sulfonamides. In excessive dosages and over long periods of time, these compounds have been shown to have definitely deleterious effects on the morphology and chemistry of the blood, on the physi- ology of the kidney, and on the nervous and cutaneous tissues of the body. The author of this study indicates the importance of further investigations to determine the pathological effects of toxic dosages of the sul- fonamides on the liver, spleen, kidneys, and lungs. A list of extremely useful therapeutic cautions is included for the practising physician. The fourth report covers the antagonists, dynamists, and synergists of the sulfonamides. The role of various bacteria, yeasts, enzymes, and chemical com- pounds in either stimulating or depressing the effective- ness of certain concentrations of the sulfonamides in the body is outlined. A knowledge of these factors is essential in the application of sulfa-therapy, since it not only points out methods of increasing the potency of the sulfonilamide drugs, but indicates the reasons for their ineffectiveness under certain conditions as well. The final paper deals with the general action of the sulfonamides in the body, and discusses the urgent need for further investigation into the activity of bacteria in the body fluids in relation to actual or potential immunity. The author here points to the need for further studies in the development of specific drugs which will individually ettack such bacteria as cause tuberculosis or endocarditis. These papers will provide much interesting enlighten- ment for the entire medical profession, and will un- questionably be eagerly received by the general practitioner as well as the medical teacher or investigator. BIOMETRY STATISTICAL ADJUSTMENT OF DATA. By W. Edwards Deming. John Wiley and Sonts, New York; Ckapman and Hall, London. $3.50. 8 x 58; x + 261; 1943. The adjustment of data presented in this book is by the method of least squares, and the book could ap- propriately be called "Least Squares Adjustment of Data," since no other method is developed. The basic principle of least squares is presented in a different way from the classical approach. It follows in gener- alized form the line of thought that is inherent in the least squares adjustment of measurements on the angles of a plane triangle to the condition that the sum of the three angles shall equal 1800. As applied to curve fitting, the equation to be fitted becomes a conditional equation to which the adjusted values of the observations are to be subject. This approach unifies the various problems in least squares adjust- ment and a single general solution is given, to which the solutions of all the special problems are oriented. The author states at the outset that he is not at. tempting to cover all statistical methods, nor even the entire field of least squares, but is attempting to supplement other books, with emphasis on scattered portions of the subject of adjustment of data that are difficult to find elsewhere. Perhaps it is because of this effort to collect scat- tered matter that the book is very uneven and it is not clear to what type of audience the author addresses himself. In fact, one gets the impression that he has put together papers prepared for different groups.</page><page sequence="38">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 273 His use of such terms as "standard error" and "Student test" without definition, implies some familiarity on the part of his readers with statistical terminology, yet in Chapter VII he defines at some length the terms 'cell" and "cell frequency" in a correlation table, which implies no knowledge of the most elementary terms. Incidentally, he had used these terms previ- ously without definition. Another difficulty with the style is the continual reference to a later part of the book for the definition or interpretation of the matter under discussion at the moment. Thus such a fundamental concept as the weight of an observation is used in equations and text, in the solution of a problem of equal weights and one of unequal weights before a section is reached entitled "A digression to define weights." The term residual is used in three pages of discussion before it is defined. We find in Section 8 (p. 15) the sentence: "Least squares may also be considered the minimizing of the estimate a (ext), to be introduced in Section 13." Such frequent reference to future sections for defini- tions must oblige the person who is not already familiar with the subject matter to jump back and forth in his reading or else to read without understanding. MIore serious from the point of view of acquiring a real understanding of the method of least squares and applying it soundly is the failure to stress the assump- tions underlying the method. The inquiring student might ask why least squares is preferable to least 4th powers or least absolute deviations, and what criteria must be fulfilled to justify adjustment by this method. What discussion there is of these issues is so scattered and disorderly that it would be virtually impossible for a student to get a view of the complete set of assumptions involved in the process of least squares'. The author stresses that he is interested in the practical side of adjustment, that is, in results that "can be used as a basis for action." However, in the section on curve fitting he gives the student no guid- ance whatever on how to select the function to be fitted. Yet every person experienced in curve fitting knows that this is by far the most difficult and critical issue of the entire procedure. The book is weak, therefore, at the very point where most guidance is needed in getting results that furnish a sound basis for action. TH:E FoREIGN-1ORN POPULATION OF CONNECTICUT, 1940. Storrs Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 246. By Nathan L. Whetten and Henry W. Reicken, Jr. Unizversity of Connecticut, Storrs. (Paper). 9 x 6; 75 + 27 maps; 1943. The basic data of this report are from published and unpublished tabulations obtained from the 1940 Census. The Appendix, which comprises about half of the Bulletin, contains these raw data. The other half of the report discusses the results of analyzing the material and presents the salient findings in maps and charts. The foreign-born white population of Connecticut in 1940 was 19 per cent of the population of the state. a proportion exceeded only by New York, Massa- chusetts, and Rhode Island. Italians and Poles account for a third of this group. The intrastate geographical distribution of each of the ten leading nationalities is presented, together with comparisons of their urban-rural distribution. The Bulletin should be useful to the various groups of workers in education, social service, and racial relations who need to have a view of the distribution, as to origins and basic cultures, of the populations with which they are working.

Emnerson Books, Inc., New York. $3.00. 9 x 6; x + 311; 1943. The fourth edition of this popularized account of chemistry has been extensively revised and emended. Much new material has been added, including chapters on "Strategic Raw Materials" and "Chemistry after the War." It is still one of the most outstanding contributions of its type. Dr. Holmes has done an excellent job in confining the history and development and the modern application of chemical knowledge to civilization in one volume, and in doing it in a very entertaining and readable manner. However, his enthusiasm causes him to stress chemistry to such a degree that he practically denies the existence of other sciences.</page><page sequence="39">274 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY TME CONTRIBUTION oF HOLLAND TO TIIE SCIENCES. A Symposium. Edited by A. J. Barnoaw and B. Landkeer. With an Introduction by P. Debye. Querido, Aew York. $3.50. 8 x 5; xvii + 373; 1943. The title of this symposium by Dutch scholars is mis- leading, for the term "science" is here used so as to embrace most of the fields of knowledge. Of the 352 pages of text, 261 (or nearly 75 per cent) are de- voted to the "Humanities and Social Sciences" (theol- ogy, philosophy, philology, psychology, sociology, historiography, law, political economy, international law, history of art, musicology, oriental studies, library science, and archival science). The "Exact Sciences and Architecture" (astronomy, mathematics, physics, chemistry, medicine, plant biology, architecture) are covered in the remaining 91 pages. The gaps in the above list are all too evident. Thus there are no sections devoted to general biology, zoology, paleon- tology, geology, or anthropology. But this, as the editors point out in their preface, was caused by a lack of competent authors for certain subjects. Although the book is necessarily compressed in style, because of its encyclopedic nature it serves the purpose for which it is intended-to acquaint the reader with Holland's more than considerable con- tribution to human knowledge. The attainments of living scholars and scientists, for obvious reasons, are not included. But here one may read of the achieve- ments of such men as Erasmus, "the prince of the humanists"; Spinoza, the great rationalist; Lambert ten Kate, student of the Gothic language; Grotius, the father of international law; Huygens, mathe- matician, physicist, and astronomer; and Van't Hoff, chemist and physicist-to mention but a few. Of special interest to biologists are the accounts of figures like Leeuwenhoek, Boerhaave, De Vries, Einthoven and Eijkman. Holland needs no propagandists. Her history speaks for itself. The sober facts, such as those compressed between the covers of this little book, are ample testimony of the tremendous contribution to civilization that has been made by one of the smal nations-numerically speaking-of the world.</page></plain_text>
