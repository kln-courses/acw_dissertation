<plain_text><page sequence="1">IV.-THE HEGELIAN DIALECTIC. BY BERNARD MUSCIO. 1. THE argument of the Hegelian Dialectic may be stated in general terms as follows. If we attribute a predicate to some subject, we are compelled, as a result of a careful scrutiny into what we have done, to attribute to the same subject the logical contrary of that predicate. We are thus compelled to assert a contradiction. For, while two contrary propositions may both be false, they cannot both be true. The fact is, however, according to the dialectic, that there inevitably arise instances in which we are forced to believe both of two contrary propositions true. It is held that the most extreme scepticism cannot escape this result. Every sceptic can be forced to admit, by an argument similar to that of Descartes, that something exists. In admitting so much the contradiction is at once reached, for a predicate has been attributed to some subject. Because " Being " has been predicated, " Not-Being " must be predicated. The so- lution of this contradiction, according to the dialectic, is a synthesis in which the distinction between the contrary predicates, or "categories," is overcome. Each is seen to be a " moment" in a " higher " predicate. The predication of the synthesis, however, resuscitates the difficulty, since we are forced to predicate its contrary. A new synthesis is thus required. The disease breaking out once more, the process is continued until a predicate, " the Absolute Idea," is reached, which, when attributed to Reality, does not compel us to predicate its contrary. From the fact that " the Absolute Idea " can be predicated of Reality, it can be inferred, it is held, that the Universe is Spiritual. This con- clusion concerning the Universe is, therefore, according to the dialectic, absolutely certain. Our certainty of its truth arises from the fact that we are compelled to predicate " the Absolute Idea" of Reality, if we predicate of it anything at all; and, no matter how great our scepticism, we must predicate " Being ". 2. The unique characteristic of the dialectic is its synthesis of contraries in such a way as to resolve a contradiction.</page><page sequence="2">THE HEGELIAN DIALECTIC. 523 Not it seems evident that this synthesis is possible only if there are contradictions to which the dialectic can be applied; that is, only if we are under the necessity of predicating logical contraries of the one subject. The contradictions must exist, and be recognised, before the characteristic principle of the dialectic can be adduced as their solution. Hegel, and his followers, definitely assert that they consider certain contra- dictions, arising, it is said, inevitably, as the cause of the dialectic process. It will therefore be admitted by the advo- cates of the dialectic that, if the specified contradictions do -not occur, the dialectic process cannot begin. The disappear- ance of the dialectic will necessarily follow from the dis- appearance of the contradictions which it was designed to resolve. 3. The question to be considered, then, is: Are the con- tradictions which, it is held, cause the dialectic process, and thus lead to the knowledge that the Universe is Spiritual, inevitable ? Two reasons only are urged for their necessity. (i.) It is held that the predication of one predicate of a subject "implies," or "involves," the predication of the logical contrary of that predicate, of that subject. In this ca.se the contradictions are reached by means of the relation of "implication," or "being involved in ". (ii.) It is held that the demands of the " Understanding " lead to contra- dictions if we apply to Reality any predicate except "the Absolute Idea ". These two reasons are quite distinct, as will be clear as we proceed. The difference between them does not seem, as a rule, to have been recognised; and acceptance of the dialectic seems to have been due, in some instances,- to a belief that they are identical. The fact is, however, that each attempts to prove, in a manner entirely different from that of the other, that there must arise contra- dictions which only 'the principle of the dialectic can solve. We shall consider both reasons in some detail. 4. (i) We have stated the first argument in the form that the predication of one predicate of a subject "implies," or " involves," the predication of the logical contrary of that predicate, of that subject. We wish to draw attention, first, to the phrase " predication of a predicate " in this statement. In the writings of those who accept the dialectic the above phrase would, generally speaking, be considered equivalent to either of two others, which are in fact constantly used as synonymous with it. These are " predication of a category," and, "predication of an idea". The most usual way of stating the difficulty which, it is held, the principle of the dialectic removes, is to say that, if we predicate a category of</page><page sequence="3">524 BERNARD MUSCIO: a subject, we are compelled, as a result of a close inspection of that category, to predicate the logically contrary category of that subject. According to this, the most usually accepted phraseology, " category " is synonymous with " predicate ". But we frequently find in Hegelian literature the phrase "apprehend under some category," and here " category " does not appear to be synonymous with " predicate ". What would be the meaning of apprehending something under a " predicate"? The question thus arises: What, in the Hegelian terminology, is a category ? 5. This question is highly important. Strange to say, it seems never to have been asked. The meaning of " category " appears to have been supposed obvious, and it is perhaps due to this fact that the word has been used with incompatible meanings. It is of course clear for what words " category'" is to stand. The various terms "Being," "Not-Being," " Becoming"; " Logic," " Nature," "Spirit "; etc.; are all "categories ". But taking any one of these terms, say "Being," what does it denote ? Three different things must here be distinguished. There is the mere word, the name of the " category" to which reference is made; there is the entity itself, whatever it may be, which the word denotes; and there is the idea in the mind of the person who uses the word as a symbol, that is, the idea of the " category" of which the word is the name. The important question is: When a Hegelian speaks of a " category," what kind of entity does he use this word to denote ? It appears highly doubtful if Hegelians use the names of the " categories " in any precise sense. By this it is not meant that they sometimes, for instance, use " Being " to mean what " Being-Determinate " is used to mean else- where; but that the kind of entity which the name of at " category" denotes seems never to have been definitely decided upon. This is suggested, for example, by the fact that it is sometimes said that " Being is an idea," sometimes that " Being is predicated of something" (and we do not predicate ideas of anything), and sometimes that "we ap- prehend something under Being" (and we do not apprehend things under predicates). 6. There is a strong tendency among Hegelians to use a "category" in the Kantian sense, as, so to speak, a groove of the mind, a piece of mental architecture, in accord with the unyielding outlines of which, "objects," must accom- modate themselves. The various types of judgment are then taken to be the expressions of the activity of the mind</page><page sequence="4">THE HEGELIAN DIALECTIC. 525 through its structural constituents. The manifold of sense is put into " intelligible " order by the " categories ". The chaos which sense (on this theory) would be in the absence of mind, is converted into a cosmos by the activity of the mind working through its " categories ". 7. Though there is a strong tendency among Hegelians to use " category " in this sense, some other is absolutely neces- sary for the dialectic. In the first place, it, is doubtful whether the most convinced Hegelian would admit that there are special mental construc- tions corresponding to the several score of Hegelian " cate- gories ". Our minds are not built on this elaborate plan. To uphold the contrary position would be particularly difficult in view of var~ious criticisms which have been urged against the " validity " of certain of Hegel's " categories " by those who accept the dialectic as a whole. Modern psychology would increase the difficulty. But even if we knew there were " categories " in this sense, and even if we knew,-as we do not know,-what were the relations between them, to argue from these to the nature of Reality would be, as the phrase is, a very crude piece of subjectivism. Are we to say that there is a reality corresponding to any curious kink our minds may happen to possess ? In the second place, the relation of " implication "-what- ever it be,-which is the instruinent by which, according to the argument we are considering, the contradictions are generated, cannot possibly hold between Kantianesque " cate- gories ". This relation is said to hold between certain enti- ties, whose precise nature is not defined, which are predicated. It is evident that we cannot predicate Kantian " categories ". Yet if the contradictions are to be obtained, logically contrary " categories " mu?st be predicated. Consequently, " category" cannot be used in the Kantian sense. 8. A " category" as used, not as defined, by advocates of the dialectic, appears to be simply the defining function of a class. In most usual philosophical terminology, a Hegelian " catef gory " is a predicate, simply, in the widest sense of this term. When, for example, it is said that " Being" is a " category," what is meant is that there is a class of entities, each of that has a certain relation to the predicate " Being ". Again, the " category" of " Life" is that set of predicates and relations, in virtue of the possession of which, certain entities are menmbers of the class " living beings ". Similarly, the "cate- gory" of " Cause" will be that relation by which certain events are grouped together, as " instances of causation,"' in a certain class. And so on for the remaining " categories ". If this be</page><page sequence="5">526 BERNARD MU SCIO: the correct account of the matter, it will follow that there %re as many " categories " as there are defining functions of classes, that is, an infinite number; and the dialectic will be a selec- tion from all possible " categories ". The " categories " which constitute the stages of the dialectic would be those which stand in such a relation to each other, a,s leads the advocates of the dialectic to believe that they can proceed, by means of them, to the conclusion that the Universe is Spiritual. 9. We are now in a position to deal with the argument which states that the predication of one predicate, of a subject, " implies," or "involves," the predication of the logical con- trary of that predicate, of that subject. In considering this argument we might investigate it in its application at any part of the dialectic process; but we shall choose for this purpose the starting-point. There are two reasons for this choice. The first is that the criticisms we shall make seem slightly clearer with regard to this part of the dialectic than with regard to other parts: a fact which is due to the greater simplicity of the first " categories ". The second is that if we show that the dialectic process never begins, it wilt be perfectly clear that it never reaches any conclusion; whereas, if we showed that there is a fallacy at some point after the beginning, it might seem that this could be rectified. But our criticism is equally valid against any part of the dia- lectic. 10. The dialectic begins, then, from the consideration that an absolute scepticism is impossible. To say, " there is nothing," or "there is no truth," is to refute oneself There is at least the act of mind which asserts "there is nothing," and it is true at least that " there is no truth ". This is familiar ground, and need not be laboured. The dialectic tells us, to begin with, that we must admit that something is; and this we must admit, even though we assert that we are entirely ignorant what the something is. This position is taken to mean that the " categpry of Being is valid "; and this means that we can truly predicate " Being," a simple predicate, of something. It is then pointed out that all that the sceptic must admit is the existence of the merest something. Indeed, whatever the thing be, " something " is too definite a word to indicate it. The sceptic must admit that "something is"; but )his admission must be interpreted in such a way that, when- ever it is asked whether some particular thing is that which the sceptic admitted, we must assert that this par- ticular thing is more than the sceptic admitted. The "Being" that is predicated is, as Hegel and his disciples</page><page sequence="6">THE HEGELIAN DIALECTIC. 527 say, " Pure Being ". It is " Being-apart-from-all-deter- minateness ". The next advance is to assert that " Being-apart-from-all- determinateness" is essentially what we mean by "Not- Being". It is held that this identity of meaning enables, or rather compels, us, to predicate "Not-Being" wherever we predicate "Being" (" Pure Being"). But, according to the dialectic, "Being" and "Not-Being" are logical con- traries. Consequently, to predicate both of one subject is to assert a contradiction. We thus require the synthesis " Be- coming" to solve the difficulty. Stated in a perfectly general way the contention assumes the following fQrm: We are compelled to predicate P of S; otherwise, according to the dialectic, every assertion is a contradiction. )XTe then find that P is, in some respect, iden- tical with Q. Let us suppose that the " in some respect " is not a necessary qualification, and that we have: "We then find that P is identical with Q ". The result is that we are compelled to predicate Q of S; or rather, in predicating P we have ipso facto predicated Q. We have now predicated of S both P and Q. We did this because we supposed Q identical with P which we were compelled to predicate of S. This was the justification of, and the sole reason for, our action. On closer investigation, however, we discover that the " in some respect " is a necessary qualification,; that while we mean by P the same as we mean by Q, P and Q are really logical contraries. Finding that both,are predicated of the one subject we recognise a contradiction, and, accord ing to the dialectic, one solution only is possible, namely, the merging of the differences of P and Q in the synthesis R. 11. We submit, briefly, that if P and Q are identical, we predicate Q in predicating P; but that, if P and Q are iden- tical, they are not logical contraries, and the joint predication of both of them of one subject presents nothing to synthesise. On the other hand, if P and Q are logical contraries, there is not the slightest ground for the predication of the one in the fact that we have predicated the other. And here, also, there is nothing to synthesise. 12. There appears to be an extraordinary confusion in the dialectic between predicates a.nd the ideas of predicates. The dialectic seems to say that the ideas of logically contrary predicates are identical,-wbich is itself an amazing state- ment,-and that we are therefore compelled to predicate logically contrary predicates of the one subject. Consider the terms "Being" and "Not-Being". The advocates of the dialectic have repeatedly said that the ideas</page><page sequence="7">528 BERNARD MUSCIO: of "Being" and of "Not-Being" are identical. The idea of "Being" is the idea of "Pure Being," not the idea of " Being-Determinate " but of " Being-apart-from-all-deter- minateness This, it is said, is what we mean by "Not- Being". It is definitely asserted that, if we examine what we mean by " Being " and " Not-Being," we are unable to discriminate between our meanings. So far, however, we are in the realm of ideas only. And what have ideas to do with the point at issue ? We certainly do not predicate the idea of " Being" of anything whatever, nor do we predicate the idea. of "Not-Being" of anything whatever. Even supposing the contrary, no contradiction would be generated, since it is asserted that the ideas are identical. If it be admitted that we do not predicate ideas, what explanation of the procedure can be adduced? The logically contrary predicates, it may be said, are, of course, not ideas; but we predicate logical contraries because our ideas of them are identical. This, however, is clearly false. If the idea in the mind of a person when he uses " Being " as a symbol is not discriminable from that in his mind when he uses " Not-Being" as a symbol, it is simply contradictory to say that the person means one predicate by " Being " and its logical contrary by " Not-Being". He means the same thing by the two words. 13. We have supposed,-what is absurd,-that ideas may be used as predicates. It would generally be admitted that this supposition is absurd. Nevertheless, it is this absurdity which seems to have been committed by the dialectic. Be- cause of an identity between ideas of logically contrary predicates, in " affirming Being," it is said, we are " affirm- ing Not-Being". It is added that the ideas manifest an " identity in difference ". This means that they are " iden- tical " in one part, and " different " in another; that one is Xy and the other Xz. The difference must be temporarily suppressed when it is said that in "affirming " the one, we are, ipso facto, " affirming " the other. By virtue of in- discernibility of "difference," and by virtue of this alone, Xz is " affirmed " when Xy is " affirmed ". The suppressed " difference " is then brought forward, and there is consider- able astonishment over the fact that ideas, which could not be discriminated from each other, are really logical contraries. The simple solution is that meanings have been altered to suit the stage of the process. 14. To " affirm Being " is to predikate existence of " some- thing ". If there is in reality a predicate corresponding to our idea of "Being," when we use that idea in "affirming</page><page sequence="8">THE- HEGELIAN DIALECTIC. 529 Being" we are making a true judgment. If we use an idea different from the idea of " Being," it matters not how slight the difference and how great the similarity, we do not know that, because there is something in reality corresponding to the idea of " Being," there is also something in reality cor- responding to this other idea. It is a fallacy, therefore, to " affirm " the one on the ground that we have " affirmed " the other. If we make two judgments, of which each attri- butes the same predicate to the same subject, we make no advance in thought in making the second of the two; but if, as is necessary for the occurrence of the contradictions on which the dialectic relies, our two judgments attribute each a different predicate to the same subject, we are not justified in making the one judgment when we have made the other, on the ground of a point of identity between, either the pre- dicates, or the ideas of the predicates. The dialectic requires that the relation of " implication" should hold between logically contrary predicates. We would thus be able to infer " S is Q " from " S is P," where Q and P are logically contrary predicates. Curiously enough, no contradiction now results. If logically contrary predicates "implied" each other in the above way, there would be instances of two contrary propositions both being true. It is generally assumed that two contrary propositions cannot both be true, and the dialectic accepts this assumption. On the above theory, however, two contrary propositions would both be true, and there would be an end of the matter. The difficulty which the principle of the dialectic is directed to remove is that we are compelled to believe true both of two logically contrary propositions. Yet, if we ask why we are compelled to such a belief, we are referred to " implication " between logically contrary predicates; but this, clearly, is a false theory, and, even if true, would not generate the con- tradictions. The fact seems to be that the reason for assert- ing our compulsion to this belief is to be found in the asserted " indiscernibility of meanings"' of logically contrary predicates; the relation between meanings being transferred to predicates without the confusion being realised. Put otherwise: the relation of " implication," as used by the dialectic, must hold either between predicates, or between entities other than predicates. If it holds between predicates, no contradiction is generated, since then two contrary proposi- tions can both be true. Consequently, " implication " must hold between entities other than predicates. We discover that these entities are the ideas of the predicates, and that the relation between them is that of identity, or partial identity. If it</page><page sequence="9">530 BERNARD MUSCIO: is identity, the predicates of which they are ideas cannot be logical contraries. If it is partial identity, we cannot legiti- mately attribute to a subject the predicate corresponding to the one, because we have attributed to it the predicate cor- responding to the other. Here, also, no contradiction is generated. 15. We conclude, therefore, that so far as the argument we have considered,-which is the fundamental argument adduced in support of the dialectical principle,-is con- cerned, the dialectic can never begin. For no contradic- tion of the kind upon which the dialectic relies for its beginning, and advance, can possibly be generated in the way this argument asserts it to be generated. 16. (ii.) The other argument by which the dialectic seeks. to show that contradictions of a certain kind are inevitable, has been stated (? 3) in the form that the demands of the " Understanding" lead to contradictions if we apply to Reality any predicate except " the absolute Idea ". Accord- ing to the dialectic the demands of the " Understanding" are two. (a) It is said, first, that the "IUnderstanding" demands, that the various " categories," that is, the various predicates, be treated as " independent," and ultimate, entities. The force of " independent " here is that the " Understanding " demands that predicates must not be " merged " in " higher " predicates, as the syntheses of the dialectic attempt. This contention may be criticised in two ways. In the first place, the "demand" of the "Understanding" here put forward is a pure fiction. It is false to assert that the "Understanding," or anything else, demands a priori that predicates must have certain relations to each other. If such a demand were made, it should be treated, just as the Universe would treat it, as a mere piece of impertinence. It, cannot be truly said that, if we think at all, we must treat predicates as " independent," and ultimate, entities. The chief condition for precise thinking is that we keep our ideas- definite and distinct, whether they are ideas of predicates, or of subjects. We do demand that, if two predicates are two, that is, if they are different, they shall not be regarded as one. We demand that distinction and difference, where they are discovered, shall be recognised, and acknowledged. But the "Understanding" which demands, a priori, that predicates shall stand in certain relations to each other, must, surely, be the "Understanding" of primitive man. NVe deny, therefore, that this particular "demand" is a demand.</page><page sequence="10">THE HEGELIAN DIALECTIC. 531 Granting, however, what is plainly false, that the " Under- standing " does make this demand, what follows ? Either, the Universe will satisfy it, or it will not. The theory pro- ceeds to say that this demand cannot be satisfied, because, to predicate any one "category," regarded as "independent," and ultimate, of realitv, is to reach a contradiction. But how does this contradiction arise ? It may be said to arise in the way we have already considered and found invalid, namely, by the asserted " implication " between logically con- trary predicates. Assuming that this method of generating the contradiction fails, what other method remains ? One such method attempts to show that predication itself involves contradictions, that is, that the "relational way of thought " cannot mnove without contradictions. But, if we assert a proposition of the form " S is P," how does the con- tradiction arise? It could arise if we consider "S is P" equivalent to " non-P is P " and the is in " non-P is P " as the sign of identity. This, however, would be an error; and if is be taken as the predicative copula, no contradiction arises.-Again, it is said that mere relatedness involves an infinite regress of a vicious character, and that in this fact the " Understanding" is plunged into contradictions. But until something more than reiterated assertion is adduced in favour of the infinite regress involved in relatedness, we may be content with what direct apprehension appears to reveal, namely, that relatedness involves no infinite regress, vicious or otherwise.-These are the only methods by which the at- tempt is made to prove that any assertion " involves " con- tradictions. There is, then, no contradiction in the attribution of a predicate to a subject, though a judgment which states such predication may be false. In asserting a subject- predicate proposition, we are not asserting, nor assuming, that the predicate is an "independent," and ultimate, entity. We are not asserting any relation between this and other predicates. We are asserting a relation between a predicate and a subject; that is, we are stating that there is a complex of a particular kind, a unity of a particular and a universal. This contains no contradiction. This " demand " of the " Understanding " is sometimes made still more extraordinary. It adds that some one pro-. position must express the whole truth. This, at least, appears to be what is meant. when it is said that the "Under-' standing" demands that " Being," for example, shall be an "adequate expression of Reality ". Of course, the " Under- standing" which demanded this would have perpetrated an</page><page sequence="11">532 BERNARD MUSCIO: absurdity, and no advocate for it could be found. But whose "Understanding" demands such an extraordinary thing ?-This whole argument must, therefore, be dismissed as baseless. (b) The other " demand " of the " Understanding" is for a " complete explanation " of the Universe. Following on the assertion of this demand, it is contended that the 'Understanding" cannot attain a "complete explanation," because of the nature of the "categories" which it employs. This difficulty, it is said, can be overcome by the syntheses which "Reason" waits to perform. It is added that the " Understanding" must allow " Reason " to perform this function, because the difficulty has arisen through a " demand " of the " Understanding " itself. Before we are willing to admit that the " Understanding" demands a "complete explanation" of the Universe, we must be told quite precisely what is meant by a "complete explanation ". After this has been done, we shall be in a position to decide whether the " demand " is a fact, and also, if it leads, as is asserted, to contradictions. What, then, is " explanation"? We are told that the aim of the dialectic is both the "complete explanation " and the " complete rationalisation" of the Universe; and it is held that the dialectic has accomplished its aim. " Explanation" is, then, " rationalisation ". But what is " rationalisation "? The first step in the attempt to prove that the Universe is "completely rational" is to prove that it is "partially rational". This is supposed to be accomplished when it is shown that there is at least one true proposition, for example, 4 something is ". To apply a predicate to a subject is, therefore, " to rationalise "' partially, and, consequently, " to explain" partially, that subject. It would seem from this that any subject would be cGompletely " explained," or "rationalised," if we knew all the propositions concerning it which were true. And this is part of' what is meant by " complete explanation ". It is said that " the Absolute Idea" is the only "category" which completely "explains " eyerything. "The Absolute Idea" is said to have the "lower categories" "implicit" in it. In predicating "the Absolute Idea," one is, therefore, ipso facto predicating all the " lower categories ". If this, however, were all that the dialectic means, its contention would be trivial. No par- ticular subject except the Universe could be " completely explained " or " completely rationalised," if this result with regard to any subject followed only when "the Absolute Idea " could be predicated of it. For of no subject, except</page><page sequence="12">THE HEGELIAN DIALECTIC. 533 the Universe, are all the " categories " truly predicable. To say that " the Absolute Idea " is predicable of the whole of reality, means, so far, only this: that within the Universe all the " categories " are, somewhere or other, to be found. This is not a particularly novel, nor important, statement. It cannot be merely this meaning of "explanation " which the dialectic has in view when it accuses the " Under- standing," in demanding a " complete explanation," of demanding something which it cannot attain without contradiction. For this meaning of " explanation" does not. lead to contradictions. In attempting to discover what this asserted "demand" of the " Understanding " is, we may compare it with another which is frequently, but inconsistently, associated with it. This is the demand for " complete knowledge ". We re- cognise that the ideal of " complete knowledge " is legitimate,. and that it is compatible with very great present ignorance. But ignorance, when brought face to face with the " demand " for "complete explanation," is supposed to generate a con- tradiction. Whence arises this difference between " complete knowledge " and " complete explanation " ? It is a significant fact that, when illustrations of the con- tradictions, which are supposed to be "involved" in this "demand" of the " Understanding," are given, they have almost always some reference to causality. On closer ex- amination we discover that this -demand for a "complete explanation " is a demand for a " complete knowledge " of all the causal relations in the Universe. The " Understand- ing," it is said, demands that every piece of knowledge should be a knowledge of the whole cause of some "fact". This demand, it is asserted, is contradictory, because we never know the whole cause of any "fact ". It is said that the cause of one phenomenon is to be found in surrounding phenomena, and that the sphere of " explanatory" pheno- mena gradually increases until it contains the whole of the present state of the Universe, while this again must be causally " explained" by prior states of the Universe, and a vicious infinite regress is the result. The "Understand- ing" demands, but can never obtain, because. of the self- contradictory character of the demand, the knowledge of the cause of everything. This is the essence of the difficulty which the dialectic raises against the " Understanding ". Apart from the meaning of " cause," as used by the dialec- tic, consider this " demand " of the " Understanding ". The " category" of cause is, for the dialectic, one among a large number. We have defined a " category" as the defining of</page><page sequence="13">534 BERNARD MUSCIO: function of a class. The " demand" that we should know completely the causal relations in which every constituent of the Universe stands to every other, is, as interpreted by the dialectic, a demand that all the constituents of the Uni- verse should be members of some one selected class. It is clearly conceivable that there might be constituents of the Universe not causally related. The " Understanding " is thus supposed to " demand," a priori, that this possibility is not the case. The most natural question to ask here, is: What right has the " Understanding " to make this demand ? And the answer is, briefly, that it has no right whatsoever. If we are to decide, a priori, what are the various relations which unite entities, our results, to say the least, will have a very ambiguous worth. Further, it seems utterly false to say that the " Understanding" makes this demand. This will appear from an examination of the Hegelian meaning of cause The dialectic assumes that one entity, not one event, is causally related with other entities. It thus uses " cause," most generally, to mean "efficient cause ". It carries the doctrine of " efficient causality" to the extreme by asserting that every entity is the partial "cause," and the partial " effect," of every other. The difficulty which the dialectic brings forward then seems to arise thus. Any and every piece of knowledge is supposed to be a knowledge of " causality ". The knowledge of the " cause " of any one entity is supposed to require a knowledge of the " cause " of all entities. We are supposed not to have this knowledge. Consequently, it is said, we have no knowledge,-a self-contradictory state- ment. It should be pointed out, first, that if " cause " be used in the scientific sense to indicate the subsumption of events under laws, no contradiction can be generated from it. It must then be asked whether the Hegelian theory, that every entity determines partly, and is partly determined by, every other, is really a demand of the " Understanding ". It must be asked, further, whether, if the dialectic knows this theory to be true, we have not even now a complete knowledge of " causality ". This the dialectic denies. What is really denied, however, is that we have a complete knowledge of all causal laws, that we have a complete knowledge of " cause " in the scientific sense of the term. The appeal to this meaning of " cause " at this point is quite illegitimate. The argument requires one meaning of the term to be used throughout. If the scientific meaning be adopted, there is no contradiction in this " demand ". On the other hand, if</page><page sequence="14">THE HEGELIAN DIALECTIC. 535 -the characteristically Hegelian theory of "causal" inter- ,dependence be accepted, we already know the whole truth about causality, and the only apparent way in which our -knowledge could be increased would be by the direct ap- prehension of every constituent of the Universe. This, however, would not affect the reciprocal interdependence of the parts of the Universe. But how do we attain the know- ledge of this interdependence? The fact is that it is an assumption, which the " Understanding," on discovering -its character, is very willing to discard. It must always be illegitimate, and fallacious, to suppose that the human mind demands something which may not be the fact. Here, the " demand " of the " Understanding" is ,equivalent to the assertion,-for the making of which there appears to be no explanation but an attenuated imagination, --that the Universe has a character, which, conceivably, it may not have. This contention seems to have been largely due to the failure to recognise what is the scientific mueaning of " cause," and to the adoption of a somewhat anthropo- :morphic notion in its place. This notion is found to generate difficulties. If so, why not at once cast it aside ? It is not necessary for thought, especially since not every proposition ,expresses a "causal" relation. It probably seemed to the reflective savage that the " Understanding " demanded that a thunderstorm be regarded as the activity of a malignant god; but we have outgrown that demand. It seems high time that we should reject those "demands " with which idealistic philosophy has so constantly attempted to reach 'the nature of the Universe. The demands of man are relevant in psychology, in ethics, and chiefly in life. The one demand of the philosopher which is worthy of veneration is the demand- for the truth; but this means that he shall be willing to class entities where they belong. When, in general, the demands of man are referred to, it is important to know a great deal about man; otherwise, the " demands of man" are likely to be the personal demands of the speaker. What doctrine is more peculiarly Hegelian than the doctrine that every constituent of the Universe is partly the "cause" of, and is partly "caused" by, every other? It is this doctrine which the ,dialectic asserts to be a "demand of the Understanding". 17. We conclude that the arguments which are used to prove that the " Understanding" is necessarily " involved " in contradictions, are fallacious. If this conclusion, and our former one (? 15) are true, the important result is reached that the dialectic must expire at its very birth, for the means</page><page sequence="15">536 BERNARD MUSCIO: of its life,-certain specified contradictions,-are not to be, found. 18. Let us now consider the distinction, insisted on by the advocates of the dialectic, and by others also, between the " Understanding " and the " Reason ". This distinction is a heritage from the Faculty Psychology, and is of a kind which modern psychology cannot admit. It would be ex- tremely rash to maintain that any conclusion of modern psychology is so certain as to be beyond the possibility of modification. Nevertheless, modern psychology is, in view of its investigations, only acting reasonably when it asks: What is the " Reason," and what the " Understanding " ? 19. The terms "Reason" and " Understanding" are fre- quently used as though they denoted psychological facts; and in answer to a question concerning their reference, we expect, in the light of many statements in which these terms occur, to be shown two types of thought, one of which is "higher" than the other. We are at times distinctly told that the " Reason " and the " Understanding " are two "varieties" of thought; and whatever be the precise lan-- guage used to denote the distinction, there is no doubt that these terms are meant to refer to psychological phenomena. From various statements made by the advocates of the dialectic, we should expect to find some such theories of the, two as that the function of the " Understanding " is to judge,. while "Reason" possesses insight; or, that the "Under- standing" can pass round the externals only, of things, while " Reason " penetrates to their very essence; or, that the " Understanding " is merely descriptive, while "Reason " is interpretative. But while all this is suggested, no precise theories are offered. Instead of psychological analysis, which is merely adumbrated, we are given two different theories of Reality, of which one, it is said, is held by the " Understand- ing," and is riddled with contradictions, while the other, it is asserted, is held by the " Reason," and is self-consistent and satisfactory. 20. The theory of the " Understanding," as stated by the dialectic, is pluralistic. It tends to over-emphasise dis- tinctions, even to the point of denying that certain rela- tions unite entities into wholes. The theory of the " Reason," as stated by the dialectic, is monistic. It tends to deny differ- ences, and to assume a priori a principle of intimate unity. 21. The important point to note is that the sole philosophi- cal question relevant to these two theories does not concern their supporters, or their originators, but their truth. One kind of argument might question whether there are two,</page><page sequence="16">THE HEGELIAN DIALECTIC. 537 varieties of thought. It might suggest that "Understand- ing " is merely a name for exactness, and " Reason " a name for a number of mystical and anthropomorphic tendencies, whose vogue is passing. It might urge that thought is essentially one. Some such argument might be adopted, and might be successful against the use that is made of the terms " Reason " and "Understanding" by advocates of the dialectic. The essential point, however, lies elsewhere. It must be recognised that, whatever distinctions may be discovered between mental phenomena, the distinction between "Reason " and " Understanding," as used by the dialectic, is really between two theories of Reality. The dialectic wishes to show that one of these theories is true, and to discredit the other. It seems to have been accepted, because of some misapprehension, that " Reason " is "higher" than the "Understanding": certain desires have then been supposed "demands" of "Reason"; finally, it seems to have been believed that, since " Reason ") is " higher " than " Understanding," the " demands " of " Reason" must be realised. It is useless, however, to urge in proof of the falsity of a certain theory that it is held by the " Understanding". It is even more: to introduce, as the dialectic does, the distinction between the " Reason " and the " Understanding," is to draw a red herring across the track. We repeat: the distinction is simply between two philosophical theories; and the sole question, provided they are both clearly stated, is: Which, if either, is true? The " backers " of a theory do not determine its truth. 22. We conclude that the distinction between the "Reason " and the " Understanding," as used by the dialectic, denotes merely a distinction between two philosophical theories. It should be remembered, also, that modern psychology admits no such distinction between mental phenomena. 23. If the preceding criticisms are sound the Hegelian dialectic, considered as a metaphysical argument, is invalid. The opposite conclusion has been, and is, upheld, by a considerable number of philosophers. It is difficult to under- stand that there could be such advocacy of the dialectic as there undoubtedly has been, and is, if the dialectic did not deal with facts. These facts, however, may not be those with which its advocates believe it to deal. Indeed, if our conclusions are valid, this must be the case. Consequently, the question very naturally arises: What are the facts with which the dialectic deals? 36</page><page sequence="17">538 BERNARD MUSCIO: 24. The dialectic appears to be an analysis of psychological phenomena only. It has been urged by others that the dialec- tic is " subjective ". It is not in general clear what this criti- cism means, and we shall not state our interpretation in that form. It is necessary to remark, however, that the various replies, by those who accept the dialectic, to criticisms against it on the score of its " subjectivity," seem to be little else than attempts to show that Hegel certainly meant the conclusions of the dialectic to be " objective," to apply to all Reality. But was this doubted by those who asserted that the dialectic is " subjective " ? Their point surely was that the facts, upon which the dialectic is based, do not allow of a valid inference to all reality; and this contention is not met, satisfactorily, by saying that Hegel believed otherwise. It can only be met satisfactorily by showing that the infer- ence is valid. It is doubtful, however, as a rule, just what are the facts with which the dialectic, according to those who criticise it as " subjective," is supposed to deal. The theory here put forward is that the dialectic is a treat- ment of the question of meaning, a question of the first im- portance in psychology, where it has received little attention, and of even greater importance in metaphysic. One of- the chief aims of thought is to discover the relations which hold between the entities, which, we believe, are the objects of our ideas. We are generally so busily engaged in the at- tempt to realise this aim, that we sometimes forget that we are usirng ideas, and tend to think that the ideas are the things. We fail, also, to recognise the manner in which meanings come to birth in our minds, and in what relations they stand to each other once they have made their - appear- ance. We have acquired the habit of thinking of ideas as though they possessed the rigidity of chunks of wood, or pieces of quartz. We do not recognise how perfectly fluid the world of ideas is. Yet here, if anywhere, is to be found the Heracleitean flux. The possibility of exact thought, de- pends upon the possibility of keeping ideas, or meanings, definite,-a task which is always difficult. Once we have " got " an idea, we are, curiously enough, inclined to think that it always was perfectly definite; that its edges are just as clear-cut and well-defined as are those of the entity to which it refers. Yet it is the most commonplace experience that, notwithstanding all our efforts, our ideas are constantly merging into one another. To-day we associate with a cer- tain symbol an idea which is different from the idea we as- sociated with it yesterday. Even in the one discourse as we speak, in the one paragraph as we write, we have to watch</page><page sequence="18">THE HEGELIAN DIALECTIC. 539 our meanings most carefully lest they change,-it may be ever so slightly, yet sufficiently to render our conclusions, invalid. All the emphasis which has been laid upon the importance of the middle term of the. syllogism is due to the tendency of meanings to pass, quietly and unostenta- tiously, into one another. Meanings are like gases: sometimes they mix without noticeable result, gliding imperceptibly into each other; sometimes they sparkle into vitality at the merest contact. Similarity between ideas renders them dangerous for thought. Differences are frequently unnoticed because of the fact that images are generally associated with ideas, and often mis- taken for them. The same image may be associated with several different ideas. We then tend to think the ideas identical. Again, different images may, on different occa- sions, be associated with the same idea. We then tend to think that we have had different ideas on the different occasions. It appears practically certain that the doctrine of the identity of the ideas of " Being " and of " Not-Being," for instance, has been due to a confusion between ideas and images. It was believed that the idea of " Being " (" Pure Being ") could have no definite image associated with it, for the reason that it was the idea of " Being-apart-from-all- determinateness," while the association with it of a definite image seemed to make it the idea of " Being-Determinate ". It was believed that the idea of " Not-Being," also, could have no definite image associated with it: otherwise, it seemed to be the idea of " Something ". When, then, a philosopher thought the ideas of " Being " and of " Not- Being," he had in each case to repel any image which might be present, as having nothing to do with the idea. After this had been done, he curiously attempted to find the differ- ence between the two ideas in difference of images; and, as he found no difference here, he considered the ideas identical. Since, however, the words " Being " and " Not-Being " are formally contrary, he supposed that they indicated contrary entities. It seems never to have occurred to him that, if he used " Being" and " Not-Being " to indicate different entities, the ideas of "Being" and of "Not-Being" could not. be identical. The kind of result arising from similarity between ideas may be illustrated as follows. The idea of a man is distinct enough from the idea of a woman. But the idea of a man is more similar to the idea of a woman than it is to that of an ape. Suppose now that some person is interested in the</page><page sequence="19">540 BERNARD MUSCIO: Suffrage question, and desires to prove that some proposition is true of men, as opposed to women. He discusses the question, and as the discussion advances refers to earlier conditions of society.. The idea of evolution is thus suggested to him, and this, in its turn, suggests the idea of ah ape. He concludes by proving a proposition, which, to his amazement, is true of both men and women, as opposed to apes. But one of the most extraordinary things about ideas is their contrast effects. One meaning becomes more sig- nificant and definite, when brought into contact with its contrary. According to the old dictum, we know a given thing more fully, the better we know its opposite. In the opinion of Nietzsche, we can tell the truth only after we have learned how to lie. From this relation between ideas one is easily led to say that an idea " implies," or " involves," its contrary. This may, in a sense, be true. It may be the case that we would have no idea of virtue if we had no idea of vice. But this fact must not, so to speak, be objectified; we must not think that there would be nothing correspond- ing to the idea, which we now have, of virtue, if we did not have the idea, which we now have, of vice. The Hegelian dialectic appears to be a study of the way in which various meanings, generally regarded as primarily " logical," are connected in our minds. It shows how, begin- ning from the " simplest idea " which we possess, the idea of "Pure Being," we can pass, by gradual steps, by means of similarity and contrast, to the " highest " idea we possess., " the Absolute Idea ". The various stages in this process are, sometimes, contrary ideas, though, as we proceed to the " higher " " categories," the contrary character is not so marked. Here, in the language of the dialectic, one mean- ing " completes " the other. It is seen that one idea gradu- ally arises, and becomes definite, through a reciprocal backward and forward movement with another, and vice versa. Each adds to the other's significance, throws it into relief, and helps us to grasp it more securely. This process con- tinues until we reach " the Absolute Idea ". The Hegelian dialectic then, illegitimately, objectifies this mental process; but, so far as the dialectic is valid, it appears to be a descrip- tion of the psychological process only. 25. We may now briefly summarise our conclusions. We have maintained the three following propositions: (a) The contradictions upon which the Hegelian dialectic: relies for its commencement, and advance, do not occur; consequently, the dialectic process can never begin, and no theory of the Universe can be established by it.</page><page sequence="20">THE HEGELIAN DIALECTIC. 541 (b) The theory of the supremacy of the " Reason " to the "Understanding" appears to be rejected by modern psy- chology, and is, in any case, wholly irrelevant to the validity of the dialectic. (c) The dialectic, so far as it is valid, is simply a descrip- tion of certain psychological phenomena, namely, of the growth of meanings and the relations between them.</page></plain_text>
