<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews Bercovitch, Sacvan. The Puritan Origins of the American Self. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1976. Pp. 250. $15.00. When Tocqueville visited America in the 1830's, he noted an "irritable patriotism" among the inhabitants. He found that they were quick to defend the nation against even the most casual and benign criticism. He was especially impressed that the Americans would defend the very climate and soil of the country "as if they had concurred in producing them." The ordinary citizen, Tocqueville ob served, "looks upon the fortune of the public as his own." Americans "transfer the habits of their private vanity to their vanity as a nation." Tocqueville found this behavior unique and disturbing. "It is impos sible to conceive a more troublesome or more garrulous patriotism; it wearies even those who are disposed to respect it." This peculiar identification of individual and nation, of self and continent, of self and climate, that Tocqueville finds at the level of common everyday behavior, Bercovitch describes and explains at the level of highest intellectual achievement in America. Bercovitch shows that the Ameri can Puritans, the "nonseparating congregationalists," created from the resources of Renaissance ideas and abstractions an idea of the corporate self of America as a sacred entity, a self that totally transcended any individual self, a corporate identity that they called "New England" or "America." And he argues that Cotton Mather's Magnalia Christi Americana is one of the accomplishments of this vision. Bercovitch's focus is Mather's Magnalia, and, more particularly, the "Life of John Winthrop" as an epitome of Mather's biographical technique. But the study of Mather is a way of getting at this larger problem, the creation of an "American self," of America as a self. It is one of Bercovitch's main points that, whereas the spiritual autobiographies of the Refor mation "saints" emphasized the progress of the individual soul, in America this focus upon the individual soul was "inverted," and America itself was "personified" as an individual soul, and the em phasis of spiritual autobiography or biography served to chart the progress of a sacred nation, the nation as a saint. The American Puri tans did not really focus upon the individual saint; they applied all of the notions of personal conversion of the individual to the communal enterprise of America. What Bercovitch shows is that the Puritans had need of a distinction between an authentic and an inauthentic self, between a transcendental and an historical self. But the American Puritans characteristically identified the authentic or eternal self (their "christic" identity) with the American continent itself, thereby changing American geography into what Mather called "Christiano graphy." Thus, according to Bercovitch, Mather's series of biographies and biographical groupings "demarcate the successive acts in the drama of the corporate American pilgrim." And since, as Mather says, "the SiR, 15 (Fall 1976) 623</page><page sequence="2">624 BOOK REVIEWS further the grace of God is continued among us . . . the greater effects of that grace will be still appearing," there is the added promise to the future that comes from the success of a documented on-going venture. "What will be is present in what has been." Thus, for Bercovitch, the Magnalia "not only signifies but embodies and vouchsafes the national telos." Tocqueville thought that democratic institutions allowed for an easy identification of the individual and the nation. Bercovitch thinks that the early Americans created a corporate identity in an attempt to efface or regiment the individual self. He keeps referring to this crea tion of the corporate self as a "mode of regimentation" rather than as a certain kind of experience of the self. He tries to show that Mather is laboring to achieve reconciliations of contradictions arising out of the broad ideological confrontations of Catholic institutionalism, hu manistic individualism and Protestant eschatology, conflicts handed down to American Puritan intellectuals from the confusing trends of the Renaissance. And for Mather, as for John Cotton and John Winthrop, there are the more palpable contradictions of family and tribe, piety and politics, worldly hierarchy and spiritual democracy. Such contra dictions had to be overcome. As Levi-Strauss has demonstrated, the function of mythology (what Bercovitch tends to call "rhetoric," since he is dealing with Mather rather than with a medicine man) is pre cisely the reconciliation of contradictions that are irreconcilable. Mather is able to straddle in his biographical writings the paradoxes implicit in the Reformation experience in a manner like that of Gover nor Winthrop himself as presented to us by Edmund Morgan, except that, for Morgan, Winthrop's attempts at achieving the middle ground of compromise are always concrete political decisions, but, for Berco vitch, Mather's attempts are always abstract intellectual exercises that appear to have no echo in actual, lived experience. It would seem that Mather was content to allow all of his thought to flow into pure vision ary or imaginary vessels of a symbolic imagination. "Whether New England may live any where else or no, it must live in our History," that is, in the Magnalia, says Mather. For Bercovitch, Mather projects an America that is a pure "world elsewhere." And so Mather becomes a member, perhaps a forefather, "of that long procession of solitary keepers of the dream" of America, that imaginary land that is at once consummation and promise, synthesis and adventure. Of course, there is the possibility that Mather believed in the magical power of visionary projections to transform "reality." Along with other Puritans and later visionaries like Emerson or Whitman, he no doubt believed that the function of vision was to redeem history. And for Bercovitch, Mather may be absolved of the task of presenting a realistic, modern or secular history of New Eng land. "Mather set out, with the ambition of an epic bard, to leave to posterity an outline of the country's divine origins, a pantheon of its first fathers, a variety of heroes embodying its cultural norms, and an action appropriate to the cosmic scope of the venture." Bercovitch ex presses a quite legitimate admiration for the achievement and beauty of Mather's synthesis, for the richness of his mythic constructions.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 625 Bercovitch also offers us an acute sense of the modernity and sophistication of Mather's need for this synthesis in Mather's sense of isolation from the main stream of cultural development in New Eng land. Scholars have called the Magnalia a "monumental elegy to a defunct corporate ideal," but Mather anticipated such a reaction and tried to protect himself from criticism by belittling his project as merely personal. But his sense of the personal could also be ardently aggressive: "'Tis COTTON MATHER that has written all these things: Me, me." But what does such a statement mean? Bercovitch thinks that it is important for us to know that Mather thought of his vision as an "individual act," that he thought of himself as a lonely, isolated visionary who expected "nothing but scourges" for his labor. And, according to Bercovitch, Mather "earns his authority as com munal spokesman not by his relation to any existent community, but by personal assertion." But this is an exceedingly troublesome idea. What can it mean to belittle or deny Mather's relation "to any existent community"? Bercovitch appears to be offering us a contradiction that is his own and not necessarily Mather's. He seems to want us to believe that Mather's vision is derived from the New England Puritan's com munal need to find a mythical (or "rhetorical") means of social con trol, and yet that Mather's manipulation of that means is an act of "individual" will and vision, and he wants us further to believe that Mather could straddle such a contradiction and a goodly number of other contradictions without experiencing any of the "tensions" that other New England historians display. It is difficult to accept this Mather as a bland and isolated intellectual who, as Bercovitch has abundantly shown, lived in the midst of the ideological conflicts set loose in the transformation of the Medieval into the Modern world. Moreover, since Bercovitch does not offer us any sense of Mather's actual historical situation, it ought to be more difficult for him to imply that Mather is alienated from his culture. Mather's sheer "per sonal assertion" is just too abstract an idea to be believable. We could accept such an idea more easily if we had some sense of Mather's rela tions to a concrete New England culture, but we will not find it in Bercovitch, nor, for that matter, in Robert Middlekauff's recent study of the Mathers. Despite the considerable work that has been done in the past couple of decades in colonial social history, we do not really have as yet a serious attempt to place the colonial culture within the context of social history that is being revealed to us. One of the limita tions, or I should say frustrations, of this impressive book is the way it treats only the contradictions of thought abstracted from historical ex perience. When Bercovitch announces that "I have centered my analy sis on the interaction of language, myth, and society," we can regret the fact that the only society he refers to is the society of the myth that is the focus of the book, the myth of society. He refers to the Levi Strauss notion that myth "is a form of history of a higher power than itself." But one of the critical tenets of Levi-Strauss has been that the significance of myth can be understood only in the concrete ethno graphical context. Despite Bercovitch's disclaimers, he has a tendency to see this mythic America as a kind of Jungian archetype. In the last</page><page sequence="4">626 BOOK REVIEWS chapter of the book, a study of the continuation of the "myth of America" into the nineteenth-century, Bercovitch tries to anticipate the objections of his readers by saying that he is not speaking of some "amorphous American Spirit hovering ubiquitous in the New World air, like the white-hooded phantom of Moby-Dick." But in his refusal to place the mythology in a context of social praxis, he is always run ning a serious risk of being misunderstood and of not understanding the mythology itself. Just as the Puritan ministers warned their con gregations "that Christ was never got by a wet finger, by the mere reading of scripture," so we can admonish Bercovitch that the signifi cance of ideas is not got simply by analyzing the inherent contradictions of thought. Yet, Professor Bercovitch's book is a provocative and very rich study of the origins of "a genuinely distinctive mythical mode" of the American imagination. From the Puritans who "gave America the status of visible sainthood," we get, Bercovitch asserts, "our eschato logical anthropomorphism of spiritual biography: American dream, manifest destiny, redeemer nation, and, fundamentally, the American self as representative of universal rebirth." That is, from the intellectual background that Mather synthesizes, we have derived a basic part of the folklore of everyday life in America. Such a statement is impressive enough, I think. But the book seems to me most exciting and impres sive in its suggestion that a mythology of individualism is not really native to America, that we developed instead a mythology for the effacement of the individual. Tocqueville never saw any relationship between the American kind of patriotism that he thought was so irritable and the phenomenon of individualism that he identified as the key to American behavior. If Americans were capable of over coming the social disintegration implicit, as he thought, in individual ism, it was because they entered into a multiplicity of voluntary associations, as if they had an instinctive fear of individualism. What Bercovitch has shown, however, is that the American Puritan developed a powerful mythology of anti-individualism, a rhetoric of social regi mentation that is truly unique and American, even while it was nur tured by Renaissance intellectual developments. The non-separating congregationalist in America "considered his social commitment cru cial to his selfhood as Christian," and this commitment to society "made visible his sainthood, his allegiance to the Reformation, and his historic destiny." The one thing that Anne Hutchinson and other antinomians discovered was that the New England Way did not allow for a Paradise Within. The only paradise that was possible was the political and social experiment going on, the one called "America." What Bercovitch is demonstrating is that, if Protestantism loosed upon the modern world a type of individualism, the self as sole authority in the place of the traditional authorities, and thus the possibilities of social anarchy, so too it built a structure of self control, a regimentation of the freed self within the very movement of visionary or intellectual reflection. What one hears behind Bercovitch's study is the rumble of a transvaluation of values and the creation of an ideological tribalism that would replace the organic tribalism or organic social bonds that</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 627 Tocqueville or Burke saw breaking up in the modern world. Moreover, what Bercovitch can present to us with his abstract focus is the extraordinary survival of the Puritan syntheses in generation after generation, in century after century, in what we normally take to be a "particularly discontinuous culture." The dream of what Walt Whit man called a "moral continent" had its origins in the Puritan ideas that are at the center of this book. Strong echoes of this visionary mode can be heard in twentieth-century America, in T. S. Eliot's various lands, in Hart Crane's or William Carlos Williams's or Charles Olson's visionary continents with their respective representative heroes. But these twentieth-century versions are echoes of nineteenth-century pro jections of a visionary America that we find in Cooper, Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne, Melville and Whitman. What Bercovitch is claiming is that Cotton Mather's Magnalia Christi Americana is one of the great forerunners and accomplishments of this vision. We shall have to congratulate Bercovitch for adding an important new link to the intellectual genealogy that perhaps we had previously supposed extends from Jonathan Edwards to Emerson. We shall now have to speak of a line that runs from Mather to Edwards to Emerson and beyond. Richard Hutson University of California, Berkeley</page></plain_text>
