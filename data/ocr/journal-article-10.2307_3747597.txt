<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE AESTHETIC AND SCIENCE JOSHUA C. GREGORY WHEN a rainbow spans the sky the eye may rest with simple rapture on the arch of colours, or the mind may interpret it as an interplay between raindrops and light. This perceptibly separates the aesthetic relish of the colours from the scientific understanding of the bow. Archbishop Temple distinguished the restfulness of art from the restlessness of science. This applies to the wider aesthetic which includes natural products, such as snow-scenes or daffodils or rain- bows, with the pictures, statues, buildings, poems, and other products of man-made art. The rainbow clearly separates the understanding sought by science from the immediate contemplative aesthetic satis- faction with the colours. Music, Temple also notes, presents beauty, not truths. The profane parrot who lived in a gilded cage isolates another purely aesthetic aspect of experience. Every Sunday at one o'clock, when the clergy- man came to dinner, a cloth over polly's cage, to dam the flow of damns, accustomed the bird to a weekly covering. One Monday the clergyman arrived unexpectedly at lunch time. As hurrying feet and anxious hands covered polly's cage the bird loudly remarked, "Well! Well! That's a damned short week!" The revel in the ludicrous of the parrot story resembles the aesthetic preoccupation with the rainbow's colours or the beauty of music. The enigmatical, wholly indefinable, unmistakable, familiar, and absolutely unique sense of the ludicrous is also too unlike delight in colour, or in the beauty of music, or in any artistic gratification, to be unhesitatingly called aesthetic. The relaxed comic, also, seems to differ from the contem- plative aesthetic: the relaxation seems to be opposed to the dynamic and intense which have so often been noted in the sense of beauty. If art is restful, as Temple said, then, adapting Walter Hylton, the restfulness is "a busy rest." Lipps and Groos deny that the comic is an aesthetic experience; Lascelles Abercrombie affirms that it is, and the comic is usually included in the aesthetic. Cassirer affirms that "comic art" has "in the highest degree" the "sympathetic vision" of "all art." Whether the parrot story has this high sympathetic vision or not, it does what the rainbow does-isolates a purely aesthetic aspect of experience. The ludicrous, at one point, samples the pervasion of experience by this aesthetic aspect. The wholly comic is as indifferent to truth or error, or to the understanding of things, as the number five seems to be indifferent to space or time. A purely geometrical pattern of colour may be simply beautiful without any relevance to truth or understanding. 239</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPHY The rainbow colours, the wholly ludicrous, the musical harmony, and the geometrical pattern, by isolating the aesthetic aspect, help the recognition of its pervasiveness in experience. The aesthetic appeal of astronomy seems to Sir James Jeans to tend to predominate over the scientific appeal, for the aesthetic side makes more men into astronomers than the scientific side does, and many astronomers, when made, are mainly interested in their science because it is "the most poetical and the most aesthetically gratifying of the sciences." The "sense for style" is an "aesthetic sense," as Whitehead says and most agree. Whitehead emphasizes the pervasiveness of aesthetic experience by recognizing style in science, logic, and practical execu- tion as well as in art and literature. The aesthetic aspect is very pervasive if Whitehead rightly calls style "the ultimate morality of the mind." In literary style the aesthetic aspect is intuitively dis- cerned in complex experience. The intuitive discernment of the aesthetic ranges widely-in the smooth working of a loom, for instance, or in the sweet cricket drive over the ropes. Such extensions of range trouble the assessors of the aesthetic in poetry and art. When Lascelles Abercrombie includes kissing a girl the "aesthetic" is uneasily suspected of being anything pleasant or, at any rate, delightfully pleasant. Bosanquet suspects some trace, at least, of the aesthetic in all pleasant feeling. Coleridge tries to preserve the dignity of the aesthetic by honouring beauty above the merely agreeable. If a Frenchman, he writes, called the flavour of mutton beautiful, he would be promptly recognized as a Frenchman. This implies that the flavour of mutton is not beautiful, and Coleridge can use his essential distinction between the agreeable and beauty to exclude the mutton. The grand concert of frogs delighted a Dutch gentleman, when he first heard it in England, more than Catalina singing in the compositions of Cimarosa delighted him. This Dutch gentleman, Coleridge says, was sensible, accom- plished, and quite aware that his feeling was ludicrous. The frogs' concert, the context implies, tempted the Dutchman to call it beautiful because it happened to be very agreeable to him. The aesthetic has a wide range if "an actual fact is a fact of aesthetic experience." It may be wise to be wary of taking White- head's statement too naively, for he thinks in his own way. An "intense experience," he also says, is "an aesthetic fact," but is this true of an arrow in the heel? The fatal wound of Achilles can be an aesthetic item in myth, and Bullough, more prudently, says that anything may be aesthetically contemplated. A. E. Taylor may be too sure that a bald fact, as such and irrespective of its quality, cannot be adored. The virtue may be in the "adored," but a simple fact, as such, apparently can have aesthetic quality. It has when 1IIo are paid for a Jubilee-issue postage stamp incorrectly printed 240</page><page sequence="3">THE AESTHETIC AND SCIENCE a greenish-blue. The disgusting snore, no doubt, must be contem- plated as the trumpet of sleep to make it at all aesthetically pleasing, but there seems to be good reason for any fact, simply as a fact, to have at least minor aesthetic quality, unless something swamps it. The mind searches vigilantly for the assured because thinking is mere vanity without a firm footing on facts. Thus, naturally enough, any assured, or apparently assured, fact, however trivial, may gratify ever vigilant curiosity aesthetically, however temporarily. Descriptions of the aesthetic, including the beautiful and the artistic, usually stress its pleasure or delight, and apply such words or phrases as appreciation, Bullough's "psychical distance," or T. S. Eliot's autotelic work of art. They significantly insist that the aesthetic is intuitive and contemplative. Temple calls the aesthetic experience purely mystical in its "direct and immediate apprehension of an absolutely satisfying object." The contemplation in the mental repose of art, he further says, though it is still, is also active- Hylton's "busy rest." Such descriptions are probably usually modelled on eminent appearances of the aesthetic in art or poetry, but they seem to apply, in appropriate degrees, to a whole range of aesthetic experience. They may seem too lyrical for the cricketer's drive, but even the direct feel of a perfectly timed, perfectly adjusted hit has something absolutely satisfying in it. The batsman, if only for one brief fleeting moment, lives in Paradise. If all experience is aesthetic, though the aesthetic judgment may be swamped, as Lascelles Abercrombie affirms, then the aesthetic aspect of experience includes kissing a girl, the smoothly working loom, the smack over the ropes, the frog's chorus and perhaps the slighted flavour of mutton. An aesthetic aspect does seem to pervade experience from the simple contemplation of a trivial actual fact to an eminency in Paradise Lost or in a Boticelli painting. The aesthetic, in this respect like pleasure, is always aesthetic, though it is very variously embodied with different degrees of honour. The red of a pillar-box has a sheer sensory core. Sophisticated per- ception contains more than this-that the red is red, for example. All perception has a cognitive aspect; it also has a reflectively recog- nizable aspect which is sheer sensory experience of colour. This colour can give aesthetic delight-it gives it in the coloured mag- nificence of the sunset. "There are three green things-meat, wine, and gold": the presumably honorific sense of "green" in this Arabic saying may derive, as Wallis Chapman suggests, from the sumptuous oasis in the arid desert. The associations of colours, deep seriousness with dark blue for instance, disturb the ascription of an immediate aesthetic response to the sunset colours as such. Volkelt's theory relegates colour to the pre-aesthetic. Coleridge ascribes the beauty of the sunset to the conjunction of colour with form and relation. D 241</page><page sequence="4">PHILOSOPHY This conjunction is present in the daffodil, or in the delicately-shaped shell, or in any aesthetically moving object. Every experience has its cognitive or intellectual aspect however the contemplative aesthetic dominates it. The delicate shell must be perceived to manifest its beauty, and all perception has its quota of cognition. The cognitive varies between maximum and minimum, as the aesthetic does, and the intellectual moves towards the maximum as questing science tries to understand. Listen to the harmonious music of nature, Aristide Maillol advises, but do not try to discover its causes, as you ought not to ask why an apple-tree produces apples. This is one mode of what Herbert Read calls "a specifically aesthetic attitude towards nature." Science turns from the gusto of the apple to the puzzle of its growth. Emile Male seems to have stimulated the recognition of the aesthetic prompting to science by his Religious Art in France in the Thirteenth Century-in 1913 Dora Nassey published a translation of the third edition. Thorndike, for example, includes the book in his reference, and Crowther specifically names Male when they discuss what Whitehead calls, in the same connection, "the Rise of Naturalism in the later Middle Ages . . ."-the rise of "naturalistic art." Sculptured plants and animals, lovingly delineated, reveal craftsmen who observe and artists who are naturalists, though the fauna includes fanciful chimeras. An architect's sketches of a lobster, or of two paroquets on a perch, manifest the same delight in direct accurate delineation. Thorndike notes the impetus to science, in Albertus Magnus for example, by the observant study of natural facts; Whitehead discerns "a final ingredient necessary for the rise of modern science" in the direct joyful apprehension of things. Later on, as Whitehead notes, Leonardo da Vinci carries the patient observation of the naturalistic artist into science. The aesthetically moving rainbow became a sign set in the sky; to-day it is an ordered interplay between raindrops and light. As questing science, intent on understanding, passes from aesthetic relish to ordered concepts, then to the contemplation of an ordered whole, of Coleridge's "multeity in unity," it achieves its own peculiar aesthetic gratification. This aesthetic aspect, as Croce says, appears when active understanding passes into contemplation, and every scientific work is also a work of art, for science and art meet on the aesthetic side. The aesthetic aspect passes from the sensory to the intellectual. The beautiful, Coleridge insists, because it does not originate in sensations, belongs to the intellect. According to White- head, "intellectual beauty," the "delicate adjustment of thought to thought," though it can be "hymned in terms relevant to sensible beauty," is "beautiful by stretch of metaphor." In either case the intellectual is recognized in the aesthetic aspect of experience. 242</page><page sequence="5">THE AESTHETIC AND SCIENCE Science has constantly affirmed its own artistic or aesthetic quality. T. H. Huxley glories in it. The infinitely diversified structures of animals and plants present a unity in their variety. When Huxley cites this harmonization of many different structures into a central law he calls the pleasure it excites "intensely real" and thoroughly aesthetic. One chief delight of pure science, Karl Pearson contends, is a "continual gratification of the aesthetic judgment." Jeans stresses the powerful aesthetic appeal of astronomy; "The harmony and simplicity of scientific law" seems to Eddington to appeal strongly to "aesthetic feeling"; Schr6dinger parallels the "aesthetic element" in "pure knowledge" with the "contemplation of a work of art." Some writers, exuberantly and perhaps indiscreetly, compare science to poetry and scientists to poets. The psychologist Spearman accepts the claim-science is becoming more truly poetic. Einstein's "cosmic religious feeling," the "rapturous amazement at the harmony of natural law," involves no "anthropomorphic conception of God," but it does reveal an incomparably great intelligence. This seems to be more than the self-sufficient aesthetic which, in itself, is indifferent to truth, or even to the moral. Einstein implies this xwhen he affirms that morality, unlike the "sense of universal causation," is too purely human to be divine. Science has been described as highly stylized art. The concepts of modern science, as in all systems, are imperfectly harmonized. There is ordered adjustment of concept to concept enough, in microscopic physics, for instance, to be im- pressively aesthetic; the maladjustment adds to this effect by pointing onwards, as the vista in a picture leads forward to infinity. The delightful aesthetic supplement becomes a logical embarrass- ment. Science, says Einstein, seeks for the simplest system, the system which contains the fewest possible mutually independent postulates or axioms. This, cries a critical chorus, is an aesthetic criterion, not a logical demand appropriate to science. The aesthetic may deflect logic, or delude understanding, if this is so. If aesthetic preference decided the presumed perfection of the circle, which pre- disposed astronomy to circular versions of the moving heavenly bodies, then one aesthetic motive powerfully determined astronomers from Aristotle to Kepler. The emotional recognitions of unity in a complex seem to Roger Fry to be too similar in art and science to be psychologically different. Einstein directs his own endeavours, he tells us, by the "conviction that existence should have a completely harmonious structure." The harmonious, the unified multiplicity, Coleridge's multeity in unity, appeals aesthetically. Newton's law of gravitation unifies the fall of an apple, the earth's orbital motion, and all other material motions under one principle. It may have delighted seventeenth- and 243</page><page sequence="6">PHILOSOPHY eighteenth-century minds because it made them understand, or because it gratified them aesthetically, or because it did both. The aesthetic may usurp intellectual understanding if successful ordering or harmonization of concepts persuasively simulates truth. This is the more likely if, as Roger Fry suspects, the unity-emotion in both art and science is identical in kind. Nature seemed to Newton to be "pleased with simplicity"; it now seems to many that it is the simplifying thinker who is pleased with his simplification. Nature still seems to Einstein to realize the "simplest conceivable mathematical ideas"-those embodied in the fewest possible independent postulates. Experience seems to him to justify this. According to a paper by the physicist Born, reasonably epitomized, nature compels the mind to simplify her; then the mind attributes the simplification to the nature simplified. Though "simple" may have no one simple meaning, it often denotes the unifying principle, as Nature is "very simple" for Newton when she moves all the heavenly bodies by "the Attraction of Gravity." It is natural enough to speak of the "beautifully simple," and, according to Sullivan, science still uses the aesthetic criterion, but calls it "simplicity." In so far as the simple is connected with the unified complex it has the aesthetic charm which may lure science to accept a simplification as logically complete. Science, according to Whitehead, must aim at the simplest ex- planation of complex facts; then she is apt, erroneously, to regard the facts themselves as simple. If the mind must simplify, and all simplification over-simplifies, as Whitehead also says, science is pre- determined by its nature to error. In "Seek simplicity, and distrust it" Whitehead urges the mind to do what it must do, and then to suspect what it has done. Simplification has its logical triumphs-it has one when it shortens "He is my baby's father's sister-in-law's husband" into "He is my brother-in-law." It also, if it has been assessed rightly, allures science aesthetically into error, and compels her to advance by retrieving her mistakes. "An Aristotle was but the rubbish of an Adam. ..." This aphorism may have consequences for the familiar "Beauty is truth, truth beauty," and through them for science, since it delights aesthetically in spite of its obsolete doctrine. It clearly separates the discredited truth aspect even as this is submerged in the dominating aesthetic aspect. Poetry does this still more effectively. In Rising and cawing at the gun's report, Sever themselves, and madly sweep the sky; Puck puts the flight of the wild geese from the "creeping fowler" into 244</page><page sequence="7">THE AESTHETIC AND SCIENCE what Whitehead calls a "poetic transcript," but poetry is not always a poetic transcript of the factual or true. Full fathom five thy father lies; Of his bones are coral made; Those are pearls that were his eyes: Nothing of him that doth fade, But doth suffer a sea-change Into something rich and strange. Coral is not bones, eyes never become pearls, and, though the rotting corpse is strange, it is not rich. Yet these scientifically out- rageous lines are poetry-Shakespearean poetry. Truth itself may satisfy aesthetically. Truth, also, need not be damaged when the entrancing aesthetic co-exists with the untrue. La Rochefoucauld's "True love, like the ghost, is much talked of but seldom seen" pleases aesthetically, but it need not deceive. Analogously, a generous act may be beautiful, and an ungenerous act need not be approved because it is aesthetically set. In the high aesthetic appeal of the Prodigal Son the ungenerous Elder Brother remains ungenerous still, as Iago is the villainous Iago through the drama and poetry of the play. From too much love of living From hope and fear set free, We thank with brief thanksgiving Whatever gods there be, That no life lives for ever, That dead men rise up never, That even the weariest river Winds somewhere safe to sea. Swinburne's lines are poetry, and C. D. Lewis knows they are, but for him their ostensible sense is untrue. Beauty, however, may still be truth, even when it seems to allure through the untrue, if poetry carries an intuition of truth beyond the confines of immediate fact. Lewis explains that the poetic meaning is not the apparent meaning, and cannot mislead. It shows something which could not be other- wise seen, which is not judged as ordinary truth is judged. The aesthetic or artistic aspect of science is probably often called "poetic" because it is more conceptual than sensory. If art is essen- tially a special insight into reality, and is real life "at a new power," as Lewis says, science, if it does become art or poetry, may be aiming at one kind of truth and getting another, or it may be getting two kinds at once. Also, as Crusoe looked for tobacco and found a Bible, so science may look for truth and find the aesthetic. This may be so if Whitehead says rightly that intellectual beauty "is independent of the mere blunt question of truth." If every scientific theory is pro- visional and eventually superseded, then scientific concepts may be 245</page><page sequence="8">PHILOSOPHY appropriately valued aesthetically as works of art. "The history of science," says Whitehead, "is strewn with the happy applications of discarded theories." Each theory, during its day, dispenses pragmatic benefits in utilities, such as the radio. The changing concepts them- selves may ultimately be classed as works of art and valued wholly aesthetically. If Swinburne intended an actual poetic transcript he took an aesthetic recompense from universal evanescence by expressing it in poetry, as Herrick takes his in Gather ye Rose-buds while ye may, Old Time is still a-flying: And this same flower that smiles to-day, To-morrow will be dying. There is aesthetic recompense again when the comic takes it in a joyful laugh from distress or danger or even from disaster. Science may take her aesthetic recompense for final failure to understand from the intellectual beauty of logically disposed concepts. Augustine Birrell compares the truth-hunter to the nympholept who glimpsed a spiritual inmate in the sylvan shades and chased her all his life-quite vainly. Science is not likely to abandon the chase, whatever aesthetic recompenses she may constantly secure from the changing kaleidoscope of concepts. The intuitive sense of beauty, Coleridge insists, excites pleasure, an immediate and absolute complacency, apart from any interest, or even contrary to it. The good, which is above beauty, and the agree- able, which is below it, are both interests, for they act on the will and prompt desire. In one place Coleridge includes utility among the interests, and with it, apparently inconsistently, beauty itself. He also recognizes "an Interest of Truth." Coleridge's statements imply that beauty can call to the soul when it co-exists with the untrue, but he would not agree with Whitehead that it is more important for a proposition to be interesting than to be true. Coleridge opposes "interest" to beauty; Whitehead transfers it from the true to the aesthetic. The principle may not apply to Bernard Shaw's "Every man over forty is a scoundrel" if it is merely a piece of facetious foolery without the "importance" proper to genuine "interest." The proposition, conspicuously in the effective aphorism, has aesthetic and conceptual aspects. On Whitehead's assessment the logician and the scientist wrongly make the conceptual aspect primary or more fundamental. At some point in Hamlet's "To be, or not to be" speech, Whitehead contends, aesthetic delight eclipses judgment. This might mean no more than an occasional swamping of truth by poetry, but Whitehead presses logic and science hard by affirming that judgment is a "very rare component" in realizing propositions. 246</page><page sequence="9">THE AESTHETIC AND SCIENCE Stace actually makes "interestingness" the "ultimate value at which science and philosophy aim." The intellectual, a thought or concept or proposition or theory or universal, interests; pictures, statues, and sunsets are beautiful. Stace discards intellectual beauty for interestingness, which has the same relation to concepts as beauty has to precepts. Since truth is not a value at all, science is handed over bodily to the aesthetic, though Stace himself separates the interesting intellectual from the aesthetic beautiful. This termino- logical revision does not conceal the transference of the scientific appeal to the artistic or aesthetic from insight into truth. If there are three great values, Stace affirms, they are Goodness, Beauty, and Interestingness. Thus Euclid's proof of the famous Pythagorean theorem interests; so does a scientific theory nicely adjusted to facts. Whitehead expressly allows interest to contemplated truth. "Science and Art," he says, "are the consciously determined pursuit of Truth and of Beauty." Truth, however, is subordinate, for beauty, as the only self-justifying aim, is the wider and the more fundamental of the two. Truth need not be beautiful, it may be unseasonable, it may even be evil, and beauty can do without it. Whitehead, however, has no heart to treat truth too scurvily: it is an important promoter of beauty. Art aims at "Truthful Beauty," and it has some success if it achieves either Beauty or Truth. The aesthetic, however, pre- dominates, for Truth is merely trivial without Beauty, while without Truth Beauty only drops to a lower level, and Truth only "matters because of Beauty." This presentation of beauty and truth is applied mainly to art, but it implies that the aesthetic aspect is more significant than the truth aspect in science. Whitehead speaks of a revelation "as in a flash" of "intimate absolute Truth regarding the Nature of Things." This sug- gests an acme in truth rather than in beauty. It also suggests an analogue of the special insight into reality pleaded by Lewis. Since Whitehead calls this revelation "a curative function" of Art, science may not reach this great aesthetic height. Any tendency to exalt the aesthetic, such as seems to be visible in Whitehead, is intelligible enough, for the bliss of heaven appears to have a better earnest in the self-sufficient satisfaction of art or poetry than in the shifting concepts of metaphysics or science. The conviction that the gratifying aesthetic is supreme gratifies again. Whether this final gratification is aesthetic, or, in the wide sense, scientific, is easy to ask and hard to answer. 247</page></plain_text>
