Rowe ABSTRACT We have dated a sample of red paint taken near an anthropomorphic pictograph in Elk Creek Cave in the Pryor Mountains, Montana. The radiocarbon date obtained, 840?50 years BP, is in agreement with expectations based on archaeological inference. Keywords: AMS dating, pictographs, archaeometry. INTRODUCTION Throughout the world new direct dating meth ods are being used to date pictographs (van der Merwe, Sealey, and Yates 1987 in South Africa; Loyetal. 1990; McDonald etal. 1990; David 1992 in Australia; Russ et al. 1990; Farrell and Burton 1992; Geib and Fairley 1992; Russ, Hyman, and Rowe 1992; Chaffee, Hyman, and Rowe 1994; Chaffee et al. n.d. in the USA; Valladas, Cachier, and Arnold 1990; Valladas et al. 1992; Clottes, Courtin, and Valladas 1992 in France and Spain). All are dependent upon accelerator mass spec trometry (AMS) radiocarbon measurements. Ex cept for the occasional use of charcoal, paint pigments themselves are inorganic materials, pri marily iron and manganese oxides; without the addition of a binder/vehicle these materials may not adhere to rock surfaces. Although virtually nothing is known about paint mixtures used, it is believed the pigments were pulverized and mixed with other materials, some possibly containing carbon. Most pictograph dating methods currently in use rely on the presence of charcoal in the pigment for AMS radiocarbon determinations. Some char coal drawings may have been produced with a charred stick; others by pulverizing charcoal and mixing it with a binder/vehicle. In either case, a sample of this charcoal can be AMS dated (van der Merwe, Sealy, and Yates 1987; McDonald et al. 1990; Valladas, Cachier, and Arnold 1990; Clot tes, Courtin, and Valladas 1992; David 1992; Far rell and Burton 1992; Geib and Fairley 1992; Valladas et al. 1992; Chaffee et al. n.d.). This method of dating pictographs suffers from the well-known "old wood" problem (Schiffer 1986), i.e., the age of the charcoal is not necessar ily the age of the archaeological event to be dated, but is sometimes somewhat older. Although char coal was often used in European prehistoric rock paintings, it is apparently less common in Ameri can Indian rock paintings. In the absence of charcoal, it is possible to remove some of the organic material associated with the paint. In Australia, for example, partial plant fibers have been directly recovered from a pictograph (Cole and Watchman 1992). Their ori gin is problematical: they may be the product of mashing plants for their juice as a binder, or they may be part of the bmsh used to apply the paint. In either case, their age should relate closely to that of the pictograph itself. Our approach is different. We use a low-tem Scott D. Chaffee, Marian Hyman, and Marvin W.

This is both the main advantage of the technique as well as its significant disadvantage. The advantage is that it permits us to date pictographs presendy undatable by any other technique. Unlike all other accepted picto graph dating, we do not depend upon either char coal or other visible organic materials. We extract whatever organic material may be present in the paint (added as binder and/or vehicle) and thus do not know the material being dated, the disadvan tage. In the case of the Elk Creek Cave (24BH501) sample dated here, the pigment is inorganic iron oxide and so no other method is available to di rectly date the paint binder/vehicle. THE PICTOGRAPH SITE Elk Creek Cave in the Pryor Mountains of Montana (Fig. 1) was originally recorded in 1967, then revisited and test excavated in 1970 (Loen dorf 1967, 1974). The cave is located in a steep Figure 2. The "solidly shown rectangular" anthropomorphic pictograph in Elk Creek Cave. sided limestone canyon at the head of a small side drainage to Elk Creek, a tributary to Sage Creek. It measures slightly more than 30 m across its maximum dimension, penetrating into the rock about 6.5 m. The rock art in Elk Creek Cave includes both historic drawings and presumed nonhistoric paint ings. The historic art, executed in black paint, includes initials or brands, a Euroamerican style house and an airplane. Probably associated with these historic paintings, which may have been drawn using sheep branding paint, are evidence of a recent fire, wires hanging from the ceiling, tin cans and part of what appears to be sheep shears. The presumed nonhistoric paintings in the cave include a solidly painted anthropomorphic figure, 21.5 cm tall with a rectangular body (Fig. 2), and a nearby highly exfoliated painted area, without any decipherable form. Both are of similar colored red paint. The figure is a profile facing to its right (or to the left as the figure is viewed) with short horizontal feet that point toward its right. Its upraised arms are bent at the elbows, but neither displays a hand. The sample for dating was ob 196</page><page sequence="3">Scott D. Chaffee et al.

The painted limestone fragment was barely at tached to the wall by a thin hinge of rock that appeared ready to exfoliate in the near future. Since the human figure and this exfoliated painted area are the only red pictographs in the cave, we assume they are similar in age. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE A thin section was prepared from a portion of the red painted limestone fragment. Examination of the thin section revealed a single paint layer. Under an optical microscope, the surface of the sample appeared to be dirty. Therefore, we rinsed it with deionized water in an ultrasonic bath for 20 minutes. We then wrapped the sample loosely in aluminum foil and dried it in an oven at ~110?C. Upon reexamination, the sample looked clean un der the microscope and the red paint appeared slightly brighter. There also appeared to be a small amount of white accretion on top of the red paint in some areas which we left intact. This sample, 24BH501-1, was placed into the oxygen plasma system. The plasma chamber had been cleaned prior to sample loading following standard procedures which are described in detail elsewhere (Russ, Hyman, and Rowe 1992; Chaf fee, Hyman, and Rowe 1994). Two argon plasmas were performed after sample insertion; argon is a nonreactive gas and its plasma acts like an atomic sandblaster to dislodge adsorbed carbon dioxide. The last argon plasma process yielded 2.5 x 10"5 ton* carbon dioxide (0.064 micrograms carbon which corresponds to only -0.02% contamination for the sample dated here, thus a negligible effect). A vacuum integrity check (Fig. 3) indicated no problems; the plasma system pressure rose to only 1.3 x 10"* torr after 630 minutes. The 24BH501 -1 sample was then subjected to two oxygen plasma extractions (Table 1). The first oxygen plasma extraction, 24BH501-la, lastedfor two hours at 100 watts power and an oxygen pressure of 0.9 torr. This produced 110 millitorr carbon dioxide (0.28 milligram carbon) which was sealed in a collection tube and sent to the Univer sity of Arizona AMS for radiocarbon dating. A second oxygen plasma treatment was run for four hours but only produced 30 millitorr of carbon dioxide (0.08 milligrams carbon) which was judged as insufficient for dating purposes, and was not saved. Arizona assigned the code number AA 8843 to the 24BH501-la carbon dioxide sample. The Elk Creek Cave sample was removed from the plasma chamber after the oxygen plasmas were completed. We observed no apparent change in the 197</page><page sequence="4">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Vol. 39, No. 148,1994 Table 1.

A sample of unpainted limestone, 24BH501 2, which was obtained from the same area of Elk Creek Cave as the painted sample, was also proc essed as an experimental blank. This is done to ensure that the limestone rock itself does not con tain a significant amount of carbon which would influence the radiocarbon age of the paint. The background rock was found to be only about 1% of the sample that was dated. That amount of background contamination of the date would shift it only 9 years toward a more recent date if the contamination were assumed to be of modern at mospheric carbon or 80 years more ancient if the contamination were dead carbon RESULTS The University of Arizona AMS facility re ported the radiocarbon age 840?50 BP (AA-8843) for 24BH501-la. The age reported here is for the painted area on the wall which had no recognizable form and not for the adjacent painted anthropo morphic figure. We assume that the two regions of paint are of similar age. Arizona did not measure the 513C value for this sample, but assumed a value of -2596a This could cause an additional error in the age; a l%o deviation in the 813C value from -25%o produces a 16 year deviation in the radio 13 carbon age. Most of the measured 8 C values for pictograph paint samples from our laboratory clus ter between -21 and -26%a Thus if the 513C were -21%a the error due to uncertainty in the 513C value would be to shift the age more recent by 64 years; if -26%o, it would shift the age to 16 years more ancient. Thus the propogated uncertainty found by combining the AMS uncertainty and that from the lack of a measured 513C value is a = V502 + 162 = +52 years and - a = V502 + 642 = -81 years, respectively. An additional source of error is intro duced by the background carbon in the rock. The 0.003 milligram background carbon measured (Table 1) represents close to 1% contamination of the carbon extracted from the sample. The shift in the measured age from the value with no contam ination can be calculated by rearrangement of equations 10 and 12 in Mook and Waterbolk (1985:27). Age shift = AT = Tm + 8033 In ^" "/^ lUU \ i ?

In terms of the meas ured age only, (l00e(-Tn/8033)Uxao iT=T*+8033 4 looa-i Thus 1% modern atmospheric carbon contamina tion would shift the date only 9 years more recent, or 80 years more ancient if the contamination were dead carbon Combination of all known sources of uncertainty yield a = V502 = 162 = 802 = +96 years and _ a = V502 = 642 = 92 = -82 years. Therefore our best estimate of the age and its uncertainty is 840 +967-82 BP. 198</page><page sequence="5">Scott D. Chaffee et al. Dating a Pryor Mountain Pictograph DISCUSSION Pictographs are fairly common in the caves along Sage Creek reported by Nelson (1942). These have been revisited and assigned numbers by Stuart Conner. The most prominent of these caves is Teton Jack Cave, 24BH411, which has a single painting of a black buffalo on its back wall (Nelson 1942:264; Conner and Conner 1971:24). Another conspicuous cave is Lufkin's Cave, 24BH413; it contains a faint series of vertical and horizontal lines painted in red that cross each other in a geometric pattern. Site 24BH422, another rock shelter investigated by Nelson, has six thin-line pictographs of shield-bearing warriors and V necked humans, applied in black paint with a rigid applicator. A final site where Nelson noted pictographs is 24BH416, a rock shelter that contains five or six dim, but still visible, horizontal series of short vertical lines painted in red. Amidst these series there is a vertical line with three or four short horizontal lines bisecting it. Other lines in red, a lazy E and a vertical line with short horizontal lines attached to its sides, are visible in the cave. Nelson noted a stylized human figure and a turtle, but although a stick-like figure may be the human, the turtle is no longer visible. The turtle was painted in black and recent use of the cave has introduced smoke to the walls which may have obscured it. Another nearby site found by Conner, but not noted by Nelson, is the Sobia site, 24BH420. The site exhibits faint red pictographs that are mainly short horizontal lines crossing short vertical lines. The horizontal lines decrease in length toward the top of the design giving them a plant-like appear ance. One fairly clear pictograph is a short vertical line with a solid painted circle attached to its top. The anthropomorphic figure in Elk Creek Cave is within a group of rock art human forms known as "solidly shown rectangular people" (SSR) to distinguish them from other stick human figures (Conner and Conner 1971:19). SSR hu mans display the following attributes: (1) round heads attached to short necks; (2) heads usually devoid of decoration; (3) arms in various positions, but often with elbows that are bent; (4) seldom any hands or fingers; (5) bodies solidly made such that they appear to be wearing a full length garment; (6) short horizontal feet that usually point in one direction; and (7) they are often phallic. In addition to Elk Creek Cave, Conner and Conner (1971:19) list Atherton Canyon, Robison Rock Shelter, and Lookout Cave as other sites with SSR figures. These sites are in Montana but none is near the Pryor Mountains. The figures most like the SSR pictographs are pecked petroglyph humans at Petroglyph Canyon, 24CB602, located in Carbon County, a few kilo meters west of Elk Creek Cave (Loendorf 1984). Other better defined and recognized rock art types, such as the shield bearing warrior or V-necked humans are made as both pictographs and petro glyphs in Montana and Wyoming. Thus, compar ing the SSR painted figures with similar petroglyphs is valid from a formal position. The majority of the petroglyphs at Petroglyph Canyon were made by removing all the interior of each petroglyph, as opposed to simply pecking away an outline of each figure. The characteristic is used as a defining criteria in establishing a type of petroglyphs known as the en toto pecked style (Loendorf and Porsche 1985), which is dominated by depictions of humans shown in full view. Both males and females are shown and some figures display head attachments that may represent feath ers, while others hold what appear to be bows. Test excavations into soil deposits at the base of the rock art panels at Petroglyph Canyon pro duced carbon samples from stratified layers that were dated at 1270?125 BP and 850?50 BP. Al though there is no absolute association between these dated cultural levels and the petroglyphs, the ages have been tentatively used to establish the relative age of the en toto pecked style petroglyphs (Loendorf and Porsche 1985; Loendorf 1988:11 12). Petroglyphs in this style are thought to be part of a continuous tradition that lasted through at least four centuries. Further, it was suggested that the human forms were more elaborate in earlier phases, losing attributes such as hands and fingers through time (Loendorf 1984:68-74). Four of the human figures at Petroglyph Can yon have been dated by direct AMS and cation-ra tio dating methods (Loendorf et al. 1991; Francis 199</page><page sequence="6">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Vol. 39, No. 148,1994 et al. 1993). The numerical ages for these human figures range from 1375?94 BP to 1125?87 BP. The ages are in agreement with the lower cultural level at the site. None of the human figures without hands and fingers, thought to be near the end of the tradition, was among those dated, but there is no reason to suspect they would not date to a time more recent than the other dated figures. The av erage age of the four dated human figures is 1278 BP, within the range of the oldest radiocarbon date from the excavated deposits at the site, and the human figures without hands and fingers are most likely associated with the 850 BP date, as origi nally assumed. Returning to Elk Creek Cave, the age of 840?50 BP obtained for a solidly shown rectangu lar person without hands or fingers is what one would predict by comparing it to petroglyphs of known age in nearby sites.
