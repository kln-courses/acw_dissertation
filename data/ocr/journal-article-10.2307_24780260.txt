<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Fallen and Evolving Worlds of 2001 TERRY OTTEN When Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey premiered in April 1968, it enjoyed not only the expected folderol of Hollywood "hyp" and a popularity virtually guaranteed any such foray into pop culture; the movie also garnered even scholarly interest. Though rather generously panned by some early critics, it earned the praise of most and the interest of all. Indeed, it was the topic of the first issue of a new scholarly journal, Hartford Studies in Literature, and generated a lively debate that extended into academe. Not surprisingly, publishers rushed into print source material on the making of the film and its forebears in serious literature. All the artistic and intellectual pretense aside, the movie has secured a place in the history of film, however enigmatic its script and however dependent on the pyrotechnics of its form. Soon after the film appeared, Arthur C. Clarke published the novel based on the script, which was itself inspired by his short story "The Sentinel." Written concurrently with the script, it likely owes its popularity more to the movie than to its own merits, for it provided for many viewers at least a partial explanation of the more baffling moments in the film. If not as firm in its control or characterization as the earlier Childhood's End, which Clarke published in 1948, his 2001 offers more than a gloss on the film, despite occasional lapses in language and some rather serious structural flaws. The book has inevitably borne the criticism sometimes directed at the film, which of course one must discuss in conjunction with it. For example, Mosaic XIII/3-4 0027-1276/80/010041-10S01.50 0 Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">42 Terry Otten at times the dialogue seems stiff to the point of embarrassment. If we ignore for the moment the grunting of the apes in the "Primeval Night" section and consider the larger second part called "TMA-1" (Tycho-Magnetic-Anomaly 1, the monolith newly uncovered on the moon), we can certainly find the problem. All conversations are reduced to utter banality or impossible technological jargon: Heywood Floyd's brief exchanges with the smiling stewardess Miss Simmons, his protracted discussion with his Russian col league Dimitri Moisevitch and others at the moon base lounge, and his completely uninspired briefing of the American contingent stationed at the base. Language is conveyed by computer, silenced on two-dimensional "news pads," and stripped of all emotion. In the film Kubrick accentuates the deficiency of oral language by using inordinately long pauses and con centrating visually on non-aural communication (for example, centering attention on the written instructions for using a toilet in zero gravity) or pseudo-oral communication (as when Floyd has to talk into a computer for voice identification). In perhaps the most obvious failure of dialogue, Floyd tries hopelessly to engage his inattentive daughter in a few moments of conversation to wish her happy birthday (Frank Poole receives a similarly inept birthday greeting in the next section of the narrative). In fact, Kubrick has admitted, "I tried to work things out so that nothing important was said in the dialogue."1 To the degree that he imitates this intent in the novel, Clarke is innocent of literary offense; for surely a major theme in both the movie and the book is the human isolation of characters from each other. The charge directed at Kubrick and Clarke that they are more enamored of technological gimmickry than of human beings deserves significant qualifi cation, for we are not in an intended Utopia in 2001. The failure of language reflects in large measure an intense spiritual stasis that the Odyssey into space challenges. Given the accusation that the language is deficient in the novel and film, we might expect the concomitant claim that the characterization is poor. To some, HAL, the 9000 computer, or even the apes in "Primeval Night" ("The Dawn of Man" in the film) are more vital human beings than any of the men in the story. It is a criticism that Keir Dullea, the actor who played Dave Bowman, freely accepts: "To play a 21st-century astronaut, I tried to show him as a man without emotional highs or lows—an intelligent, highly trained man, lonely and alienated, not too imaginative" (Agel, p. 313). Here again, we must grant Kubrick and Clarke their givens. To some degree they intended to create automatons—hence Kubrick's visual emphasis on space suits, his symbolic use of the "Hiberculum" and his ironic humanization of HAL (male voice, female nipple, enlarged brain). The most telling criticism concerns structure and meaning. Even if fasci nated. most movie-goers likely could not figura nut the opening "Dawn «f Man" sequence or, especially, the end of the film. The novel seemed to resolve some of the difficulties but by no means all. Clarke himself consid ered revising his own work soon after publication because of possible</page><page sequence="3">2001 : Fallen, Evolving Worlds 43 confusion about the Star-Child's motives in setting off the nuclear bombs surrounding Earth ( Agel, p. 256). Nor has the novel satisfied many viewers or readers in its account of Bowman's apparent metamorphosis. They still wonder what it all means and what it has to do with the opening moments telescoping the evolution of ape into man. We still seem to have three, perhaps four, loosely connected narratives, and we lack even a hero who can incorporate the separate parts of the whole. Even granting the episodic nature of the epic form which the title invokes, critics rightly argue the need for focus. In fact, 2001 possesses both a hero and a basic unity, however slight the transitions between parts. Alan Brody, writing exclusively about the movie, accurately identifies "human consciousness" as its hero and the fortunate fall as its integrating theme.2 Clarke himself once remarked that "M-G-M doesn't know it yet, but they've footed the bill for the first $10,500,000.00 religious film (Agel, p. 10)."3 His book version makes this clear, despite Clarke's own insistence on being called an atheist and the intense seculariza tion of the myth. Joseph Gelmis could not speak with more veracity than in concluding that the film "owes more to the mystical vision of Jung and William Blake than to H. G. Wells or Jules Verne."4 It is an irony of fate that Clarke has long lived in Ceylon near the site of Adam's Peak, where accord ing to Muslim legend Adam settled with Eve and propagated the human race after their expulsion from the Garden of Eden. In their modern Odyssey, he and Kubrick depict the essential Romantic version of the fall of man, in which man's disobedience is "the necessary first step upon the educational journey by which thinking and striving man wins his way back toward a lost integrity, along a road that looks like a reversion but is in fact a progression."5 As Brody aptly points out, the action involves three separate falls, each of which marks a stage in the evolution toward a higher innocence. The pattern inverts the strictly orthodox interpretation of the myth, in that, in the conventional version, "the fall looks only back; i.e., man can only hope to return to a lost innocence." But in the Romantic reading of a fortunate fall, Joseph Mazzeo has said, man looks forward in the belief "that the acquisi tion of knowledge constitutes a hope for salvation, a journey into a better world and not a journey from a lost world."6 "It is dangerous to know," Rollo May writes in Love and Will, "but it is more dangerous not to know." In 2001, "knowing" is the means of becoming, whatever the risks. And the quest for knowledge repeats the most ancient of Biblical myths, even in the highly secularized world created by what Blake would label Urizenic gods, science and technology. Borrowing from the work of Louis Leakey, Clarke and Kubrick begin with the evolution of man from simple primate. If the arid landscape of Australopithecus africanus s world is in any sense Eden, it is so because the</page><page sequence="4">44 Terry Otten ancestors of man exist in profound self-ignorance, satisfied only because they are unaware of their potential for change and thereby content in their naiveté. Moon-Watcher, the central man-ape identified by name in the novel, "unmistakably held in his genes the promise of humanity,"7 but he lacked necessary self-knowledge. In theological terms he had not yet entered history because he had not yet gained the freedom to act: he owned no past and no future. He thought of his father, the Old One, as he thought of the rival tribe of apes at the water hole, solely in the context of the now. His father's death brings neither remorse nor relief. Into his world comes "New Rock," like the Tree in Eden an emblem of a deity. Instinctively, he attempts to eat it; but though he fails, the "Tree" initiates the movement toward self-knowledge (Kubrick uses the intense chanting of György Ligeti's score to underlie the religious drama). Clarke speaks of the transparency of the monolith wherein 'ill-defined phantoms moved across its surface and its depths" (p. 21). In its reflections of the apes, the Tree-monolith establishes a narcissistic truth. Seeing himself for the first time, as Adam and Eve become aware of their nakedness, Moon-Watcher sees a "new image" in his world. Driven to action by the signal transmitted by the slab, he hits the monolith with a rock and feels "indescribable pleasure, almost sexual in its intensity" (p. 23). Though as yet uninitiated into "experience," Moon-Watcher imi tates man's primal gesture of offense, dissatisfaction with paradise—"dis content had come into his soul, and he had taken one small step toward humanity" (p. 25). From such temptations comes a fall, and Clarke appropriately relates it to death, the first fruit of knowledge. Picking up a pointed stone, Moon Watcher discovers the first tool-weapon, and is about to become the first and only creature able to construct his own garden—to play god. With "a pleasing sense of power and authority" he kills a pig and enters wholeheartedly into the duality of good and evil. Now carnivorous, he has found a ready means of survival in a land of minimal vegetation, and yet' he has for the first time exercised a potentially self-destructive will to power. From this, other dualities emerge. In the climactic moment of this first ritual of a fall, Moon-Watcher takes us all the way to Genesis 4. A hunter and a killer, he slays his brother creature, thereby anticipating Bowman's murdering HAL in the later section of the novel. One-Ear, leader of the Others, a rival tribe of apes at the waterhole, bears the wrath of his brother Cain—"the frozen snarl of death came crashing down upon his uncomprehending head" (p. 34). Man has entered the world of experience, "acquired a past" and begun "to grope toward a future." Moon-Watcher turns knowledge into a weapon of self-destruction—good and evil cannot be kept forever in balance. As Brody tells us, death coexists with knowledge. The "first experience to liberate man's mind.. .comes as a direct result of an encounter with death (p. 10). The very weapon of destruction itself is the bone of a fellow creature. As in Eden, the first and ultimate consequence of the fall is mortality; but here death is a self-conscious act—not just dying but knowing one is dying, experiencing</page><page sequence="5">2001 : Fallen, Evolving Worlds 45 death as something other than a mundane event, a disappearing off the margin of existence as the Old One does at the beginning of the novel. The duality Clarke tells us about, Kubrick records in one of the greatest film dissolves ever done. The sequence begins with an ape-man in childlike innocence playfully striking the bones of a skeleton with another bone. Play becomes an exercise of power moving from wrist to arm and finally explod ing in Dionysian abandon when the wildly dancing ape shatters the skeleton with violent blows and flings his weapon gleefully into the air—the grace fully floating bone becomes a twenty-first century space ship (an image reinforced later when Discovery assumes the appearance of an elongated bone). The same powers of mind that can produce the spectacular techno logical advances of the space age can create the sophisticated weaponry to annihilate man. If Mark Twain was right in concluding that "our Heavenly Father invented man because he was disappointed in the monkey" ("Man is the Only Animal that Blushes"), then the creator repeated his mistake. The remaining portions of the novel reenact the same inevitable pattern of the fall at a higher level of consciousness. Brody calls the second fall an "even greater fall from innocence" than the first, "which will lead to a new and even greater discovery of self and an even greater fall" (p. 12). If the first fall develops incidentally from a childlike curiosity and playfulness, the second one assumes the nature of a quest. Having received radio signals from the "Tree" planted at the Tycho Post Maria crater, twenty-first-century man consciously wills "to gain a deity." But the quest is couched in irony; for like Adam, he can gain knowledge only at the cost of his garden—and his Eden is the deadly Utopia described in radical theology. Blake would call it "Ulro," a state of "rational self absorption" constructed by reason. Its inhabitants are the slaves of the spurious god Urizen ("Your reason")—Blake's "technicians," as Don Daniels notes, "with their 'golden moon, the quadrant, &amp; the rule &amp; balance.' "8 In the first portion of the action we follow Heywood Floyd to the moon. The dialogue, as we have noted, borders on the ludricrous. The synthetic environment seems a veritable parody of twenty-first-century bourgeoise culture. The rooms at Clavius Base even look "like a good motel suite" (Kubrick, of course, makes much of the Howard Johnson's sign prominently displayed in the lobby). In this totally artificial state grows the Tree of Knowledge for a second time, and it makes a mockery of man's limited knowledge and pseudo-existence. It challenges what Daniels rightly calls the "technological totalitarianism" which makes men "servants of scientific rationalism" (p. 2). The monolith, like the apple offered by the snake, piques man's curiosity by virtue of the same appeal, the will to power, "to become like one of us." Not insignificantly, in the encounter with the monolith, Floyd repeats Moon-Watcher's first gesture, the extended hand, the instinct to "touch." But, as Daniels points out, "the scientist reaches toward the slab with a hand insulated by his suit" (p. 5). The protective apparel of modern man must be stripped away in the confrontation with knowledge. "To</page><page sequence="6">46 Terry Otten know," man must be made aware of his vulnerability. The search for the source of the radio signal transmitted by the monolith produces such an action. Whereas the men-apes at the dawn of man lived on the brink of physical extinction in a desert wasteland, the spacemen on Discovery are imperiled by an even great extinction in a spiritual wasteland possessing all the deceptions of a Utopia. Discovery is nothing less than Eden in miniature, an image of twenty-first-century man in microcosm—and it carries with it all the spiritually debilitating force that Blake glimpsed in the Urizenic paradise of eighteenth-century scientific rationalism. The inclusion of HAL suggests another extension of the myth into Genesis 4, for HAL is the offspring of man. In Biblical language Adam "knew" Eve, and she bore Cain. As Gerhard von Rad notes, "to know" implies not just knowledge but experience,9 and truly HAL is as much a child of "ontology" as Cain. An android created by humanoids, he is born of and reflects twenty-first-century man's mechanistic existence, an echo of Blake's "shad owy hermaphrodite." Spuriously androgynous with his mellow masculine voice and maternal breast, he is a descendant image of Adam and Eve, and like his fallen creators he too has been assigned guardianship of paradise. The simulated life on board Discovery reflects the spiritual ennui the English Romantics found in the Biblical paradise in their conception of a fortunate fall. Here too man lacks freedom and beingness. Life itself is simulated in the "electronic sarcophagi" where three astronauts remain in hibernation. Life is reduced to biocensor panels where the EEG displays provide "the electronic signatures of three personalities that had once existed, and would one day exist again" (pp. 91-92). In this Urizenic garden knowledge is limited to maps and charts and geological surveys, language to "technish" or incredible banality, survival to the blibs and blinks of the "situation board." "Life functions" go on in a pretend existence—sex, exer cise, games, even culture are played out while passive humans drift in nothingness. The hopeless vacuity of their lives is characterized nowhere better than in the birthday greeting Frank Poole receives from "home": "Well, Frank, can't think of anything else to say at the moment..." (p. 119). Kubrick does not even allow Poole to get up from the exercise table to respond to the telescreen and has HAL position his body and head to receive the message. Frank makes no gesture of his own, shows no emotion. In the novel, Clarke observes that he "had moved into a new dimension of remote ness, and almost all emotional links had been stretched beyond the yield point." With no small irony, the moment ends with HAL's comment, "Sorry to interrupt the festivities...but we have a problem" (p. 120). The garden implies closure and, according to the second law of ther modynamics, closed systems entropy. The decadent Utopia can no more endure than the One World created by the Overlords in Clarke's fine novel</page><page sequence="7">2001: Fallen, Evolving Worlds 47 Childhood's End. Sooner or later the garden must suffer collapse. In a chapter aptly called "Need to Know," Clarke writes simply, "like his makers HAL had been created innocent; but, all too soon, a snake had entered his electronic Eden" (p. 148). As the protector of this doomed paradise HAL is both the agent of the gods and a brother to the astronauts. He suffers from the elemental disease of fallen man, a profound schizophrenia, a divided nature that compels him to sin against himself but reject his guilt. Pro grammed for perfection, he cannot tolerate the judgment of the gods at Mission Control who convict him of a fault. When he is charged by his twin computer of inaccurately predicting the failure of an AE-35 transmitting unit, he staunchly maintains his "innocence." In describing his fall, Clarke reveals HAL's limited humanity, for he shows us that the android cannot achieve total self-consciousness, that his evolutionary capabilities are finally confined to the Eden man creates for him. Whereas Bowman's human potential will allow him to move toward a higher innocence after the fall, HAL cannot commit a "saving sin" against himself. His "moral" absolutism reflects the Urizenic gods that made him. In the vein of a radical theology articulated in secular terms, Clarke blames the false deities (and their agents "the planners" with "their twin gods of Security and National Interest") for HAL's unresolvable dilemma—"the conflict between truth and the concealment of truth" (p. 149). HAL, pro grammed not to act in deception, must do so to conceal the knowledge he alone possesses about Discovery's true mission. A neurotic coerced to "sin" but unable to admit guilt without endangering his prescribed raison d'être, HAL instinctively reaches for fig leaves. "Without rancor—and without pity," he struggles to preserve the innocence-perfection upon which his beingness depends. Here Clarke differentiates between the android and the humanoid, for whereas HAL cannot gain the moral frèedom to choose by a fully conscious act, Bowman can. In Blakean terms, HAL is incapable of Higher Innocence simply because he cannot sin against the "moral" catego ries implanted in his being. He cannot run the risk of violating his prescribed mission. Bowman, however, can and must gain independence from the deified system that has constructed his mechanistic Eden. In his human ability to choose, he can assume control of the "life support system" while HAL remains the parasite of the system that judges him. To achieve his salvation, however ironic, Bowman must also fall—and by choice. In re sponse to the "warning bells sounded somewhere far down in the depths" of his consciousness, he must enact "the courage to be." The Romantics tended to see the fall recorded in Genesis 4, Cain's murder of Abel, as a consummate act of freedom and to make Cain something of a hero of the spirit along with Milton's Satan and Faust. As Eric Smith observes, to them "Cain, the direct heir to the Fall...is of more absorbing interest than are Adam and Eve."10 In Romantic versions of the myth, such as Byron's Cain, the rebellious brother, like the Prodigal Son, acts more courageously and acquires greater self-consciousness than his brother. Like</page><page sequence="8">48 Terry Otten the Romantic hero, Bowman achieves a moral superiority when he kills his brother HAL. Threatened with death when HAL releases the oxygen from the ship, Bowman barely manages to escape by putting on a space suit (in the film he is locked outside and forces entry in a near symbolic rape of the mother ship). Aware that his survival depends on wresting control of the ship from HAL, his obedient brother who follows the order of his god, Bowman performs a lobotomy by disconnecting the memory blocks in the computer's "brain." Until this point all of Bowman's actions have been purely emotionless and perfunctory. Now, he must literally commit murder, in a way imitate Moon Watcher's murder of One-Ear at the dawn of man—but with consciousness. Unlike his predecessor he feels remorse in his act. "This is harder than I expected," he admits (p. 156). His sorrow stems in part from his own fear of isolation and loneliness, the immediate fate of Cain in the Bible, and in part from his compassion for HAL. Clarke tells us that he pulled out the last memory unit when he "could bear no more" of HAL's pathetic return to infancy. In death HAL regains the innocence of childhood; Bowman moves through experience to the Blakean Higher Innocence associated with full self-consciousness. Until he commits his crime against the sterile perfection that has rendered him spiritually impotent, Bowman is literally the equal of HAL, essentially an advanced automaton devoid of beingness. When he slays his brother, therefore, he commits a form of suicide. And, in Tim Hunter's words, "in committing murder, Bowman has essentially lost his dehumanization and become an archetypal new being: one worthy of the transcendental transformation that follows."11 In a Tillichian sense, Bowman's fall moves him from essence to existence by thrusting him from a spiritual state of suspended animation. His fall is therefore an advance. He, like Adam, has been expelled from paradise; and, to quote Erich Fromm, he "is able to make his own history, to develop his own powers."12 The enigmatic end of the novel and film, when Bowman follows TMA-l's "big brother" through the Star Gate, portrays the ultimate evolution of man into "mind"—"and if there was anything beyond that, its name could only be God" (p. 174). For HAL the fall was unfortunate because he could not reconcile his opposites. Clarke tells us that soon after HAL's death a brother 9000 computer "had been driven into an identical psychosis, and was now under deep therapy" (p. 168). But having gained his autonomy by consciously murdering his brother, indeed an ironic mirror image of himself, Bowman penetrates the other side of the looking-glass. His internal journey is paradoxically a return to innocence and a progression. Falling through Star Gate, which is depicted in the movie as a spectacular psychedelic trip, Bowman passes "through a new order of creation" east of Eden. Here he becomes "like one of us." When the space pod lands in the</page><page sequence="9">2001: Fallen, Evolving Worlds 49 often discussed Louis XVI suite, as Brody points out, Bowman literally "overtakes himself in time" (p. il). In effect he returns to the dawn of man, "retrogressing down the corridors of time, being drained of knowledge and experience." Yet "nothing was being lost; all that he had been, at every moment of his life, was being transferred to safer keeping. Even as one David Bowman ceased to exist, another became immortal" (p. 216). From Genesis to Revelation, from fall to rebirth—transfigured from a puppet living within the constraints of a mechanistic garden into the Star Child transcending the dimensions of time and space, Bowman truly "gains a deity." He is an infinite version of the being Teilhard de Chardin describes "who is the object of his own reflection"—and "in consequence of that very doubling back upon himself becomes in a flash able to raise himself into a new sphere."13 Blake differentiates between the innocence of childhood, which is un earned and unconscious, and the Higher Innocence gained through experi ence when one chooses to act. Clarke's Star Child manifests that higher innocence when he wills to return to earth across "the great river of suns": "Unwittingly, he had crossed it once; now he must cross it again—this time, of his own volition. The thought filled him with a sudden, freezing terror..." (p. 218). If not a Christ assuming flesh, this new Adam "was back, precisely where he wished to be, in the space men called real" (p. 220). And like the Biblical agent of apocalypse, he brings judgment to the world. By detonating the ring of nuclear bombs surrounding Earth, he begins a first act of judgment and purification. Though Kubrick does not project it in the film, Clarke in effect shows him triggering another fall—as Camus concludes in The Plague, "for the bane and enlightening of men." A deity born of man's ever-evolving cycle of fall and rebirth, from the desert plain to the emptiness of space, he reenters human history. And, Christian imagery aside, we wonder with Y eats what it is that journeys "toward Bethlehem to be born." If "not quite sure what he would do next," like his ancestor Moon-Watcher, "he would think of something." NOTES 1/ See The Making of Kubrick's "2001," ed.
