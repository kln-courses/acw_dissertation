BACKGROUND When we discuss architecture, we make buildings the focus of our attention, but that is an unusual condition. The buildings that are involved with our daily lives are part of our system of habits, and we live our lives with them in the background, un- problematically, as unconscious of their role as we are of the air that we breathe or the time that is passing. In order to understand the re- lationship that we have with buildings, we need to take note of the way habits are formed, and how they become part of who we are. Walter Ben- jamin made this point, or something like it, in his essay on the work of art in the age of its tech- nological reproducibility, where he contrasts the person who concentrates on a work of art and is absorbed by it with the consumption of art by the "distracted masses" who "absorb the work of art into themselves."1 "This is most obvious," he says, "with regard to buildings."2 A tourist who is vis- iting a famous building for its aesthetic interest will give it concentrated attention and will take photographs of it to help preserve the memory of having been at the place, which will be experi- enced for only a brief interlude. If we are being invited to value a building's aesthetic qualities, then it is usually presented in order to appeal to such a view. Architecture books abound in fine photographs of buildings, nearly always without people in them, and we are invited visually to ap- praise the composition of form and void. This way of appreciating buildings has its roots in the art- world, where we expect to focus our attention on artworks and to derive some benefit by doing so. This approach has a very powerful appeal, and it is not to be wished away, but it is not the fo- cus of this article's attention. The alternative view in Benjamin's schema, which is explored here, is the way that we come to know the buildings with which we are very familiar, which is rather through habit than from focused visual attention. When we have made ourselves thoroughly habituated to something, through many repetitions, we can cease to be conscious of it and can perform rou- tine tasks without giving them much attention at all, even tasks of considerable complexity.3 In re- cent years there has been some attempt to broaden the range of sensory perceptions that inform a response to architecture, including discussion of buildings' acoustic effects or their appeal to the sense of touch, but such studies belong in the first category above, giving the building concentrated attention, tending to involve consideration of the building as an artwork, albeit an artwork that deals in a range of sensory experiences.4 However, for the buildings that we use every day, this mode of contemplation is unimportant. If everything is going well, we do not focus on the building but rather on what we are trying to do in it. This is the case even where the build- ing has a definite presence in the artworld: in its routine use, the building is more or less ignored, and what matters about it, for its inhabitants, is whether their life-habits are conveniently accom- modated. In this regard, the appropriate conceptual model for the building is not the artwork, but the tool, and the aesthetic appreciation of the building cannot be separated from what it does. This article argues for a pragmatist aesthetics of architecture, where the sense of the building-in- use is given weight and where an ethical aspect seems inescapable. This in no way undermines a "contemplative" appreciation of buildings, which here is characterized as the tourist's gaze; but if © 2011 The American Society for Aesthetics</page><page sequence="2">44 The Aesthetics of Architecture we want to understand how buildings come to be more closely implicated in people's lives and iden- tities, then we need to understand something of the bond that is established through habitual use. A pragmatist aesthetics can allow us to value the things about a building that matter to us when we are using the building and it is working well. The tourist's gaze removes such things from consider- ation, preferring visual spectacle, and it has domi- nated the way that architecture is presented. This article, by considering the idea of habit, taking cues from Samuel Butler and Eileen Gray, seeks to focus attention on the building as a support for life and to see that focus as a legitimate part of aesthetic analysis. II. DESIGN FOR LIFE Samuel Butler made "habit" the key principle in both his understanding of life and in his Lamarck- ian theory of evolution, set out in various works, including, most importantly, Life and Habit , where he uses the example of learning to play a tricky piece of music on the piano. We have to pick our way through it, hesitatingly and painstakingly at first, with many repetitions, until the sequence of notes is thoroughly ingrained and one can concen- trate on nuances of expression rather than track- ing down the next key. Butler uses this as a model for the many other habits we acquire and which we subsequently perform unconsciously.5 Each new piece demands this kind of attention, so that al- though we learn it as a habit, we remain aware of the process, whereas we can more or less for- get how we acquired a skill like writing, learned in childhood with laborious effort and much con- centration on the formation of letters and words. When we write as adults we form our letters un- consciously and think about the sense we are try- ing to convey with our writing, not about how to shape the individual letters. Butler's theory of evolution led him to believe that things we have done unconsciously all our lives (by instinct)- things like seeing, growing, or breathing- were once learned with difficulty, not by any recent rel- atives, but by very distant prehuman ancestors. Butler knew that this notion did not belong to sci- ence, and he explicitly repudiated that claim: it was, he said, an experiment in thought.6 The same could be said of his novels. Darwin's properly sci- entific idea of "natural selection" is the preferred model of the mechanism that is at work here. In evolution it is unlikely that the things learned by an organism can find their way into its DNA, but in an individual's life, habits that are firmly ac- quired remain in place as characteristic patterns of behavior and make possible uniquely intelligent and "human" activities, even the most advanced. Wordsworth said that "the child is father of the man," and in that unscientific sense we might be said to "evolve" from infant to adult, by way of a mechanism such as Butler describes.7 Perhaps his theory is best seen as a vast anthropomorphism, stretching back across millions of generations, that has some intuitive plausibility because it resonates with personal memories of earlier iterations of oneself. It is this "poetic" version of his theory that is helpful here, seeing the habits acquired in child- hood as producing the adolescent and the habits of youth as the means of producing the adult. Shake- speare crystallized the sequence into "seven ages of man," which could be redescribed here as seven "generations" of habits in the "evolution" from cradle to grave.8 What interests me in Butler's argument is how, along the way, he redraws the barriers between categories that would normally be kept distinct. The boundary between organic and inorganic en- tities is dissolved, as is the boundary that makes an individual's identity distinct from that of a pre- vious generation or from its surroundings. Every part of our bodies is composed of elements that can be analyzed as inorganic. We do not think of carbon as organic when we find it in diamonds, or calcium as organic when we find it in rocks, but we ingest carbon and calcium, iron and oxy- gen, and metabolize them. We inherit our instincts, and when we find ourselves in situations that our instincts recognize, they tell us what to do. We might recognize this at a conscious level when we sense danger and our adrenalin starts to raise our metabolic rate, but Butler suggests that there is a similar kind of ingrained "habit" at work at a molecular level, when the cells in an ovum find themselves in circumstances where they respond by developing into something that previously they were not.9 Somewhere in their evolution, mol- lusks appeared with the habit of building houses for themselves from minerals in their environ- ment, and the modern mollusk continues this prac- tice- instinctually, without conscious thought- this "intelligence" is distributed through the body at the cellular level in its DNA, so the building is</page><page sequence="3">Ballantyne Architecture , Life, and Habit 45 constructed from what is at hand, making a dwelling to shelter and protect the creature within and allowing it to lead its life. However it hap- pened, and however many millions of genera- tions ago, the mollusk's body began producing this hard shell by ingesting calcium carbonate and se- creting it with a changed crystalline structure as aragonite.10 The means of production are now so profoundly embodied in contemporary mollusks that, by this innate property, which one could call an unconscious instinct or (as Butler did) a "habit," they produce these houses. "Habits" and "instincts" shape all animals at a biological level and make possible the activities characteristic of every species. III. SHELL VERSUS MACHINE At a level much closer to commonsense intuition we can find the Irish designer and architect Eileen Gray thinking about her furniture along similar lines. She had a problematic involvement with Le Corbusier, who was fascinated by the house that Gray designed and had built at Roquebrune, on the shore of the Mediterranean. Gray's lover, Jean Badovici, an art dealer who also edited the journal L'Architecture vivante , encouraged Le Corbusier to paint murals in the house, which he did. Gray found them overassertive, upsetting the harmo- nious balance of the interior, and this judgment reflects their different approaches to architecture. She explained that her conception of the house was entirely different from Le Corbusier's. For him the dwelling was a " machine à habiter ," which led him to look for ways to make houses take on the qualities of mechanical structures- airplanes, grain silos, ocean liners, and suchlike.11 Gray re- pudiated the idea: "A house is not a machine à habiter. It is man's shell, his continuation, his spreading out, his spiritual emanation. Not only its sculptural harmony, but its whole organization, every aspect of the whole work combined, come together to make it human in the most profound sense."12 In Butler's conception of the organism, there is a more developed sense of these ideas, but it comes with problems, for example, because it is difficult to imagine the volition that sets the pro- cess in motion. Gray's conception of the house is identical but without the evolution. There is the same sense of a blurring of the boundary of the individual, which takes in the surroundings and the way of life, and the same sense of the unself- conscious habits of life being reified into spatial configurations, items of furniture, and enclosed volumes of building. These arrangements antic- ipate a certain range of habits, accommodating some of them closely and directly, others more flexibly. For example, the main space of the house at Roquebrune has basically a linear configura- tion, with one side facing the sea, and that side is glazed and has a terrace along it, while the other side is closed. It seems to be a sensible way to orga- nize the house, and one needs to restore a histori- cal perspective in order to sense how remarkably direct and clear-sighted an approach this was when it was adopted in the late 1920s- in the immediate wake of Le Corbusier's Pavillon de l'Esprit Nou- veau and his white cubic villas. Gray prioritized the habits of living that she wanted her house to promote, but paid little heed to the habits of de- signing and building that would have been known to the local craftsmen. It is remarkably unclut- tered by the conventional trappings of domestic- ity of the time and of her background, which was aristocratic. It is an expression of freedom, mak- ing a shelter that enabled a comfortable life beside the sea, but with the building making a minimal support for that life, not in the least taking on the qualities of a monument or a sculpture. Going back to the idea of designing around habits: it is clear that Le Corbusier's machine à habiter , insofar as it was being considered as a machine for producing the conditions for life, was actually quite compatible with Gray's ideas. Their differences lay in what they saw as appropriate in the expression of what was happening in the house or, rather, which aspect of the house each thought should count as "architecture." IV. ORGANIZED BEINGS Le Corbusier defined architecture as "the mas- terful, correct, and magnificent play of volumes brought together in light."13 He praised the "engi- neer's aesthetic" and promoted it as an expression of truth in construction. It was evident in bridges, airplanes, automobiles, and grain silos, and one would look to the engineer for advice on how to construct, but the proper deployment and au- thoritative use of form is clearly the architect's province. It is plainly a visual aesthetic, sculptural and determined, and it has had wide currency.</page><page sequence="4">46 The Aesthetics of Architecture By contrast, Gray's dictum remains underex- posed, it being formulated in a private letter, not trumpeted in a manifesto, though she is far from being alone in thinking along those lines. It is perhaps closer to the ad hoc of vernacular tra- ditions, but making use of the new materials and processes that the twentieth century brought her way. She felt a need and, when she was design- ing, closely analyzed the need, and then like ev- ery other organism, made shift with the things available to her, which included traditional tech- niques-lacquer, leather, carved timber- as well as tubular steel and experimental plastics. It would be possible to describe Le Corbusieťs buildings in these terms, and no doubt there was an element of this kind of thinking in the work that he did, but he gave his account of architec- ture along very different lines. His "poem of the right angle," for example, extols the purity and ra- tionality of pristine geometry, opposing it to the functional "way of the donkey," where form is gen- erated by muddling through expediently.14 Going back to Walter Benjamin's ways of experiencing architecture, Le Corbusier clearly gives priority to sight, whereas by contrast Gray gives priority to body and habit, grounding her sense of archi- tecture in the life of the organism rather than in the contemplation of pure and authoritative form. The organized being extends as far as it organizes. The house is an extension of the person- actually part of the organism. The house cannot be under- stood without the person. Curiously, it is in the aspect of the house as a machine that one would expect Gray and Le Corbusier to be in agreement if one has been reading Butler, for whom organic and inorganic mechanisms were equally mechanical. For my pur- poses, however, the significant difference between them is how they conceptualize architecture. For Le Corbusier the house as machine à habiter is a functioning mechanism, which belongs in the world of function and engineering. What makes it architecture is altogether different: "the mas- terful, correct, and magnificent play of volumes brought together in light." It is when the machine is contemplated that it is found to be architec- ture, not when it is being used. By contrast, Gray's conception of the house as a continuation of its inhabitants makes it inappropriate to judge it in Le Corbusier's terms. To see the house as a play of volumes is to miss the point of the house: it sup- ports life, is imbued with life, and is inseparable from life. For Le Corbusier, the architecture is in this volumetric play, but for Gray it manifestly was not. V. FORGETTING Therefore the appropriate aesthetic response in this frame of reference is not one that derives from disinterested contemplation of forms, but one that derives from the satisfaction of experi- encing the building in everyday use- a pragmatist aesthetics. A house as a sequence of spaces and forms does not in itself have an ethical dimension, but the organized entity that is the dwelling-and- its-occupants certainly does. The "good house" is inseparable from the "good life," which the building would be caught up in as a fundamen- tal support and shelter.15 The ideal rapport be- tween a dwelling and its occupants might be close enough that their ethos would find expression in it, whether in the grand design or in the detail. Beyond being a shelter, the dwelling is caught up in our projects of self-invention that seem so characteristic of the modern age, at least in fairly affluent liberal democracies. There are premoni- tions of it in Montaigne, but it is at its most heroic in Nietzsche and is made into a settled part of the curriculum by John Dewey.16 We use our dwellings to tell others, and ourselves, who we are and what we aspire to be, and we do not use them in iso- lation but in connection with our behavior, our clothes, our patterns of speech, choice of music, newspaper, or means of transport. These things are ingrained and habitual and are done or used or reached for unself-consciously on any given day, but they can be read gesturally. We would have no trouble in recognizing what kind of person was going through the events in a story because of the things that a novelist or dramatist has that char- acter say and do, what clothes are worn, and in what surroundings the events unfold. I can see this very readily in other people, maybe very wrongly (because often there is no way of checking), but it is not normally how I would see myself. Our dwellings are complex in parallel ways. They are instruments that help us to do both the things we have to do- sleeping, refueling, washing- and also various things that we can choose to do or not to do. Houses are sometimes used to accumulate tokens of personal memories, objects of aesthetic interest, and things that we imagine will enhance</page><page sequence="5">Ballantyne Architecture, Life, and Habit 47 our status in the eyes of the people we want to impress; they can be used to nurture friendships, family, or career contacts. Often the things we do with our houses blur or confound these categories, as the pleasures of entertaining are often insepa- rable from establishing status in society. There are so many things going on in a dwelling, at so many levels, that it is a wonder we manage to keep ev- erything going. We do manage, however, and we do it by establishing habits that persist and take us along one trajectory of self-actualization or an- other. From time to time the trajectory may be reviewed and adjusted, maybe gently, by learn- ing to do something new or, maybe drastically, by setting entirely new goals and deciding, in fact, to be a different person by deliberately adopting new habits, inferring a new telos for the organizing that I extend into my world. So for a dwelling- and by extension any building that I know through my habits of engagement with it rather than as a vi- sual spectacle- a pragmatist aesthetics involves an engagement with the ethos of the place, and that is enabled by the building, but driven by the people who must not be separated from it. Insofar as the judgment is aesthetic rather than ethical, it will consider the rapport between the dwelling and the life- the stronger the rapport, the better the fit, the more aesthetically satisfying the achieve- ment. However, if the ethos is bad (however that judgment is made), then it would probably seem to be an abdication of some wider responsibility to see as highly admirable a design that was con- figured so as to support evildoing. The occasion when such design can be admired without moral problems arising is in the case of the design of scenery for drama. A stage or film set can put in place an idea of a room that is an aesthetically sat- isfying lair for a villain, expressing the malign per- sonality and its power through the décor. We can appreciate the effectiveness of the design without separating it from the (imagined) life and without endorsing the evil. When the evil feels real, then expressing enthusiasm for the skill of the design can easily be misunderstood as endorsing the evil and is impolitic. It is certainly safer to foster the idea that evil and kitsch keep company, and there is some evidence to support that idea.17 There is enough counterevidence to repudiate the case, but it is more challenging to make it. Robert van Pelt has published the architects' drawings for the gas chambers at Auschwitz, which had organizational rationality and compositional skill to recommend them, but to dwell on their aesthetic achievements in the presence of their utterly abhorrent reason for being is to fail as a human being.18 The build- ings do not look remarkable, certainly not remark- ably evil, but then that could hardly have been the designers' intent. Few of us cast ourselves as vil- lains in our own lives. If we were able to visit these buildings as tourists, we might come away having taken photographs that looked quite pleasant. If we were to consider engaging in the building's life, we would be overcome with revulsion. Sometimes a building's aesthetics are not the most important thing about it, and even to mention aesthetics as an aspect of the building seems to show a lack of judgment. A pragmatist aesthetics makes the "life" inescapable, so one need not cauterize moral revulsion as inadmissible to aesthetic discourse. The occasions when we can securely make aes- thetic judgments about buildings in the absence of "life" are when the building's life has long van- ished. Therefore, for example, the ancient Colos- seum in Rome seems impressive without feeling morally dangerous, because the barbaric activities that it supported have long vanished. The prestige of ancient monuments in our culture has made them the focus of much contemplation, but we should not derive a general theory from them, as they are special cases. The general theory should come from the ordinary cases of everyday life and experience. In contemporary life, the Colosseum is experienced through the tourist gaze, and one spends more time in its cool vaults than in the scorching arena. A digital evocation of its heyday is in circulation (in Ridley Scott's film Gladiator ), but the building itself will not in any foreseeable future be a support for gladiatorial bloodshed. It is now a place from where horse-drawn carriage rides begin and where ice creams are sold. The ethos of the modern life that surrounds it is driven by benign leisure pursuits, an idea of cultural pres- tige, and the desire to maximize tourist revenue, not by bloodlust. VI. LIVING ARCHITECTURE Moving to a new house is notoriously one of the most stressful events in a life, and part of the reason for that is that it involves abandoning the habits that attached to the earlier dwelling. Hotels around the world that are aimed at the business community all have very similar facilities</page><page sequence="6">48 The Aesthetics of Architecture and spatial layouts, whether they are in New York or Indonesia, whatever the indigenous architec- ture is like. It is a way to minimize the inconve- nience involved in regular travel, but it also irons out the things that would give the particular places their distinct character. The negative side of habit is that once patterns of behavior have worked their way into the unconscious, they can be difficult to change.19 For as long as conditions continue with- out need of serious change, the formation of habit is an advantage, as we can do more without hav- ing to think about it. If we have good habits then we can continue to be good through habit, even in the absence of actual virtuous intentions at a given moment.20 If one is trying to design to ac- commodate anticipated behavior, then it can be a comfort to know that one is designing for someone with fixed habits, whose movements can be antici- pated. But if circumstances change once habit has taken a hold, then we might find it impossible to adapt. Where patterns of thought have settled into place, we might find ourselves incapable of mak- ing mental leaps that are not part of our settled routine- reverting too readily to common sense or the repetition of ideas that have become dog- matic and therefore unable to come up with the fresh insight that the new situation demands. The mental space that we have built for our thoughts then turns into a prison, but in its positive aspect it is an architecture of our minds, while conversely, the walls that frame our actions have the role of the unconscious.21 Without its inhabitants investing the dwelling with their ethos, the building becomes precisely as lifeless as an empty shell, which is not without interest- it can be used to decorative effect- but we can reasonably infer that it was not the mol- lusk's unconscious "reason" for making it. Eileen Gray moved on from her house in 1932 when she left Badovici. He died in 1956, and the house has been little occupied since then. It has been in poor repair, and its last owner, who sold the original furniture, was murdered there in 1996.22 It might soon be restored and opened to public view, but unoccupied it will not be the " architecture vivante " that it once sought to exemplify. Its siting and its sculptural qualities will be admired, and a pattern of life might be inferred from the traces that re- main. However, the point of the house was the life by the sea, and it is as if we were being invited to admire the plinth of a sculpture or a painter's easel. By then it will have been enlisted in the ranks of the buildings that we appreciate by eye, rather than by habit, and will therefore be judged by a different set of values. If we go along with Gray and Butler in seeing the house as a part of the organized being, then we should be looking for its effectiveness in promoting vitality and in giving expression and support to the ethos of the place. For the category of "places that we come to know through habit," the appropriate aesthetic qualities have an ethical aspect. To sum up, buildings can be contemplated as artworks, and this article does not attempt to ar- gue otherwise. Such contemplation, however, is a "special case" and is not remotely like the way that one normally engages with buildings in ev- eryday circumstances. Aesthetic analysis is neces- sarily contemplative in character, but if we are to apprehend a building's everyday character (as op- posed to its character for the tourist's gaze), then we need to understand it by way of the habits of ev- eryday life. The building will support some habits, and might obstruct others, but crucially the thing that makes it satisfying is the match between the building and the life that goes on in and through it. The role of aesthetics can be to articulate an ap- preciation of the fitness of the match between the place and the ethos, to see the building through the habits of daily life. By doing so, it becomes possible to see how the boundary between a space and its occupants can blur, so that the "organized being" has an identity that extends beyond the organic body into its territory. The building is normally not the focus of attention, but the thoroughly ha- bituated background for life, which does not mean that it cannot be discussed, but does mean that it is better understood if it is not discussed separately from the life. By making such a move, one claims for aesthetics a viewpoint that can be that of an inhabitant of a building, rather than a tourist.
