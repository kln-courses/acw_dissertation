<plain_text><page sequence="1">REPRESENTATIONAL CAPACITY, INTENTIONAL ASCRIPTION, AND THE SLIPPERY SLOPE STUART SILVERS Department of Philosophy Tilburg University, The Netherlands A long-standing objection to Fodor's version of the Representational Theory of Mind (RTM) argues that in ascribing intentional content to an organism's representational states there needs to be some way of distinguishing between the kinds of organisms that have such representational capacity and those kinds that haven't. Without a principled distinction there would be no way of delimiting the appropriate domain of intentional ascription. As Fodor (1986) suggests, if the objection holds, we should have no good reason for withholding intentional ascription from paper clips. Fodor (1986) has defended RTM against this slip- pery slope objection. He distinguishes between the kinds of creatures that exhibit selective responses to nomic properties of stimuli (for example, psychophysical properties) and the kinds of creatures that also respond selectively to nonnomic properties of stimuli (for example, being a crumpled shirt). The distinction marks the differences between two kinds of "primal scenes" in which lawful relations are said to hold between an organism's behavior, representational state, and stimulus property. The arguments for the distinction are provocative but counter- examples show them to be inconclusive. Among the various problems that beleaguer the Representational The- ory of Mind there is one that has, since its resuscitation in Fodor's (1975) Language of Thought, formed a kind of "bottom line" objection. Dennett (1976, 1978) articulated it early on in his critical review of Fodor. The obstacle that RTM must avoid is Dennett's (1978) charge that in ascribing representational states to things, Fodor's theory (and intentional ascription in general) is on the slippery slope, that is, there is no natural point at which such ascription ceases to apply. Fodor's own formulation is, "It seems that, unless intentional states are attributed only to things very like us-perhaps only to things that have brains-there can be nowhere to stop short of attributing them to thermostats and (who knows?) paper clips" (Fodor, 1986, p. 4). As Fodor's quip suggests, RTM is harassed by this: What sorts of or- ganisms are equipped with the kind of representational capacity such that we can appeal to the (intentional) contents of their mental states in ex- plaining their behavior. The answer is crucial to RTM if it's to be an adequate theoretical expression of our intuitions about the kinds of things to which we ascribe causally efficacious mental states. On the face of it, the question, "What kinds of natural systems have representational ca- Philosophy of Science, 56 (1989) pp. 463-473.

But this may, in part, be merely appearance since the empirical content of the question is de- pendent upon certain assumptions about the concept of representation and the role of representational systems in the explanation of intelligent or conceptually driven behavior. Fodor's way off the slope is to make a pair of parallel distinctions between two kinds of, what he calls, primal scenes and the kinds of crea- tures that are responsive vis-a-vis the different primal scenes. Anything counts as a primal scene in which: (3a) An organism A sees something S. (3b) S has some property 0, such that: (3c) A's behavior comes to exhibit some property C in consequence of (3a) and (3b). (Fodor 1986, p. 6) In primal scenes of the first type "there is a lawful connection between a certain property of the 'stimulus' (viz., S's property of being 0) and a certain property of the ensuing behavioral response (viz., A's behavior coming to be C)" (Fodor 1986, p. 9). This is selective response in type- one primal scenes. Whatever else is going on, A's response is a lawful effect of S's being 0; if S lacks 0, A's behavior does not become C. By contrast, primal scenes of the second type are those in which the property 0 of the stimulus and A's behavior coming to be C, in virtue of S's having 0, are not lawfully connected, that is, 0 is a nonnomic property of S to which A selectively responds. Organisms of which this property P is true are representors in type-two primal scenes. This dis- tinction is supposed to block Dennett's slippery slope objection: we can and paramecia can't respond selectively to nonnomic stimulus properties. It will prove important to bear in mind just what sort of property that "certain property of the 'stimulus"' is. For if, in type-one primal scenes, S's being 0 is lawfully connected to a certain ensuing behavioral response and, in type-two scenes, S's being 0 is nonnomic, then assuming it is the same property 0, it is going to be a very curious property indeed.2 Properties like being a dented fender, a crumpled shirt, a foul ball, or a double fault are incontestably nonnomic stimulus properties and we do respond selectively to them. There are skeptical objections denying, for example, that being a crumpled shirt is nonnomic, that crumpled shirts are seen (in some technical sense of 'see') and that nonnomic properties enter into explanations of behavior. Fodor rejects these as mere truisms and refuses to defend his distinction "against philosophers prepared to 'The scenes are called primal in virtue of their being priming scenes, that is, situations that trigger behavioral responses. 21f the properties in question are not the same there are still grave difficulties in store, as will be evident below.</page><page sequence="3">REPRESENTATIONAL CAPACITY AND THE SLIPPERY SLOPE 465 doubt any and every contingent truth that the distinction proposes" (1986, p. 13). But this policy seems to me to beg the question against serious skeptics for whom the distinction between intentional and nonintentional systems is not as Fodor characterizes it. There may be such a distinction but it need not be one that can be drawn in purely causal terms. So I propose to take the truisms more seriously than Fodor. My reasons in- volve the shortcomings of the argument with which he tries to explain the selective responses to nonnomic stimulus properties. The selectivity of response to nonnomic properties is a function of A's representing S as having or being 0, (S, of course, need not have or be 0) for example, A's taking S to be a left shoe. First there must be psy- chophysical, that is, the appropriate causal, relations between A and S; O is, ex hypothesi, not involved here. Next, A represents S as being 0 in virtue of the psychophysical relations and perceptual inference: Presumably such inferences exploit information from memory as well as about the detected psychophysical properties of S; in the typical (though by no means exclusive) case, this would be information to the effect that the psychophysical properties cohabit with property 0, so that the detection of the former provides a reliable index of the presence of the latter. (Fodor 1986, p. 14) Finally, A's representing S as 0 and response C must be lawfully con- nected. What sort of lawfulness is at stake here? I submit that it's not the kind of lawfulness that enjoys corresponding counterfactual support. Compare the lawlikeness of "Copper conducts electricity", which is law- like in virtue of the counterfactual support from "If X weren't to conduct electricity then it wouldn't be copper". Contrast now Fodor's case, "If A represents S as 0 then A behaves C" where (borrowing from the title of Adam Morton's (1975) paper) if A represents S (an utterance) as an insult (0) then A's behavior becomes C (she slaps his face). Suppose A were not to behave C (for example, were not to slap his face) it doesn't follow that A did not or would not represent S as 0 (for example, rep- resent utterence S as an insult). The insulating of this connection between face-slapping and representing S as insulting by vast ceteris paribus clauses results in the unwelcome analyticity of the relation. Alternatively, A might very well behave C (slap his face), and it might be that this C response was engendered not by A representing S as 0 (she can deal with verbal insults) but that at the same time he pinched her derriere or A is spastic or whatever.3 In any event, S's being 0 for A might be ceteris paribus 3Suppose A represents S as 0 when it's not. A's belief that S is 0 is sufficient for C but A's behavior need not become C in lawlike virtue of her representing S as 0. A's behavior might become C, for example, A is spastic, when A's representation of S is beside the point.</page><page sequence="4">466 STUART SILVERS causally sufficient to bring it about that A behaves C but it doesn't look like a lawful connection at all, in any sense of 'lawful' that science re- quires. The semantic link in the causal chain that is RTM's explanation of A's behavior becoming C is, of course, A's representing S to be 0. And, to appeal to another truism, a chain is as strong as its weakest link. Fodor's forging of the semantic link is, however, purely ad hoc, as I shall now try to show. The appeal to inferences exploiting informational resources available to the organism is just the appeal to what Fodor (1984) has called the dreaded problem of collateral information. How do we distinguish be- tween what is observed, given the right causal conditions, and what is inferred from just such informational resources? The issue is the role of the conventional element in the determination of observation predicates. If the representation as property is the property characteristic of obser- vation properties (predicates) then it seems to follow that the meaning (that is, the representational content) of the 0 predicate is, to that extent, similarly conventionally determined. The distinction of concern is be- tween nomic transducibility and perception (the construction of the per- ceptual object from sensory stimulus plus appropriate inference). Causal relations obtain in any case, so that a percipient without the relevant in- formational resources to draw upon (the collateral information problem) will stand in the same nomic psychophysical relation to a distal object as one who enjoys such resources. But whereas the latter represents the ob- ject as for example, a tennis ball, the former is vis-a-vis that same object devoid of representational content. There will, I suppose, be "demon- strative" content, for example, A represents S to A as this or that (with gestures) but what behavioral responses selective to nonnomic properties are we to predict from that? So we have again all the problems of the relativity of observation that baffled the empiricists' theory of meaning as well as their methodology of science. There are, of course, cases that slip through this relativity, notably perceptual illusions like the Muller- Lyer, which are seen (even by mice!) as "designed" despite the perceiv- er's knowledge (having the background information) which should deliver the veridical goods. This might establish that there are certain perceptual invariances that "transcend" corrective information from the background system. It might also establish something about the modular and infor- mationally encapsulated response capacities of the transduction systems. The question, as I see it, is, however, in what sense is there a semantic connection (in the Fodorian sense of truth valuational) in the causal chain that begins with the distal object S and proceeds via the nomic properties of the psychophysical relations, resulting in A's becoming C. The answer is an argument still owed.</page><page sequence="5">REPRESENTATIONAL CAPACITY AND THE SLIPPERY SLOPE 467 Cohabitation and Representation. Then there is the cohabitation rela- tion. Under what conditions does 0 (the nonnomic property) cohabit with the nomic properties P of A? The answer to this query is, I believe, to a large extent not psychological at all but anthropological in nature. For I take it to be nontrivial that the satisfaction conditions of nonnomic prop- erties, that is, what kinds of things or states of affairs instantiate them, are themselves defined relationally with respect to relevant contrast cases, for example, crumpled shirts have that property relative to neatly pressed ones in particular and shirts in general. If S's being 0 is explained by RTM in terms of O's cohabiting with the relevant Ps then cohabitation is a species of contingent identity (on pain of the P's of S causing or being correlated with the Os). Although I can't tell you what a context is, it seems to me that, in a certain context, the conditions the nomic satisfaction of which are psychophysical, take nonnomic values as their instantiations. It is surely compatible with this view that in another context (or counterfactual situation) the same psy- chophysical properties might cohabit with some other set of nonnomic properties, hence be realizable as a different 0. There is then a certain relevantly context-relative promiscuity as regards just which Os cohabit with which invariant nomic properties. The point is, however, about RTM as a causal theory of explanation and I'm assuming that causation is nomic, not merely sufficient and hence transparent across anthropologically distinct boundaries. The question of whether a left shoe is a left shoe everywhere is ambiguous at best and unanswerable at worst. In any case the answer depends upon how you determine the respecting of satisfaction conditions.4 So the nonnomic property of being a left shoe, if it figures in any way in causal expla- nations of behavior, does so, as it were, by courtesy of noncausal aspects of the determination of perceptual objects. So if A's behavior becomes C because of S's being 0 the "because" in question is causal only in a pinched, derivative, and bounded way, a way that gives rise to the idea of causal sufficiency. Fodor acknowledges this; "not all properties," he says, "enter into law- ful relations" (1986, p. 9), in particular, it's the nonnomic properties that are excluded. The way in which nonnomic properties enter into laws is, on this account, presumably, irrelevant to the causal efficacy that the law 4If among the blind the one-eyed man is king, then among the barefoot the left shoe is a curiosity. It is absurd in the extreme to say, as internalists are wont to do, that where there are left shoes, there isn't anything that isn't non-accidentally related to left shoedness. But on the other hand, it is the brave externalist (that brave I'm not) to say just where that particular property ceases to be relevantly related to others. So I'll grant that being a left shoe is not connected in any interesting way to being a potato grown in Aroostook County, Maine, but my granting it doesn't make it so!</page><page sequence="6">468 STUART SILVERS expresses. But Fodor is a reductionist; it's the body of laws that constitute the psychology he's pursuing, so it would seem that his program must eventually provide for the reduction of nonnomic properties from his the- ory. It is all the more puzzling that he should need all this machinery.5 Fodor claims that for RTM to go through S's being 0 must be a two- timer: once in rerum natura, and once as representation . . . the first oc- currence is required in order that the truth-conditions of A's percep- tual belief should be satisfied ('see' is transparent to existential gen- eralization; if A saw a crumpled shirt, then there was indeed a crumpled shirt that A saw). And the second occurrence is required in order that S's being 0 should have consequences for A's behavior, and in order that those consequences should be specific to the property 0 (as op- posed, for example) to merely coextensive properties. (1986, p. 15) The requirements are clear but how RTM satisfies them remains a mystery. It's just too easy to say that 'see' is transparent to existential generalization; it has the ring of fiat in the way in which the externalist epistemologist has 'true' follow from 'know'. But the issue here is not a linguistic-conceptual one. Fodor can, with characteristic bravura and aplomb, announce that we see shirts, for example, and that it's loopy to deny that we do. We do, of course, because shirts are non-natural kinds (indeed subsumable under wider non-natural kinds, for example, wearing apparel) that fit the explanatory bill (like a shirt?). But the test of the theory are surely the hard cases, the ones that don't fit so snugly into the generalizations over intentional content governing behavior. This is a simple Popperianism but no less valid for that. So we have the percipient and the tennis ball case again. There is the appropriate psychophysical de- tection, but there is, ex hypothesi, the failure of informational resource- fulness. So how are we to answer the question as to what is seen and more generally, what is transparent to existential generalization? I suggest that if it's psychophysical detection that satisfies the transparency con- siderations vis-'a-vis existential generalization then by Fodor's own spec- ification 'see' as the operative perceptual verb is not transparent with respect to existential generalization. For the perceptual inference goes through transparently only if the informational resources are present, when they are not, 'see' is in this relevant sense opaque. 5An important consideration, which Steven Schiffer emphasizes, is that explanation is intensional and explanation of behavior is intensional with a vengeance. What gets ex- plained does so under a certain description; a behavioral fact the description of which is sensitive to all sorts of noncausal considerations.</page><page sequence="7">REPRESENTATIONAL CAPACITY AND THE SLIPPERY SLOPE 469 Nonlinguistic Indicants of Representation. Of nonlinguistic indicants of behavior (that is, behavior that provokes intentional ascription in crea- tures lacking the capacity for language) Fodor argues that, if the prop- erties Pi . . . p, of S are found to be sufficient but not necessary for A's behavior becoming C then there is reason to infer the involvement of 0.6 "There must be a psychophysical relation between A and S, in virtue of which some of the nomic properties of S affect (nonbehavioral) states of A" (1986, p. 14). In addition to the nomic properties, there are nonnomic ones sufficient to bring it about that A's behavior becomes C. The non- behavioral states implicated here are not psychological, falling within the proper domain of psychophysical lawfulness. There is not a hint of men- tality here, it is stimulus detection at the sub-psychological level. On p. 15, the story changes, "Thus S has psychophysical (hence nomic) properties Pi . . . Pn as well as (nonnomic) property 0. In virtue of psychophysical laws, causal interaction between S and organism A eventuates in (non- behavioral) psychological states s, . . . s - Here the nonbehavioral states are now psychological. That poses a di- lemma: if the nonbehavioral psychological states (call them thoughts or beliefs) result from the causal interaction between S and A then (i) either the nonnomic stimulus properties are redundant and mental states are the effects of purely causal antecedents or (ii) nonnomic properties do, in some way, enter into lawful relations or (iii) intentionally individuated mental states are not the effects of causal interaction between S and A. The second alternative can be ruled out immediately and, as we have seen above, Fodor rejects the notion of nonnomic properties entering into lawful relations anyway. The first disjunct yields a view of mental states as nomically determined, which is the negation of the conclusion that Fodor argues for. This would put us in the same situation that Fodor's poor paramecia find themselves, that is, selectively responding to stimuli to which we are lawfully connected, that is, exhibiting type-one primal scene behavior. Such a view is, given our best intuitions about the sorts of properties to which intentionally contentful states are sensitive, surely counterintuitive. 6But notice that Pi ... pn are (or were) the nomic properties of S relative to A. What would it mean to be a nomic property of S that is sufficient but not necessary for A's behavior becoming C? It surely couldn't be a property that enjoyed unfailing support from its corresponding counterfactual. So it looks like a property that is both nomic and non- necessary is like Dennett's soluble fish. Unless Fodor has some other notion of nomic connection in mind it is difficult to tell what it is he's getting at and impossible to un- derstand what he means by nomic property without some form of necessity. If, on the other hand, this is a quibble about the word 'nomic' then, as Steven Schiffer has suggested to me, Fodor just might drop the term and push on with causal sufficiency. But it has always been Fodor's view that causal relations are lawful, that is, counterfactually sup- ported. So that suggestion won't do.</page><page sequence="8">470 STUART SILVERS If "nonbehavioral psychological states" are thoughts or beliefs, that is, the having of a mental state with intentional content, then Fodor's claim is that organisms enjoy the having of, say, the belief that P, when the right causal conditions are satisfied. But which causal conditions are the right ones? The question is not merely rhetorical. It matters if, as Fodor demands, the intentional content of mental states is the result of certain causal interactions between organism and environment. Moreover, to as- sume, as Fodor explicitly does, that intentional, nonbehavioral psycho- logical states are, at a certain point on the phylogenetic scale, the end products of psychophysical laws, is to beg the question against the skeptic with regard to intentional ascription. So alternative (iii), which contra- venes the antecedent of the conditional, has something important to be said for it.7 The question of nonlinguistic indicants is big trouble for the causal interpretation of RTM. What is to guide our interpretation of what we take to be evidence of mentation in coming to behave C? We have an abundance of properties that are sufficient but not necessary; when one of them is present, A does C even though there may be others that, as it were, get A to do C. A case in point, which Fodor (unpublished) has exercised, involves Tinbergen's (1951) classic study of escape-instinct behavior in birds with hawk predators. The birds exhibit the escape behavior not only in the presence of the hawk predators but also in the presence of black, fluttery cloth rigged to "resemble" hawk-hovering. The escape response of a bird is brought about in fact by a countless number of conditions, few if any of which are nomically related to the bird's escape routine. These are conditions that are sufficient but not necessary to elicit the behavioral response. A point of crucial methodological importance here involves the (best explanation) inference to intentional state. There is a plethora of causally sufficient but non-necessary conditions for the bringing it about that an organism's behavioral response is C. The conclusion that ascribes to the organism a mental representation with distinct (and causally effi- cacious) intentional content requires independent, systematic evidential support. Fodor's (1984) own form of verificationism demands it. But if we are to take the idea of causal interaction seriously, as indeed we are obliged to, then underlying the causal sufficiency of the particular property must be a relation between that property and A's doing C which legitimizes the causal claim. So the question is, "What do all those var- ious sufficient conditions have in common such that in the presence of 7To enter here upon a discussion of just what might be said in favor of the third disjunct would carry the current critique of Fodor's thesis too far beyond its modest scope. In an expanded version of this paper I do enter upon just such a discussion. Compare Burge (1979, and forthcoming); Baker (1986).</page><page sequence="9">REPRESENTATIONAL CAPACITY AND THE SLIPPERY SLOPE 471 any of them A does C?" Fodor's answer, (compare Dretske 1986) is that all the sufficient pis are, by definition, compatible with the presence of 0 and perceptual constancies "correlate better with the presence of 0 than with the presence of Pi . . p," (Fodor 1984, p. 19). The compatibility of nonnomic properties 0 of S with the various psy- chophysical properties that lawfully connect S and A, however, is not the sort of relation upon which we base an explanation of A's behavioral responses (A's behavior becoming C). There is a countless number of nonnomic properties compatible with S's psychophysical properties. So the nonnomic properties will have to be explanatory as well as compat- ible. Those that we choose might have explanatory value without being in any special sense causally implicated in A's behavior becoming C. This was the point of the above argument about the conventional element in the determination of perceptual objects, and hence of the fixation of per- ceptual beliefs. Tinbergen's birds exhibit escape behavior in the presence of almost anything at all, regardless of resemblance or lack of it to predators. For example, a loud noise or indeed any unexpected change (whether in the external environment or in a bird's brain) might trigger the same behav- ioral response. How then are we, on the RTM account, to describe the intentional content of a bird's representational state? I think there is, short of an extreme anthropomorphism, no way to save intentional content while adhering to a strict causal account of behavior. The problem, as I see it, is that in dealing with languageless creatures, in particular the ethological cases, intentional ascription is purchased at the expense of postulating representational capacity with specific inten- tional content. These do not, of course, form an incompatible pair. How- ever, given that there is a countless number of conditions sufficient to produce A's behavior becoming C, the move from the diversity of causally sufficient stimuli to a unified intentional content is unwarranted, for it invests the creature with highly complex perceptual capacities; indeed it presupposes, as Burge (forthcoming) has recently noticed, capacities like being able to determine that "relevantly different antecedents have the same effects on the (creature's) mind" (p. 6). The point surely is that in such cases, to bridge the gap between the diversity of causally sufficient stimuli and a response type, postulating a representational capacity with such intentional parameters simply re-asks the question about the inner goings on. Fodor (1986) acknowledges "that the apparatus of intentional ascription and mental representation seems securist in its application to verbal or- ganisms". He adds that although "the connection between language and intentionality is pervasive but not deep (. . . of course, the connection between representation and intentionality is the fixed point on which cog-</page><page sequence="10">472 STUART SILVERS nitive psychology turns: see Fodor 1975)" (1986, pp. 18-19). That con- nection, however, remains obscure in view of the indeterminacy of in- tentional ascription and its role in ethological studies uiberhaupt. If cognitive ethological cases succumb in the face of this kind of ob- jection then it might be that the Cartesian principle of linguistic capacity is, at bottom, the distinguishing mark. Descartes' application of this prin- ciple has it that animals are "natural automata". Fodor's bird-with-hawk- predator case is reminiscent of a well-known passage in Descartes: When a man in falling thrusts out his hand to save his head he does that without his reasoning counselling him so to act, but merely be- cause the sight of the impending fall penetrating his brain, drives the animal spirits into the nerves in the manner necessary for this motion, and for producing it without the mind's desiring it, and as though it were the working of a machine. Now, when we experience this as a fact in ourselves, why should we marvel so greatly if the light re- flected from the body of a wolf into the eyes of a sheep should be equally capable of exciting it in the motion of flight? (1955, p. 104) If it is linguistic capacity that distinguishes nomologically determined behavior from the cogitative sort, then the explanation of behavior via essential reference to the mediating role of the intentional content must restrict itself to those beings for which evidence of language capacity is relatively uncontroversial. I've suggested that the capacity to represent something as a dented fender involves contrasts with contextually determined alternatives; being a dented fender counts as a property of a perceptual object relative to what counts as satisfying the truth conditions of the object, where such truth condi- tions are themselves cognitive norms of the context. The question that emerges from these remarks is: When does the degree of representational fidelity of the ascribed intentional content of a token representation to the tokening of its cause, merit the fine-grained semantic evaluation that in- dividuates intentional content in terms of truth conditions? Perhaps there is a way off Dennett's slippery slope, but if there is, it's not Fodor's way, for the purely causal route that he follows leads to a dead end. There surely is representational capacity and it's indeed loopy to deny it. We do represent states of affairs in terms of their nonnomic properties but it's no solution to explain this capacity in causal terms. To continue to do so is to emulate the man who looks for his lost keys under the lamp because that is where the light is. REFERENCES Baker, R. (1986), "Just What Do We Have in Mind?", in P. A.
