One of the functions of the nose is to moisten the air before it goes to the lungs. In areas where the air is very dry, such as deserts, a larger mucous area is required to moisten in- spired air, and this necessitates a longer and narrower nose (Molnar 1983:71–73). Both the Olmecs and the West African ancestors of African-Americans have short, flat noses because they lived in wet, tropical ar- eas; Nubians and Egyptians have longer, thinner noses because they have lived in a desert.18 Comparison of figures 1 and 2 with figures 3–5 reveals that although these two groups differ in the shape of the nose and the lips, both are dolichocephalic and prognathous. Most of the colossal Olmec heads are not; only 3 of the 16 Ol- mec heads show a degree of prognathism. Figures 6–9 clearly show that these heads do not resemble Nubians (having flat noses, thick lips, and epicanthic-folded eye- lids and lacking dolichocephaly or prognathism) or, for that matter, West Africans (having epicanthic folds and lacking dolichocephaly or prognathism). The people represented in the Olmec sculptures had short, round, flat faces with thick lips, flat noses, and epicanthic folds; that is, they resembled people who still live in the tropical lowlands of Mexico (see figs. 10 and 11). Van Sertima (1992b, 1995) places great emphasis on Tres Zapotes head 2 (also known as the Nestepe or Tux- tla head)19 because it has seven braids dangling from the Fig. 3. Nubian from Koyekka. (Photo Friedrich W. 18. Some Afrocentrists have argued that modern populations of Hinkel.) Egyptians and Nubians look different from those of antiquity, but both Trigger (1978) and Berry, Berry, and Ucko (1967) point to a ‘‘remarkable degree of homogeneity’’ in this area for 5,000 years. 19.

Argument by assertion is common in Van Sertima’s work. Peo- ple from all over the world (including Europeans) have been braiding their hair for thousands of years. Is he arguing that an Ethi- opian was included in the ship that reached America and provided the model for the Olmec head? Why would the Olmecs not have used an Egyptian hairstyle? Frank Yurco (personal communication, 1995), an Egyptologist at the Field Museum in Chicago, points out that the Olmec braids do not look like either Egyptian or Nubian ones. What evidence is there that a seven-braided hairdo was char- acteristic of Ethiopia in the period 1200–700 b.c.? If Van Sertima’s evidence comes from colonial or modern Ethiopia, why should we believe that this hairstyle has prevailed unchanged for thousands of years? Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. None is provided. Fig. 6. Monument 5, San Lorenzo, front and rear 21.

There is hardly a claim in any of Van Sertima’s writings that can be supported by the evidence found in the ar- chaeological, botanical, linguistic, or historical record. He employs a number of tactics commonly used by pseudoscientists (Cole 1980; Radner and Radner 1982: 34.
