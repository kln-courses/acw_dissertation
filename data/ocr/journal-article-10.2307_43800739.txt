<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE NARRATIVE FUNCTION OF IDEAS IN CYRANO'S ESTATS ET EMPIRES DE LA LUNE by Alexander Dunlop A philosophical narrative is one in which abstract ideas form a part of the sequence of narrative material. To the extent that it merits considera- tion as a work of art, it consists neither of ideas candied over with a story nor of a story interspersed with somebody's viewpoint. Rather it is an insoluble complex of idea and story, neither of which has aesthetic value except by relation to the other. In the Estais et Empires de la Lune we have an unquestionably complete narrative unit. 1 Unified by the experience of the central figure of the narrator, it begins with his departure from France and ends with his return. Between these poles there are three distinct episodes: one in Canada, one in Paradise, and one in the world of the moon. The moon and the earth are basically similar, for each is a world. Each reflects the other physically and symbolically, and many aspeas of the moon are presented as mirror-like reverse images of earthly quali- ties. 2 Burial, for example, is a disgrace; the disposal of bodies is designed to revitalize the deceased in another form. Doctors are concerned with preserving the healthy, not with patching up the sick. Honored are not the aged, but the vital young. The sign of nobility is not the death-dealing sword, but the male reproductive organ. Virginity is not an honor, but a disgrace. Military daring is not considered brave and noble, but unnatural and even cowardly. All these characteristics suggest a life-oriented moon 1 Because it is very probably unfinished, the Estats et Empires du Soleil must be excluded from consideration here, despite the obvious relationship. 2 Pierre- Antoine Brun, Savinien Cyrano de Bergerac (Paris, 1893) speaks of Cyrano's "méthode à rebours," p. 280.

The Estais et Empires de la Lune , however, is by no means the pres- entation of a Utopian society. The lunarians, by their own assertion and by their characteristics, are indeed human. Although they walk on four feet and differ in a number of other ways, the essentially human weaknes- ses are unquestionably present: "// y a du vulgaire ici comme là qui ne peut souffrir la pensée des choses où il ri est point accoutumé" 3 King and queen, court and courtiers, peasants and innkeespers, philosophers and clergy, politicians, hypocrites, hotheads and criminals, all are there. Nor are the lunarians notably more open-minded or reasonable than their earthly counterparts. If we compare Cyrano's initial reception in Canada and in the moon-world, we find it is the same. He is taken into custody by a troop who, judging on the basis of his appearance and their own experience, immediately make an assumption as to his identity. This common-sense assumption is in each case erroneous, yet all other possibil- ities are excluded with scoffing cynicism. He is brought to the rulers - the Canadian governor and the lunar king - and is held in custody. He is received with somewhat more understanding by those more highly placed, yet in each case his future is jeopardized by the opposition of the clergy. His truthful explanation is seen in each case as a direct threat to the accepted religious tenets. It is not difficult to find in the Estais et Empires de la Lune an anti- clerical bias. More significant here is the fact that the soldiers, on the basis of what their senses accurately perceive, are unable to understand the phenomenon of Cyrano in any but their own very limited terms. Their understanding is wrong. Yet the phenomenon, fictionally, is understandable, as the reader knows who has witnessed Cyrano's landing. The principle involved is that all the potentially knowable may not be understood in terms of what we already know. From this it is apparent that the opening paragraph of the Estais, in which Cyrano and his friends, walking in the moonlight, offer fanciful explanations of the moon, is not merely a pictur- esque introduction, but an example of this same kind of wrong thinking. 3 Les Estais et Empires de la Lune, in Les Oeuvres Libertines de Cyrano de Bergerac, ed., Frédéric Lachèvre (Paris, 1920), I, 33.

Right thinking, then, would be a more or less inductive logic of cause- and-effect (" causes naturelles ") involving both sense perception and rea- son, such as Cyrano practices on his way to the moon: "Je cherchais des yeux et de la pensée ce qui en pouvait être la cause " (p. 19). 4 Although commentators have often spoken of paradox, contradiction and inconsistency in the Estais , the fact is that this pursuit of causes naturelles results in an unquestionably coherent set of ideas, expressed at one time by Cyrano, at another by the lunarians. 5 In brief, the concept is this: All matter consists of only one element and achieves diversity through different combinations of this element. Simple and combined units of the material element move by attraction ("par sympathie ") through spaces void of material (vacuum). This motion is not merely local but is universally continuous in billiard-ball fashion (though the intensity of the transmitted motion depends on the density of the matter). Further, this motion is not erratic, but perfect and cyclical: " Cela ri est pas fort espineux à comprendre pour qui connoist le cercle parfaict et la délicate enchesnure des Elemens" (p. 49). The universe, then, is an infinite quantity of matter eternally moving and changing according to a perfect form. We have here a world view that rivals in stability and geometric per- fection the world construct of the medieval philosophers. A greater sim- plicity and clarity is achieved in this system, which needs neither " vos excentriques, vos concentriques , ny vos épicicles ; tous lesquels vous ne sçauriés expliquer que très confusément , et dont je sauve mon système" (p. 12). Sacrificed, on the other hand, are the human ego and its corre- sponding anthropomorphism, a product of reasoning by analogy. 4 For Cyrano all phenomena of nature are potentially understandable. How- ever, not all phenomena are actually understandable (except by analogous reason- ing) because man's senses are inadequate. The sun-spirit, in contrast, is endowed with senses other than the five human ones, and he can speak of the " facultés imbéciles de l'homme ." 5 Brun, p. 180, sees this supposed inconsistency as a defect. Weber, p. 11, speaks of "l'absence de lien apparent entre les idées" Others see contrast or contradiction as an essential quality of the work, but do not specify its precise function. See, e.g., Geoffrey Strachan, trans., Other Worlds (London, 1965), p. xvi; also Richard Aldington, trans., Voyages to the Moon and the Sun (New York, 1923), p. 40; Cf. Georges Mongrédien, Cyrano de Bergerac (Paris, 1964), p. 193: " Son système philosophique est cohérent ," and p. 199: " Cyrano , maitre de sa pensée, est également maitre de son style"</page><page sequence="4">140 ROMANCE NOTES There would seem to be no room left for God in a universe of eternal and infinite matter. Yet the sun-spirit, who is endowed with superior knowledge and intelligence and with more senses than the five human ones, adheres consistently to a moderate deism. He opposes the priests, who " avoient embaboüiné la conscience du peuple " (p. 60); he also opposes the radical young philosopher who affects an ostentatious impiety. He rejects the traditional anthropomorphic notion that man is made in the image of God. God, incapable of passion, is a morally neutral force, yet a real force. The quality most often attributed to God by the sun- spirit is wisdom, a wisdom that seems synonymous with some kind of foresight, plan or form for the universe. Another attribute of God is motion. In sum, God is "ce sage Moteur " (p. 69) - both the wisdom (form) and the motive force of the universe. 6 Cyrano and the lunarians do not need the notion of God to account for an interaction of matter that is explicable in terms of matter itself: " Je trouve dans la terre les vertus qui la font mouvoir " (p. 13). However, the stability of this interaction, its cyclical form - that which prevents it from being chaotic and ultimately self-destructive, that which is order in the universe - requires an affirmation of an ultimately inexplicable sagesse, be it the wisdom of nature, or, in the terms of the sun-spirit, God. Thus the deism of the sun-spirit does not contradict, but rather complements perfectly the materialistic world-picture of Cyrano and the lunarians. There is one blatant inconsistency in the Estais et Empires de la Lune . We have noted that the concept of an infinite and eternal universe is expressed twice, once by Cyrano in Canada and once by the philosophers of the moon. However, when the lunarians present their views, Cyrano has changed his mind. With comic naïveté he takes a narrow parochial stand based on the authority of Moses, Aristotle and the faith. Cyrano admires, but cannot accept a lunarian's presentation of his own former views on the structure of the universe. This position, which typifies Cy- rano's attitude during his stay in the lunar world, is the direct opposite of his attitude during the Canada episode. 6 There is nothing in this view to prevent equating it with nature, as does Henri Weber, pp. 29-32, p. 121 n. 1, p. 122 n. 3, p. 123 n. 1, so long as we specify, as Weber does not, that we mean only the form and motive force of nature, and not the matter.</page><page sequence="5">THE NARRATIVE FUNCTION OF IDEAS IN CYRANO'S... 141 To explain this inconsistency we must examine the narrative material between Canada and the moon- world: the Paradise episode. It is only in terms of this change in attitude that the narrative function of the Para- dise episode becomes clear. Having been rendered ignorant by his super- ficial bite into the apple of knowledge, Cyrano has become overly reverent of authority. The Paradise episode is not merely a device to get Cyrano from one place to another, nor merely a pretense for railing at Christian tradition; it is a symbolic statement. Like Adam, Cyrano tastes the fruit of knowledge and falls from Paradise, landing on the world of the moon. Cyrano becomes a second Adam, and the Paradise episode a reenactment of the religio-mythical history of the fall of man. When he returns to earth, Cyrano is surrounded by barking dogs: "on voyait depuis le dogue jusqu'au bichon hurlant de plus épouvantable furie que s'ilz eussent faict Vamûversaire de leur premier Adam" (p. 98). An important change has been made in the nature of the fruit of knowledge, however. The second Adam falls not because he tasted a forbidden fruit, but because he did not bite deeply enough into it. This change reverses the whole intent of the tradition in which the fall is punishment for pursuit of forbidden knowledge. It is the very tradition itself, the whole tradition of mythological and analogical thinking, that has brought about man's fall to the state of pompous ignorance burlesqued in the position taken by Cyrano during his stay on the moon. This is another aspect of the earthly tradition of collective self-destruction that is reflected inversely in the society of the lunarians. What is needed, if man is to turn from ignorance and death, is the defiance of authority, the pursuit of knowledge and the ultimate extension of the human faculties in order to extract the secret of the unity of matter and of the universe. "77 nous manque un Prométhee pour faire cet extraicť (p. 52). Who is this new Prometheus? We learn in the Paradise episode that Prometheus and Adam were really the same person: " les Hébreux Vont connu sous le nom d'Adam et les idolâtres sous le nom de Prométhee " (p. 23). It is probable that the travelling Cyrano, our second Adam, was also to become a second Prometheus in the unfinished Estats et Empires du Soleil. 7 7 "C'est un bien pour les habitants de vostre Globe d'avoir porté un Homme qui luy puisse apprendre les merveilles du Soleil puis que , sans vous 9 ils estoient</page><page sequence="6">142 ROMANCE NOTES The Estais et Empires de la Lune is not a philosophical treatise manqué, but a successful and coherent philosophical narrative. Its sup- posed inconsistencies - the contradictory views expressed by Cyrano, the conflicting views of the Paradise prophet, the sun-spirit, and the luna- rians - are either non-existent or serve a specific narrative function. Cyrano was characterized as "mad" in the eighteenth century, then as "strange" in the nineteenth. Twentieth-century commentators have further mollified the epithet to "inconsistent." I have tried to suggest that even this phrase is inaccurate. Chapel Hill, N. C. en danger de vivre dans une grossière ignorance , ' Cyrano is told on the sun, Lachèvre, p. 185. Had the Estais et Empires du Soleil been finished, Dry eona might well have spent his remaining days chained to an earthly rock.</page></plain_text>
