<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> CHAPTER FOUR OLD ROADS IN THE NORTHWESTERN BORDERLANDS Ancient Gandhāra was a pivotal contact zone for movement into and  out of South Asia. Migrations of Greeks, Sakas, Kusāsnsas and Huns  enriched the political and cultural history of this fertile region, which  served as a launching pad for Buddhist transmission across the Hindu  Kush and Karakorum mountains. As at other major South Asian  nodes (such as Taxila, the northwestern metropolis located across  the Indus River from Gandhāra proper), material surpluses generated  by agriculture and trade permitted Buddhist complexes with stūpas  and monasteries to proliferate in Gandhāra and neighboring regions.  Although Gandhāra was geographically distant from Śākyamuni Bud- dha’s homeland in Magadha, the localization of his relics and narra- tives of his former lives contributed to a strong and enduring Buddhist  presence during the first millennium CE. Gandhāran Buddhist art  and archaeology, inscriptions and coins, and new discoveries of sev- eral collections of Gāndhārī manuscripts from the first few centuries  CE amply demonstrate this region’s rich material and literary culture.  These sources, along with the accounts of Chinese pilgrims who visited  regional shrines and monasteries between the fifth and seventh cen- turies CE, provide different viewpoints on Gandhāran Buddhism. The  regional ‘transplantation’ of Buddhism in Gandhāra and its successful  movement across mountain passes raise interesting and longstanding  questions about the character of Gandhāran Buddhism and the impe- tus it gave to transmission beyond the frontiers of the Indian subcon- tinent.1 Which Gandhāran religious, cultural, economic, and political  features have had discernible impacts on Buddhist literary texts, artis- tic motifs, devotional practices, and monastic architecture and insti- tutions? To what extent are dynamic syntheses of hybrid indigenous,  Indian, Iranian, and exogenous elements resulting from contacts and  1 As a transplant requires suitable soil and other conditions to grow and flourish,  whereas it is not necessary for an implant to adjust to a different environment, “trans- plantation” is preferable to the “implantation of Buddhism” discussed by Lamotte  1988: 333 [1958: 365] and elaborated by Fussman 1994a.

How was it possible for the Buddhist san֛gha to thrive for so  long in this regional borderland, and why did Gandhāran Buddhism  have such an extensive influence on early patterns of transmission in  Central Asia and China? In order to address these questions, envi- ronmental, political, and economic conditions for settlement patterns  and the institutional expansion of Buddhist shrines and monaster- ies are surveyed, along with relevant Gandhāran material sources.  Nodes and networks for cultural and religious transmission between  Gandhāra, Udsdsiyāna (Swat valley), and Bactria (northern Afghanistan  and the Oxus basin) are delineated. These connections permit us to  retrace the overland itineraries of South Asian Buddhist missionar- ies to Central Asia and East Asia and to locate Buddhist shrines and  monastic communities reported by visitors such as Faxian, Song Yun,  and Xuanzang. This examination of ‘Old Roads’ for religious mobility  concludes with an assessment of how Gandhāran Buddhists ‘imagined  a place for Buddhism’ and made it their own through processes of  social, cultural, and literary ‘domestication,’ particularly by situating  jātakas, avadānas and other previous-birth narratives in the north- western frontier milieu.2 Rather than importing Buddhist traditions  without modification from Indian Buddhist centers, Buddhists selec- tively appropriated and transformed religious media to localize the  Buddha’s presence and to turn the Dharmacakra from the regional  hub of Gandhāra. Environmental Conditions for Buddhist Transmission in Gandhāra Just as religious and social conditions in ancient Magadha proved  ideal for the emergence of the Buddhist san֛gha, the geographical, eco- nomic, and political environment of Gandhāra was optimal for Bud- dhist traditions imported from northern India to grow and expand in  new directions. Before mapping regional routes in the northwestern  borderlands, it is necessary to demarcate topographical features and  the broader cultural extent of Gandhāra in order to discern significant  2 The phrase ‘imagining a place for Buddhism’ is borrowed from Monius, Anne  E. 2001.

The “center of  gravity” (Foucher 1905: 1.13) of Gandhāra was located in the Peshawar  basin around the confluence of the Kabul and Swat rivers, which join  to form the Landai tributary of the Indus River.3 While the Indus River  marks the eastern boundary of Gandhāra proper, the Suleiman Moun- tains form a permeable western boundary interspersed with numer- ous passes (besides the famous Khyber Pass).4 The Safed Koh range  separates the Peshawar valley from the Kohat district to the south in  the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) of Pakistan. Passes leading  to the Mohmand and Bajaur districts in the northwest and the lower  Swat valley and Buner district in the north and northeast intersect  an arc of hills on the northern rim of the Peshawar basin. The rich  alluvial land watered by drainage from the surrounding mountain val- leys along with seasonal monsoon rains has long sustained “substantial  agriculture and urban centres, and the entire region forms a transit  zone between the highland massif of Central Asia and the Indian  plains” (Zwalf 1996: 14). Gandhāra was located on an extension of east-west arterial routes  of the Uttarāpatha as well as northern and southern regional feeder  routes. While the Gandhāran core area can be narrowly defined as  the Peshawar basin, the amorphous cultural influence of “Greater  Gandhāra” (Salomon 1999: 3) extended across the Indus River to  Taxila (30 km east of the Indus) and westwards into modern Afghani- stan following the Kabul River upstream to Jalalabad and Kabul, as  well as the Bamiyan valley.5 Areas to the north of Gandhāra, such as  3 For the hydrography of Gandhāra, see Foucher 1942: 1.51–52 (“La rivière maî- tresse”), Fussman 1994a: 18; Jansen, Michael. 2008. “The Cultural Geography of  Gandhara.” In Luczanits 2008: 28; and Zwalf 1996: 14. 4 Dar, Saifur Rahman. 2007. “Pathways Between Gandhāra and North India during  the Second Century B.C.—Second Century A.D.” In Srinivasan 2007: 24–54 correlates  nineteenth-century geographical descriptions of routes and mountain passes in the  northwestern frontier of British India with archaeological discoveries from ancient  Gandhāra. 5 Although Takkasilā (Taxila) (treated in greater depth in Chapter 3: Taxila,  pp. 201–204) is referred to as the capital of the Gandhāra mahājanapada in Pāli lit- erature (Dietz 2007: 49; Law 1932: 49–50), a late passage in the Rāmāyansa (7.101.11)  distinguishes between the capital of the Gandhāra visasya at Pusksalāvatī (modern  Charsada) and the capital of the Gandharva deśa at Taksasśilā (Taxila) (Jansen 2008:  27). Fussman criticizes the inclusion of Taxila in Gandhāra “par abus de langage”  (1994a: 18, n. 6), but admits that Taxila participated in Gandhāran culture. While  some authors add the Bamiyan valley “to the west of the core region” (Jansen 2008: 27)  and areas of Bactria north of the Hindu Kush to ‘Greater Gandhāra,’ more restrictive  </page> <page sequence="5">  old roads in the northwestern borderlands 233 the Swat, Bajaur, Buner, Dir, Chitral, and the upper Indus, Gilgit, and  Hunza valleys also maintained varying levels of cultural, commercial  and religious contact with Gandhāra, yet remained distinct regions.  Bannu, Kohat, and the Kurram valley located directly to the south of  the Peshawar basin can also be included within the broader orbit of  Gandhāra, but Kandahar and other areas of southeastern Afghanistan  and neighboring areas of Baluchistan in southwestern Pakistan may be  excluded. In this chapter, networks that connected the core areas of  ancient Gandhāra with Swat and Bajaur to the north and with ancient  Bactria across the Hindu Kush further to the northwest are discussed  in more depth than links with Taxila (already treated in chapter 3) and  the upper Indus (the focus of chapter 5). The growth of Buddhism in Gandhāra benefited from political  and social factors, including royal patronage and urbanization. Since  Gandhāra and the lower Indus River valley were Achaemenid prov- inces until Alexander of Macedon’s attempted conquest in 327–6 BCE,  the northwestern borderlands played important roles in the formation  of early western classical ideas about Indian politics and life.6 During  the reign of Aśoka (ca. 272–232 BCE), Major Rock Edicts inscribed in  Kharostshsī at Shahbazgarhi and Mansehra signaled that these north- western frontier regions belonged to the Mauryan empire.7 The initial  foundations of Dharmarājika stūpas at Taxila and at Butkara I in the  Swat valley probably date to the Mauryan period, although Aśokan  Buddhist inscriptions are not found at these early monuments.8 While  Buddhist missionaries may have reached Gandhāra earlier than the  definitions limit its extent to the valley of the Kabul River and its tributaries in north- eastern Afghanistan.  6 See Chapter 2: Iranian Contacts in the Northwest and Hellenistic Interactions,  pp. 96–109. Gandhāra and the western borderlands were the primary contact zones  between the Hellenistic and Indian worlds before Alexander’s campaign.  7 See Chapter 2: Legacy of the Mauryans: Aśoka as Dharmarāja, pp. 78–94 and Falk  2006: 127–129 (Mansehra), 132–135 (Shahbazgarhi) for Aśokan edicts in Kharostshsī.  Falk 2006: 241–253 points out that the Aramaic inscriptions from sites around Jala- labad (Laghman and Pul-i Darunta) mention Aśoka (King Priyadarśin) as ruler, but  seem to report legal verdicts instead of recording Aśokan edicts.  8 Fussman 1994a: 19 and Behrendt 2004: 40 express skepticism about the attribu- tion of these stūpas to Aśoka and argue for later dates in the second century BCE  rather than the Mauryan period. While Aśokan inscriptions “do not directly address  the introduction of Buddhism into Gandhara” (Behrendt, Kurt. 2007. The Art of  Gandhāra in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. New York: Metropolitan Museum of  Art, 21), a Mauryan imperial presence in the Northwest firmly attested by Aśokan  edicts at Mansehra and Shahbazgarhi supports the consensus view that the founda- tions for these two stūpas can be reasonably dated in the third century BCE. </page> <page sequence="6"> 234 chapter four time of Aśoka, the official introduction of Buddhism was apparently  linked with imperial support, and it is only significantly later in the first  century BCE and first century CE that Buddhist stūpas and monaster- ies begin to proliferate when the Sakas and their subordinates exerted  control over routes and territories between Gandhāra and Mathura. Settlement patterns indicate that agricultural surpluses fueled the  growth of Gandhāran urban centers such as Pusksalāvatī, the ancient  capital of Gandhāra near modern Charsada.9 Other important cities  with very early archaeological layers ranging from prehistoric to Indo- Greek periods include Barikot, Udegram, and Mingora in the Swat  valley, Purusaspura (modern Peshawar), and Udabhansͯapura (modern  Hund) at an important crossing of the Indus River.10 Recent surveys  of the Peshawar basin by Ihsan Ali and other Pakistani archaeologists  have revealed that the first century BCE and first century CE were  periods of intensive growth of urban and suburban centers.11 Although  there is relatively little archaeological evidence for Buddhist shrines   9 Sanskrit Pusksalāvatī (or Pusksarāvatī) “lotus town,” is identified with the Bālā  Hisssāsr mound, which was excavated by Mortimer Wheeler (Wheeler, Mortimer. 1962.  Chārsada: A metropolis of the North-West Frontier, being a report on excavations of  1958. Oxford: Oxford University Press for the Government of Pakistan and the British  Academy). Wheeler “suggested” that the site was occupied between the sixth to first or  second century BCE (Callieri 1995: 299), but it could be dated much earlier according  to Stacul, Giorgio. 1990. “On Chārsada and Beyond: What is Wrong with Sir Mor- timer?” In Taddei and Callieri, eds. 1990: 605–610 (cited by Karttunen 1997a: 50).

Settlement at the neighboring site of Shaikhān Dsherī can be dated to  the Indo-Greek period beginning in the third and second centuries BCE on the basis  of coins of Indo-Greek rulers and classical double-moulded terracotta figures (Callieri  1995: 299–300; Dani, Ahmad Hasan. 1965–1966. “Shaikhan Dheri excavation (1963 &amp;  1964 seasons).” Ancient Pakistan 2, 17–214.  10 Callieri, Pierfrancesco. 2008. “The Archaeological Basis.” In Luczanits 2008:  58–63.  11 Ali, Ihsan. 1994. “Settlement History of Charsada District.” Ancient Pakistan 9,  1–164; Ali, Ihsan. 2003. “Early Settlements, Irrigation, and Trade Routes in Peshawar  Plain, Pakistan.” Frontier Archaeology 1 (cited by Callieri 2008: 58); Ali, Taj. 2001.  “Archaeological Survey of District Mardan in the North-West Frontier Province of  Pakistan.” Ancient Pakistan 14, 55–172.  </page> <page sequence="7">  old roads in the northwestern borderlands 235 within these cities during the early pre-Kusāsnsa periods, the prolifera- tion of stūpas and monasteries located outside of cities, close to transit  routes, or on hillsides above fertile agricultural zones demonstrates  that regional Buddhist expansion was intrinsically linked to conditions  of urban and agricultural prosperity.12 The distribution of Buddhist archaeological sites in Gandhāra  and adjacent regions of the Northwest reveals connections between  monastic networks and interregional itineraries through river valleys  and across mountain passes. Alfred Foucher, the “father of Gandhāra  studies” (Zwalf 1996: 74), proposed three stages for the “propagation  of Buddhism” in Gandhāra and Bactria from ca. 250 BCE to 150 CE: 1)  Buddhist institutions expanded from northern India to the plains  of Gandhāra between 250–150 BCE with the initial patronage of  Aśoka. 2)  Piedmont areas bordering the southern Hindu Kush and Himala- yas gradually converted to Buddhism by the end of the first century  CE at the time of the Kusāsnsas. 3)  After a “long interval of time had separated the evangelization of  the mountains from that of the plains” (Foucher 1942–1947: 2.279),  Buddhism crossed the Hindu Kush to the Oxus valley.13 Gérard Fussman also discusses a “relatively coherent (and possibly  illusory) tableau” (1994a: 20) reflected by archaeology and epigraphy  in which the first monasteries and dharmarājika stūpas were estab- lished near cities at the end of the third century BCE, followed by pro- gressive expansion into mountain areas from the second century BCE,  and considerably more success at the beginning in the first century.  These general models for understanding the growth of monasteries  and paths of transmission in the context of regional topography tend  to reify models of gradual diffusion from the Peshawar basin to the  surrounding hillsides and over mountain passes without adequately  accounting for the contemporaneous foundations of early stūpas at  12 Callieri, Pierfrancesco. 2006. “Buddhist Presence in the Urban Settlements of  Swāt, Second Century BCE to Fourth Century CE.” In Behrendt and Brancaccio 2006:  60–82. 13 I reconsider the stages proposed by Foucher in Neelis, Jason. 2002 [2006]. “La  Vieille Route Reconsidered: Alternative Paths for Early Transmission of Buddhism  Beyond the Borderlands of South Asia.” Bulletin of the Asia Institute 16, 146–147. </page> <page sequence="8"> 236 chapter four Taxila and Butkara. Foucher’s observation that dozens of Gandhāran  Buddhist monasteries are “threaded like pearls of a necklace” (1942:  1.156) along sinuous routes and often mark the openings of the prin- cipal passes between Gandhāra and Udsdsiyāna (Swat) draws attention  to systemic connections between the construction of Buddhist shrines  and travel routes, as was sometimes the case also for medieval Christian  monasteries.14 Other possible reasons for “siting” Buddhist monaster- ies in pleasant garden-like surroundings, in idyllic locations suitable  for meditation, or on promontories suitable for defensive purposes  are not to be excluded.15 While acknowledging that different types of  Gandhāran stūpas and monasteries were accommodated to the local  landscape for various reasons, it is still useful to quickly revisit Fouch- er’s early division of Buddhist archaeological remains in Gandhāra  situated along “two concentric lines of ruins” (1905: 1.11–12), with  sites on hills near cities of the Peshawar plain belonging to the inner  band and those located further away on routes through the mountains  between Gandhāra and Swat on the outer band. Archaeological sites of Buddhist stūpas and monasteries in the  Peshawar basin belonging to the inner radius tend to be located within  or just outside of urban settlement areas. Stūpas and monasteries were  rarely built inside of cities, but Buddhist sculptures excavated from  the Bālā Hisssāsr mound at Charsada (ancient Pusksalāvatī) and a large  stūpa-like structure in the adjacent city of Shaikhan Dsherī probably  dating from the second to fourth centuries CE are notable exceptions.16  The area of the “eight cities” (Sanskrit Astsasnagara / modern Hashtana- gar) near the confluence of the Kabul and Swat rivers (upstream from  Charsada) has also been a very productive region for Buddhist mate- 14 Marc Bloch’s comments (1961 [1949]: 1.63) about the location of medieval Euro- pean monasteries in proximity to trade routes may be applicable to the distribution of  Gandhāran Buddhist monasteries.  15 Schopen, Gregory. 2006. “The Buddhist ‘Monastery’ and the Indian Garden:  Aesthetics, Assimilations, and the Siting of Monastic Establishments.” Journal of the  American Oriental Society 126.4: 487–505 draws attention to aesthetic considerations  in the selection of locations for Indian Buddhist monasteries. Jansen 2008: 29 sug- gests that the stūpa and monastery at Nimogram on a high ridge above a side valley  in Swat may have been due to the suitability of this spot for meditation, but does not  exclude the possibility that such sites were chosen because they could be protected.  Shaw 2007: 143 also suggests that that the “fortress-like aspect” of some towered  platforms on hilltops around Sāñcī could indicate that these sites were selected for  monastic inhabitation because of their suitability for defense and surveillance. 16 Callieri 2006: 76–77; Callieri 2008: 58–59, fig. 1. </page> <page sequence="9">  old roads in the northwestern borderlands 237 rial remains, but it is likely that extensive monastic sites have not  been preserved because stone structures have been reused for modern  buildings or lie buried beneath agricultural fields and settlements.17  Another major urban Buddhist complex was the “Kanisksa vihāra” and  monumental stūpa at the site of Shāh-jī-kī Dsherī in the city of Pesha- war (ancient Purusaspura), which is referred to in Faxian’s account  as “over four hundered feet high . . . decorated with various kinds of  ornaments . . . [and] the most splendid in all of Jambudvīpa” (Li 2002:  170–171).18 While recent excavations at Gor Khuttree in the center of  Peshawar indicate that ancient Purusaspura was occupied as early as the  fourth century BCE, the Buddhist site at Shāh-jī-kī Dsherī is likely to  belong to Kanisksa’s period (after ca. 127 CE) or slightly later. Ancient  Varusaspura (probably localized at Shahr-i Bahlol) was another major  ancient city in Gandhāra where extensive Buddhist structural remains  and sculptures have been found since the nineteenth century, but the  site is not well preserved due to continued occupation.19 However, the  impressive remains of a large Buddhist shrine and monastic complex  that may have housed approximately 250–350 monks at its peak are  preserved at Takht-i Bahi on a ridge a few kilometers north of Shahr-i  Bahlol.20 Significant archaeological remains of stūpas and monasteries  located on ridges and hilltops overlooking the Peshawar plain directly  to the east and northeast of Takht-Bahi include Jamalgarhi, Sikri,  and Tareli.21 Other hilltop stūpas and monasteries at Mekhasanda  and Canaka Dsheri belonging to Foucher’s inner concentric circle are  17 Behrendt 2004: 24, 176 plausibly suggests that the relative paucity of Buddhist  archaeological remains in urban centers in the plains of the Peshawar Basin compared  with better preserved complexes in the foothills may be attributed to modern popula- tion and development pressure. 18 Kuwayama 1997 discusses the archaeological remains of the stūpa and monastery  at Shāh-jī-kī Dsherī in significant depth. Xuanzang also describes the shrine and neigh- boring monastery, along with narratives associating the construction of this complex  with Kanisksa (translated by Li 1996: 70–76). The so-called Kanisksa reliquary inscrip- tion (CKI 145) is discussed in Chapter 2, subchapter Paradigms of Patronage under  Kanisksa and Huvisksa, pp. 137–142. 19 Errington, Elizabeth. 1993. “In search of Pa-lu-sha, a city of the central Gand- hara plain.” Bulletin of the Asia Institute 7, 55–66 localizes Varusaspura (Pa-lu-sha in  Chinese accounts of a shrine commemorating the Viśvantara narrative) at Shahr-i  Bahlol. 20 Behrendt 2004: 181–190, figs. 44–53 provides a recent overview of excavations at  Takht-i Bahi since the nineteenth century. 21 Behrendt 2004: 191–199, figs. 61–63 (Jamalgarhi), 68–77 (Tareli), 90–91 (Sikri)  re-assesses the architectural and sculptural evidence from Tareli and Jamalgarhi, and  estimates that the peak monastic populations may have been over 200 at Tareli and  </page> <page sequence="10"> 238 chapter four clustered on a spur of the Karamar mountain above Shahbazgarhi  (where a set of Aśokan major rock edicts are inscribed).22 While the  dating of these Buddhist monastic sites largely based on discoveries of  coins, stylistic analysis of sculptures, and structural comparisons with  Buddhist monasteries in Taxila and Swat remains open to dispute,  their distribution can be explained by the ready availability of eco- nomic surpluses generated by prosperous urban settlements (ancient  Purusaspura, Pusksalāvatī, Varusaspura, and important crossroads at Shah- bazgarhi) and the agricultural production of the rich Peshawar plain. The outer band of the concentric line of Buddhist monasteries  ringing the Peshawar Basin closely corresponds to transit points over  mountain passes leading to Swat, Bajaur, Buner, and the upper Kabul  River valley. For example, the so-called Shpola stūpa and the related  monastic site of Ali Masjid just below the Khyber Pass leading to  Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan have received considerable attention  because they are located on the primary modern route.23 Noting that  many other Buddhist monasteries in the outer band mark the open- ing (“debouche”) of principal passes between ancient Gandhāra and  Udsdsiyāna, Foucher commented that “. . . the route would become the  unique reason for sanctuaries” (1942: 1.157).24 While the Malakand  Pass is the main modern passageway between the Peshawar basin and  the lower Swat valley, the routes through the Shahkot, Mora, and Kara- kar passes were lined with archaeological remains of Buddhist monas- teries at sites such as Loriyan Tangai, Sanghao, and Nathu.25 Materials  found at Kashmir Smast demonstrate that religious establishments on  these transregional lines of communication were not exclusively Bud- dhist monasteries.26 Another important Buddhist monastic at Ranigat  is located on a steep mountainside in the Tutalai district in the north- eastern Peshawar basin.27 The distribution of Buddhist and other reli- gious monasteries on transit routes through mountain passes between  about 100 at Jamalgarhi based on the number of cells built around the main court- yards and scattered among “mountain vihāras” on the hillsides.  22 Behrendt 2004: 177–180, figs. 64–67 (Mekhasanda). 23 Foucher 1942: 1.156, 159, n. 28; Luczanits 2008: 47, fig. 3. 24 “Parfois même, comme dans le cas extrême de Bâmiyân, la route sera l’unique  raison d’être des sanctuaries.” (Foucher 1942: 1.157) 25 Zwalf 1996: 14, 18, n. 35. 26 Nasim Khan, M. 2006.

Gandhāran Material and Literary Cultures Archaeological excavations of Buddhist stūpas and monasteries as well  as discoveries of Buddhist art, inscriptions, coins, and manuscripts  amply testify to high levels of cultural production in Gandhāra and  neighboring regions of the northwestern Indian subcontinent. The  innovative adoption of local, Indian, Iranian, Hellenistic, and Central  Asian features in Gandhāran Buddhist sculptures continues to attract  the interest of art historians and contemporary museum audiences.  According to Wladimir Zwalf: The huge quantity of surviving sculpture and large number of sites  reflect a powerful religious motivation in a region which, for some of  the duration of the style, formed part of a large empire and possessed  the commercial importance and consequent wealth for generous endow- ments. (1996: 20) Foucher’s masterly L’art gréco-bouddhique du Gandhāra (3 vols., 1905– 1951) remains a major touchstone for studies of Gandhāran Buddhist  art. His debate with A.K. Coomaraswamy concerning the primacy of  foreign Hellenistic influences versus indigenous Indian sources for  anthropomorphic depictions of the Buddha still resonates as a “con- frontation of colonizer and colonized” (Abe 1995: 82).28 Among art  historians who have reconsidered the role of Gandhāran artists in the  Marco, eds. 2000.

Commenting on Foucher’s penchant for finding Greek origins  in the style of Gandharan Buddhist art, Abe makes an interesting point: “Foucher was  in his own way attempting to enhance the standing of Gandharan art by incorporat- ing Graeco-Buddhist art into the universal history of World Art” (1995: 80). Also  see Chapter 2: Hellenistic Interactions, pp. 98–109, especially notes 121–127, for the  problem of determining the chronology and extent of Greek influence on Gandhāran  Budddhist art. </page> <page sequence="12"> 240 chapter four formation of the Buddha image and the significance of western Hel- lenistic influences in Gandhāran Buddhist art, Maurizio Taddei’s con- tributions are particularly noteworthy: We cannot of course content ourselves with a bare description of con- vergency or derivation phenomena in iconography and style. Nor can  we accept facts as mere links in a chain of stylistic evolution under the  impact of a foreign artisitic culture: this would amount to admitting  that Gandhāra was either a sort of cultural vacuum into which anything  could be poured (just for the look of things) or a Hellenized province the  inhabitants of which—though Buddhists!—regarded the Mediterranean  countries as their fatherland. (2003 [1969]: 1.155–156)29 While Foucher recognized the importance of Gandhāra as a signifi- cant zone of contact and cultural transmission between India, Iran,  Central Asia, and the Hellenistic world, his emphasis on foreign influ- ence tends to diminish Gandhāran impacts, since he tended to regard  ancient Gandhāra, Bactria, and Udsdsiyāna as transit zones between the  great civilizations of Europe and Asia.30 The prominent role played  by Gandhāra in the development and elaboration of Buddhist artis- tic styles, architectural features, and the production, standardization,  and transmission of texts written in Gāndhārī was connected to the  position of this region on trade routes between ancient India, Iran  and Central Asia, but it was hardly a “cultural vacuum” where these  cultures just crossed paths. Epigraphic and numismatic sources provide valuable evidence of  intrareligious developments and interreligious dynamics in ancient  Gandhāra. Kharostshsī inscriptions that record donations to Buddhist  communities by male and female lay patrons, local and regional rul- ers, and monks and nuns supply concrete data for studying onomastic  patterns, religious and political titles, and chronologies for regional  29 Original publication: “Harpocrates—Brahmā—Maitreya: A tentative interpreta- tion of a Gandharan relief from Swāt.” Dialoghi di Archeologica 3, 364–390. In “Some  Reflections on the Formation of the Buddha Image” (2003: 2.593–607), Taddei asks  “What is wrong with Foucher?” (596) in order to “. . . underscore the fact that some  of the premises are simply wrong” (597). He concludes that “Gandharan artists intro- duced a technique of narration which is neither fully Indian not fully Hellenistic,  though it was later widespread both in the Christian West and the Buddhist East; now  we see that they introduced an image of the Enlightened One which is neither fully  Indian nor fully Hellenistic; it was something new” (605).  30 Foucher 1942–1947: 2.368–371 (“Orient et Occident”); Olivier-Utard 2003 [1997]:  76 comments that Foucher’s views on Gandhāra and Afghanistan were conditioned by  geographical and political outlooks of the early twentieth century. </page> <page sequence="13">  old roads in the northwestern borderlands 241 history and art.31 Monastic affiliations of recipients of gifts reflect the  geographical distribution and relative influence of various Buddhist  ordination lineages.32 Coin hoards from Gandhāra help to reconstruct  relative chronologies of local, regional, and imperial dynasties and shed  light on cultural and religious symbol systems, since Indian, Iranian,  and Greek and Roman gods and goddesses depicted and labeled on  coins illustrate cross-cultural “transformation of image and symbol”  (Errington and Cribb 1992).33 Recent acquisitions within the last fifteen years of diverse collections  of Kharostshsī manuscripts belonging mostly to periods from the first  to third century CE scholarly have broadened scholarly understand- ing of the scope of Buddhist literature in Gāndhārī.34 Along with an  incomplete scroll of a Gāndhārī version of the Dharmapada recovered  in the 1890s near Khotan,35 “. . . these fragments are likely to be the  oldest Buddhist manuscripts, as well as the oldest Indian manuscripts,  known to date” (Salomon 1999a: xv).

According to Salomon, “. . . the different versions of a text such as the  AG [Anavatapta-gāthā] should not necessarily be considered as exclusively or even  primarily sectarian in character” but “this is not to say that school affiliations are  irrelevant or meaningless for the issue at hand here, namely an understanding of the  history of the AG and its versions” (2008a: 14). </page> <page sequence="15">  old roads in the northwestern borderlands 243 mon 1999: 178) in the first three centuries CE, including some early  Mahāyāna sūtras.42 The employment of various media to transmit the Buddha’s teach- ings in written and visual forms raises several questions about relation- ships between the regional literary and material cultures during the  first centuries CE. The material and historical contexts gleaned from  inscriptions and coins have aided in the interpretation of manuscript  fragments, but it remains to be seen if advances in textual studies of  the manuscripts help to clarify issues in Gandhāran art and archae- ology. While material evidence indicates unique hybrid regional fea- tures characteristic of a borderland environment, the extent to which  Gandhāran Buddhist literary texts are culturally distant or relatively  close to Indian Buddhist traditions varies significantly, and depends  on the relationship of particular texts to versions in other Buddhist  languages. While some narrative texts, commentaries, and scholas- tic treatises in the British Library are clearly original compositions  without direct literary parallels, other texts may have been translated,  transposed, or transformed versions of texts similar but not identi- cal to versions preserved in Pāli and Sanskrit, or another hypothetical  Buddhist Middle Indic dialect. Further comparative work on recently- discovered Kharostshsī manuscripts may help to support if not prove  the ‘Gāndhārī hypothesis’ of a link with early Chinese translations of  Buddhist texts.43 What these textual and other artifacts reveal about  the role of Gandhāra as a contact zone between South Asia and Cen- tral Asia remains open to speculation, but a full synthesis of archaeo- logical, art historical, epigraphic, numismatic, and manuscript sources  is beyond the scope of this investigation of routes for religious trans- mission in Gandhāra. 42 Allon, Mark and Richard Salomon. 2010. “New Evidence for the Mahāyāna  in Early Gandhāra.” Eastern Buddhist 41.1:1–22 discuss Kharostshsī fragments of the  Bhadrakalpika-sūtra, Bodhisattvapitaska-sūtra, and Sarvapunsyasamuccayasamādhi- sūtra in the Schøyen collection, and Strauch 1998: 123–125 presents the preliminary  results of an examination of a Gāndhārī text resembling the Aksosbhyavyūha-sūtra, the  longest text in the Bajaur collection preserved in ca. 640 lines, which is an “indepen- dent source of the early variety of ‘Pure Land’ Buddhism which centers around the  Buddha Aksosbhya and his Abhirati Buddha field” (125). 43 Boucher 1998 critically examines the evidence for this hypothesis with regard to  Dharmaraksas’s Chinese translation of the Saddharma-punsͯarikā sūtra, which is not  (so far) attested among Kharostshsī manuscript discoveries. </page> <page sequence="16"> 244 chapter four Gandhāran Nodes and Networks Multiple nodes of Buddhist transmission within Gandhāra belonged  to a complex network with many itineraries for connecting the cos- mopolitan frontier with the major arteries of South and Central Asia.  Feeder routes north of Gandhāra led to Swat, Buner, Bajaur, Chitral,  and the valleys of the upper Indus and Gilgit rivers, where capillary  networks across the Karakorum range provided direct inks to the  southern silk routes of the Tarim Basin.44 Other paths leading south  from Gandhāra criss-crossed the foothills and passes through the  Suleiman mountains to reach Kandahar in southeastern Afghanistan  (ancient Alexandria in Arachosia), and yet other itineraries connected  Gandhāra with the southern Punjab and the lower Indus valley. In  the Gandhāran core area of the Peshawar basin, the ancient urban  center of Pusksalāvatī (near modern Charsada) probably functioned  as an entrepôt for commercial traffic with Nagarāhāra and the upper  Kabul valley (in eastern Afghanistan) via the Michni Pass or other pas- sageways through the territories of modern Mohmand or Bajaur ter- ritories rather than the Khyber Pass, which is now the primary artery.  Although the archaeological foundations are significantly earlier, by  the Kusāsnsa period Purusaspura (Peshawar) had become a major hub  for exchanges between Gandhāra, Nagarahāra, and regions south of the  Hindu Kush when itineraries on the southern side of the Kabul valley  were more widely utilized. Other urban centers of ancient Gandhāra,  such as Varusaspura near Takht-i Bahi and Shahbazgarhi in the district  of modern Mardan, occupied nodal positions where east-west arter- ies through the Peshawar basin intersected with multiple north-south  feeder routes from Udsdsiyāna (Swat). Udabhansͯapura (modern Hund),  an extensive archaeological site in the eastern Peshawar plain which  served as the later capital of the Hindu Sāshis, was located at the most  important crossing of the Indus River for interregional connections  with Taxila and the Punjab. 44 Capillary routes in northern Pakistan and the silk routes in eastern Central Asia  are detailed in chapters 5–6. </page> <page sequence="17">  old roads in the northwestern borderlands 245 Udsdsiyāna in the Swat Valley Gandhāran Buddhists evidently maintained close connections with  counterparts in the Swat valley of ancient Udsdsiyāna, a famous region  with an especially rich archaeological, artistic, epigraphic, and liter- ary heritage with seemingly innumerable remains of Buddhist stūpas,  monasteries, and rock carvings. Since the 1950s, Italian and Pakistani  archaeologists have surveyed and excavated major Buddhist sites in  the lower Swat valley, including stūpas and monasteries clustered  around Butkara and Barikot.45 Their surveys indicate that Buddhist  monasteries concentrated on communication routes and connected  with hydraulic systems were integrated into the prosperous mercantile  and agricultural economy of the Swat valley. Based on the distribu- tion of over 120 monasteries, a “radial model” in which Buddhist sites  radiated outward from the older center at Butkara to inner valleys on  the slopes of Mount Ilam above the modern cities of Mingora and  Manglawar can be distinguished from a polygonal “multiradial settle- ment typology” in which the Buddhist monastic network expanded  into the Karakar, Najigram, and Kandak valleys south of Barikot.46  Along the “ancient communications route” (Olivieri 2008: 294) lead- ing to the Karakar Pass, monastic complexes are generally situated  above the alluvial fan of fertile agricultural land and many of the most  important sites, such as Tokar Dara, Najigram, and Tokdara are con- nected with dams and irrigation structures, while other more remote  sites such as Amluk-dara and Abbasaheb-china are built near water  sources (springs and lakes) close to the head of the valley.

The “silent presence” of “mountain people” is  reflected in rock paintings, petroglyphs and shelters that may belong  to a “local religious substratum” (Filigenzi 2008: 300–301).47 Old Roads Across the Hindu Kush (Map 4.2: Archaeological Sites in  Afghanistan) An extension of the Uttarāpatha called the “ancient route” (vieille  route) by Foucher connected Gandhāra and Taxila with Bactria, thus  linking South Asia with the overland network of the “silk routes” in  western Central Asia.48 Extrapolating from literary sources, archaeo- logical discoveries, and art historical analysis, Foucher contended that  this “Old Road” across the Hindu Kush of Afghanistan was the primary  artery for foreign invasions into northwestern India and the movement  of Buddhism beyond the Indian subcontinent to Central Asia. In his  description of the Old Road through the Hindu Kush of Afghanistan,  Foucher acknowledged that this “grande-route” was not the only route  between western Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent: We do not pretend that the route which we will describe was the only  one possible or the only one that existed: we only say that it was once  the overland ‘highway’ between the West and the interior of the [Indian]  peninsula . . .

Kapiśa Abundant finds of ancient coins and numerous archeological remains  of Buddhist stūpas attest to the commercial and cultural significance  of the plateau of modern Begram (ancient Kapiśa).53 Ivory sculptures  imported from western India, Roman glassware, and Chinese lacquer  were among the spectacular discoveries of DAFA excavations between  1937–1946.54 The results of French excavations of Begram support  Foucher’s assertion that “. . . it commanded the main routes between  India and High Asia” (1942: 1.139), although Sanjyot Mehendale dis- putes the characterization of the findspot as a Kusāsnsa royal palace and  instead proposes that the materials belonged to a commercial store- room.55 Begram was a major node for interregional trade and tribute  50 Foucher 1942: 1.34–35, 148–154. 51 Ball and Gardin 1982: 1.116–118; Barthoux, Jules. 1933.

Bamiyan The route to Bamiyan in central Afghanistan was “the true highway  of another time” (Foucher 1942: 1.25). Due to its location in a valley  connecting the Oxus and Indus watersheds via the Kara Kotal, Dan- dan-Shikan, Ak-Robat, and Shibar passes across the western Hindu  Kush, Bamiyan was a particularly important place for traders and  other travelers to halt for provisions.56 According to Xuanzang, who  visited Bamiyan in 629 CE, “When merchants coming and going hap- pen to witness visions of heavenly deities, whether as good omens or  as predictions of disaster, they worship the deities to pray for blessed- ness” (Li 1996: 38).57 Perhaps the devotional need to make religious  offerings before attempting or immediately after completing difficult  journeys over dangerous mountain passes stimulated the growth of  Bamiyan.58 Buddhist manuscript fragments from Bamiyan demon- strate that both artistic and literary cultures flourished there for several  centuries, beginning in the second or third century CE.59 Xuanzang’s  visit provides a terminus ante quem in the early seventh century for the  worship of the colossal standing Buddhas (demolished in 2001) and a  Mahāparinirvānsa Buddha, which is now being excavated by Zemary- 56 Ball and Gardin 1982: 49–51 (no. 100: Bāmiyān); Foucher 1942: 1.129–137;  Godard, André, Y.

Bactria The “vieille route” traced by Alfred Foucher extended to Bactria, a  major node for transregional overland trade located between the south- ern bank of the Oxus River and the Hindu Kush. Bactria is linked to  Margiana (Merv) in the west, to Termez, Payon Kourgan and via the  “Iron Gates” to the Sogdian emporium near Samarkand in the north,  and across valleys in Badakhshan, Wakhan and the Pamir mountains  to the Tarim Basin in eastern Central Asia.62 The proverbial “thousand  cities of Bactria” referred to by Strabo (15.686) and Justin (41.1.8, 4.5)  indicate that this region was known for its prosperity, which resulted  from its central position on trade routes between northwestern India,  Iran, Central Asia, and western China, and its fertility, which was  largely due to a vast irrigation system in existence since the second  millennium BCE.63 According to Strabo (relying on Apollodorus of  Artemita): 60 Results of the ongoing excavations were discussed by Buffler, Eléonore. 2009.  “Spreading of some Buddhist Architectural Designs between Afghanistan and China:  The Case of the Cruciform Stupa” in a paper presented at the Buddhism Across Asia  conference in Singapore (17 February, 2009). Numismatic evidence of Kushano-Sasa- nian coins found at the site may suggest that the main stūpa belongs to a period before  the Kidāras and Alchon Huns controlled routes through the Hindu Kush beginning  in the fifth century.  61 Kuwayama 2002: 159, map 17 (“Bamiyan and its Buddhist Activities”). Kuwaya- ma’s assertion that earlier routes between Central Asia and Gandhara through the  Karakorum and eastern Hindu Kush were “completely discarded” (1987: 725) is  directly contradicted by the evidence of Buddhist inscriptions and petroglyphs from  the upper Indus region discussed in Chapter 5. 62 Foucher 1942: 1.7, fig. 2; Leriche, P., Sh.

Gentelle.  1997. “Bilan de campagne 1997 de la MAFOuz de Bactriane.” Bulletin of the Asia  Institute 11, 17–52. 63 References to the “thousand cities of Bactria” are discussed by Tarn 1951: 118– 124 and Karttunen 1997a: 271. Foucher observes that population density is noted in all  of the ancient sources, but “Ne cherchez pas ailleurs que dans ces centaines de petites  bourgades rurales les ‘milles villes’ de Justin” (1942: 15). Tarn attributes the “thousand  cities” to the rise in status of “serf villages” and claims that “the evolution of the serf  village into the organized and quasi-autonomous township was the most important  work done by the Greeks in Asia” (1951: 124). Karttunen disputes Tarn’s assertions  </page> <page sequence="23">  old roads in the northwestern borderlands 251 The Greeks who caused Bactria to revolt [from the Seleukids] grew so  powerful on account of the fertility of the country that they became mas- ters, not only of Ariana, but also of India (11.11.1, translation by Jones  1917–1933: 5.279).64 Foucher referred to a “Bactrian Mirage” because he was unable to  identify Hellenistic layers during his excavations at Balkh. Although  he did not find what he expected in Balkh, the survival of a Hellenistic  outpost at Ai Khanum, which is not located on the main artery of the  Old Road, essentially confirms some aspects of his hypothesis of Greek  cultural impact in ancient Bactria.65 Routes of Buddhist Missionaries and Pilgrims to and from Gandhāra Many if not most eminent Indian Buddhist monks in Chinese hagiog- raphies compiled by Sengyou (c. 515), Huijiao (c. 530), and Daoxuan  (664) either came from the northwestern frontiers of South Asia or  traveled through this region on their overland journeys to Central  Asia and China.66 Several figures are associated with the region of  Jibin, which is often translated as Kashmir and sometimes as Kapiśa  (located near Begram), but the term often refers more generally to  the northwestern regions of South Asia, including areas of modern  northern Pakistan. While literary accounts specify that monks from  Jibin such as Buddhayaśas, Dharmayaśas, Dharmamitra, Vimalāksas,  and Punsyatara traveled overland to Chinese centers via the Tarim  Basin, other eminent figures including Buddhabhadra, Gunsavarman  and Buddhajīva followed circuitous maritime itineraries.

Some hagiographical accounts provide interesting details about the  long-distance journeys of eminent monks who traveled through north- western India to Central Asia and China. For example, a Gandhāran  monk named Jinagupta from ancient Peshawar (Purusaspura) traveled  through Afghanistan (Kapiśa) and the Pamir range to Tashkurgan, via  the southern Tarim Basin to Khotan, and through the Gansu corridor  to Xian.67 A western Indian monk named Dharmagupta also traveled  though Afghanistan (Kapiśa), across the Hindu Kush, and via Tash- kurgan, Kashgar, and Kucha to Xian and Loyang.68 Dharmaksesma,  a master of protective spells (dhāransīs) from the “Middle Country”  (Madhyadeśa), studied in Jibin before going to Kucha and the court of  the Northern Liang ruler at Lanzhou, where he was murdered in 433.69  Based on his survey of biographies of Buddhist monks who came to  China during this period, Kuwayama observes: . . . most of the eminent translators of Buddhist texts in China were closely  related to Ji-bin in the point that they studied the Buddhist philosophy  there, whether they may have been natives of Ji-bin or not. It is also  likely that those intending to proceed from Ji-bin to China inevitably  took the routes leading to Kashgar and farther to Qyzyl [near Kucha].  (1987: 707) Other Buddhists from China and Central Asia came to the northwest- ern Indian subcontinent to study for extended periods. Probably the  most famous of them was Kumārajīva (344–413 CE), who traveled  from Kucha to Jibin with his mother when he was eight or nine years  old, and after three years returned via Kashgar to Kucha.70 Accounts of Chinese pilgrims supply geographical details and infor- mation about Buddhist communities and shrines on long-distance  routes used by other Buddhist travelers as well as merchants, dip- lomatic missions and sometimes soldiers who traveled to and from  South Asia. The famous Chinese traveler Faxian described numerous  shrines in Udsdsiyāna and Gandhāra around 400 CE.71 Zhemong and  67 Bagchi 1927: 276–9, 1938: 446–57. 68 Bagchi 1938: 464–467. 69 Bagchi 1927: 212–223; Zürcher 1999: 42–43. 70 Bagchi 1927: 1.178 ff.; 1981: 42–4; Kuwayama 1987: 706. 71 Faxian’s sojourn in the Northwest is commented upon by Deeg, Max. 2005.

Xuanzang provides a detailed report of his  journey from China to India from 627–645, although his information  about Buddhist communities in the northwestern frontiers is some- times based on secondhand reports rather than firsthand observa- tions. Zürcher cautioned that Chinese pilgrims, Indian missionaries  and translators memorialized in hagiographies represent only “the tiny  tip of the iceberg, the élite of scholar monks” (1999: 18) and suggested  that many more anonymous foreign monks fulfilled roles as thauma- turges, meditation teachers, and ordination experts (1999: 52–7). Like  the more famous figures whose long-distance journeys are sometimes  outlined in religious biographies, these itinerant monks followed over- land networks which connected the Tarim Basin to the northwestern  frontiers of South Asia. While Chinese hagiographies about the travels  of the great monks typically focus on Buddhist relics, previous-birth  stories, images, and festivals localized at shrines and monasteries, sim- ilar itineraries between the northwestern Indian subcontinent and the  Western Regions of China were followed by merchants with worldly  goals of journeying for material profit. Domestication of Gandhāran Buddhism From the perspectives of local devotees and Chinese pilgrims who vis- ited regional Buddhist shrines between the 5th–7th century, Gandhāra,  Udsdsiyāna, and Bamiyan were central hubs rather than marginal periph- eries of the Buddhist world. The Chinese accounts reflect processes of  “domestication” whereby local Buddhist inhabitants adopted previous  lives of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and relics of Śākyamuni Buddha to  local settings in the regional landscape of the northwestern border- chinesischen buddhistischen Pilgermönchs über seine Reise nach Indien mit Übersetzung  des Textes.

Although the historical Buddha clearly  did not visit this region during his lifetime, the Mūlasarvāstivādin  Vinaya includes apocryphal stories about Śākyamuni’s “conquest of  dharma” (dharmavijaya) in Gandhāra, Kashmir, and other northern  regions where, accompanied by Vajrapānsi, he subjugated local Yaksass  and Nāgas.74 Literary sources regard a disciple of Ananda named Mad- hyantika (Majjhantika in Pāli) as the earliest Buddhist missionary to  Kashmir, the Indus Valley, and Gandhāra.75 Although these accounts  and narratives of the Buddha’s previous lives, his conquests, and Mad- hyantika’s mission to Gandhāra are objectively dismissed as ahistorical  imaginings, they reflect Buddhist strategies to establish a locative con- nection between Gandhāra and Bodhisattvas, Śākyamuni Buddha, and  prominent figures within the Buddhist tradition belonging to various  past periods. Abbreviated summaries of avadāna and pūrvayoga stories about  Gandhāran historical figures from the first century CE also reflect  the domestication of Buddhist narratives in Gandhāra in Kharostshsī  73 Lewis, Todd. 1993. “Newar-Tibetan Trade and the Domestication of the  Simshalasārthabāhu Avadāna” History of Religions 33.2: 135–160 proposes that “domes- tication” is a “universal process in the successful missionary adaptation of Buddhism  in venues throughout Asia” (1993: 135). This “dialectical historical process by which a  religious tradition is adapted to a region or ethnic group’s socioeconomic and cultural  life” (Lewis 2000: 3–4) overlaps somewhat with a more general model of “domestica- tion of the san֛gha” elaborated by Strenski, Ivan. 1983. “On Generalized Exchange  and the Domestication of the Sangha.” Man n.s. 18.3, 463–477. Strenski views domes- tication as an early and ongoing maintenance of residential, ritual, social, political,  and economic relationships between the sansgha and society through symbolic and  material exchanges, although he criticizes a “romantic vein” (1983: 464) which links  domestication to the decline of a ‘pure’ san֛gha of world renouncers. Strenski’s criti- cism is directed at Carrithers, Michael. 1979. “The Modern Ascetics of Lanka and the  Pattern of Change in Buddhism.” Man n.s. 14.2: 294–310, who juxtaposes eremitic  forest-dwelling ideals of ‘pure’ renunciation to the practices of town- or village-dwell- ing monks who interact with society by serving as preachers and literary specialists.  74 Lamotte 1988: 679, n. 67 [1958: 752–3]; Przyluski, Jean. 1914. “Le nord-ouest de  l’Inde dans le Vinaya des Mūla-Sarvāstivāda et les texts apparentés.” Journal Asiatique  11 ser., vol. 4: 493–568. 75 Fussman 1994a: 44, n. 162 refers to literary accounts in the Mūlasarvāstivāda- vinaya, Divyāvadāna, and Avadāna-Kalpalatā as “pious fictions” which are not spe- cific to Gandhāra. </page> <page sequence="27">  old roads in the northwestern borderlands 255 manuscript fragments.76 Not surprisingly, Saka characters play impor- tant roles in many of these narratives. For example, Aśpavarman, a  member of the Apraca dynasty who is attested in first century CE coins  and an inscribed silver saucer from Taxila, helps to make arrange- ments for sheltering monks during the rainy season with a charac- ter named Zadamitra.77 In the following avadāna, Zadamitra vows to  obtain individual enlightenment after discussing the disappearance of  the true law with a monk.78 Timothy Lenz (2003: 182–191) relates this  avadāna to a pūrvayoga story set in Taxila summarizing a dialogue  between a Saka and a monk about the disappearance of the “True  Dharma” (saddharma), which concludes with the Saka making a vow  to become an Arhat. The favorable depictions of Zadamitra and the  Saka as aspiring devotees of Buddhism in these Gāndhārī narratives  present an interesting contrast to other Buddhist ex eventu prophe- cies associating the disappearance of the Dharma with an invasion of  Kauśāmbī in northern India by foreign kings, including Sakas, Par- thians, and Greeks.79 Another very fragmentary story explicitly set in  Gandhāra (gadharami) involves a ‘Great Satrap’ (Mahaksastra(*pa))  named Jihoniga, who is also known from first century CE coins and an  inscribed vessel from Taxila.80 Although these original compositions of  avadāna and pūrvayoga story summaries with contemporary historical  figures present interpretive difficulties due to the lack of direct literary  parallels, the incorporation of these characters into Buddhist narra- tives was likely intended to acknowledge their religious patronage and  to appeal to a regional audience. Étienne Lamotte dismissed the value of these types of narratives for  illuminating local traditions, since in his view the domestication of  legendary stories merely reflects a process in which pan-Indian Bud- dhist narratives have lost their original local associations in processes  of oral and written transmission when they become linked with places  outside of the Buddha’s homeland: 76 Neelis, Jason. 2008. “Historical and Geographical Contexts for Avadānas in  Kharostshsī Manuscripts.” In Gombrich and Scherrer-Schaub 2008: 151–167. 77 Salomon 1999a: 145–149; Lenz 2010: 85–93. 78 Lenz 2003: 203–208, Appendix 3: Avadāna of Zadamitra; Lenz 2010: 82–89. 79 Nattier 1991: 127. 80 Lenz 2010: 95–98; Salomon 1999a: 141–145 (Frag. 2.1r is reproduced on the cover  of Salomon 1999a).  </page> <page sequence="28"> 256 chapter four The stories, tales, legends and fables, undergoing a perpetual interchange  of ideas, were conveyed from one end of the world to the other and, if  they ever had any local characteristics which might betray their origin,  they soon eliminated them and acquired a universal aspect which made  them to the taste and within the reach of everybody. (1988: 442 [1958:  487])81 Gérard Fussman also argues that Gandhāran Buddhism was no differ- ent in terms of ideology from Gangetic Buddhism.82 While Gandhāran  Buddhists certainly sought to link their own traditions to the Indian  Buddhist homeland, it was also necessary to compose new stories and  adapt other narratives to local settings in order to attract potential  patrons, including Sakas, Kusāsnsas, and Huns. Conclusion Gandhāran Buddhist manuscripts, inscriptions, art, and architec- ture clearly reflect the cosmopolitan culture of the frontiers between  ancient India, Iran and Central Asia. Gandhāran Buddhism blended  South Asian and exogenous features from the cultural environment  of the northwestern frontier. The long period of rapprochement with  peoples and cultures foreign to South Asia probably strengthened the  appeal of Gandhāran Buddhism in adjacent regions of Bactria and the  Tarim Basin. As the primary zone of contact and encounter between  India and the outside world, Gandhāra provided a springboard for the  transmission of Buddhism beyond South Asia. 81 Lamotte elsewhere comments that “Alongside Vārānsasī . . . Gandhāra was the  only one to play the game—somewhat puerile, but profitable to the places of pilgrim- age—of the acclimatization of the legends” (1988: 335 [1958: 367]). 82 “. . . sur le plan idéologique, le bouddhisme du Gandhāra ne se distingue en rien  du bouddhisme gangétique” (Fussman 1994: 43). </page> </plain_text>
