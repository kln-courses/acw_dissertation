<plain_text><page sequence="1">DECONSTRUCTION AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE ANTHONY APPIAH Christopher Norris. THE DECONSTRUCTIVE TURN: ESSAYS IN THE RHETORIC OF PHILOSOPHY. London and New York: Methuen, 1983. 1 Deconstruction entered the Anglo-American academy in departments of literary studies, transposed from its Continental origins in the institutional con- text of philosophy. Though it grew out of a critique of phenomenological texts, its dissemination in the anglophone world has been principally connected with the rise of "deconstructive criticism," which usually addresses texts which are not canonically philosophical. Indeed, because the mainstream philosophy of the anglophone world-analytic philosophy-has refused to recognize its legitimacy - insisting, as often as not, on its essential foreignness- deconstruc- tion has been allowed to settle here only on the condition of internal exile. That it should have found the philosophic environment of the anglophone world inhospitable is hardly surprising. When, in the early part of this century, Frege replaced Hegel as the tutelary spirit of English philosophy, the ethos of Continental historicist modes of thought was largely extirpated from the anglo- phone terrain. Yet these institutional circumstances have genuine significance for deconstruction in the anglophone world. For the intellectual impress of analytic philosophy is an inescapable feature of the institutional climate of England and America; and the peculiar dislocation of anglophone deconstruc- tion cannot be regarded as marginal if, as Derrida advises, the very logic of deconstruction requires it to address not only the discourses of philosophy but also "what is wrongly seen as their external lodging, the extrinsic conditions of their exercise." Derrida's injunction is clear: deconstruction must attend to the "institutional conditions and forms of instruction." (See Derrida, La VWrite en Peinture 23-24; see also Samuel M. Weber, "After Eight: Remarking Glyph" 236-37- hereafter RG.) And it is just the particular "forms and conditions of teaching and learning" that obtain in the Anglo-American academy that make the way literary theory positions itself in relation to analytic philosophy of crucial moment in the enterprise of anglophone deconstruction. Christopher Norris's The Deconstructive Turn squarely addresses this issue, opening with the question that the book is meant to answer. "What might be the consequences for philosophy if its texts were exposed to the kinds of reading made possible by recent developments in literary criticism?" What he has in mind is to bring "that particular practice of textual close-reading which goes under the name of deconstruction" [1] to texts in which contemporary Anglo-American philosophers who have not hitherto caught the literary eye ad- dress relatively "technical" questions. Such texts, Norris asserts, "actively resist" [3] this kind of reading; and, to be sure, few have been so read before. diacritics / spring 1986 49</page><page sequence="2">................... .......... ..... . !iiiii~iiiiiiiiiiii~ii -iiii K -Miiiii il~iiiiApiiii i~ii~i!ii% iiiiiiiiiiii~Wiift iiiiiiiiiii~iiiiiiii~i......................-------------iiiiiii</page><page sequence="3">I come to The Deconstructive Turn as a practitioner of analytic philosophy of language, interested in literary theory, puzzled by some of its claims, and able to imagine various kinds of useful engagement between philosophy and literary theory. What I want to do in this essay is to examine the way Norris reads some texts of analytic philosophy from within the realm of literary theory, in order to determine whether his book offers philosophy and deconstruction a route to mutual comprehension. Because the middle chapters of this book deal either with works outside analytic philosophy (Kierkegaard, Benjamin, Livingston Lowes) or with analytic philosophy that has often been discussed by literary theory already (J. L. Austin), I have focused my attention on the surrounding chapters, which address Ryle, and Wittgenstein and Kripke. Norris does, in fact, serve notice that he has analytic readers in mind: "The chapters in this book . . . explore the various ways in which philosophy reveals, negotiates or represses its own inescapable predicament as written language. That such problems should engage the interest of philosophers in the 'other,' analytic tradition is a message which I hope will be born out in the reading" [12]. What The Deconstructive Turn seems to offer those in my position is the chance of coming to understand what is at stake in deconstruction by seeing it at work in a familiar body of texts. If these essays are to bear out Norris's "message," however, they must satisfy two condi- tions. First of all, they must provide evidence of a secure understanding of the philosophical arguments Norris engages-an understanding secure enough to make it possible for a reasonably sympathetic analytic philosopher of language to be able to recognize that it is his or her discourse that is being engaged. And second, once it is established that analytic philosophy of language is indeed what is being engaged, it should be engaged in a way that is potentially of interest not merely to the deconstructor but also, as Norris promises, to the analytic philosopher. Now to catch the interest of analytic philosophers one must provide and not just mention arguments; and this requires that Norris should do more than appeal to what Derrida has "shown." For given the way philosophers see their business, "as X has shown" ought only to work for someone who has been through X's arguments: and for whatever reason, most analytic philosophers have never, as it were, "let X = Derrida." 2 Norris's approach to this "other," analytic tradition proceeds by means of two distinct strategies. The first is one of accommodation. It seeks to assimilate analytic philosophy to post-structuralist theorizings; and it searches for points of resemblance, the "striking parallels" Norris claims repeatedly to have located. Norris believes, for example, that "recent developments on the analytic front have thrown up problems very similar to those essayed in the texts of deconstruction. One example can be seen in the attempt of philosophers like Quine to purge their discourse of all dependence on mentalistic or a priori concepts and categories" [7]. There follows a summary of some of Quine's anti-positivist strictures and an exposition of his image of our conceptual scheme as a "web of belief." Norris then continues: I would not want to press too far with the comparison between Derrida and Quine.... Nevertheless it is clear that Quine, like Derrida, perceives a covert metaphysics at work in traditional ways of conceiving philosophy; also that he shares the deconstructionist will to demystify language by removing the appeal to some ultimate ground of concept or meaning. Derrida's critique of logocentric assump- tions is not, after all, so far removed from Quine's insistent refusal to entertain talk of "meaning" outside the particular, context-governed instances of sense. [! can find no Quinean doctrine of which this is a plausible paraphrase-auth.] Others, after Quine, have pressed yet further in this principled mistrust of hypostatized semantic criteria. [9] This passage illustrates an interesting feature of Norris's style in this accommodating mood: when a connection is made, he himself points out that we should not take it too far. So we are prompted to ask whether the likenesses that Norris divines are philosophically 50</page><page sequence="4">significant rather than just critical trompe I'oeil. I think those who have read both Derrida and Quine will largely view the effort to assimilate them with the skepticism that any attempt to assimilate incommensurable positions must provoke. And granted that Derrida and Quine say different things with different purposes about different subjects, Norris's "textual indeci- sion"- his making and unmaking of comparisons- is unsurprising. In general, Norris's attempts at making analytic philosophy "look like" post-structuralist theorizing-and vice-versa- produce either a distortion of the analytic argument or a trivialization of his own post-structuralist claims. In the form that enables him to smuggle it into analytic philosophy, deconstruction is, as it were, nothing to write home about. But this is only half the story. Norris's other strategy- perhaps the more conventional one-turns from dialogue to combat. Here the object is to topple analytic philosophy from its high horse; to demonstrate its lack of self-awareness, to show up the textual waywardness that haunts its writings, ever implicated in the blunder of logocentrism. Norris here assumes the familiar stance of those who would, in the words of Samuel Weber, "construe the rela- tion of deconstruction to philosophy as one of essential negativity, as the overcoming of philosophy, in order for deconstruction to emerge as a valorization of literature and of literary criticism .. ." [RG 235]. For in a sense, as Norris himself observes, the essays "repre- sent the revenge of literary theory on that old tradition of philosophic disdain or condescen- sion" [3]. This dual approach lends an odd contrapuntal texture to Norris's essays, and it will help mark our way if we keep it in mind. For he has, as it were, two voices. One of them is cautious and almost demure; the other, bold, apocalyptic. The first is the voice that tells us he "would not want to press too far with the comparison between Derrida and Quine" [8]; or cautions us that, despite common "motives," Israel Scheffler's "aim is very different from Der- rida's" [10]. A voice, this, with its qualifications and concessions, that we can confidently place in English academic discourse. This is Christopher. The second announces: "The scan- dal of deconstruction, simply put, is its habit of uncovering a disjunct relationship between logic and language, the order of concepts and the order of signification" [7]. This voice is French - in England, there are no intellectual scandals, only scandals about intellectuals. It is, so to speak, the voice of Christophe. In practice, Norris's rhetorical counterpositions are self-subverting. With bemusing regularity, the boldest remarks are succeeded by crippling qualifications; heady assertions are quietly decapitated by parenthetical asides; Christophe's promises are emptied out by Christopher's reservations. In the sense that this book is an unresolved dialogue between these voices, it epitomizes, unhappily, the relations between deconstruction and the philosophy of language. 3 These problems figure prominently in the first chapter of the book, which offers a reading of Gilbert Ryle whose purpose is to allow Norris to argue for "a new way of looking at the relation between French and Anglo-American philosophy of language."' Discernibly, however, there are really two dialogues conducted with the works of Gilbert Ryle; both Christopher and Christophe must have their say. Christopher has the first word; for Norris starts by suggesting that there is "a very real af- finity between Ryle's philosophy and Derrida's practice" [19]. At this first level, what is pro- posed is a reading of Ryle as "a deconstructor of ordinary-language philosophy" [21]. That should, of course, be illuminating for the analytic philosopher, raised with a view about what Ryle was up to. 1 Having characterized deconstruction as "French philosophy of language," Norris immediately proceeds to insist, sensibly enough, that deconstruction and the philosophy of language are not "the same activities under different names." What Norris says of a passage in Ryle will serve to describe his own rhetorical progression: "What it actually performs. . . is a backwards unravelling of its own apparent logic" [29]. diacritics / spring 1986 51</page><page sequence="5">According to Norris, Ryle's "object is not simply- as with Austin - to unpack the hidden assumptions of a given piece of language, but to press them to a point where they visibly buckle under the strain of their own (hitherto unnoticed) ambiguities. In this sense Ryle is a deconstructor of ordinary-language philosophy" [21, my emphasis]. It is as if Norris (as Christopher) is inviting the philosopher of language- the straight-man, the bourgeois gentil- homme de nos jours-to exclaim: "Par ma foi! Then I have been talking deconstruction all these years without knowing it." To this invitation, however, it would be natural to reply "Au contraire, it is you who have just started talking philosophical analysis." Christopher's gesture of reconciliation compromises the significance of Christophe's claims. In any event, it simply doesn't seem very profitable to view Ryle as anticipating Derrida because he noticed (along with, for example, Hume and Sextus Empiricus) that "common sense" statements often con- ceal contradictions that a full drawing out of their "logical entailments" [21] may reveal. A version of deconstruction trivial enough to accommodate Ryle would seem to be of little in- terest to anybody. What Norris shunts aside in order to achieve this assimilation is a series of crucial distinctions. Thus, although Derrida and de Man do attend to the drawing out of implica- tions, they do not draw them only, as Ryle does, from the propositional meaning, from what de Man calls the "grammatical"; so that Norris's talk of "ambiguity" [21]- which is precisely a propositional or "grammatical" phenomenon - is more than a little misleading. Deconstruc- tors do indeed draw implications: but not simply from the grammar of a text, nor, as a more traditional critic might, from the figures or tropes, which belong to what de Man usually calls the "rhetorical"; rather, as they would claim, they draw attention to the tensions between two such "modalities of the production . . . of meaning" ["The Resistance to Theory," Yale French Studies 7- hereafter RT]: and this is both a distinguishing mark and, in its own view, a particular achievement, of deconstruction.2 Thus, in de Man's discussion of the title of Keats's fragment The Fall of Hyperion in "The Resistance to Theory," he draws attention to the way its grammatical meaning is in tension with its rhetorical function, leaving its meaning "strictly undecidable." The denial of any possibility of resolving these undecidabilities marks a central feature of the deconstructive strategy. De Man makes the same point in, for example, his well-known discussion of Archie Bunker's "rhetorical" question "What's the difference?" in "Semiology and Rhetoric" [Allegories of Reading- hereafter SR]: "The grammatical model of [Archie Bunker's] question becomes rhetorical not when we have, on the one hand, a literal meaning and on the other hand a figural meaning, but when it is impossible to decide by grammatical or other linguistic devices which of the two meanings (that can be entirely incompatible) prevails" [SR 10]. In the later essay, de Man objects to the "replacement of rhetorical figures by gram- matical codes ... of a hermeneutic by a semiotic model, of interpretation by decoding" [RT 16]; and his insistence on maintaining just such a distinction is central to his approach. Now the distinction between "hermeneutics" and "decoding," of course, is just the distinction be- tween the interpretation of intentional acts as meaningful and the interpretation of the mean- ings of signs; so that de Man's point here is that tropes do not function by way of conven- tional associations between patterns of linguistic signs, on the one hand, and some recoverable meaning, on the other. There is no set of rules, no grammar of the trope, that will read the rhetorical aspects of a text the way a semantics reads the propositional aspects. (This is one of Donald Davidson's arguments in his well-known discussion of metaphor, "What Metaphors Mean," On Metaphor, S. Sacks, Ed. [Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1979], 29-46.) This reveals at least one important way in which de Man is post-structuralist. Since literariness-the property which emerges in a literary reading of any text-con- sists, at least in part, in "the use of language that foregrounds the rhetorical over the gram- 21 use the disjunct relation between grammar and rhetoric as a synecdoche for the various disjunctions between the ways meaning, on the deconstructive view, may be produced. Thus to offer a few examples, rhetoric itself, in de Man, familiarly contains a disjunct relation between trope and persuasion; and we see the same sort of disjunction when Derrida marks a tension between catachresis and metaphor in "White Mythologies," when Warminski reports on one between syntax and semantics ["Missed Crossing: Wordsworth's Apocalypses," MLN 99 (1984): 983-1006], and when de Man, once more, sketches the disruptive intertwinings of "Anthropomorphism and trope in the lyric." 52</page><page sequence="6">matical and the logical function" [RT 14], Norris's failure to acknowledge that belief in an undecidable tension between rhetoric and grammar divides deconstruction profoundly from Ryle (as from structuralism) reflects, in a de Manian sense, nothing other than a resistance to theory. 4 Christopher's argument is, at any rate, not as straightforward as I have suggested. For, as the chapter proceeds, the tone comes to sound not conciliatory but defensive; when Christopher says that Ryle's account of such philosophic procedures as reductio ad absurdum "could well be adapted to the defense of conceptual rhetoricians like Derrida and de Man," one is left with a sense that what is happening is not so much the exposure of philosophy to a deconstructive reading, but rather the stiffening of deconstruction with a little philosophic rigor. Norris continues: "The most frequent charge against deconstruction is that it merely takes texts apart in a spirit of perverse and negative zeal" [21]. And he then suggests that Ryle provides a way of answering this accusation both for deconstruction and for philosophy. Ryle proposed an analogy between the testing of metals by engineers, on the one hand, and of concepts by philosophers, on the other. He observed that engineers stretch, twist, compress and batter bits of metal until they collapse, but it is by such tests that they determine the strains which the metal will withstand. In somewhat the same way, philosophical arguments bring out the logical powers of the ideas under investigation, by fixing the precise forms of logical mishandling under which they refuse to work. ["Philosophical Arguments," Philosophy of Recent Times 492] How are we to apply this analogy to the case of deconstruction? Engineers strain bits of metal only in order to be able to build bridges. They need to know the strains metals will stand not because- like physicists in the "pure" sciences-they have an abstract interest in the issue, but because it is of practical concern in the application of their craft. Rylean "idea- battering" too has an ulterior purpose, one he did not have to make explicit for an audience of philosophers. For philosophers define their task as having to do with acquiring rationally supported beliefs about a fairly determinate range of conceptual issues, and for them the discovery of inconsistencies in common sense, in our ordinary ways of thinking and talking about such issues is, more or less by definition, a philosophical "result." The analogous assumption that would make possible an analogous defense of the "text- battering" of Derrida is by no means clear. Norris, certainly, is not content with the claim that "text-battering" has its own intrinsic interest: no doubt he feels that deconstruction would not be worth all the work if it did not yield more than this. In the page that follows, Norris suggests that what Derrida's readings have yielded is, among other things, the demonstration that "the'closure' of philosophic concepts- their absorption into structures of formalized or systematic knowledge-is always the sovereign gesture of logocentric thought" [22]. Whether or not we can find in logocentrism a good rationale for or explana- tion of the desire for "closure"-the desire that certain philosophers have felt to construct completed philosophical systems- Norris might have done more to establish the existence of a desire for closure in analytic philosophy; and more to show that closure really is impossi- ble. It does not help to point to Derrida's catalogue of failed attempts at closure: first, because modern philosophers-like philosophers in most periods-think they have made progress with many problems that resisted their philosophical predecessors; and second, because the philosopher will be interested in why closure is impossible, if, indeed, it is. Regrettably, Norris evinces no interest in the extensive analytic literature that seems relevant to the issue of closure. Fallibilism, for example-the view that all our beliefs are open to revision - is defended by Quine, and might be thought to be a way of denying the possibility of epistemological "closure"; and Gbdel's incompleteness results-which show the impossibility of capturing mathematical structures as rich as arithmetic by systems of diacritics / spring 1986 53</page><page sequence="7">axioms-certainly show that our conceptual resources resist another sort of "closure." But as he seeks to portray a mystified analytic philosophy hopelessly compromised by this will-to- closure, Norris fails to engage precisely these sorts of philosophical arguments. 5 The discovery of a desire for closure also underlies Derrida's reading of Husserl (see Jacques Derrida, "Genesis and Structure," Writing and Difference, Trans. Alan Bass [London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1978], 154-68) and this fact provides Norris with an opportunity to construe a parallel between Ryle and Derrida. In Norris's account of it, Ryle's essay on H usserl takes issue with the notion that philosophy can return to first principles by ... turn- ing the mind inward upon its own ideas as a test of their ultimate validity. The con- cepts in question . . . are not to be regarded as mysterious entities in some shadowy realm of private intuition. They exist only by virtue of the uses . .. to which they are put. Phenomenology, therefore ... can only make use of the linguistic procedures "by which all good philosophers have always advanced the elucidation of concepts" [this is from Ryle's review of Farber's The Foundation of Phenomenology- hereafter "Review of Farber"- in Collected Papers 1 221]. To this extent Ryle, like Derrida, re- jects the idea of any privileged access to the self-present consciousness of thought. It is therefore accurate to say that Ryle's critique of Husserl fastens upon the logocentric merging of reason and reflexive self-evidence which Derrida likewise seeks to deconstruct. [22-23] But Norris's account simply does not warrant the claim that Ryle and Derrida share a common perception of what is wrong with Husserl. Referring back to the essay Norris cites, we discover that Ryle's central objection to the phenomenological method is that you can- not, as Husserl claims, find the significations of concept-words by introspective intuition of their mental essences. The way you can find them, in Ryle's view, is by conceptual analysis. So what Ryle's critique of Husserl "fastens upon" is Husserl's confusion of conceptual analysis- which involves "fixing the rules of [the] uses" ["Review of Farber" 221] of concept- words- with finding the signification of these words by introspective intuition of the mental essences to which they correspond. Norris's account of Ryle's view is adequate only if "reason" means "conceptual analysis," and "reflexive self-evidence" means "introspection of the essences of concepts." But conceptual analysis, in Ryle's view, would only be one kind of exercise of reason, and the equation of reflexive self-evidence (i.e., Husserlian Evidenz) with the introspective examination of conceptual essences is one of the Husserlian theses Ryle ex- plicitly opposes ["Review of Farber" 221]. Unfortunately, the sole basis for Norris's com- parison proves to be this eisegetic reading of Ryle. For disagreements with Husserl to reflect interesting doctrinal affinities, they must derive from a shared perception of why Husserl is wrong- otherwise any two philosophers who disagree with a third will be importantly aligned. An adequate examination of Ryle's argument against Husserl, however, reveals none of the affinities with Derrida's concerns or strategies that might make the comparison worthwhile. Derrida's objection to Husserl - which centers on the issue of closure- has little to do with the argument basic to Ryle's objection. (Ryle's objection, as it happens, is that concepts do not correspond to men- tal essences because they are "abstractions from integral propositions and they embody the logical structure of those propositions. . . . The intelligent use of concepts in thinking does not, therefore, presuppose a pre-judgmatic [sic] finding of entities of which concept-words are names" ["Review of Farber" 221]. The argument that I have abridged here involves invok- ing the same sort of picture of the relation between word-meaning and sentence-meaning as I discuss, in greater detail, in the next section.) "That Ryle's response is very different from Derrida's I would not wish to deny," Norris writes. "What is striking is their common perception of the problems" [25]. But the point of comparison between these two critiques of Husserl turns out to be altogether trivial. For the 54</page><page sequence="8">claim that the proper way to understand the concepts that engage philosophy is by in- trospective intuition of their essences is Husserl's central methodological claim: it pretty much is the phenomenological method. As a result, it is going to be denied by almost anyone who disagrees seriously with phenomenology. Yet it is just this denial which appears to be the basis of Norris's talk of a "common perception." If the accommodating Christopher has had little success with Ryle, what we want to know now is whether the combative Christophe can do any better. Christophe aims to expose Ryle's phonocentrism, and he concerns himself with Ryle's essay "Letters and syllables in Plato" [hereafter LSP], which draws upon a model of the rela- tions of propositions and concepts that is proposed in some of Plato's later dialogues in order to elucidate a certain insight of Frege's. In Norris's account, Ryle pursues... the notion that thoughts are built up in propositional form somewhat after the manner of letters combining to create a syllable, a unit of ar- ticulate sound whose properties are not the sum of its parts. In the same way, Ryle argues, concepts are always involved in a larger propositional meaning that transcends, and makes it impossible to delimit, any singular idea they might carry. The point is brought out in the following passage: "As an integral sentence is the minimum vehicle of a truth or falsehood, it is also the minimum expression of knowledge, belief and conjecture. A noun by itself or a verb by itself does not con- vey what I know or think, any more than a consonant-character stands for something that I can pronounce" [LSP 64]. The analogy thus lends striking support to Ryle's idea of concepts as possessing a logical power . .. beyond any account that could be given of their atomistic meaning. [25] Unfortunately, these comments reveal an understanding of Ryle's argument that is, at best, insecure. Since Ryle's purpose in the essay cannot be recovered from Norris's account of it, we must turn to the essay itself to set ourselves straight. Ryle's argument, we find, turns on what he calls a "difficult but crucial point" [LSP 58] of Frege's, and the description is cer- tainly apt. Frege was perhaps the first modern philosopher to see clearly the truth in a slogan that is now trite learning: the sentence is the unit of meaning. By this I mean he understood that it was wrong to hold, as Locke did, for example, that sentences are collocations of words, each of which gains its meaning by referring to some idea or thing. For Frege, its potential for play- ing a role in sentences is what gives each word its meaning; the meaning of the German predicate ist rot, for example, offered by saying that it is an expression that, when preceded by the (German) name of a thing, produces a sentence that is truly asserted if, but only if, that thing is red. Locke thought of words as having meanings that were explanatorily prior to their role in sentences. Frege saw that without a sentential role words would not have meanings. (Or perhaps we should say, remembering the language-games of the Philosophical Investiga- tions, that they would not have the meanings they actually do have.) Just as for Locke, the relation of representation (which holds between ideas and things) is what is central to semantics, for Frege, it is the relations of truth and falsity (which hold between propositions and the world). Ryle's claim in "Letters and syllables in Plato" is that Plato provides a model that illuminates the Fregean insight. That Ryle took Frege's point to be of the first importance is clear from the way he returns to it in other places. In an essay on "Phenomenology and 'The Concept of Mind,'" for exam- ple, he puts it somewhat more clearly than in "Letters and syllables in Plato": the sense of a sentence is not, what had hitherto been tacitly assumed, a whole of which the meanings of the words in it are independently thinkable parts but, on the diacritics / spring 1986 55</page><page sequence="9">contrary, ... the meanings of the parts of a sentence are abstractible differences and similarities between the unitary sense of that sentence and the unitary senses of other sentences which have something but not everything in common with that given sentence. To put it in epistemological terms, we do not begin with possession of concepts and then go on to coagulate them into thoughts. We begin and we end with thoughts, but by comparative analysis we can discriminate ways in which something which is constant vis-A-vis what else is varied between different things that we unitarily think. [Collected Papers 1 184] With Frege's point clearly before us it is possible to see why Ryle thought the metaphor of the phonetic composition of spoken syllables- rather than the graphic composition of written words-served to make this point, provided we first make what Ryle charmingly describes as "dull but necessary" [LSP 54] distinctions. Ryle begins by contrasting the graphic components (the letters), which he calls the "atoms" of which a written word is made, with the phonemes that make up the word as it is spoken. The atoms are literally part of the (written) word; the phonemes, on the other hand, are "distinguishable aspects or features of integral noises, but not . .. integral noises" [58]. The initial phoneme of - to use Ryle's own example- the word "box," whose presence is in- dicated by the initial letter "b," is not an atom of the word; that is, it is not one of the sounds which go to make that sound, in the way that "b" is one of the letters that go to make the written word "box." You cannot pronounce a phoneme. You can say "bee"-which is the sounded name of the letter "b"-or "buh"- as in the initial sound of "before." But whether what you produce is a word of English or not, if you make a sound it will be a syllable, not a phoneme. When Plato discusses the relation of concepts to thoughts in the later dialogues in passages where he uses words and their parts as a model, he had usually been taken in modern times to have been thinking of the relations of letters to written words, not of the relations of phonemes to spoken ones. Ryle argues, against this consensus, that if we inter- pret Plato as having been concerned with phonemes rather than letters, we can see that he is expressing Frege's insight. For Frege's point is that words are not atoms of sentences but features that account for the semantic similarities and dissimilarities of sentences; just as phonemes are not atoms of sound but features that account for the phonetic similarities and dissimilarities of sounds. In Fregean terms, the meaning of a word contributes to determining the truth conditions of a sentence, but it does not stand for a part of those truth conditions. Likewise (as Saussure saw), a phoneme contributes to determining the sound of a word, but is not a part of that sound. Frege's challenge was to a Lockean "theory of meaning" that survived him to become the picture theory of Wittgenstein's Tractatus. Ryle agrees with Frege (and the later Wittgen- stein and Quine and almost every recent philosopher of language) that this is a theory to be discarded-and it is perhaps worth observing that it is his rejection of this Lockean view which accounts, in large measure, for Ryle's resistance to Husserl's phenomenology. (Husserl's position, as we saw, depended on supposing that what a "concept-word" signified could be intuited by introspection of the essence of the idea to which it corresponded. If the Fregean theory is right, there are no such Lockean ideas: all terms-save, for Ryle, names - are "syncategorematic" ["Review of Farber" 221].) In Ryle's philological reading, this "admirable model, which Frege lacked, of the phonetic element in syllables, enabled Plato to explain more lucidly than Frege the notion of the independent-variability-without-separability of the meanings of the parts of sentences" [LSP 71]. The notion, that is, that you can vary the sentence-meaning by changing the words independently of each other (independent variability), even though words have no mean- ing-or, more precisely, make no assertion - in isolation (hence, no separability). Pace Norris, this view does not entail that it is impossible to delimit singular ideas within "a larger propositional meaning" [25]. I discussed earlier Frege's way of associating predicates, like "-is red," with properties in such a way as to delimit the singular idea-"redness"-with which they are to be associated in a theory of meaning that is indeed atomistic, at least in the sense that the meanings of sentences are built out of the meanings of words. Ryle can hardly 56</page><page sequence="10">have neglected Frege's view since he ascribed the "crucial point" of his exercise to Frege (whom Norris does not mention in this chapter). The very passage from Ryle that Norris cites seems not to support the gloss he puts on it. Aside from Norris's failure to capture Ryle's essential conclusion, what he says fails to express Ryle's argument. That argument involved differentiating two things that "letter" might be taken to mean (in the sense that Ryle wants to take it- the phonological sense- his point is that letters do not combine to form syllables at all). Yet Norris's account of Ryle's argument does not even mention this distinction. Norris discusses it only afterwards, explaining first that: "There is another line of argument in his essay . . ." [25]. Doubtless if Norris had fol- lowed Ryle's argument more carefully, he would have realized that this wasn't "another line of argument" but the very same one. In all events, it is hardly encouraging that Norris reads Ryle's central argument in a way that misses the essay's major philosophical achievement. But Christophe's mind is on other things- foremost, as I say, the bias of phonocentrism, the privileging of speech over writing, that we are to find instantiated in those two exemplars of western philosophic thought, Plato and Ryle. At the point we have now reached, the point of Platonic exegesis, Ryle and Derrida might perhaps have been expected to have something to say to each other. Derrida holds that Plato privileges speech over writing; Ryle suggests that Plato's model here is of speech rather than writing. Christopher the assimilator might have found here the basis for remarking a parallelism of some sort. But Christophe the agonist is in charge; and so this point of seeming coincidence is described as bringing Ryle's essay "squarely in conflict with Derrida's treatment of the speech/writing opposition" [25]. For Derrida this issue is raised in exemplary form by Plato's insistence (in the Phaedrus and elsewhere) that speech is the only authentic medium of language, and writing merely a debased and derivative function. ... In his view, the privileging of speech over writing is the logocentric gesture par excellence.... His object, as always, is to show that writing remains a problematic and obsessive theme, even where its workings are most cunningly disguised. This "return of the repressed" is what Derrida elicits from the figurative texture of Plato's dialogues. [25-26] Whereas, according to Norris, "Ryle argues to opposite effect that the letters and syllables of Plato's text must be thought of as spoken rather than written elements" [26]. In this case, while Ryle appears to corroborate Derrida's reading of Plato's phonocentric tendencies, Christophe tells us that Plato's attempt to devalue writing should lead to the "return of the repressed"- the emergence of writing as an insistent thematic [26] that Derrida elicits from Plato's figuration. But notice how this undermines Norris's treatment of the passages from Ryle he goes on to "deconstruct." As we saw, that Ryle regarded certain of Plato's metaphors as being about speech rather than writing is taken by Norris as evidence of Ryle's phonocentric bias. To clinch this claim, Norris shows a passage of Ryle's to be "positively laden" with metaphors and images that serve as figures (if I may put it this way) of speech. But by the very argument that disqualified- Ryle's reading of Plato, the writing-repressing Ryle should surely have figures of writing haunting his prose. I think de Man points to what is wrong with Christophe's approach when he advises that there is "no merit whatever in upsetting a canonical interpretation merely for the sake of destroying something that may have been built with considerable care"; for de Man, the "necessity to revise the canons arises from resistances encountered in the text itself.. . and not from preconceptions imported from elsewhere" ["Reply to Geuss," Critical Inquiry 384]. Yet the argument that Ryle is tendentiously phonocentric is required only by a prior commit- ment to the thesis that he must be so. And this fact can be brought out by observing that some of the bases for this accusation would, if sound, convict Derrida himself of a phonocentric agenda. Thus, for example, one of Norris's reasons for thinking Ryle phonocentric - that he restores "a phonocentric theme to texts which . .. actively resist it" [27]-would be an argument against Derrida, who finds the same theme in the very same texts. diacritics I spring 1986 57</page><page sequence="11">7 Norris's reading of Ryle proves less interesting, therefore, than we might have hoped. Unfortunately, however, it is not just with Ryle that Norris runs into trouble. Although Witt- genstein's only known foray into literary criticism was to tell F. R. Leavis to give it up (as Leavis recounts in Recollections of Wittgenstein, Rush Rhees, Ed. [Oxford: Oxford UP, 1984], 59, 65), Wittgenstein's name is frequently invoked by literary theorists. Nonetheless, Norris is not conspicuously more successful with Wittgenstein than with Ryle. Now, Philosophical Investigations is doubtless more interesting from the point of view of conventional literary criticism than "Letters and syllables in Plato"-that is, it is more in- teresting in its use, as opposed to discussion, of figurative language. Perhaps this is why Norris, relenting in his declared critical perspective, is sometimes drawn into a more conven- tionally literary approach to Wittgenstein's writings. Consider, for example, Norris's exploration of Wittgenstein's use of the image of an "alloy" to figure the relation between a letter and its sound, a relationship Wittgenstein is already using to figure the relations of word and meaning. Adopting something very like a biographical approach, Norris states that "with his early training and lifelong interest in mat- ters mechanical, Wittgenstein is unlikely to have used the word with just a casual sense of its metaphoric overtones" [55]. But then Derridian injunction comes to the fore, bidding us to "aim at a certain relationship, unperceived by the writer, between what he commands and what he does not command of the patterns of the language that he uses" [Of Grammatology 158]. So he asks: "But why attach such a weight of significance to Wittgenstein's isolated metaphor?" This is his answer: "First, because it figures at the stage in his argument where certain tensions have developed, tensions which are focussed and (at least for the moment) resolved through Wittgenstein's hitting on this image. Secondly, because it offers a compact example of how figurative language works both to advance and to complicate the argument in hand" [55]. Roughly, the problem Norris suggests is this: though "alloy" strictly means "a combination of metals melted together" [54], it also has a history of connoting not any mix- ture of metals, but a mixture of a baser metal with silver or gold, in order to "bring it to the recognized standard."3 It follows that Wittgenstein's use of the word "alloy" can be inter- preted both as implying the equal melding together of the written and spoken word, (and thus, in the embedded figure, of word and meaning), and as implying an inequality between them, so that one-though it is "undecidable" which- is the baser. Now, it is not strictly inconsistent to ask us to be interested in the metaphor both because Wittgenstein (who was indeed a brilliant engineer), would not have used it casually, and because his figures have escaped his command. But granted, as deconstruction requires, that we cannot find a univocal reading in the text that is Wittgenstein's "authentic meaning," the question whether Wittgenstein-the historical author-would have used a figure casu- ally seems, so to speak, de trop. The uncertainty in Norris's approach to this figure in Wittgenstein's writing is combined with a degree of unreliability in explaining his arguments that is at least as worrying as his failures in understanding Ryle. Witness, for example, the gloss he gives to a question Witt- genstein discusses in Philosophical Investigations. 'Given the two ideas "fat" and "lean," would you be rather inclined to say that Wednesday was fat and Tuesday lean, or vice versa?' Wittgenstein inclines towards the former fancy, but can offer no rational account for his choice, apart from reflect- ing that 'they might be associations from my childhood' [Philosophical Investiga- tions 2 16el. Yet this seems perilously close to the idea of a private language-game which could not possibly, on Wittgenstein's account, possess any kind of coherent... meaning. [37] 3This is from the O.E.D.'s entry for "alloy," cited by Norris [55]. I should say that I share an anxiety he seeks, in a nervous parenthesis, to dispel, about taking a German figure - Legierung, alloy- seriously by discussing, as it happens, a false French etymology of its English translation; see the full extract from the O.E.D. [54-55]. 58</page><page sequence="12">But Wittgenstein's private language argument is not an argument against saying anything that we normally say-"philosophy leaves everything as it is"; it is rather an objection to a par- ticular philosophical theory of interior states: the Cartesian theory, namely, that some such states are essentially unknowable by others. Wittgenstein does not want us to stop talking about "associations from childhood," he wants to reject a certain philosophical picture of what this involves. 8 The final substantive chapter is about Saul Kripke, who has been at the center of the development of the "technical" field of quantified modal logic, and Norris makes much of the prospects for this meeting of the rigor of deconstruction with the rigor of formal seman- tics. But here, it seems to me, in discussing work that is truly remote from traditional literary concerns- Wittgenstein was discussing metaphor, Ryle was discussing Plato's figures- Norris goes truly astray. I must confess to finding distinctly odd the major premise of this chapter: the claim that one thesis shared by structuralism and Anglo-American analytic philosophy, but denied by Kripke, is the claim that "meaning determines reference" [144]. This premise turns out, in Norris's account, to be the foundation for the major enterprise in this book, his attempt to establish relations between the two estranged traditions: "Deconstruction is the rigorous con- sequence, not only of structuralist thinking but of any linguistic philosophy basing its methods on the principle that 'meaning determines [or precedes] reference'" [157]. Yet in the sense in which the doctrine is recognizably a structuralist claim it would have been denied by Frege and Russell; and in the sense in which it is denied by Kripke, it is not clear that it was ever held by Saussure. Thus Frege, Saussure, and Russell might have said "Ja," "Oui," and "Yes," if you asked them whether meaning determined reference; but they would have been assenting to different thoughts. Worse still, Kripke might also say "Yes," but mean something different again. What claim, then, would be represented by the words "meaning determines reference" in Frege, Russell, Saussure, and Kripke? For Frege, whom Norris cites on the first page of the essay, meanings were abstract ob- jects, above all not to be confused with psychological entities. The essence of his theory was that the meaning, or, more precisely, the sense,4 of an assertoric sentence was what you had to know in order to know what truth-claim it made - to know, in the jargon, its truth condi- tions. In short, the truth conditions of an assertoric sentence are its sense. If this is right, then the sense of a word - a name, for example - has to be given by saying what contribution it makes to fixing the truth conditions of sentences in which it occurs. Frege noticed, famously, that even though the two names "Hesperus" and "Phosphorus" both refer to the same ob- ject- the planet Venus-they make different contributions to the meanings of sentences in which they occur. (Otherwise "Hesperus is Hesperus" and "Phosphorus is Hesperus" would mean the same.) It followed from this that the sense of a name could not be given simply by saying what it referred to. In fact, he held that the sense of a proper name was an associated description- for "Aristotle" it might be "the teacher of Alexander"-though, since different people might associate different descriptions with the same name, Frege was rather inclined to regard names as anomalous and to hope that they could be excluded from a logically im- proved language. His reasons for defending a view of names (in logically imperfect natural languages) as disguised descriptions had, therefore, to do with considerations of logic, ques- tions about the individuation of these abstract entities that he called "senses." Russell, on the other hand, thought of meaning as fundamentally psychological, and his reasons for defending his account of names as disguised descriptions had to do with an em- 4More precisely, because names have sense-i.e., Fregean Sinn - but not meaning. The sense of a name is whatever you have to know to fix the meanings of sentences in which it occurs. This is, of course, an extremely abridged and simplified exposition of Frege's views. Michael Dummett's Frege: the philosophy of language [London: Duckworth, 1973] gives a rich, illuminating-and controversial!- account. diacritics / spring 1986 59</page><page sequence="13">piricist epistemology in which only "objects of acquaintance" could be known, and only terms referring to objects of acquaintance could be properly understood. (Norris, inciden- tally, seems to think that the view that names are disguised descriptions is called "the theory of descriptions" [144]. In fact, the theory of descriptions is Russell's analysis of expressions of the form "The F . . ." (where "F" is replaced by a noun phrase), that Russell called "definite descriptions." You could agree with Russell that names were disguised definite descriptions without accepting Russell's logical analysis of the latter.) There is, however, an important sense in which Frege and Russell agreed on a doctrine which might be expressed by saying that "meaning determines reference." If we say that knowing the meaning of a sentence or expression is simply to be identified with understand- ing it, and if we hold that two people who understand the meaning of the same sentence share a certain subjective state, then Frege and Russell would have agreed that what the reference of an expression is, is determined once we know the subjective state of somebody who knows the meaning of that expression (someone who, in Fregean language, "grasps its sense"). Kripke's originality lies precisely in denying this claim, so understood. (Or, more precisely, in developing the formal semantical theories in which this claim is false. For Hilary Putnam had long been arguing for just this position without the modern apparatus of quan- tified modal logic.) But there is another sense in which Kripke would agree that meaning determines reference - his contribution to the semantics of necessity allows us to individuate meanings in such a way that this condition holds - but deny that knowledge of meaning can be identified with a certain subjective state. For Kripke it is possible for two people in the same subjective state to understand the same expression correctly as meaning different things; and for people with different subjective states to understand the same expression as meaning the same thing. For what you mean - in a sense that determines what you are refer- ring to- may depend in systematic ways on aspects of your situation in the world that you know nothing about. It is from this insight that Kripke draws the un-Fregean and anti-Russellian conclusion that there can be both a priori contingent truths and a posteriori necessary ones. Kripke has separated out the epistemological question of what is knowable a priori from the metaphysical question of what is necessarily true. In this respect, he has, as Norris correctly says, largely revised "conventional ideas in truth-conditional semantics" [155]. The problem, then, is in deciding whether there is a doctrine that Frege, Russell, and Sacssure agree on and Kripke denies. For Norris's argument is that Kripke, in challenging ruling assumptions of analytic philosophy, "provides . . a basis for controverting post- structuralist theory at its own sophisticated level" [161]: if accepted, we are told, Kripke's ac- count of language and meaning would "render deconstruction virtually redundant by pro- viding a different, seemingly 'non-deconstructible' philosophy of language." In Norris's scheme, it is thus competition that must be faced down. But Norris's view that Kripke and post-structuralist theory are competing for the same turf remains, in the end, unsupported. The Frege-Russell claim that identity of subjective state entails identity of reference I will call, for convenience, "psychologism." Kripke agrees that meaning determines reference, but denies psychologism because he doesn't think that knowledge of meaning is in the relevant sense subjective. Question: what claim is it that Norris thinks Saussure would have agreed to in saying that "meaning determines reference"? Norris says Saussure held that language "structures and determines our grasp of the world" [44]. But this claim is perfectly consistent both with psychologism and with its denial. And he says that for "Saussure, as for Frege, 'meaning determines reference' in the sense that there exists no self-sufficient act of naming outside the criteria which language provides for deciding how . . . such an act achieves its designated object" [145]. But this claim is entirely consistent with Kripke's position. For Kripke does not deny that it is a matter of linguistic con- vention that names play the semantic role they do; what he denies is a certain account of what the convention is. I do not find anywhere in Norris's essay an account of the allegedly Saussurean doctrine that meaning determines reference to which the dispute between Frege-Russell and Kripke is relevant. What I do find are various other structuralist claims to which Kripke's arguments are supposed - apparently as the result of confusions - to be especially relevant. 60</page><page sequence="14">Take Norris's discussion of Saussure's famous and rather unhappily expressed thesis of the arbitrary nature of the sign. This thesis (as analytic philosophers will need informing) is not the relatively uninteresting (though characteristically modern) view that the relations be- tween words and things are conventional. For Saussure the "sign" is the union of the signifier (word) and signified (the psychological concept that the word expresses). And perhaps the radical core of the thesis of the arbitrary nature of the sign is the thesis of the arbitrary nature of the signified: the claim that given a suitable structure of signs, any concept at all may come to be expressed, and no system of concepts has a greater claim on reality than any other. (That Norris means it this way is evident from his connecting Saussure in the familiar way with the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.) Now I think that Kripke would deny this claim; but then Russell and Frege would have denied it also. It leads swiftly to a species of idealism: the denial of the realist's view that there is a reality out there structured independently of our concepts of it. This is not, however, an issue that is systematically connected with the divide between Continental and Anglo-American theorizing: there are realists and idealists on both sides. Norris, in short, mistakes the deeply original Kripkean claim-that what your words refer to is not fixed simply by your psychological states, your subjective "meanings"-for another claim that Kripke would certainly accept, but that only a minority of philosophers in the analytic tradition have recently wanted to deny-that reality (what you refer to) is con- stituted independently of our knowledge and belief about it. In the "Methodological Postscript" to the book, Norris recommends his deconstructive treatment of Kripke as perhaps his most "rigorous." It is a revealing choice, for no "textual close-reading" is even begun in this chapter. In lieu of it, Norris simply points to Kripke's use of the word "baptism" in his account of the way names acquire their referents; declares this to imply a "myth of origin"; and reports that Derrida has "textual strategies in plenty for show- ing up the self-deconstructing and illusory character of all such myths of origins" [161]. This economic technique - a species of what de Man nicely terms "criticism by hearsay" 5 - leads by a form of argumentum ad verecundiam to the foreclosure of reading. If this is what Norris means by "rigor," one can easily understand why he might want the notion "revised - or pro- visionally suspended" [173]. 9 I have so far discussed only Norris's treatment of analytic philosophers. But in the "Methodological Postscript" that ends this book Norris is largely concerned to exorcise the spectre of Rodolphe Gasch&amp;, author of two influential essays (namely "Deconstruction as Criticism" [Glyph VI (1979): 177-215]; and "Unscrambling Positions: On Gerald Graff's Cri- tique of Deconstruction" [MLN 96 (1981): 1015-34]) that criticize what he views as the mis- use of deconstruction for literary-critical ends. In particular, Gasche opposes "thematic" readings or interpretations that substitute for (and are presented as) genuine deconstruction. Since Norris's own chapters have been "examples of deconstruction in what Gasche would doubtless call a 'thematic' and hence non-rigorous form," he acknowledges that Gasche's arguments "might be seen as challenging my own appropriation of Derridian 'themes' in the preceding chapters" [167] and he offers a rejoinder "partly by way of pre-emptive self- defense" [172]. Describing his readings of philosophical texts in the preceding chapters, Norris makes this claim: "It is my argument that these texts contrive to highlight the problem of writing and fictionality even as they attempt to contain or repress these topics. And this means in turn that the most rewarding texts for deconstruction are those which more or less explicitly thematize their own problematic status" [172]. Whatever his intentions, Norris would appear to be signalling here a major theoretical departure from Derrida and de Man: for surely this is a major theoretical departure. After all, if the western tradition is logocentric through and through, (reflecting, in Norris's description, "a kind of aboriginal and endless swerve into 5"Common as it may be, criticism by hearsay is only rarely held up as exemplary" [RT 15]. diacritics / spring 1986 61</page><page sequence="15">forms of mystification so deeply ingrained that they cut across all the usual boundaries of discipline and culture" [14]), then this fact should be displayed in all, or anyway most, of its texts, and not just those that explicitly thematize their own problematic status, however un- consciously. Rather than offering any theoretical response to Gasche's argument, what Norris does is to implicate as equally "thematic" certain sanctioned readings to which he grants [e.g., 7, 168, 173] the privileged status of being "exemplary,"6 and then to appeal to a kind of "in- nocence by association." In this vein, Norris alleges that "Derrida's chosen texts are those which more or less explicitly thematize the deconstructive logic at work within them," and that it is from this canny preselection of texts that "much of the force of Derrida's arguments comes" [168]. And the same goes for de Man. "Let us grant-as de Man repeatedly in- sists-that these are not interpretative readings of individual works, but cases of a general- ized textual predicament which drives a wedge between logic and rhetoric, sense and in- tent, 'constative' and 'performative' aspects of language. Still it is the case that his texts are so chosen as to thematize the rhetorical blind-spots and perplexities which solicit a deconstruc- tive reading" [168]. But this claim surely misrepresents de Manian practice. It is simply false that de Man only reads texts that conveniently thematize his theoretical concerns. Whether we consider de Man's discussion (say) of materiality in Kant's Third Critique or of the word "comme" in Baudelaire's "Correspondances," 7 it is clear that however these texts instantiate the problematic status of writing, no thematic reflection of the issue is required of them. In- deed de Man addresses this very point in his discussion of Proust in "Allegories of Reading," when he says that "we cannot a priori be certain to gain access to whatever Proust may have to say about reading by way of . . a reading of a scene about reading. The question is precisely whether a literary text is about that which it describes, represents or states." Thus, "if reading is truly problematic... then the sections of the novel that literally represent reading are not to be privileged"; we find that we may need to "use a principle of selection that is no longer thematic" [Allegories of Reading 57-58]. Here, then, in an essay where de Man does read a text that thematizes the topic of writing, he explicitly makes the claim that this is not an essential feature of the case at hand. Norris offers no argument that de Man is mistaken in this. In short, Norris's claim that de Man's "texts are so chosen as to thematize ... rhetorical blind-spots and perplexities" [168] is not only belied by de Manian practice but contrary to de Manian theory. We have seen how, in earlier chapters, Norris's attempt to draw analogies between disparate philosophical traditions sponsored only distortion and trivialization; in the postscript, which confronts a rift that is presumably within the deconstructive enterprise, the results are not much better. 10 "Dialogue," E. G. Ballard has observed, "is the most wistful word of the times." Richard Rorty has advised us, in the same spirit, to "put aside wistful talk of bridge-building" between "Continental" and "analytic" traditions in philosophy [E. G. Ballard, Philosophy at the Crossroads 286; Richard Rorty, "Philosophy in America Today," (hereafter PA) 226]. In this sense, Christopher Norris has produced a most wistful book. There is, I think, nothing mysterious about the source of this wistfulness. We cannot be happy with a state of affairs that leaves philosophers and literary theorists in a state of mutual incomprehension. And that is why Norris cannot simply accept Richard Rorty's advice and recognize the analytic- Continental split as "both permanent and harmless" [PA 226]. Continental philosophy has as 6A category implying, as i. Hillis Miller observes " a valid synecdoche of similarity, a genuine sample of some homogeneous whole"[The Linguistic Moment: From Wordsworth to Stevens (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1985), xxi]. 7I have in mind "Materiality and Phenomenality in Kant," [Hermeneutics: Question and Prospects, Gary Shapiro and Alan Sica, Eds. (Amhurst: U of Massachusetts P, 1984)], and the essay, "Anthropo- morphism and Trope in the Lyric," [The Rhetoric of Romanticism (New York: Columbia UP, 1984), 248-52]. 62</page><page sequence="16">much of a de facto claim on anglophone intellectual life as analytic philosophy: perhaps we could tolerate mutual incomprehension across the water, but we cannot accept it across the fences of our own back yards. Norris's book offers no answer to his call to mend this rift. His understanding of philosophy is too distorted for his essays to provide a useful gauge of the prospects for dialogue between philosophy and deconstruction: he proposes no coherent vision of the way literary theory should position itself in relation to analytic philosophy. Indeed, he pro- vides no serious support for his revision of de Man's view that though literary theory "may now well have become a legitimate concern of philosophy . .. it cannot be assimilated to it" [RT 8]. What is important for Norris's project is, of course, not the concern of philosophy with deconstruction but the interest of deconstruction in philosophy. And, as I said at the start, analytic philosophy was bound to become the legitimate concern of deconstructive literary theory for institutional reasons, not out of a coincidence of theoretical interests but out of a shared situation in the anglophone academy. However, though one must read this book as a response by deconstruction to its mode of inscription in that part of the world where analytic philosophy remains hegemonic, it is not a response with which we can be content. For what Norris has substituted for dialogue is the suppression of differences. It is this suppression that accounts for what we may call, borrowing Norris's own suggestive phrase, his "strategic misunderstanding" [167] of the philosophy of language; and I would argue that his assertion that deconstruction is at its best when it is thematic is a consequence of it also. The claim that to be "rewarding" [172] deconstruction must confine itself to texts that thematize the prob- lematic status of textuality is one that compromises the generality of deconstruction as a critical strategy. And it is precisely the generality of the claim that there is in every text a necessary tension between its grammatical and its rhetorical aspects- between what it says and what it does-that constitutes the unbridgeable gap between analytic philosophy and deconstruction. For analytic philosophy of language characteristically explains what a declarative sentence says by explaining what an utterance of it in standard circumstances does. (Thus, on Gricean theories, the meaning of a sentence is given by saying what belief it is intended to communicate, so that the effect of an utterance in standard circumstances- its performa- tive function - is just to communicate that belief. I develop this view in Assertion and Condi- tionals [London: Cambridge University Press, 1985], Chapter 7.) Standard analytic theories of meaning cannot live with the possibility that there is always a tension betweenrgrammatical and rhetorical functions, just because they rely, in this way, on the claim that rhetorical force in standard contexts is identical with propositional meaning.8 For deconstruction, on the other hand, it is crucial that there is always a tension between grammar and rhetoric. Once more we can listen with profit to de Man: "Since grammar as well as figuration is an integral part of reading, it follows that reading is undone, at all times, by its rhetorical displacement" [RT 17]. A form of deconstruction that suspends this claim will achieve a point of contact with Anglo-American philosophy only at the price of losing touch with itself.9 WORKS CITED Ballard, E. G.

Note, however, his insistence that rhetoric as persuasion is "indeed inseparable" from rhetoric as trope [RT 19]. I do not wish to imply that analytic theories of meaning cannot deal with the possibility that the figural level of a text should have different implications from its literal level. This is quite generally the case with metaphor, and analytic views of metaphor reflect this fact. But this is not I think the sort of tension de Man and Derrida are concerned with: and even if it were, the standard analytic views of meaning could not accept the claim that there is always a tension, for precisely the reason just given in the text. 91 am extremely grateful to Henry Finder, Cathy Caruth, and Phil Lewis, each of whom commented on an earlier draft of this paper. diacritics / spring 1986 63</page><page sequence="17">.
