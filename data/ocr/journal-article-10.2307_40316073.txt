The Ammassalimiut of East Greenland carved human face masks from driftwood to wear for drum dancing. In the traditional culture, the masks represented various mythical beings, tute- laries, and other spirits, but today, masks are made for sale. The historical background of masks, details of their manufacture, and the carvers are discussed in this article. EDITOR'S FOREWORD To the present date, information about Eskimo masks of Greenland has been regrettably sparse. There are very few examples of these masks in American museums or collections and little has been written about them. This is in great contrast to the knowledge we have of the wooden masks made by Alaskan Aleuts and Eskimos. Masks from the Aleutian Islands were taken to Russia as early as the 1770s, and nu- merous masks have since been collected from the Eskimos living on the west coast of Alaska. These masks , of amazing variety , quantity , and aesthetic merit, have been described and illus- trated in many published articles and books. The masks produced by the Eskimos of Green- land are likewise of great artistic worth , but fewer in number and less well known. Conse- quently , it was a notable event when the Musée de THomme, in 1978-1979, held an exhibition of their Greenland masks and issued a foldout bro- chure to serve as a catalog. It became imme- diately apparent that the masks (although only 23 of the museum's 208 Greenland masks were illustrated) are of a greater richness and variety than hitherto realized, even by many persons in- terested in the arts and crafts of the North. The significance of this exhibition led me to propose to Dr. Robert Gessain, an anthropolo- gist who was a member of the French expedition that collected many of the masks in the 1930s, that he write an article in English and provide photographs for publication in an American jour- nal. I offered to do what might be necessary to prepare his materials for publication. Dr. Ges- sain, honorary director of the Musée de lTHomme, enthusiastically agreed , and the result of our collaboration is the present article. The 50 masks here illustrated is the largest number that has been presented in a single publication. To- gether with the 26 masks illustrated in a recent publication by Bodil Kaalund, The Art of Greenland (of which but seven are duplicated herein), this significant native art is belatedly receiving the attention that it richly deserves (D.J.R.). INTRODUCTION The Ammassalimiut, a group of Inuit, lived for centuries on the east coast of Greenland, just below the Arctic Circle between 65° N and 66° 30T N latitude. 1 Three fjords of unequal depth, edged by high alpine peaks and glaciers, and many islands and islets, surrounded by a sea frozen in winter and full of floating ice in summer, framed their life. In the latitude of the Ammassalik district , the sun does not appear above the horizon from November 15 until January 15, i.e. , dark winter followed by bright winter. The temperature ranges from -10° C and -25° C in winter and +1° C and +10° C in summer. The more than 400 Ammassalimiut, who were discovered in 1884 by the Dane Gustav Holm and his Danish and West Greenland companions, lived in isolation. In mid -nineteenth century the east coast of Greenland north of Ammassalik was uninhabited, although ruins testify that Eskimo xThe name Ammassalimiut means "the people of capelins," from ammassat (capelin, Mallotus villosus).

South of Ammassalik, on a coast 1000 km long, a few more than 100 people lived in four or five houses , which were stopping places for the rare Ammassalimiut man who , be- fore 1880, undertook a three- or four-year- long journey to Cape Farewell to barter, mostly for iron. Their isolation was increased by an ice pack 100 km wide to the east and by an ice cap 700 km wide to the west. Many of the Ammassalimiut have since moved to West Greenland, where, under the influence of Danish medical care and social institutions, they now number 2500. (About 1000 km north of Ammassalik in the Scoresbysund district live 425 Greenlanders , descended from 75 people who moved there with Danish help in 1925.) In three generations, and with great individual and col- lective difficulties, the Greenlanders have passed from a state of prehistoric hunters , living in a closed, isolated society that maintained very old traditions, to that of Danish citizens incorporat- ed into the economic, technical, social, and reli- gious spheres of Denmark. [Greenlandic Home Rule went into effect May 1, 1979. -Editor] For four years during World War II , they lived in close contact with the United States Army, fur- thering changes in their traditional society. HISTORY OF THE DISCOVERY OF MASKS IN AMMASSALIK Masks made by the Alaskan Eskimos have been illustrated in many publications, and their uses in various ceremonies have been studied and described (see e.g., Ray 1975). To date only one mask of historical times is known from Canadian Eskimo societies (Boas 1888:606). Un- til the 1930s, little was known about Ammassalik dance masks, but it is easy to understand why they remained unknown for such a long time. The lack of understanding and extreme moralism of the first Danish missionaries in the 1890s con- signed them to the shadows of a hidden exis- tence. The West Greenlanders apparently once made masks, but by the mid -eighteenth century all traces had been eradicated through the zeal of the missionary Hans Egede, who had begun his work in 1721. Gustav Holm did not see any masks during his stay in the Ammassalik district from August, 1884, until August, 1885, but he and his com- panions attended dances in which performers were "disguised." Holm wrote that a "pastime for winter evenings is the singing of songs which have been handed down from olden days . . . accompanied by drum. . . . The singer stands . . . with a stereotyped grimace on his face, though every now and then he breaks into a laugh or giggle." An example was a man dressed up "to look like a pregnant woman. . . . the hood was stuffed so that it looked as if it contained a baby. His hair was tied up in a top-knot; his eye-brows and cheeks were blackened with soot, and a thin seal -thong was stretched under his nose and over both ears. Thus disguised he ran round . . . the company. This game is called uajartek" (Thalbitzer 1912: 125-126, 129). 2 Although Holm did not see wooden masks in 1885, he attended a uajèrtut game (often played with guests after a meal) , during which they were sometimes used, the dancers performing alternately with masks or with their faces black- ened with soot and distorted with a string, a tradition that continues to this day. The wood- en masks, which were worn only by the men, were also blackened with soot. Women danced without a mask or makeup . As Holm wrote , these games consisted of sexual and comical or clownish scenes, "a song during which a woman goes round to the men who are present and calls upon them to seize her pudenda" ("Thalbit- zer 1912:128). Johan Petersen (alias Ujowàt) , a West Green- land man who was one of Holm's interpreters, recorded the first observation of an Ammassalik dance mask in his diary under the date of De- cember 12, 1894. 3 He was a guest in the house of Amitewartivi (not far from the winter station Holm built in 1884-1885), where, late in the evening of December 12 and after the return of the hunters, he attended "drum songs. One of the hunters had put on a fantastic costume and wore a mask on his face. . . . it is a Uàjèrtoq game where a man, for instance dressed in a comic and funny way, frightens the others and runs after them among shouts and noise" (Peter- sen 1957:19-20; translated from the Danish). This, the first recorded observation of a dancer wearing a mask, is very brief- describing in one sentence the games that went on for hours -and is hardly consistent with the facts , since no dancer tried to frighten anyone. The Danish botanist Christian Kruuse lived in Ammassalik from 1898 to 1902 and made a number of observations about masks, the pres- ence of which in Ammassalik were a revelation to the ethnological world. He wrote that: 2Uajèrtoq: verb, third person singular, meaning "he is playing, capering, teasing the other sex"; uàjèrtut: third person plural, "they are playing," which means, "there is a meeting for this sort of game." \Iohan Petersen, from the west coast of Greenland, was Gustav Holm's interpreter when Ammassalik was discovered in 1884-1885. Johan was pronounced Ujowát in Ammassalik, a name he used to sign his diary. Petersen opened the first commercial trading post in 1894, the same year that F. C. P. Riittel, the first missionary, began evangelizing among this small population of about 450 Eskimos who were barely emerging from prehistory.</page><page sequence="3">Gessain: Ammassalik Masks 83 the inhabitants of Ammasalik carved masks in driftwood . . . they are not used , as one could think it ... for religious reasons ... If they had such a value, it has been lost . . . they are now toys which are used to frighten children. They are rather rare and everyone is not able to carve them , nevertheless those who have this skill do not hesitate to give masks (needless to say in ex- change for an adequate compensation). A man Akernalik gave us one he said to be old, then he came back to ask if we wanted to have a representation of his wife, after that he brought us a mask (recently carved) repre- senting Solo (Sor en Nielsen) [a Dane working in the shop] . On the masks appear the many lines of an aged face but carrying no tra- ditional or ornamental signification (Kruuse 1911:44; translated from the Danish) (Figs. 1-3).* To understand KruuseTs statements, one needs to place them in the context of Ammassilik cul- ture at the very beginning of the twentieth cen- tury. The missionary F. C. P. Rüttel, estab- lished there since 1894, had acquired enough in- fluence to forbid use of every drum , dance , and mask, which he considered inimical to his evan- gelization. He demanded that all things that he considered to be pagan were to be thrown into the fire or the sea. Every offender was forbid- den to buy guns, ammunition, iron, and tobacco at the store. This explains why the hunters who continued carving masks presented them either as portraits or as harmless games "to frighten the children." This statement has subsequently been repeated by various authors , contrary to its real meaning and use of the mask. In the East Greenland language , the word for mask is kiappa (fda/ciface; parupon), but there is a similar word, kiappák ( /da fc: face; pákibig). This "big face" sometimes appeared at the winter house window and did frighten both children and adults through the translucent seal intestines. This big face is, in my opinion, that of a mythi- cal being, a cephalopod also known, for instance, among the Canadian Inuit. This linguistic confu- sion was maintained by the Ammassalimiut to pro- tect themselves from the intransigence of the missionary Rüttel. Between 1901 and 1905, more masks were sent to Denmark from Ammassalik, and William Thalbit- zer (1912:637), the Danish ethnologist, pointed out that he saw Ammassalik masks in the collec- tion of the Hofmuseum in Vienna. In the summer of 1906, Rudolf Trebitsch, an Austrian, visited the west coast of Greenland, and although he did not go to Ammassalik, he acquired a collection of 47 Ammassalik specimens, two of which were wooden masks from the Kongelige Grdnlands Handel (K.G.H.) in Copenhagen. (The collection is now in the Hofmuseum in Vienna.)6 Trebitsch noted that the two masks were equipped with leather straps to hold them on the face, and were blackened with the soot of the blubber lamp . These are the first Ammassalik masks published in ethnological literature, and exhibit all charac- teristics of masks- strap, soot, and furrows- that we saw during our research in Ammassalik in 1934-1935 (Trebitsch 1908:468) (Figs. 4, 5).7 In 1905-1906, Thalbitzer wintered in Ammas- salik, and although he did not see any masked dancers, he brought back masks. At that time there were still a few obstinate characters who carved dance masks, since Trebitsch had bought some that had been brought to the store for trading. 8 They were most probably used for dancing since the winter houses were some dis- tance from Tasiidaq where the missionary lived. (At that time the large winter houses were sev- eral hours apart by sledge , scattered along more than 500 km of coast.) Since dance masks were not kept after use, some hunters found it expedient to barter them for commercial food after the store was opened instead of throwing them away. Thalbitzer was openly friendly with the gov- ernment Minister and received informants at the Danish administrative headquarters in the small settlement of Tasiidaq, where the trading post and church were also located. Under these con- ditions, it is easy to understand why the Ammassalimiut told Thalbitzer what the Minister wanted to hear, at least in regard to masks: "There are no more masks and if any , they are toys to frighten the children with." Neverthe- ^Akernilik was an Ammassalimiut hunter and carver who was born about 1845; his wife Qaqatorujuk was born about 1850 and his father about 1820. Kruuse brought back some masks, which are said to be in the Museum für Volker- kunde, Berlin. 5Rüttel also made the men who accepted bap- tism cut their hair, in spite of the fact that in the Ammassalimiut tradition no iron tool should ever touch hair. As late as 1906, there were many unbaptized Ammassalimiut who openly wore long hair to mark their faithfulness to their fathersT traditions. 6In 1979 I saw this collection in the Hof- museum , and I thank Dr. Christian Feest for all the help he gave me. 7One of Trebitsch's masks (Fig. 4) bears some resemblance to a mask from King Island (good shaman, Ray 1975:plate 48), with small round eyes under horizontal forehead and wide mouth suggesting a "mors de danse" without furrows (see footnote 12). The Inupiaq name for King Island is Ukiuvuk; in Ammassalik there is an inhabited place called Ukiiq. They have the same root: ukiok, winter. 8When our research party arrived in Ammas- salik in August, 1935, we found masks sold in the store.</page><page sequence="4">84 Arctic Anthropology 21:2 less, Thalbitzer obtained a small carving of two opposing human faces, carved in the style of masks, which showed: the front and back of a wooden block carved like a head with two faces. The too narrow neck was broken off, uppermost on the head is a deep socket-like hole. I imagine that the carved furrows of the faces are meant to be tattoo markings; in this case b must be con- sidered as the face of a women [sic] ; if a is meant to be the tattooed face of a man , it does not at any rate have any of the men's tattooing designs known in more recent times. This block was found in a grave . . . it is the only , really evidence of the occurrence of masks or mask-like objects in Greenland . . . (Thalbitzer 1912:636) (Figs. 6 and 7). In 1917, Thalbitzer corrected part of this state- ment, for the figure was found not in a grave, but, in "an old house, evidently owing to the fact that the carving of the wooden block was done during winter in the house in question" (Thalbitzer 1917:464). This was indeed the case because all masks were carved in the winter houses, for it is only during winter that the uàjèrtut ceremonies are held. No provenience nor dating of archaeological horizon- Dorset or Thule- could be given for this carving. Thalbitzer also received four masks from Akernilik, the same man who, some years earlier, had brought masks to Kruuse. "Certain old men (especially Akernilik) as late as 1906 knew how to carve in wood in imitation of their ancestors , but without knowing anything about their origi- nal use" (Thalbitzer 1912:637). Akernilik ob- viously knew their function, but he was indeed a clever man who also knew what to tell and what not to tell a Danish friend of the Minister! Of the four masks received from Akernilik, two represent men and two are: female masks with the hair tops wound round with skinbands from which a couple of fish bead-strings [necklaces made from fish verte- brae] were suspended. They all have deep furrows across the face, the smooth intervals are blackened , whereas the bottom of the furrows is uncoloured, white as the natural colour of the wood, so that the furrows show out against the dark surface. A carrying- strap to be laid around the back of the wearer is fastened in the ears of the mask. . . . The masks brought me by Akernilik represented certain deceased persons whose names he gave me (Thalbitzer 1912:638). The presence of straps is proof that these carvings were dance masks and not portraits as Akernilik himself alleged to avoid opposing the pastor's prohibition. Furthermore, Thalbitzer added, "Besides these wooden masks I received a somewhat larger mask made of shark skin with a piece of skin sewn on as nose and the rims of mouth and eyes roughly seamed with small transverse strips of a lighter colour" (Thalbitzer 1912:639) (Figs. 8-11). Thalbitzer (1912:639) explained the use of masks: Aleqajik (old woman) told me that before the arrival of the Europeans the masks were often used in the house- games (uaajeertut) when they tried to represent the spirits of the angakut. The angakut themselves did not use them during ceremonies. When worn out they were not preserved but thrown out on the refuse -heaps. Akernilik told me that his father had been a skilled carver of wooden masks. Another old man who carved masks was Nataaq [Natáaq, born about 1850]. They used their masks merely for fooling or frightening the children, and when they died the masks were thrown into the sea together with their corpses. Thalbitzer (1912:639) also said that "these masks from Ammassalik are the only remnants found in Greenland of the western Eskimo's variegated world of cultic masks." This last sentence, how- ever, is Thalbitzer's personal opinion , which was not borne out through observation. Nobody in Ammassalik has ever seen masks being used for any shamanistic cult , although during the games uájertut, they were apt to represent mythical beings or tutelaries of the angakkoq or shaman. Not until the 1930s were studies of Ammas- salik masks undertaken in a systematic way. In 1932, the ethnologist Knud Rasmussen included a masked dance in a film, "Palo's Wedding" (Palos Bruderfaerd) , which he directed in Am- massalik using Greenland actors. Since Rasmus- sen had spoken Eskimo since childhood, he won the trust of the people , and they cooperated with him in reviving a centuries-old tradition. In 1934-1935 and again in 1936 and 1937, a French expedition consisting of F. Matter, M. Perez, P. Victor, and I collected and studied many masks and their use on the east coast of Greenland, and I returned many times there- after. We arrived on board the Pourquoi Pas, the French polar boat, in midsummer. After settling quickly in a house lent by the Danish authorities, we spent three months learning the local language. It did not take the Ammassali - miut long to realize that these four foreigners, who did not speak Danish, who showed an in- terest in their way of life , and who lived with them in tents and winter houses, had no wish to change their customs and beliefs but instead wanted to learn about them. This was our entree to the masks and their use and meaning.</page><page sequence="5">Gessain: Ammassalik Masks 85 THE CARVERS There were no specialized craftsmen in the traditional society. Every dancer was able to carve his mask, just as he was able to make his own weapons, kayak, and other implements. Kruuse was misinformed when he wrote that there were only a few mask carvers. Everyone from childhood on tried to carve masks. The un- skillful, like those who did not succeed in sing- ing or dancing, felt rather ashamed. During our residence in Ammassalik in 1934- 1935, there were several good carvers. One of the most gifted and prolific was Georg Poulsen (born 1901, died 1962), a son of Pavia and a grandson of Utuak. He was known as Kion, the Greenland pronunciation of George, but was also called PibaT, one of his Eskimo names. He chose the surname Poulsen after the Danish form of his father Poul's Christian name when the Danish administration required everyone to take a family name toward the end of the 1940s. He lived in Kulusuk, not far from his fatherTs patriarchal house. Kion was an atypical Ammassalik since he insisted on living with his wife and a servant (whom he married when he became a widower) in a separate dwelling rather than in the traditional setting of the large household. He indeed secret- ly maintained the tradition of polygamy. Viva- cious and bright, and exceptionally clever at the ayagak (cup and pin) game, he skillfully carved bone, ivory, and wood figures which are found in many private collections. Some of his masks are imaginative face carvings not used for dances. An average hunter, he was subject to vertigo when kayaking and, unlike the good hunters, did not know how to roll the kayak. Several of his masks were included in the ex- hibition at the Musee de l'Homme from October, 1978, to January, 1979. Other skillful carvers in 1934-1935 were: Inuk (who later chose Elio as his surname) from Kulusuk, born in 1894, who carved the mask of a woman noticed by Andre Malraux (1952:376) (Fig. 27); Silas Silassen (born 1895), who chose "son of Silas" (himself) as his surname, and Morta Nuko (born 1879), both of whom have sev- eral beautiful masks in private collections: Nuga Utuak (born 1912), very skillful and gifted, whose masks are more classical in shape but imag- inative in the ornamental use of the traditional furrow; and Antu Utuak (born 1898), my adop- tive father, who carved a wooden mask without furrows for me in 1935. He told me, with a laugh, that it represented the caricature of a European sailor with pimples on his face (Fig. 36). THE MAKING OF MASKS Dance masks were made of both wood and skin, but those of wood far outnumbered skin masks. Wooden masks ranged from 15 to 38 cm in height. MASKS OF WOOD Materials No trees grow in Greenland but rather only very small creeping willows which, at best, would provide only twigs for maskmaking. The Ammassalimiut found (and still find) trunks of trees in the pack ice, torn by currents from Siberian riverbanks and carried for one or two decades to the Ammassalik region by the polar stream. The floating trunks, caught by kayak hunters like game and pulled to shore, became the property of their discoverers and were dis- posed of in any way they desired, in trade (in the early days there was no money) , or given to whoever needed material for masks , handles , weapons, shafts, or kayak and umiak frames. 9 The driftwood , hardened by long immersion in seawater, bears different names (qilivatsiaq , agisitoq, and pinged) according to its look, grain of the wood, and other characteristics. Other materials used in making masks are ivory or sea mammal bone for the teeth , fur of various seals or dog (only occasionally, musk-ox fur sent as a gift from Scoresbysund) for eyebrows, mustache, and beard, and leather for the nar- row strips seen on some unblackened masks. The pieces of skin are cut by the women with their tsekke ("woman's knife," the traditional ulu) , and attached by the men with small pegs. Tools The tools used by the Ammassalik men (all carvers of wooden masks were men) are those universally used by Eskimos for wood carving. The dancer carved his mask using tools in the following order: (1) an adze (ulumat) to rough out the mask from a block of wood , and ( 2) the long handled man's knife, or crooked knife (iutivarneq) . 10 The end of the handle rests on the inner side of the right knee for a right- handed carver. This bearing point gives the tool great precision. The knife was used to im- prove the shape of a face , to carve teeth , and to cut the fastening strap. (3) The bowdrill (ammarini) was used to make the eyeholes, which were often enlarged with a knife, and the lateral holes for the fastening strap. The eye- holes of the mask were always even with the eyes of the dancer; if not, it was a false mask meant for sale. 9The umiak is the big family migration boat used until the middle of the nineteenth century for whale hunting. iUThis knife is the same tool known as the "crooked knife," but in Ammassalik the short steel blade is made crooked to carve ivory and straight to carve wood.</page><page sequence="6">*Ed. note: Essentially the same wording was borrowed by Bodil Kaalund in The Art of Green- land from the brochure, "Masques Eskimo d'Ammassalik," written by Dr. Gessain as his in- terpretation of female tattooing. -D.J.R. 86 Arctic Anthropology 21:2 Finishing the Mask After the carving was finished, the back side of the mask was hollowed to fit the face of the wearer, the front part was blackened with soot of the seal blubber lamp , and holes were made for the dancerTs eyes, mouth, and nose. Finally, furrows were carved out and the strap fastened. Wooden pegs held the hair, eyebrows, and some- times the beard , all made of pieces of sealskin or dog skin. With a few exceptions, such as "nar- row face" (Fig. 42) and the mask made by Antu Utuak (Fig. 37), masks without furrows are con- sidered to be unfinished. SKIN MASKS Masks made of sealskin, dog or shark skin were rarer than wooden masks, and were made by the women. Black depilated skins or white skins prepared by soaking and washing were cut with a woman's knife (tsekke, or ulu). Thread was made of two twisted or three plaited strands of seal sinew. The Danish ethnologist Inge Kleivan has equated these Ammassalik skin masks to a con- temporary festival called mitàrtut on the west coast of Greenland. During the Christian obser- vances of Christmas and Epiphany there are still found- though strongly acculturated-some of the elements associated with drum dances in Ammassalik, i.e., skin masks, soot-smeared faces, artificial penis, and begging for alms (Kleivan 1960). Mitàrtut comes from a word meaning "gamboling, frolicking, teasing, making faces." The word uajèrtoq is unknown on the west coast of Greenland, but is found in Ungava with the same meaning. 11 MASKS AND TATTOOING The furrows cut out after the masks had been blackened with soot from the seal grease lamp have, heretofore, been interpreted as wrinkles or pure decoration. However, there is solid evi- dence that facial tattooing is represented on many of the masks. In Alaska as well as among the Central Eskimos of northern Canada, authors such as Boas (1888:561) and Mathiassen (1927: 274-275) have described tattooing on women's faces. These designs on forehead, cheeks and chin, made by puncturing the skin with needles coated with soot or by passing a sinew thread under the skin, had significant meanings. They recorded the stages of a woman's life, and their number increased as a woman marked important events: first menstruation, marriage, birth of a child , birth of a son , and first seal killed by the first-born son (on this occasion, vertical lines were tattooed on the chin.)* A tattooed face told everybody the successes of a woman's life. Some old drawings of the nineteenth century illustrate these "telling-tattooings" on women's faces, and the designs coincide with the furrows that appear on the most traditional Ammassali- miut masks: parallel lines in V-formation on the forehead, points between the eyebrows, horizontal rows on the cheeks, and vertical rows on the chin. Such tattoos on women's chins were reported during the eighteenth cen- tury by Hans Egede on the west coast of Green- land and in the nineteenth century by W. A. Graah on the east coast south of Ammassalik (Graah 1837). Facial tattooing disappeared in Ammassalik at the end of the nineteenth century , but tattooing on the arms and legs persisted long- er , and even nowadays one may see conspicuous tattooing of dots or small lines, considered to have a prophylactic value, on the forearms and wrists. Earlier, there were probably many other reasons for tattooing, but these are now lost to us. (It is possible that male face tattooing also existed among the ancestors of the Ammassali- miut, as among the Alaskan and Canadian Eski- mos who engaged in whaling, as recognition for the success of the hunt.) Many of the Ammassalimiut masks collected between 1934 and 1936 show furrow patterns that differ from tattooing, and which have only an aesthetic value, ornamentation having taken the place of meaning. The masks by Nuga Utuak (Fig. 40) and an unknown carver (Fig. 43) are good examples of this type. At one time, dancers, in a clever dodge of the Minister's prohibition against wearing masks, pasted thin strips of leather on their faces, thus transforming their own faces into masks. This innovation was later adopted on some wood- en masks where narrow straps took the place of furrows (Figs. 16-18). THE MEANING OF TRAITS AND SHAPES Some of the traits of masks can be related to legendary personages or mythical beings. The nose with enlarged nostrils represents the martyred orphan who was lifted by the nos- trils and teased. lxIt has been noted that certain technical, linguistic, and cultural traits found among the Labrador Eskimo are close to those of eastern Greenland. Some of the migrant groups to Ammassalik travelled through the North and did not touch the west coast. Could the dance masks and games in which they appear have some rela- tionship to such migrations?</page><page sequence="7">Gessain: Ammas salik Masks 87 The mouth enlarged with a piece of wood (we call it "mors de danse"), which laterally distends the cheeks and mouth, is a trait present in a few masks and represents Qaqilangerseq ("the one who makes noise with a bone between the teeth"). Qaqilangerseq was a man of ancient times who, according to tradition, began to dance with a bone in his mouth that was taken from a piece of seal meat he had just eaten. Curled and tangled hair were also motifs that indicated this charac- ter, although not necessarily on the same mask with the wide mouth. 12 The mask, kiak amitsertewa ("narrow face") bears the name of a mythical being one might meet near the sea. Whoever sees this being loses his strength. The woman, Nalikateq, was a well-known legendary character who served as a subject of many masks , especially in the uàjèrtut games (see below). The angakkoq's tutelaries, or helping spirits, were also subjects. Some masks have descriptive names: the "falling eye," the "twisted mouth," and the "twisted nose." A mythical being who is but half a being, appearing as a longitudinally split person (illukoq or illuinaq-illu , one of the two, the other side; koq, that which is left; naq9 who is only) , is not represented in our collection of masks from Ammassalik (see Ray 1975: plate 12). We have not yet ascertained the meaning of the double noses (two lateral or two superim- posed noses), nor the meaning of the mask with two mouths with hair made of musk-ox fur. 13 A study of the different shapes of masks and their tattooing, together with findings of archae- ology, linguistics, and other disciplines, could provide important information about the interac- tion between Inuit and other cultures; the Am- massalimiut who remained isolated for centuries preserved the ancient traditions from their an- cestorsT migrations. UÀJÈRTUT GAMES Masks were used in the uàjèrtut games, which took place in the large winter house when the ice, from January on, permitted guests to travel by sled between the islands. There were many "games" or scenes in uàjèrtut, played in no special order. One of the characters in a uàjèrtut game was 12We have named a piece of bone or wood held between the teeth "mors de danse" because of the analogy with the bit of a horse (mors, bit). 13In 1778 on the American coast of Bering Strait , the explorer James Cook saw an Eskimo wearing a large labret in bone or shell cut out in the shape of small teeth under his lower lip, which made it appear that he had two mouths. Nalikateq. Jens Rosing, a talented writer and artist, and son of Otto Rosing, a Lutheran minis- ter in Ammassalik for many years , described a game of uàjèrtut that he witnessed in the 1940s in which this character was represented by a man wearing a wooden mask similar in shape to one carved 20 years earlier by Anirai (Fig. 26). This mask had a knot of hair on the top of the head (Rosing 1957). This woman, who puts her tongue out, is dangerous, an entrail eater and a luring siren, whom the angakkoq met on the way to the Moon- Man . The name Nalikateq (nalika: fork of legs, and teq : which has activity there) refers to the living dog head that Nalikateq has between her legs. This head rises like an erect phallus (Gessain 1958). Nalikateq's drumstick was a dagger (see the drawing by Karl Andreassen, Fig. 53) , and by her comical gait she tried to make the angakkoq laugh. If he did laugh, she received power to open his belly. But, during the uàjèrtut game in which she appeared, all those who were made to smile or laugh were beaten. One may draw a parallel between the angakkoq on his way to the Moon-Man and the audience in the winter house: laughing is dan- gerous . Although Nalikateq was a mythical being in the shamanistic pantheon , she also appeared in other masked dances of comical, sometimes clownish sketches, all of which were entertain- ment for the long winter evenings. When Nalikateq or some other character, such as the tutelary of an angakkoq , were represented by masks , the audience in the large common house readily recognized them. Religion and lay life were intimately mixed in these performances. The dark shamanistic performances devoted to the summoning of the spirits (tártaq) were be- lievable, and when a shaman's tutelary de- scribed the travels of the shaman who was ab- sent flying to other worlds , the spirit world became as real as that of everyday. Another scene of uàjèrtut was one featuring "the poor and widowed woman begging for food and love." A man wore a mask of a woman, noticeable by its hair knot (for example, like those carved by Nuga or Inuk in Figs. 27 and 41). She called for food, and was given food. Then she said she needed a man, and went round the assembly, laying her hand on the men's sexual organs. But if there was too little food or the organ too flaccid , she chased her victim and beat him with her drumstick. This is also what the first observers , Holm and Kruuse , saw ; the masked man "frightens the others and runs after them," without understanding the meaning of the game. Another scene involved a masked or un- masked man with a large artificial penis (kammiun, a wooden tool used to soften the soles of the kamik or leather boots) , who went around to the women, inducing laughter through</page><page sequence="8">88 Arctic Anthropology 21:2 his sexual allusions and provocations. Yet another scene was one in which a dancer, masked or made up with soot, sang and asked everyone in turn when they were born, in sum- mer or in winter (attiwa, up, the sun is up; qattiwa, down, the sun is low). Thus, the population was divided into two groups, or moieties. Those who did not belong to the same group as the dancer were beaten with his stick. The games were usually followed by a meal of putrid seal (qitsiaq , which is considered to be a brain stimulant) , and then a "game of lamps extinction" was played. In this sexual promis- cuousness (forbidden between first cousins) or ritual collective union , the fecundity of nature was insured for one year. (This promiscuous- ness, unlike spouse exchange which can take place any time of the year, occurred only in the winter. ) THE SHAMAN'S TUTELARIES Sometimes a masked man represented an angakkoq's tutelary, which the onlookers recog- nized through some distinctive features. Most of these spirits were familiar to the inhabitants of the large house where performances took place because the angakkoq called his spirits by their name during the shamanistic performances (tórnadeqf convocation of attendant spirits, tàrtaq). The tutelaries or helping spirits must not be confused with inua, which in Ammassalik is called iwa (or Uva in the modern spelling). Inua is often translated in the ethnological literature as "spirit." Inua, which literally means "the human of this one who is spoken of," is a word pertaining to the animistic vision of the cosmos , which means that every living being is inhabited by a common living entity. This renders possible the metamorphosis of animal into man and vice versa. In Ammassalik, inua does not appear as a spirit having a direct re- lationship to the activities of shamanistic scenes. MAKING FACES The Ammassalimiut were- and sometimes still are- a laughing people. Their conception of the world , their perception of the universe and of the relations between men and other living be- ings, made them confident and thankful toward the cosmic powers. They laugh, they make others laugh, and they appeal to the spectators to laugh through their mimicry. Making faces is part of this traditional mimicry , as is telling a story or pursuing game in a finger game, a true gestural language. Making faces is somewhat like wearing a mask, and was done almost always to create laughter through caricature, a talent found generally among Ammassalimiut. Some excel in making faces. The face-maker becomes the be- ing that he mimics : a friend , an animal whose actions he copies, or the mythical being to whom he gives life (Fig. 55). In Ammassalik, everyone spoke of himself in pejorative terms , glorifying his own defects (often untrue) and caricaturing himself in an effort to make other people laugh. This same mocking humor, with no unkindness intended, was also applied to others in an atmosphere of fun and as inducement to laughter. These self- effacing attitudes were the basis of uàjèrtut games, and characterized the Eskimos1 relation- ship to most mythical beings and tutelaries as well. MUSÉE DE L'HOMME'S COLLECTION An exhibit was held in Paris for the Musée de l'Homme's collection of Ammassalik masks from October, 1978, to January, 1979. Since masks are no longer used in Ammassalik for dancing, the collection has acquired great ethnological value. According to Jean-Francois Le Mouèl, an ethnologist at the Musée de THomme, This outstanding collection of 208 masks [with the collection number 34-175] is un- questionably one of the most important in the arctic world to be gathered in one museum. Truly revealing the psychic universe of the Ammassalimiut, those driftwood masks show human faces whose overcaricatured features distort them without allowing any doubt con- cerning their anthropomorphic identity . . . they are stamped by a stylistic tradition which archeologists trace to Dorset cul- ture. . . . This non-academic tradition did not dampen the invention of their carvers at the beginning of this cen- tury (Le Mouel 1975; translated from the French). The collection is not a homogeneous one, containing, as it does, masks collected under different circumstances and masks used for dances or merely carved as faces by the young people. Those definitely used in dancing, with the back hollowed out and a strap tied to the edges , were collected by us in the winter houses. Toward the end of our stay, we (and especially P. E. Victor) collected the face carv- ings , some of which are small indeed , but ex- hibit technical skill and rich, imaginative forms. GREENLAND MASKS TODAY In one of his books, Jens Rosing originated the term , "East Greenland mask culture" (Ros- ing 1957). It is a literary work of interest</page><page sequence="9">Gessain: Ammassalik Masks 89 which has revived some aspects of early east Greenland life; in it are nine illustrations of modern masks that demonstrate the evolution of forms. The masks and ceremonies in which they were used two or three generations ago have disappeared under the influence of the Lutheran ministers, who were shocked by the realism of the drum dances and forbade the use of the drum in the name of the new reli- gion. To them, the drum was the instrument of the shaman , although other drums were used for dancing and singing. The present-day Ammassalimiut , now assim- ilated into the Western economic, social and re- ligious system , have lost the greater part of their cultural identity. Masks made for sale today have as their main motif a malevolent be- ing, diabulu, a confused representation of mythical beings in the ancient Eskimo religion and the Christian devil. The faces are no longer blackened with soot from the oil lamps (which no longer exist), but are colored with shiny dark paint and boast big canine teeth, conjuring forth gruesome visions. In only two generations, a lively and sensitive art has be- come a souvenir-level craft. But it is hoped that one day there will be a renewal of artistic traditions among the Ammassalimiut, whose grandfathers displayed such talent, and to hear once again the traditional songs and laughter of the audience. FOREWORD TO ILLUSTRATIONS All the masks published here are of drift- wood blackened with soot from seal blubber lamps, unless otherwise indicated. The fur- rows are always cut out after blackening with soot and appear white. Those masks referred to as dance masks are hollowed at the back to accommodate the dancer's face, and have eye and mouth openings allowing the dancer to both see and speak. Some of the masks from this collection (34- 175, Musée de THomme, Paris) cannot be used for dancing. They have neither been hollowed out nor do they have straps for attaching the mask to the dancer's face. These are referred to as trade masks; they were made for us in 1935 and they present the same interest from a plastic point of view. Most of the masks capture a human face in motion. This seems to me specific to the style of Ammassalik. CREDITS Figures 4 and 5 are published courtesy of Museum F. Volkerkunde, Wien.

(Musee de l'Homme 34-175.2719) Figure 47. Driftwood mask with narrow furrows and deep gashes showing the natural color of the wood. This is the only mask in the collec- tion with such gashes.

Drawing, by Karl Andreasen, of the legendary Nalikateq. Her knife is in the guise of a drumstick; a living dog head is be- tween her legs. The plate is to catch the en- trails of the angakkoq (seated in the back- ground) if he fails to resist smiling at her mimicry. Karl (b. 1880, d. 1932) was adopted by an angakkoq who became a Christian. He produced a great many drawings representing the mythical beings of his people. Figure 54.
