<plain_text><page sequence="1">LORENZO VALLA'S ANTI-ARISTOTELIAN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY CHARLES TRINKAUS I t has often been observed that the humanists of the Italian Renais- sance in their efforts to recover and correct ancient texts deve- loped an empirical methodology resting on close observation. Among the elements contributing to the great transformations of natural philosophy and the sciences, close and accurate assemblage of data was certainly an important one. How much, if anything, of the so-called "scientific revolution" may be attributed to the parallel empiricism of the humanities is probably an unanswerable question.' Galileo's early and enduring interest in literary ques- tions, although intriguing, may well have had little to do with his scientific interests and discoveries. Yet it is no doubt true that his skill in projecting and representing his own conceptions and those of the rival visions of the physical universe was effective in 1 Discussions of the relation of humanism and the "scientific revolution" may be found in P.

In this essay, however, I will be looking at his Repastinatio philosophie et dialectice, both in his first redaction of 1439 and his second redaction of ca 1448, now edited with his significant insertions and corrections of ca 1453 and renamed Retractatio totius dialectice cum fundamentis universe philosophie; in both instances his first book only.3 Book one of Valla's Dialectica is purportedly a critique and modification of Aristotle's Categories and of the derivative Isagoge of Porphyry in Boethius' translation and commentary on the same. Valla rejects Aristotle's ten categories, replacing them with three: substance, quality and action. He retains the term "quality" for eight of the nine Aristotelian categories remaining, "action" equalling 2 See W.R.

ZIPPEL, pp. Ix-cxxx and Valla's second and third redactions (beta and alpha) entitled Retractatio totius dialectice cum fundamentis philoso- phie, based on Bibl. Vatic., Cod. Ottoboniano latino 2075 collated with other existing manuscripts and printed editions. This is the third redaction (alpha) which extends and corrects the second redaction (beta) with all insertions and changes in (beta) annotated by Zippel. It is entitled Retractatio because it is a thorough-going redrafting of the first redaction. The latter, contained in vol. II, bears the title Repastinatio, which is properly the title of all three redactions. It may be translated from the classical term repastinatio meaning a re-ploughing of a ploughed field, as a reworking or reconstructing of philos- ophy and dialectic. The second and third editions are sufficiently different from the first to justify editing it separately, which Zippel chose to do in a second volume, although it is the first and earlier version.

But Aristotle combined these also in his pair- ing of "substance" and "accident" and of "matter" and "form". Valla believes these distinctions are confused and confusing and considers "quality" as a more accurate replacement of both "form" and "accident". He believes that pure "substance" is never encoun- tered except in God, Who declared Himself in Genesis as "He Who is" and in Revelation as "The Lord God Who is". In his first redaction of ca 1439 Valla devised the term "consubstance" or "consubstantial" to designate the combination of substance and quality and the only mode in which anything can be encountered (except for God). This "thing" or "res" can act or be acted upon, and "res" with its multiple usages is Valla's fundamental term. "Con- substance" is abandoned in his second and third redactions.4 In the proem of his third redaction Valla states that the follow- ers of Aristotle (that is the scholastics) reject and impugn the the- ology of the Fathers on the basis of their knowledge of metaphysics, logic and the modes of signifying.5 He will, as far as he can, lead the later theologians back to true theologizing and refute Aristotle and the Aristotelians. He will do that both in dialectic and the other parts of philosophy, "reconsidering necessarily on a deeper level the fundamentals [primordii] of this matter which book one will contain together with much of natural and moral philosophy, for the second book will consider the interpretation of words [as though a new pern hermeneias] and the third the method of argumen- tation".6 4 An interpretative synopsis.

"Non-angelic" is divided into "that which is made after the image of God which is called 'human'... and into that which is not made after the image of God, which can perhaps also be divided into species: their individuals the spirit of this brute and of that one". I use the word "brute" rather than "animal" because Valla calls all "animated bodies" "animals", un- like the Aristotelians, giving full souls to animals, not just "sensi- tive". He adds: "I except Christ from the genus of animal who not only is man but also God"!8 I pass over his ensuing chapters dum posteriores reducam, Aristotelem atque aristotelicos, confutabo. Idqua etiam cum in cetera philosophia, tum vero in dialectica, repetitis necessario altius huius rei primor- diis: que liber primus una cum multis naturalis philosophie (nam secundus verborum inter- pretationem, tertius argumentandi rationem) continebit". I have inserted the words: velut ad novam pen hermeneias from the last sentence of book one in the first redaction, ZIPPEL, 446-29-30. 7 ZIPPEL, chap. 7, 46-50. See ANICIUS MANLIUS SEVERINUS BOETHIUS, Commentaria in Porphyrium a se translatum, PL 64, 71-156: 103. The Arbor praedicamentalis is diagram- med on p. 283: (Valla's alternate system is placed beside it). 8 ZIPPEL, 49.19-23; 50.3-4: "'non angelicus' in eum qui factus est ad imaginem Dei, qui dicitur 'humanus' ... et in eum qui non factus est ad imaginem Dei, qui forte et in species dividi posset: eorum individua 'spiritus huius bruti' et 'illius'. ... Christum excipio ab animalis, qui non homo tantum, sed etim Deus est". For Valla the major flaw in the Pophyrian/Boethian tables of genuses and species was its failure to differentiate the divine and the created. As Boethius has it [PL 64, 103]: "... sub corporeo vero animatum atque inanimatum corpus ponitur; sub animato corpore, animal ponitur: nam si sensibile adjicias animato corpori, animal facis, reliqua vero pars, id est, species, continet inanimatum et sensibile corpus; sub animali autem rationale atque irrationale; sub rationali Deus et homo, nam si rationali mortale subjeceris, hominem constitues; si immortale, Deum; Deum vero dico corporeum, hunc enim mundum veteres Deum vocabant ...". This statement was the source, not only of Valla's revision, but of persistent controversy among scholastics as to whether "animal", including "God" and "man", was univocal or aequivocal. An important example of this, close in time to Valla's youth, is reported by Z. KALU- ZA, Les querelles doctrinales a Paris: Nominalistes et realistes aux confins du XIVe et du XVe siecles, Bergamo, 1988, where at Paris in the early fifteenth century the Albertist (realist) Jean de Maisonneuve accused the terminist and follower of Buridan, Jean Dorp, of mak- 282</page><page sequence="5">VALLA'S ANTI-ARISTOTELIAN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY 4.4 ~ ~ . 04 C o u Z 4-4 \ D= .o U- U 4 V 1.4 &gt;~~~~ U) V CZ 4 ) ._4 0 0- 283~~~~~ -4- 4- - &amp; V 4 -4 -'-44"- 0 4 0- 044 )0 4- 4-4 0 ( 0 ~ ~ 44-.-4 0 4-4 4-4~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- 283</page><page sequence="6">CHARLES TRINKAUS "On 'spirit' and on 'God' and 'angels"', "On soul" and "On the virtues" and come to his chapter "On body" where his natural philosophy is for the most part to be found.9 Citing the Pseudo-Aristotelian De mundo 2 and 3, body, he says, is on the one hand "etherial" or "celestial", and the "non-etherial". ing men into gods on the basis of the Porphyrian/Boethian passage. Jean Dorp, comment- ing on Buridan's Summulae logicales (cit. KALUZA, Pp. 98, 116) defends him against the charge, saying: "ergo dicitur quod rationale est differentia convertible cum specie subalterna, quia Porphyrius ibi loquitur secundum modum loquendi saracenorum qui imaginantur plures esse deos. Ideo non est tenendus in hoc, immo ex fide habemus credere unum esse deum". Maisonneuve (ohannes de Novodomo) further charged the Buridanists with misusing Aristo- tle and therefore making anti-Christian statements: Et ideo fabricaverunt novos libros in illa materia saltem Parisienses non attendentes quod ecclesia catholica doctrinam Aristote- lis in tantum probavit, quod nullus in universalibus studiis in artibus posset graduari, nisi iuraverit illos libros audivisse, etsi videlicet Aristoteli non contradiceret in quantum non est dissonus fidei. Et certe si dicta eius bene inspicientur, tunc nullo modo est contrarius fidei ..." (cited by KALUZA, Pp. 99, 116, from his Commentum aureum, I, 1 ms. Erlangen 650, fol. 2va-vb). This controversy is relevant to Valla, and perhaps helps to explain the vehemence of his anti-Aristotelian stance which, as his Proem indicates, underlies his efforts to un- dermine Aristotle in all the branches of scholastic thought: theology, anthropology, ethics, and here natural philosophy (in book one). The possibility that Valla was familiar with these Parisian and northern university controversies of the early fifteenth century, con- temporary to his youthful residence in the environs of the papal curia, can only be a mat- ter of speculation. Nevertheless the possibility exists that he could have been. Conversation with Salva- tore Camporeale on this question prompted him to point out the following indications to me. In the introduction to the edition of VALLA, De professione religiosorum, Padua, 1986, M. CORTESI cites (p. xuv, n. 1) a critical reference to Valla by ROBERTO CARACCIO- LO DA LECCE in his Sermones quadragesimales de peccatis, Venice, 1488, fols. 57v-58r. Ro- berto quotes from Poggio's invective against Valla that Poggio had heard him semel in bibliotheca Minerve asserting that Augustine was not learned and did not speak correctly. Santa Maria sopra Minerva and its library was an important religious and theological cen- ter of the Dominican order. Valla in his Antidotum III answering Poggio's accusations refers (VALLA, Opera omnia, I, ed. E. GARIN, Turin, 1962, p. 352) to his efforts in 1429 to succeed his uncle in a position in the papal secretariat, claiming the Cardinal of San Eustachio and the Master of the Sacred Palace as his supporters. The latter, Andrea Chri- soberges, was one of the most influential theologians of the Dominican order and was later a major spokesman for the Roman position at the Council of Ferrara/Florence (see CAMPOREALE, op. cit., [see note 4], pp. 92, 126-127). It seems very probable that Valla would have acquired a knowledge of the current theological controversies in discussions and through contacts such as these. 9 ZIPPEL, chap. 8, pp. 50-59 ("spirit", God and angels); chap. 9, pp. 59-73 (soul); chap. 10, pp. 73-98 (virtues); chap. 10, pp. 98-110 (body); first redaction: chap. 13, pp. 402-408 (God); chap. 14, pp. 408-419 (soul and virtues); chap. 15, pp. 419-422 (body). I should at this point indicate my appreciation of Zippel's perceptive comments on Valla's natural philosophy (Introduzione, pp. xci-xcIa, cm-civ) and of his suggested scholastic re- ferences in his annotations. 284</page><page sequence="7">VALLA'S ANTI-ARISTOTELIAN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY But, he exclaims, "Who except a mad man would dare to say what the heavens are, since there is nothing of such matter among us, nor are we able to distinguish it by touch or any other sense". Moreover we cannot say that the stars are the denser part of the heavens or of ether as if the celestial corpus can be more compact and dense. "I know that the stars were made after the heavens were made and were located there; by what artistry I shall under- stand when I will have ascended there, just as reading the Holy Scriptures has taught me, so my vision [has taught me] that the sun and the stars vibrate [or twinkle]; something that Aristotle, as if he had descended from that place, denies. Would he also deny that our earthly fire vibrates?"' 0 We have in this opening passage of De 'corpore' an illustration of the double basis of Valla's knowledge of the natural world; he denies that we can know anything for which we do not have direct empirical evidence, but he does also know what the scriptures tell him to be true - a combination of simple empiricism and biblical literalism. Earlier, in discussing what could be said concerning God, he attempts to deconstruct what he makes out to be Aristotle's own theology.'1 He is, as we have said, seeking to undermine scholastic Aristotelian theology. Aristotle's god, he argues, is the universe itself, the mundus. But this mundus Aristotle thinks of as a sphere, in fact a whole series of spheres, all inside each other; and not only that, but the spheres have little spheres or epicycles circling around the circumference of the larger spheres, like a cir- cumstance he reports from Aristotle of a litter of foetal animals who, in turn, have tiny embryos inside the embryos.'2 In other words a conception like the Ptolemaic system is ridiculous and unknowable. Valla seems to agree that there is some sort of super- terrestrial universe, as, arguing against Aristotle's and others' no- tion of the eternity of the world that it could not have existed 10 ZIPPEL, 98.5-15; Ps.-Aristotle, De mundo 2, 3, 392a, 5b, 14.

ZIPPEL, 56.4-14. 285</page><page sequence="8">CHARLES TRINKAUS before the creation of mankind which had to have been recent, he asks: "For why would [God] wish for himself that rotation of the heavens and of the spheres (if any spheres are to be spoken of) around the land and the waters suspended in the middle?" [57.9-11]. Valla is also arguing at this point against Aristotle's supposed identification of God and nature. "Certainly", he says, "Pythagoras and the Stoics held that the world was made by God and for the benefit of men. Therefore it is not animated. Therefore minds (which the Greeks called noas and the recent Latins from apo tou noein, 'understanding', translated as 'intelligences') are not insert- ed into the spheres ... They wish the orbs themselves to be aroused for action by these, namely entirely by the angels ordered by God to reside there: just as if Aristotle, who made the gods animated bodies, either those I have mentioned or others, believed that any spirits or any souls could exist without bodies [i.e., the planets]" [57. 14-22].13 Here, too, Valla expressed his disdain for astrology. "Pythagoras called the world 'cosmos' on account of its beauty, a term which is thought by istis [i.e., the scholastic natural philosophers] to have meant that it was an animal. This is because they call man a 'micro- cosm' and the world a 'macrocosm'. As a result, just as man is an animal, so [they thought] heaven or God also is an animal. Hence I believe the astrologers have had a garden, not of the sciences, but of their own vanity in discerning the fate of man ... The fates lie in the decisions of God, not those of the heavens or time" [54.22-55.9].14 In this argument he is charging Aristotle and his followers with an anthropomorphic view of both divinity and the celestial realm. More overtly, toward the end of this chapter ["On 'spirit', 'God' and 'the angels"'], after criticizing Aristotle for urg- ing men to become godlike through a life of contemplation ("as if to contemplate was not to act and contemplation not action"), 13 See the passage from Boethius cited in note 8 above. Reference here is to ano- ther instance of Aristotle's supposed faulty predication of "animals" as including gods. 14 Valla's scepticism concerning astrology (as well as of occult matters in general) is far ranging. But if he is even sceptical about the existence of planets, that would seem to follow. On the other hand he is ready to accept whatever is stated in the scriptures provided that the texts have been philologically authenticated. 286</page><page sequence="9">VALLA'S ANTI-ARISTOTELIAN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY he declares: "Thus, while he wishes to render men similar to the gods, he makes the gods similar to men" [58.10-11, 14-15]. In his first redaction of ca 1439 his chapter "On 'body"' (which is much briefer: two and a half pages rather than twelve plus) he basically lists the species ("vegetable" and "not vegetable") and their possible subspecies. However he concludes in a way that is taken up and expanded in the second and is further expanded in the third redaction. Having listed some of the possible subdivi- sions of "terrestrial" body and of "aqueous" body, he adds: "Perhaps the same may be conceded for fire and air, for the stars are fires, and they call that upper air 'ether', as more liquid and purer, and they wish the 'orbs' or 'globes' (which the Greeks call sphairas) to differ in quality, but yet they also place the element of fire in- side the sphere of the moon". We shall soon see how that last statement becomes a point of major contention in the later ver- sions. "But", he adds, "they seem to me to dream, or to wish to glory in things that although false are nevertheless marvelous". And then he lists a number of traditional positions of natural philosophy which he rejects, several of which he would discuss and justify his own position in the two later redactions: "I would agree to the truth of neither the spheres, nor the fiery element, nor the five zones of the earth; nor do I agree that the sea is higher not only than the mountains but not even than the shores, nor that the earth is spherical, nor that air is converted into water and fire, nor again fire into air, nor to other things of this sort; these seem to me to approach closely to the insanity of the astrologers, to pronounce concerning the fortune and life of mankind and other audacities of this kind" [421.34-422.13]. When he returns to these questions in chapter 11 of the later version, "On 'body"', he turns immediately to the standard, and well-known notion of Aristotle and scholastic natural philosophy that there is a fiery sphere below the sphere of the moon made up of the first of the four elements followed by the sphere of the element air and then those of water and of earth. "Just as [Aristo- tle] denies that that [celestial realm] is fiery, so with Empedocles he makes a fiery element [here] which we neither discern nor feel its blast of hot air. But would I be able to resist it by invincible reason? Aristotle says, 'Motion is the cause of heat, for that vio- lent motion of the spinning of the spheres kindles the upper part 287</page><page sequence="10">CHARLES TRINKAUS of the air and converts it into fire' [De coe. II, 7, 289a, 20-25; Meteor. I, 3, 340b, 10-12, 341a 17-18]. As if we should observe that any wheel when it is rapidly turned gives off heat when at its peak rather than, if it was hot, be cooled off" [98.15-22]. At this point he confronts Aristotle's speculation [i.e., his "in- vincible reason"] with his own observation, refuting first the ex- ample in order to refute, finally, the theory of a sphere of fire surrounding the earth beneath the moon. "But let us hear a reason demonstrated by experiment. [Aristotle] says, 'Just as leaden mis- siles shot out by force liquify in the air' [Cf. De coel. II, 7, 289a 26-28]. What wonder is it if he dares to lie about things remote from our senses when he lies so about things that are visible to all?" [98.22-99. 1]. Showing that he must deal with more than Aristo- tle's, he adds similar statements of Ovid [Metam. II 727-729] and Seneca [Nat. quaest. II 57]. "Whoever noticed a ball whether leaden, iron or stone shot out of a sling heat up in the air, not to mention melting the lead? Certainly the feathers of arrows ought to be burned more than their points if they are leaden. But yet no one has ever detected their point or shaft or feathers (even if they are made of paper) catch fire when they have landed, not even under the hottest sun. Nor does the machine which they call a 'bombard', which was unknown to the ancients and has such great spin that no human force can be compared to it, ever liquefy a leaden ball in the air even though blasted out by so much fire. Moreover both that cannon ball and other missiles lose their heat, if they had any, in going, so that the motion is the cause, rather, of refrigeration. Hence exposure to moving air in the baths and the respiration of the heart chills, as the flight of birds on high does not heat up their feathers at all which are moved at the greatest speed. The rubbing together and collision of two heavy bodies mutually resist- ing each other (as earth and water, just as happens in an axle-tree and wheels) creates heat; sometimes even compression without any or with scarcely any motion. Air itself that is moved and agitated produces no heat, indeed, if any has been acquired elsewhere, it loses it and cools off" [98.22-100.1].15 15 Vaila's statement asserting that Aristotle incorrectly claims that motion produces heat but that in fact friction causes it may be compared with Galileo Galilei's statement in his II Saggiatore, 44: "Now let us proceed to examine the experience of arrows shot 288</page><page sequence="11">VALLA'S ANTI-ARISTOTELIAN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY Valla further speculates from his own observation of the con- tact of moving objects and air on a more earthly level that "the spheres, if they set fire to air by their own movement, would much more also move it [i.e., the air] (which they do not do) and turn it with itself by its contact. I do not see why the sphere itself would not be set on fire along with the air, nor how the air could be burned" [100.1-5]. He next offers two justifications of his anti-Aristotelian view of this question, one theological and the other physical and again relying on a personal experience: "God from the beginning created the elements; He did not wish them to be created in some other way by that spinning of the spheres itself, since that would have been of special value for nothing". The other, physical, justifica- tion seems to have a Stoic element in it, for it makes fire the dominant element: "For so great is both the power and excellence of fire that it never receives the alien qualities cold, darkness and rest as the other bodies do: for air, water, earth, which are by their own nature cold, dark, quiet, receive heat. And fire's heat is greater than the cold of the other things (since we are not able to suffer fire on our hand, snow we are able), and a small portion of brightness lights up a large darkness. Therefore the sun would be sufficient for providing heat both to us and the world aided by the cause I mentioned above: that fire is generated from a colli- sion and heat from compression, especially of the moisture which having been attached to the earth heats up and is exhaled" [100.5-18]. Like some other Renaissance thinkers, Valla has a special in- terest in the sun. In his famous argument that the divine Trinity was a "consubstance" of God as substance and Father, Son and Spirit as qualities, both in the first and the later redactions, he with a bow and of lead balls shot with a sling set on fire and melted through the air as confirmed by the authority of Aristotle, of many great poets, of other philosophers and historians. ... It is most false that I or signor Mario laughed and joked over the expe- rience from Aristotle, there not being the least word of derision in the book of signor Mario, nor is it written other than as if we did not believe that a cold arrow shot with a bow would be set on fire; instead we believe that, shooting a burning one, it would be more rapidly cooled off than if it were held still..."

DRAKE, Garden City, NY, 1957, pp. 269-270. 289 19</page><page sequence="12">CHARLES TRINKAUS compares God to the sun which has the permanent qualities of vibration, light and heat. Again, in the third redaction he com- pares God and the sun as the source of truth illuminating the hu- man mind and of light illuminating the universe.'6 In this present instance, the allusion to the sun refers to Aristotle's Meteorology. Aristotle says [I, 3, 341a 14f]: "As for the heat derived from the sun, the right place for a special and accurate account of it is in the treatise about perception, since heat is an affection of percep- tion; but we may now explain how it can be produced by the heaven- ly bodies which are not themselves naturally hot". This refers to his claim that the motion of the spheres heats the air beneath the moon and turns it into fire, which Valla has been opposing, and also to the problem of the conversion of the elements into each other which Aristotle discusses in both this work and especially in On Generation and Corruption. Valla's reference to the heating and exhalation of groundwater above leads him directly into his discussion of this phenomenon. "They say [i.e., the Aristotelians] that cold flees downward from this celestial fire and upwards from the heat of the earth to the middle region of the air, and because of this clouds, snow and hail are formed, as if they had discovered that the air above the clouds was hot and burning, or as if they had ever seen the feathers of birds flying in the sublime region of the other element burning. And what is more, as if [this middle air] was a cold body, and just like a small iron box in the magnetic tomb of Arsinoe , it hangs in the middle! That place above the clouds is frozen because the vapor of the earth does not ascend all the way to it, and it freezes the smallest particles of water coming to it, and on account of this keeps it from ascending further, and it condenses, just as we sometimes see happen at dusk in winter when it is serene in the smoke around the peak of houses. Therefore cold and heat are extinguished, not expelled from one place to another, nor submerged into the bottom of lands, as many argue ... Heat does not come to waters, but is generated from water, and cold does not descend into the earth but is a natural part of earth. For if you take the 16 First redaction, chap. 14, "Quid sit Deus", 404.10-21 (5); second and third re- dactions, chap. 8, "De 'spiritu"' deque 'Deo' et 'angelis"', 52.5-21 (5) (6); on truth: chap. 2, "Sex que vocantur 'transcendentia'...", 20.6-10 (30). 290</page><page sequence="13">VALLA'S ANTI-ARISTOTELIAN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY powder from the marble pavements of temples in winter and make a large heap of it and pour water into it when compressed and thrown into a wooden trough, you will cause it to become hot and good for generating plants, water which otherwise never would be- come heated unless perhaps by extreme compression" [100.24-101.20]. We have him here again casting doubt on the pos- sibility of gaining empirical evidence to substantiate the claims of Aristotle, and offering his own empirical observation of a common phenomenon - the heat produced by mixing lime and water. Passing over several disputed questions to which we shall return, Valla resumes his critique of the relationships and phenomena of the elements, directed as much against scholastic natural philosophy as Aristotle. "Excess of heat is not fire, nor excess of cold ice, as Aristotle says, since ice and fire are bodies, heat and cold are not". Valla is beginning his discussion of Aristotle's On Generation and Corruption II, 3-7, where the four elements are linked in pairs sharing one of two of the four qualities: hot, cold, moist, dry as- signed to each. "And if fire cannot subsist by itself (I am speaking of our [i.e., earthly] fire not of sidereal), then it also consumes the thing to which it adheres. Nor does it seem to me to occupy space in the very thing which it embraces, as in the smoke or the cinder, or ignited metal. Moreover it is converted into nothing, because it is made out of nothing" [102.22-30]. Here again Valla rests his physics on theology, rather than, as he accuses the scholas- tics, basing theology on Aristotle's physics: "Through this", he says, "God manifests his own power in order that we may know that something can be made out of nothing and nothing out of some- thing" [102.30-103.1]. And Valla adds a reference to his classifica- tion of souls as immortal, that is man's, and mortal, that is the brute's: This is "just as I said above about the souls of the brutes. For fire is in a certain way a mean between these souls and the other bodies". Continuing on the transformation of the elements: "For if fire is converted into air and air into fire (as they say ten- fold of fire is confected out of air, and tenfold of air out of water, and tenfold of water from land), why do we never see the air burned up, nor diminished or increased from the sea, nor the land?" [103.1-10]. Then, speaking more specifically of the Aristotelian kinship of the elements: "But yet they assign a certain affinity to the ele- 291</page><page sequence="14">CHARLES TRINKAUS ments. Namely fire is hot and dry: I would prefer they had said 'luminous' rather than 'dry', as I will soon show. That that elemental fire is neither hot nor luminous I do not grasp. Air, however, is hot and moist: I myself have denied that it is hot; indeed I have proved it to be cold; if this is so, there is no fiery element, because the kinship of heat has been removed. For if fire is hot and dry, it cannot cohere with air which I have also proved is cold and they say 'moist'. I would now add that it is not moist, which appears to be obvious. For by what law can moisture be joined with hot dryness: as if the upper half of the air is dry, the other lower half is moist, which is ridiculous to say? What is hot and dry, this will not be air but fire: therefore 'dry' is to be called air" [103. 10-25].17 Valla continues a rather lengthy discussion of this problem in which he begins to introduce linguistic considerations showing a misuse of language by Aristotle and his followers that has the ef- fect of obscuring the meaning and underlying their mistaken con- ceptions. But he also brings up two further physical arguments. One is that the simple bodies, excepting air, also have weight. "Now indeed whatever is moist is also heavy. But yet there is no weight in air; inflated bladders are no heavier than empty ones, and ships and boxes are no heavier than the material from which they are made.18 But all moist things are so heavy they consist of two diverse bodies. Things also are called 'moist' because they have liquid in them. Humor [i.e., liquid or moisture], however, is not a quality, as calor [heat] is, but body, and water is contained under 17 It should be noted that Valla, in introducing a semantic consideration here, is not abandoning the phenomenological arguments he has previously made but is rather mixing the two. It will be argued below that, even though confusion of terms can lead to obfuscation, a thing or res exists outside of the mind as well as also existing as a word. See below, pp. 306-318. 18 Valla was obviously wrong about this, which seems to have been known to the ancients, as he was of many other natural phenomena. His anti-Aristotelianism was cer- tainly anti-systematic and anti-conceptual. But what is important is his effort to utilize empirical observations, no matter if casually and unsystematically, of natural phenomena that could not have existed if Aristotle had been right. It seems to have been Evangelista Torricelli and Vincenzo Viviani, students of Galileo, who first devised a barometer in the 1640s presumably based on Galileo's own conception. See A. WOLF, A History of Science, Technology and Philosophy in the 16th and 17th Centuries, New York, 1950 (repr. of second edition, New York, 1950), p. 92. 292</page><page sequence="15">VALLA'S ANTI-ARISTOTELIAN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY it as the species of a genus: ... and 'humor' [liquid] differs from 'humiditas' [moisture, humidity] and 'calor' [heat] from 'caliditas' [hotness] as genus from species, because moisture is the liquid [water] of a moist body and hotness is the heat of a hot body ..." [104.1-14]. Valla grants that 'hotness' hardly differs from 'heat', and 'moist- ness' and 'humidity' are customarily understood by many as 'li- quid' [humor]. There are many examples of what he is talking about; "liquid is wine, vinegar, all juices, tears, spit, water. ... Clothing or soil soaked or drenched by these is called 'moist' [humida] so that they are two conjoined bodies, earth and water (just as mud, mire, slime, cake, porridge), and they then become heavier than they were before. It results from this that when they call air 'moist', they admit that it has weight and is not a simple body" [104.14-30]. It is by the evidence of this weight that Valla draws the conclusion that Aristotle is talking about a mixture of two bodies, not a per- manent quality of one, and he also exposes the confusion arising from the element of water having the same meaning as the quality moist. The other physical argument concerns space. As we quoted Valla above, the Aristotelians hold that tenfold the volume of air comes from water, and tenfold water from earth. Using the example of the bubbles of air formed in a fountain which burst out of the water just as soap bubbles "so long flying" erupt, he argues that the rarification of water into air would require an expansion of the heavens, and the condensation of air into water would require a contraction of the heavens. "For, as I have said, the scholastic philosophers [isti] say that air is condensed and changed into water and water is rarified into air. But if this should happen, although air will occupy no less space than water and earth, as a result of which we should have at least this space, frequently a small amount of water or earth would bring about a great amount of air: would it then be necessary to increase the size of the heavens?; and again, when much air would be changed into a little water and earth, to diminish it?" [105.14-19]. Continuing with the problem of the moist element also being a quality, he points out that to speak of wet water, and a whole series of similar redundancies, is linguistically ridiculous. "Yet the natural philosophers [physici] fall into this absurdity when they profess that water and similar things are humors [humores]; yet they 293</page><page sequence="16">CHARLES TRINKAUS say that in our bodies there are four humors, two of them humid certainly, but as many dry, although there are no humid humors for the reason I have given, neither are there any dry ones. For dryness is contrary to humidity and indicates nothing other than the absence of moisture. Also to say that fire and earth have a dry quality is part of the same clumsiness [inscitia], since it is not their quality precisely to be dry but to lack an admixture of another body which is called 'moisture"' [106.8-107.1]. Valla proceeds to point out further misstatements (as they ap- pear to him from everyday observations of nature) made in the On Generation and Corruption and Meteorology of Aristotle which we will pass over. When he rejects the notion that there are pure elements his basic difference with Aristotelian natural philosophy becomes clear. "Aristotle", he says, "also wishes the elements to be pure in their own regions, as though there is a purer earth and water elsewhere than those which are known to us. Also on bodies and those of the other animals, and likewise the trees and all things grown from seed, are fashioned from these. I know earth and water are in me and the other things I have named; fire I do not know of unless, perchance, they wish such fire as they imagine to be above the air which is neither seen nor felt" [109.16.23]. Clearly Valla is limiting knowledge of the corporeal world to what can be gained through the senses. Air, except as inhaled and exhaled, is also excluded from constituting flesh. But Valla's empiricism is rein- forced by his scriptural literalism. "All of this is also demonstrated by divine testimony, because we know God has formed man from mud, which is soil soaked in water. From this it is necessary that we be nourished by food and drink which are earth and water; again a corpse is dissolved into these two" [109.27-110.2]. Although it may be obvious that Valla does not totally reject abstractions, since he retains the four elements, it is also very clear that he makes qualities uppermost in his perceptions, even regard- ing the generic "thing" or res as indescribable in other than its qualities and actions. A short chapter "On 'matter' and 'form' and the 'composite"' follows that "On 'the body"'.19 He has complied with the standard usage of "matter and form", he says, rather than assented. Because, first there is not one form for one body but 1 ZIPPEL, chap. 12, 110.15-112.13. 294</page><page sequence="17">VALLA'S ANTI-ARISTOTELIAN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY many. Then because nothing could be more simple than the sub- stance composed of matter and form which they call "composite"; for if you take away one part the other will perish. Neither can exist separately. He considers the notion of a "prime matter" that can exist prior to and independently of form plainly stupid, and that of a quality without matter even "stupider". Significantly, Aristotle's own notion of the elements coming into existence and changing into each other in a process of "generation and corrup- tion" was based on the foundation of a necessary prime matter eternally existing which gave, for him, the metaphysical justifica- tion of the flux of existence. For Valla these metaphysical terms are unthinkable because, we might say, they are unspeakable.20 "If anyone denies some matter exists I would not be able to prove this to him nor to defend it, just as why these are suitable words: 'matter' and 'form'. For 'matter' is called, such as it is in a statue, marble, in a bench, wood, in a brick, clay, as I have claimed above; but 'form', what else does it signify than 'figure'? 0 Peripatetic nation, the distorter of meanings!" [111.6-13]. But it is not all a question of words. Something has to exist in the mind before there can be the word. "Finally, that they wish matter to be prior to form, how can what does not exist before be prior? And now they order us to imagine what lacks an image. Accept a worthy reason for his own proposition: 'As we may im- agine form without matter, thus we are able to imagine matter without form'. 'Let us imagine' what has an 'image', not what does not have one. And yet in that also they deceive: for nothing may be imagined except as though a body" [111.13-20]. It is probably impossible to estimate what, if any, effect Valla's negation of certain central Aristotelian doctrines may have had in clearing away some of the underbrush of traditional modes of think- ing about nature which may have obstructed the acceptability of the new science that would emerge almost two centuries later. But it would be wrong to regard this as a mere simplification of the older ideas. It is true that Valla works with them because their terminology was deeply ingrained, but always in the end to repudi- ate them. How radically he could break with the tradition may 20 Ibid., 110.18-111.6. Cf.

Fundamental to the tradition was the equivalence of the polarities of a superior and an inferior, higher and lower realm, in which the higher acted and the lower was act- ed upon. Form and matter was one such polarity; male action and female passivity was another: "Add to this the flower of Aristotelian demonstration from comparison: that the matter so desires form as the female the male and the ugly the beautiful. Truly the bloom of the thistle, stinging the hand of the writer. I do not say the male desires the female less than the female the male, because it does not proceed from beauty that it should desire ugliness: although I do not see how ugliness desires beauty. I do not say that it has not been established that matter is similar to the female and form to the male, but that the female desires the male and the male desires the female because each one lacks the other, something that cannot be said of matter and form; and they desire each other mutu- ally not in order that they may become one body and one sub- stance which are never to be separated, as happens with matter and form, but that, according to the time, each one will receive pleasure from the other" [111.21-112.9]. Truly a revolutionary state- ment against the background of Hellenic/Roman/scholastic and, we must say it, Renaissance thought. Aristotle's analogy, intended to reinforce his argument, is faulty because the relation of the male and female is one of mutuality, not domination and submission. This analogy, reversed to charac- terize the relationship of male and female as metaphysically deter- mined by the form acting on the matter as the carpenter on the wood, has been one of the most powerful figures of thought per- petuating the myth of masculine mastery and feminine dependen- cy. Valla's statement here is consistent with what he said elsewhere. For example, in his De vero et falsoque bono, "Antonio da Rho" ("Raudense") is made to say: "In the books of Moses God said, 'It is not good for man to live alone, let us make a helpmate for him similar to himself'. Although this was said about women, it should be understood for man as well. As the wife to the husband, so the husband is a helpmate to the wife" .21 21 Critical edition by M. DE PANIZZA LORCH, Bari, 1970, Book III, chap. xviI, 3, 296</page><page sequence="19">VALLA'S ANTI-ARISTOTELIAN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY Earlier in his chapter "On 'body"' Valla speaks of disputed matters which he passes over. They will be reported here, mainly as further examples of his method of refuting positions of natural philosophers, especially Aristotle, by reference to everyday obser- vation. Some of these questions also overlap with his list of dis- belief quoted above from the conclusion of his first redaction chapter "On 'body"'. One such disputed matter is the fundamental Aristotelian position that "whatever moves is moved by another, as if fire is not moved by itself but by some other thing". He car- ries it no further, mentioning that Macrobius put forth many argu- ments against Aristotle on this question in his Commentary on the Dream of Scipio [101.21-25].22 Another such question is that they say a bright body casts a shadow of an opaque body that is less sharp than itself. "An important part of astronomy rests on this as though a foundation. Although reason seems to wish this (and if something more secret hides in them, this disputation would re- quire a great many words), yet even boys can detect that this is false, boys who never see the shadow of birds flying under the sun thinned down to the measure of a black coin but see it emp- tied of the same measure and vanish" [101.25-102.4]. The next claim, this one rejected in the list of the first redac- tion, is that the sea is higher than the land. Valla does not seem to be aware that this phenomenon was commonly used to support the thesis that the earth is spherical. In fact another item in his list of unconceded doctrines is that the earth is spherical (nec ter- ram globosam concesserim) [422.8-9]. I quoted him earlier as say- ing: "For [unless it was generated for us] why would God wish for himself that rotation of the heavens and of the spheres (if any spheres are to be spoken of) around the land and the waters sus- pended in the middle?" [57.9-11: "circa terram et aquas in medio libratas"]. The passage is ambiguous but it seems to suggest a cen- tral terraqueous globe in the middle of the universe. However, it may well be that Valla adhered to the notion of a flat earth. At any rate his explanation of why the sea seems to be above the p. 118.

And therefore the same thing hap- pens in no matter what direction on the sea, nor on the sea only, but also in any flatness of the land" [102.4-15]. This problem was taken from Pliny's Natural History.23 Valla follows this up by cit- ing another item from the same source: Pliny's conclusion that the sea rises in a curve, just as tiny drops of water are always spheri- cal.24 Valla dismisses this because it is "as if a pool or a lake or any other body of water was not more similar to the sea than drops of water". Moreover, these are not what sets the waves in motion. "How is it that those who do not know this do know what is the cause of those miracles of the lightning and many other such?" [102.15-22]. With this he returns to his argument with Aristotle over the elements and spheres which we have presented above. Of the propositions of natural philosophy rejected at the end of his chapter on body in his first redaction,25 Valla continues to reject the following: (1) the spheres, assuming that he means the "orbs" by this; (2) the fiery element below the moon; (3) that the sea is higher than the land; (4) that air is changed into water and fire and fire in turn into air. The fifth (5), namely the five zones of the earth as in Pierre D'Ailly's Ymago mundi chapter 6,26 Val- la does not seem to refer to again, and it may be presumed he held to his rejection of it, if it meant the four imaginary lines separat- 23 Cf.

The sixth (6), that the earth is spherical, we have discussed above27 and conclude that he probably accepted it but that he is ambiguous about this. If it meant to him that there were no mountains, hollows or plains, he proba- bly did reject it as contrary to sense observation. Next Valla comes to the question of whether all things except for substances are "accidents".28 In the case of Aristotle, the eight remaining categories or predicaments are accidents. For Valla there are only two: "quality" and "action". "They say that accidents are what is present or absent without corruption of the subject". This is drawn from Boethius' commentary on Porphyry [PL 64, 132]. Valla protests: "What? heat can be absent from fire without cor- ruption of the fire?" [112.16-21]. The scholastic solution was to argue that "Heat in fire they say is a 'substantial form"'. Valla calls it "usialis", but he translates usia as "essence", not "substance" as Boethius and the scholastics do. "Thus now I prefer to use the customary rather than captious words and 'quality' rather than 'form', so that there is both a 'natural quality' and a 'non-natural"' [112.22-113.7]. This gives him the occasion to define "natural". "'Natural' is the quality which is unable to be absent from the essence, as vibration, light and warmth in the sun, levity in air, gravity in earth and water". Skipping over a passage inserted by him on the similarity of the qualities of man and God, he concludes: "the word 'quality' is more customary and suitable than 'form', just as 'essence' than 'matter"'; "non-natural" is such as the heat in an iron. There are, however, natural qualities that can change, such as the color of an apple, but always some color remains, and is natural. Perpetual qualities are general and have many variations or species. Both become objects of the senses [113.8-114.6]. In his first redaction Valla states: "There are two kinds of quali- ties: one that is known only by the judgment of the soul, another that is known by the senses which are, indeed, constituted from body but yet illuminated by the rays of the soul"29 [424.7-10]. 27 See above p. 287. 28 Late redactions: ZIPPEL, chap. 13, "De 'accidente', quodque novem predicamen- ta ad duo referentur, 'qualitatem' et 'actionem"', 112.14-115.26. The first redaction has no special chapter on this. 29 ZIPPEL, 17, "De 'qualitate', que sola anima dignoscitur" discusses non-physical 299</page><page sequence="22">CHARLES TRINKAUS He also devotes five chapters to the objects of the individual senses: one to vision, one to hearing, one to taste and smell, one to touch, and a fifth to experiences that are either senses of one's bodily state, as strength or languor, or of actions that are sensed such as sleep or coitus [425-436]. The later redactions cover the same ground in a single chapter that is two pages shorter than the earli- er five. [Cap. 14, De qualitatibus que sensibus cognoscuntur, 115-124]. Both versions make important statements missing in the other. And I shall quote from both of them. The objects of the senses, predictably, comprise the qualities and actions of bodies and provide him with the opportunity to set forth his ideas concerning their natures. In the first redaction Valla also looks at several of the Aristotelian categories he is con- solidating under qualities and actions, whereas in the two later ver- sions he, more or less, confines his single chapter to the objects of the senses as such, and gathers up this extraneous material in a long separate chapter called "The other predicaments are cut back either to 'substance' or to 'quality', or to 'action"' [Cap. 17, 134-156]. It is there that he discusses the nature of perception, a topic of intense and extensive scholastic concern. Valla's treat- ment, however, differs markedly from the scholastic. He will, in the first place, be talking about the physical sensations of seeing, hearing and the other senses. He deals in separate chapters in all his redactions with intellectual, social and professional qualities "dis- cerned by the soul alone" [ca 1439: Cap. 17, 424-425] or "per- ceived by the thoughts [sensa]" [ca 1448 and ca 1453: Cap. 15, 124-26], and his focus is strictly on the external qualities, actions and condition and not on how they are perceived, either by the senses or the mind. In the later versions, as he comes to the last of the to-be-rejected predicaments of Aristotle: to be acted upon [pati], he begins: "I do not see what else 'to be acted upon' may be than to feel pas- sion, as to suffer, to fear, to merit. .... For what do I suffer if I am loved, or I am feared, or I am heard, or also I am called, qualities such as social distinctions, occupations and professions, secular and sacred condi- tions. "All these qualities are known from actions as well as from the intrinsic and silent judgment of the mind" 424.32-3. Chapter runs 424.5-425.26. 300</page><page sequence="23">VALLA'S ANTI-ARISTOTELIAN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY except that I hear? But if I hear, it is now an action". "... And what they say, that a sense suffers from an object, seems to me to abuse the property of the word" [154.2-3, 12-14, 29-155.1]. This prompts him to argue that physical qualities are not pas- sively sensed but the senses act upon them. "Let it be then, that as color extends toward vision and sound toward hearing, the senses ought not to be said 'to suffer from objects' but 'to receive ob- jects'. For they suffer from them then when they are injured by them, just as when too much brightness affects the vision, or too much sound the hearing, or too much heat, or striking, or cutting the [sense of] touch. For they are received by the senses as an ap- ple falling from a tree is received by the hands, for unless they are caught by the hands, they have fallen into the hands in vain. Therefore the senses act while they perform their functions; they do not suffer except when they receive pain". If the senses then are active in receiving sensations, that leaves the quesion: "do ob- jects extend themselves toward their corresponding senses, or do the senses extend toward their objects? It pleases the Peripatetics that colors extend toward sight, sounds toward hearing" [155.1-14]. At this point he is referring to the controversy, recently ana- lyzed by Katherine Tachau,30 of late medieval scholastics over whether objects send out "sensible species" or images that strike the senses, paradigmatically that of vision, with William Ockham denying what Pierre Aureole reaffirmed: that such species exist. In fact Aureole argued that it was necessary for them to exist in order that the mind should be restrained from inventing illusory qualities in its own affirmative effort to perceive. However, Valla, though undoubtedly referring to this controversy, has his own con- cern, that is, not to insure accurate perception and judgment, but to emphasize the will-directed actions of humans (and of the other animals as well). He reports that Macrobius along with many philosophers, including Lactantius,31 believed that: "the power it- self of discerning extended toward the object. Nor, it seems, with- 30 K. H.

Otherwise a person with sharp vision would not see better from a distance than someone with poor eyesight when there was little difference in discerning between the two when close up, although sometimes the second person might see better than the first close up and the first better at a distance". An interesting reference to far-sightedness and near-sightedness, even though it may not support Valla's argument. "Nor", he adds, "would colors and shapes be carried to the vision by the help of brightness, but come to the eye as though to a mirror. For thereby those images are perceived in the eye which the eye itself does not see in itself but sees what it discerns not in the air... but in its own place, better or worse according to its own powers of projecting its glance, and not without the help of the brightness. Something similar", he adds, "can be said about sound" [155.15-156.10]. In the above passage Valla is arguing both that visual objects, colors and shapes are not transmitted to the eye by means of a medium, as Aristotle and some scholastics argued, or by sensible species, but are directly reflected in the eye and then perceived as out where they come from, and that the sense power of vision plays an active role in this process of perception. Where he deals with "the object 'of sight"' in the first redaction, he says visible things as a genus have two species: color and form. Color itself has infinite sub-species. These may be graduated means between white and black which are the extremes of clarity and obscurity. But the colors are not diversified according to their brightness or darkness as any given color may be light or dark. There are also many species of forms or shape. But the Peripatetics wish to put length, breadth and depth under the predicament of "quantity" which Valla regards as subject to "quality" [425. 15-29]. An interest- ing and extended discussion ensues to which I will return below. In the later redactions he says, "The object of sight is 'color' and corresponding to shape Lfigura], quantity, motion, rest. Of these 'figure' is the quality, I will speak of the others later" [118.17-19]. But he gets into a discussion of whether brightness is a color or another quality. Aristotle calls it "white" not "brightness", so how could it be substance? And he calls the sun and fire a glowing red. But where does "splendor" gain its brightness except from the sun and fire? Brightness and radiance illuminate all colors and render them stronger. Air has no color, but Aristotle calls it white [i.e., 302</page><page sequence="25">VALLA'S ANTI-ARISTOTELIAN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY pseudo-Aristotle De coloribus, 1].32 "I have found no one besides Aristotle who has seen air, for unless he had seen it, he never would have said it was white" [119.10-12]. The object of hearing, Valla tells us in his first redaction, is called "sound" or "voice" according to Priscian. But other gram- marians distinguish "voice" as animal and "sound" as more gener- al. Seneca and the Stoics say sound is struck or percussed air; Plato and Aristotle call it the percussion or motion of air; some call it wind; he approves of none of these statements [430.27-431.7]. Valla rather follows Quintilian who said "If anyone should say that sound is the collision of two bodies', he would err, as I believe, for 'sound is not the collision but 'from collision' ." Therefore for Valla it is a quality, one arising from air, earth and water, sometimes from fire when globes of fire soar on high. But this is in all likelihood coming from the matter consumed with it. "I believe, just as bright- ness projects from light and is in light, so voice projects from a hard body into the air, and that in that hard body is either earth or water. It does not remain there because the action, itself, from which sound [vox] is made does not persist as the action does in the case of light" [122.14-18]. Although Valla does not wish to dispute at this point whether the sense of hearing is more excellent than that of sight, it is obvi- ous that as a rhetorician he has great interest in "voice" [vox] as spoken language and is greatly concerned with the qualitative aspects of it. In the first redaction he says: In sound we consider "smoothness", "harshness", "magnitude", "thin- ness", "sharpness" or "intensity", "solemnity" or "relaxedness", "soft- ness" "hardness" and a thousand qualities of this sort. For I do not deny that "length of syllables" and "brevity" is an aspect of quantity, but I would not think, on the other hand, that anyone is so barbarous that they would deny these qualities exist when it is the same for a sylla- ble to be long as it is to be "slow", the same to be "short" as to be "rapid". Hence that marvelous effect of harmony in stringed instruments, 32 Cf. ARISTOTLE, Meteor., III, 4, 374a, 3, "... air which is nearer and lighter in nature". Ps.-Aristotle, De colonibus, 1, 791a, 2, "Air and water in themselves are by natu- re white". 33 QUINTILIAN, Inst. orat., III, 6.6. Valla makes this citation in both his first and later redactions: 431.15-18; 120.22-121.2. 303</page><page sequence="26">CHARLES TRINKAUS so that the one string sounding, another in the same lyre is moved by itself in response to the first one: but not unless this [chord] is either a unison or a fifth. For from the octave the septenary number of voices begins anew, and the octave and the fifteenth is the same as the unison, and the twelfth and the nineteenth are the same as the fifth. And these indeed happen from nature [432.27-433.12]. Valla wants to emphasize that the harmonic relationship of musi- cal intervals not only provides the basis of the theory of musical composition but also corresponds to physical phenomena. It illus- trates his conception of the relationship of language and thought to the actuality of things, just as will be set forth in the ensuing section of this paper.34 Valla displays a certain familiarity with the acoustics and the- ory of music but does not carry his discussion of the nature of sound further here. He also, interestingly, does not repeat or re- vise this passage in his subsequent versions. Rather he continues in the first redaction by introducing a consideration which is elabo- rated in the subsequent versions and has attracted the attention of certain recent scholars. I shall quote both versions even though they do not deal anymore with the physical or natural aspects of sound and hearing, because they set forth the theoretical basis of his whole conception of the role of language in human culture as the foundation of social existence and provide his intellectual frame- work for the perception and understanding of the interrelationship of nature and meaning. But the meaning comes from the establishment of art, and this [i.e., the meaning] is a quality which is not perceived by the ears just as shown above]. [He is referring to "the kind of quality known only by the judg- ment of the mind", 424.7-8 above]. Therefore "noun" and "verb" and the other parts of speech are "signifying voices" [i.e., "words"], from which speech itself is composed. It is not sufficient to say "signifying voice" unless we add "from the establishment of an artist [artificis]": for a voice wailing, laughing, hawking, coughing is indeed signifying but not 7 Salvatore Camporeale has commented on the extent of Valla's familiarity with ancient and medieval musical theory and practice in his Lorenzo Valla tra medioevo e rina- scimento: "Encomium s.

But although voices are offered naturally and their meanings are from the conventions of men, nevertheless they also devised the same words by their own decision, imposing names on the things they have disco- vered, that is "a voice with meaning" (a voice perceptible to the ears, a meaning to the mind). Finally [they devised] a letter which is read by the eyes and the mind (unless we would wish to refer this to God, who divided the languages of men at the tower of Babel, although Adam also adapted names to things), and afterwards from time to time they constructed other words. For this reason, noun, verb and the other parts of speech are only sounds by themselves, but they have multiple mean- ing from the convention of men, just as in painted colors we see that they shadow forth nothing in themselves, and yet from the artist they may represent any particular person and whatever we would wish [433.13-434.5]. A clear enunciation of the ancient distinction between "nature" and "convention", this statement is notable also for emphasizing that nature was there prior to the human invention of culture by language, with man discovering the things and then naming them. It also suggests that humans, by distinguishing qualities and agree- ing upon them, established their existence. These qualities were of no significance for the other unnoticed things of nature, and in that sense they were non-existing before they were "discovered" and drawn into human cultures. It certainly indicates how the things of the world existed by themselves and without conscious purpose, not for some higher purpose, as Aristotle, the Stoics, and certainly the scholastic realists had it, but were available for humanly deter- mined purposes. And this is in harmony with Valla's views expressed many times that things have value not in themselves or for some pre-existing design to serve God or man, but were created by God acting as an efficient cause of the pleasure and well-being mankind derived from them. If there is an ancient source for this reasoning, it is not in the schools of philosophy, which Valla specifically re- jects (Plato, Aristotle, Democritus/Lucretius, Seneca/Stoicism), but in the rhetorical tradition identified with Quintilian by Valla but traceable back to the Greek Sophists: Gorgias, and especially Pro- tagoras, whose "Man is the measure" is an amazingly close fit. Pro- 305 20</page><page sequence="28">CHARLES TRINKAUS tagoras' view of reality (as put forth for him by Socrates in Plato's Theatetus) held it to be composed of things that are not permanent but constantly changing and different for each individual. And this finds at least some expression in Valla's insistence that meanings are fluid and also constantly changing. But let us see how he restated the relation of language and nature in his later redactions: The human "voice" is indeed natural, but its meaning is from con- vention: this meaning also is its quality. But also this "voice", although it originates from nature, nevertheless descends from convention. For men invent words [voces] which they adapt to things that are known, and for this reason words are called "signs". The first man to do this was Adam at the command of God. And they taught posterity these words with their meanings. Just as the sounds are indeed from nature, the words, however, or signs and meanings are from art. And thus, just as Plato wished, the voice will be the special property of man." Otherwise the brutes would not have been called "mute" when they let forth their voice, but because [their voice] was not articulated and made by artifice. From this it happens that, as the ears perceive sounds and the mind perceives meaning, so together they perceive voices. At last letters are invented, signs of their signs, as if silent voices or images (as the voices themselves are as though images of meanings), which now are properly called "words" [vocabulv]. And this is whatever we speak: even "substance" itself, "qual- ity", "action" and also even "thing" [res] itself. For just as the name for wood is "wood", and for stone "stone", and for iron "iron", so like- wise as the name for knowledge [scientia] of incorporeal things is "science", so for virtue "virtue", for genus "genus", for species "species", so for substance "substance", so for quality "quality", so for action "action", and finally so for thing "thing" [122.30-123.22]. It is important to note that Valla here states that men invent and adapt words to things that are known. In the first redaction he calls it "to things that are discovered"; repertis rebus and rebus cognitis. Hanna-Barbara Gerl in her Rhetorik als Philosophie: Lorenzo Valla 36 is quoted by Richard Waswo in his Language and Meaning in the Renaissance37 as saying, that Valla "can no longer maintain 35 Cf.

Waswo thinks Valla is ambiguous, perhaps deliberately so.9 I believe that on the ba- sis of what I have just pointed out Valla maintained the separa- tion. It all hinges on what he adds to the above quotation: Therefore "thing" signifies thing; this is signified, that is the sign or mark of this; that is not a voice, this is a voice and therefore is de- fined: "thing is a voice or term embracing the meaning of all terms in its own" [123.23-26]. Notice the internal contradiction concerning "this" and "that". The text seems to be correct. The key manuscript of the third redac- tion, Bibl. Vatic. Ottob. 2075, has the same reading as Zippel's text which I am using. The Basel 1540 Opera omnia also has it. Zippel notes no variant. Whether it was intentional or a mistake on the part of Valla, we cannot know.40 But the passage con- tinues, making his position clear: You may say: "Therefore the term is above the thing because 'thing' in also a term". But the meaning of "thing" is above the meaning of 38 GERL, op. cit (see note 36), p. 221, "Hier st6st Valla an die Grenze der sprachli- chen Darstellunskraft, denn hier ist die Stelle, wo er die Trennung von Nicht-Wort und Wort und auch von Sache und Nicht-Sache sprachlich und damit auch logisch nicht mehr aufrechterhalten kann. Denn Zeichen und zu Bezeichendes sind beidemale res, d. h. Wort und Nicht-Wort sind gleicherweise res; und andererseits, um iiberhaupt das Nicht-Wort (res) in das Bewusstsein heben zu k6nnen, muss man sich des Wortes bedienen, der vox res". 39 WASWO, Op. cit. (see note 37), p. 108: "If Valla assumed the epistemological iden- tity of words and things in his specific statement of their linguistic identity and therefore collapsed all distinctions between 'sign' and 'signified' in a deliberate contradiction desi- gned to reveal the absurdity of such a distinction, why, in the remainder of the passage does he continue to employ it?". Waswo wistfully concedes that Valla could not transcend his own time and project a philosophy of language such as Waswo wants to establish to- day. But in this he fails to perceive how truly radical Valla was in quite another way than he would like to impose upon him. My version of this follows. 40 Brian Copenhaver believes that the passage may be interpreted in such a way that it is not contradictory. I will give the latin first: Itaque "res" significat rem; hoc significatur, illud huius est signum vel nota; illud non vox, hoc vox est ideoque definitur: "res est vox sive vocabulum, omnium vocabulorum significationes sua com- plectens". 307</page><page sequence="30">CHARLES TRINKAUS the "term", that is of the "sign": and therefore term or sign is a thing and one thing only. But that word signifies all things, just as this word "God" is below many others. For "spirit" transcends it, "substance" tran- scends it, "essence" transcends it, "something" and "thing" transcend it; however, by the dignity of meaning He transcends all other [things], since He, Himself, is the creator of all things. For this reason there is no difference whether we would say "what is wood?", "what is stone?", "what iron?", "what man?", or "what does wood, iron, stone, man mean?" Neither of these can be said of "thing": "what is thing?" and "what does thing mean?", because "what" is resolved into "what thing". Thus whoever would say "what of the thing" would speak stupidly. But if I would have asked "what word is thing?", rightly you would reply "it is a word signifying the understanding or sense of all other words; but one which now means almost the same as 'what kind"'. Finally "mean- ing" is a word which comes under "predicament" because "predicament" is a word universally signifying. The thing signified does not come under a predicament, as the meaning of the word "man" is under a predica- ment. But man, himself, who signifies,41 is under a roof or under the heavens, not under a predicament. Nor is it different when you say "man is an animal" than that "man" by this appellation is understood to be an "animal" or the meaning of animal is understood [123.26-124.25]. Since it is "man who signifies" and man who lives under a roof and the sky is not a term or a category or under one, it is clear that Valla fully distinguishes between words or terms and actuali- (Note that Zippel prints suas, not sua, in the last line, a typo, as his reference back to it in his notes shows). Copenhaver suggests that the second illud corresponds to the hoc significatur which has become huius est signum, and the second hoc (vox) corresponds to the illud by position in the phrase: illud huius est signum. Clear? Copenhaver says, "So I take the passage not to be corrupt textually or a mistake on Valla's part but rather bad writing - bad in the sense of cute, at worst ambiguous and at best distractingly complicated. The transla- tion leaves the second hoc/illud pair ambiguous because the Latin is ambiguous". I offer this with thanks to Brian for his clarification in a letter of June 19, 1991. Here is his revised translation: 'res' signifies res; the latter is signified, the former is a sign of the latter; the one is not a word, the other is a word; hence the definition: res is a word or term embracing in its meaning the things meant by all terms. I also agree with J. MONFASANI'S interpretations of this passage in his "Was Lorenzo Valla an Ordinary Language Philosopher?", Journal of the History of Ideas, 50, 1989, pp. 309-323, especially, pp. 317-318. 41 Cod. Ottob. Lat. 2075: significat, not Zippel, significatur, a serious error! 308</page><page sequence="31">VALLA'S ANTI-ARISTOTELIAN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY ty, not to use the term "reality" which is derived from "res" or "thing". A similar point is made by William Ockham in his com- mentary on the categories of Aristotle: 42 that the terms or predicaments or categories, like universals, are concepts that have no existence outside the mind or voice, but that things do indeed exist. The passage also affirms that "God" as an appellative can be classified and placed under such predicaments as "spirit", "sub- stance", "essence" but transcends all of them by the mere fact that He is God and the Creator of the men who make up the categories, just as man is the creator or inventor not only of language but of philosophies, theologies and philologies. A little further on in the place where he argues against the separate Aristotelian category of "pati" or being acted upon [154.1-155.16], Valla again shows that man can be a captive of his own systems of classification, in this case of grammar: "For because certain verbs are called 'pas- sive' as 'I am loved', 'I am feared', 'I am called', 'I am heard', this is no argument, for the grammarians name these thus no more properly than what they call the 'accusative', 'ablative', 'dative' case, as if this is ever used for 'accusation', for 'ablation', or for 'dation', and the 'imperative' mode as if it 'commanded [imperet]' or the 'optative' mode as if it always would 'choose [optet]' and the 'subjunctive' as if did nothing but 'subjoin', and 'gerunds', as if they 'carry on' [gerant], and 'supine' as if they are lying 'supine [resupina]"' [154.3-12]. He also re-enacts in this vision his emphasis on man as acting in the image and likeness of God, in this case creating, as Cusanus also argued, not real things, as God does, but the meanings of real things in man's languages and language systems, philosophies and classifications.43 Moreover, since he says the word res can almost 42 Expositio in librum praedicamentorum Aristotelis, Opera philosophica II, St. Bona- venture, 1978, p. 167: "Sed secundae substantiae nullo modo possunt accipi pro rebus quae in veritate rei sint substantiae, sed tantum pro nominibus rerum, et hoc accipiendo 'nomen' - sive sit vox sive intentio in anima sive conceptus sive quodcumque aliud si- gnum - plures significans univoce substantias, quia nulla substantia secunda, qualiter- cumque accipiatur, est in rei veritate substantia, sed tantum est signum substantiae et potens supponere sive stare pro substantia". 43 See P.

WATTS, Nicolaus Cusanus, A Fifteenth-Century Vision of Man, Leiden, 1982, p. 180 and note 51. 309</page><page sequence="32">CHARLES TRINKAUS be the same as quality, he is making this into a super "it" or "what" which embraces the meanings of all words in its own, or into the "substance" of "substances" into a "quality", or even into the "qual- ity" of "qualities". In effect, what he is saying is that we know things through their qualities [by means of our senses and our thought processes], so that these meanings which humankind im- poses by its invention of language and its namings are the mean- ings that humankind finds through its experiencing by its senses and by the judgment of its mind concerning the things that God created. The world is there as the "object" of man's senses and mind, but man is the "subject" who learns these things through his experience of and thought about their qualities and invents the words to express their meanings to him. Moreover, this is a collec- tive action of man, since language is the means by which mankind can act together in learning, giving meaning, establishing languages and propagating them through the works of culture and by educa- tion. Language embodies the entirety of mankind's relationships to each other, to the world and to God the Creator. Returning now to these objects of the senses, and passing over his comments on the objects of smell, taste and touch, Valla's treat- ment of the problem of quantity and dimension under objects of sight in his first redaction are noteworthy. According to Aristotle, quantity is a predicament which has two kinds: continuous and discrete." Valla claims that a discrete quantity means number, and that both are sub-species of quality. We do not measure num- ber by quantity but quantity by number. Moreover, the qualities of a figure are more than Aristotle's length, breadth and height. There is rotundity, quadrity, angularity and other similar qualities. Specially interesting is the question of whether, as Aristotle and Boethius after him said,45 a line has longitude without latitude. Valla criticizes this pronouncement as implying that a line does 44 ARISTOTLE, Categ., 6, 4b, 20; Metaph. V, 13, 1020a, 6-14. Valla considers "quan- tity" under "the object of sight" in his first redaction to be part of "form" or "figure", 425.24-430.21. He deals with "quantity" in his later redactions as one of the Aristotelian predicaments that he rejects in his lengthy chapter: "The other predicaments are cut back either to 'Substance' or to 'Quality' or to 'Action"', 134.14-156.22. 45 Cf. Aristotle, Metaph., V, 13, 1020a, 16; Boethius, In Categ. Anist.

Moreover, if we speak of a line in order to measure, it could also have width, height, depth, or it could be used in round, sinuous and other forms. But it is also contradictory to speak of a line as having no width be- cause it is also said that by multiplying lines, latitude or a surface is attained. All of this, however, turns out to be sparring, for Valla is really concerned to show that lines are theoretical or practical aids for assaying or measuring a body. "As to what I believe, the 'line' is the space itself of a place but, for the sake of understanding, by means of a line drawn in black, or imagined in the mind, or in the corporeal thing itself as sketched out by pen or pencil, by which we might more easily measure the thing we are concerned with. Nor is there any color or width in it but only space by means of which we may examine what is extended from the place where it begins to the place where it ends, although it is not so much a space as a figure surrounding and indicating the space. The ex- planation for this is in this kind of point which is so called from the point formed by the impression of th, pen or pencil, as it is the common practice for a line to be formed by the trace of the pen and pencil.... Thus the 'point' of space will be as small as the point formed by the pencil, especially because those who meas- ure something by means of a line need the formation of the point, yet in such a way that it occupies no space and marks out more space than there is. Sometimes, as in the middle of some circle, nothing of space is marked out but the middle itself of the circle is indicated there". He also objects to calling a point an "indivisi- ble body" if there is not quantity in it. "Or if there is quantity, why can it not be divided if it can be seen and thought, when certain insects which can hardly be seen have a thousand parts in themselves" [429.9-32]. Measurement or diagramming, therefore, is a kind of language by which mankind may discover meanings or understanding of the spatial qualities of things. It, like Aristo- tle's category of quantity, is a human device bringing things into human knowledge, pleasure and use. This effort to distinguish between actual dimension and imagi- nary use of lines and diagram to aid in measurement, as well as to dispel the confusion over whether an actual point or line has any dimension, is further evidence of Valla's separation of things 311</page><page sequence="34">CHARLES TRINKAUS and signs. He makes his position clear in the later redactions where he treats the question of whether "quantity" is a predicament: "They say that from these two [length and breadth] a surface is constitut- ed and if you add depth it constitutes a body, for no body is con- stituted except by three dimensions. And on account of this they subject body to quantity, which seems to me by far the most fool- ish. For no body is a quantity or is constituted from dimensions, because it is one thing to have quantity in oneself or to have dimen- sions, it is another to be a quantity or to consist of quantities. Just as no body is constituted from the qualities that it has, be- cause without essence it is unable to exist, for that reason it should be said that body is constituted from essence and with certain other qualities, and indeed with length: straight, oblique and deep". He also argues that a two dimensional surface is a body because whoever touches a surface touches a body. Moreover a sphere, which also has length, width and depth within a curved surface, may be said to be contained within a single surface, and so the definition of a surface is incorrect [142.17-143.3]. While the question of whether "quantity" should be considered a distinct predicament, or that dimensions, lines and points can exist in separation from substance and quality may seem an unim- portant and even trivial part of natural philosophy it is interesting to note that William Ockham discussed the same question in his Summa logicae [I.44, 45], arguing that Aristotle's position was not what it would seem from the Categories, where Ockham held that he followed popular discourse rather than stating his own position. Instead it was Ockham's belief on this question of quantity we have just seen argued by Valla as contrary to Aristotle that, "it was the intention of Aristotle and of many others that quantity is not something distinct from substance and quality, nor that point, line, surface and body are things that are totally distinct from each other according to themselves".46 Although attributed to Aristotle, it is certainly Ockham's position, and, as we have just seen, also Valla's. Although Valla included Ockham among the medieval 46 Summa logicae, Opera philosophica I, ed. Ph. BOEHNER-G. GAL-S. BROWN, St. Bo- naventure, 1974, pp. 144: "Dico igitur quod intentio Aristotelis et multorum aliorum fuit quod omnis quantitas non est aliqua res distincta a substantia et qualitate, nec punctus, linea, superficies et corpus sunt res inter se secundum se totas distinctas". 312</page><page sequence="35">VALLA'S ANTI-ARISTOTELIAN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY authors of dialectic to be despised in his letter [13] to Giovanni Serra,47 it is difficult to know how well he knew them. Gianni Zippel, the editor of Valla's Dialecticae, believes that Valla would have had access to the writings of Ockham when he was at the University of Pavia and that he in fact adopted a number of Ock- ham's positions, which Zippel duly annotates.48 These are no more than surmises. Zippel also annotates references to several works of Paul of Venice whom Valla could have known at Pavia. But Zippel quotes Paul as exemplifying the positions that Valla was objecting to as he found them in Aristotle.49 There seems to be some legitimacy in Valla's criticism of Aristotle for failing to distinguish gross quantity and number, making them into continuous and discrete quantity. It is also true that modern notions of quantification decidedly mean the subjection of bodies and their qualities to numeration. The fact that Valla is aware that devices for numeration were being sought suggests that he was not totally uninsightful in this matter. Clearly, his concern was with the qualities of things, as humans were affected by them and sought to attain, ward off, enjoy and manipulate them. Nevertheless, his criticism of the Aristotelians for failing to recognize or clearly dis- tinguish between the instruments of knowledge and the things that were being examined themselves may well have been preparatory of a more systematically effective mode of dealing with nature.50 47 Cf.

Contra privationem utpote principium rerum naturalium scripserat Ock- ham, antequam Valla: cfr. eiusd. Summukle in libros Physicorum Anistotelis, I 11 et 14". 50 There are certain parallels to Valla's recognition that points, lines and surfaces are theoretical signs for designating and describing spatial objects in contemporary Re- naissance treatises on perspective written by artists or architects. LEON BATTISTA ALBER- TI's opening paragraphs (1-4) of De pictura (1436) and his Elementa (volgare version 1430s, Latin early 1450s) deal with the same "elements" also as signs, but for the practical gui- ddnce of the painter rather than for metaphysical or philological theorizing as in Valla. Valla is unlikely to have known the volgare version which had limited diffusion. Moreover his basic treatment occurs in his first (1439) redaction which renders knowledge of the volgare version more unlikely. Nevertheless, it is important to note that such contempora- ry speculations were also occurring. Cf. L. B. ALBERTI, On Painting and On Sculpture, 313</page><page sequence="36">CHARLES TRINKAUS Another of the Aristotelian categories that Valla would eliminate is that of "Ubi" - "Where" or "Place". Edward Grant, in his Much Ado About Nothing: Theories of Space and Vacuum from the Middle Ages to the Scientific Revolution,5" deals comprehensively with this and the related concepts, and, as will be seen, Valla fits directly into this problematic. Closely related to this question, and indeed a part of it, was the concept of "privation", which Valla also rejected. And a look at that should come first. He says, in his earlier chapter "On 'accident' and that the nine predicaments should be referred to two: 'quality' and 'action"': "Where nothing is substituted [for something that has been removed] they [isti, the Peripatetics] have the practice of calling it 'privation': which, if it is nothing, what is gained by constituting a third [thing] along with form and matter, as if it actually is something? For they want it to be as if nothing, and yet as if something". He compares it to the absence of vision in a blinded person or to the condition of infants not yet born or the cubs of a beast just born "just as a man who is now dead or is still in the uterus of the mother does not yet have a soul [an interesting notion] ... in the eye not yet perfected there is a power, not indeed of seeing, but of reaching toward vision ... Privation is almost nothing else than negative state- ment. What else is a blind person than 'not endowed with sight'? deaf, than 'not having hearing'? dry soil than 'not having moisture'? empty and closed place than 'not containing anything nor open'? For if privation for the most part is nothing else than the force of denying, just as negation constitutes nothing, so [privation] is not able to be constituted. Therefore, if constituted, it will be a quality, just as I will show now of the senses and of darkness which either signifies nothing else than 'not light', or the quality of the place as 'obscurity' as 'shadow' as 'opacity'. The following from Genesis proves this: 'And darkness was over the face of the abyss"' [114.7-115. 12] .52 the Latin Texts of De Pictura and De Statua, edited with translations, introduction and notes by C.

He starts by quoting Aristotle: "certainly Aristotle, when he said, 'Just as in the forum or in the Lyceum'," which is the gymnasium of Athens, sufficiently indicated that 'ubi' is the same as 'in a cor- poreal place"'. Grant points out that on the basis of Averroes' explanation that Aristotle's positions in the Categories were sup- ported by popular sayings and his real philosophy was to be found elsewhere, Jean Buridan made a distinction between the popular and the philosophical view of "place"."5 Valla, as we shall see, fits precisely into this distinction which he, himself, explicates. He con- tinues: "But they [the scholastic Peripatetics] deny that place is a body because it is a surface. 0 the ineptitude of men! If it is thus, then there is no wine in the wooden container, nor water in the cistern, no oil in the clay pot, nor bread in the basket, nor are these which I have called jar, water pot, bucket, food basket bodies. Who ever said the 'place of the vessel is full' and the ves- sel itself is not empty [vacuum] when we are accustomed to call that emptiness of the vessel and space 'place'?" [147.25-148.3]. It was a practice of scholastics to call the surface of an empty ves- sel "place" based on such statements of Aristotle as the following [Physics IV.4, 211a 30f]: When what surrounds, then, is not separate from the thing, but is in continuity with it, the thing is said to be in what surrounds it, not in the sense of in place, but as a part of a whole. But when the thing is separate and in contact, it is primarily in the inner surface of the sur- rounding body, and this surface is neither a part of what is in it nor yet greater than its extension, but equal to it, for the extremities of things which touch are coincident. Valla continues, mocking the Peripatetic view and affirming the more popular, as follows: As "there is no place in the jar" or "in the bedroom" or "on the bench"; and "nothing of place is empty", "much place is empty in this 53 ARISTOTLE, Categ. 4, 2a, 1-2. 54 See GRANT'S first paragraph and note 5 of chapter 2 (op. cit. [see note 26]: "Me- dieval conceptions of the nature and properties of void space", pp. 9 and 267. 315</page><page sequence="38">CHARLES TRINKAUS house", that is "there is no empty space". But what am I saying, who said "the emptiness of the vessel" and "the space is empty", when they deny that a vacuum exists in nature? What shall I do? what formula of speaking shall I follow? what road shall I take: the trite and popular one or this of the philosophisers? It would be arrogant not to take the customary one, wicked to stray from the right one. But let us see whether the people or the philosopher speaks better. The people says it calls "a jar empty" when it lacks liquid, "a pool empty" when it is empty of water or of fishes, "the barn empty" when it lacks grain or legumes, "the forum empty" when people are absent from it, also "the furnace empty" when the fire has been removed from it or extinguished, or when the bricks or the breads are gone. The philosopher wishes these not to be able to be empty because they are full of air, which departing, another body will enter, and this leaving, that will succeed: thus they are never empty. The people reply, the choice and norm of speaking is in their power, nor do they call such things full when there is nothing in them besides air, except when the air itself is of some moment, as a full sail of a boat and a ball or sack for sport or a winesack when the grape harvest is approaching are said to be "full of wind". For if you call the mixing bowl without fluid "full" because air has slid into it, what need is there, as though in a marvelous thing that is unknown to the people, to glory, saying "nothing of vacuum is given in nature": when boys know this, especially those who are accustomed to fill that ball or vessel with breath? And yet, if there is no vacuum in nature, certainly there will not be something full, just as nothing hard unless there would be soft, nor light unless heavy, nor bitter unless sweet and so in the others. For this itself what they say: "there is no vacuum given in nature", is just as if they would say: "there is no air given in nature" because there is noth- ing. Therefore the people speak better than the philosopher, since with them the greatest authors agree [148.3-149.6]. Valla has made his characteristic position clear: listen to the people, not Aristotle. There could be no more apt illustration of Valla's opposing of simple experience, expressed as he would have it with popular language, with the confirmation of the greatest authors (Ver- gil, Quintilian and Cicero), to the conception of a true state of nature as it lay concealed from ordinary thought yet revealed in incomprehensible and contradictory language by Aristotle and the scholastics. 316</page><page sequence="39">VALLA'S ANTI-ARISTOTELIAN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY Motion also was important to Valla both as a word and an ac- tuality. In his first redaction [436.24-437.4] he defines it as com- ing under action, obviously his third category, but containing its own qualities such as rapidity, violence, brevity, persistence, slow- ness, length, alternity, intervals. Motion is also directional: "they make a seven-fold species of it: 'up', 'down', 'to the right', 'to the left', 'forward', 'backward' and 'in a circle'. Nor should we listen to Aristotle who makes motion into six species: 'generation', 'corruption', 'enlargement', 'diminution', 'alteration', 'change of place': for the motion is only of substance which remains the same, change of place is true of all things" [436.30-437.4]. The other changes all occur in qualities such as color, taste or odor, and their change should be called "mutation" not "motion". Although there sometimes is movement of qualities such as light, these should be called "motion" only when they move from place to place but not when they do not "transit". When sweet wine is changed into sour, he would not call that "motion of taste" but "mutation". But it can rightly be said that shadow and light and if there are any simi- lar things are moved. "Thus I do not concede that we can say 'heat' or 'cold' is 'moved', but changed, unless in some body such as the human when it moved from member to member as hot and cold fever, or as gout or other diseases usually do, but cannot be said of the heat of summer or the cold of winter. While one of these is dying the other one simultaneously is being born... Because they are beginning or coming to an end, these qualities do not change place, nor are they said 'to make a movement', but 'a change is made regarding them"' [436.30-437.23]. But now what else is "generation" than either "alteration" or "increase"? Or what else is "corruption" than either "alteration" or "diminution"? He says, "I am speaking in an Aristotelian man- ner, because he does not wish the world to be generated, never will it become corrupted. If the contrary were to obtain, genera- tion and corruption would be different than increase, diminution and alteration, because the world would have been made out of nothing [ex nihilo] and recedes into nothing, but yet there would be neither motion, nor change. Add to this that 'increase' and 'dimi- nution' is nothing except change of place, for what increases or decreases in anything, that with little doubt is changed in place" [437.26-438.1]. Valla in this terse and cryptic passage is, to be sure, 317</page><page sequence="40">CHARLES TRINKAUS opposing the Christian notion that God created the world out of nothing to the Aristotelian notion of the eternity of the universe. For Aristotle the doctrine of the eternity of the world required him to seek an explanation for change within this universe but not of the cosmos itself, namely generation and corruption, altera- tion, augmentation and diminution, which together with movement in space he called motion. Valla, in his creationist view, rejects Aristotle's (and any other's) ontological view of change within a fixity of pattern or process for an historical or "natural-historical" view of simple happenings or events readily conceivable and name- able by ordinary observation and speech. As a consequence he can conclude about "motion" that, "Out of these six species [of mo- tion according to Aristotle] two remain: 'alteration' and 'change of place'. The prior of these is 'mutation', not 'motion' (for no movement from place to place is made, as I have said of wine) but if it does happen, it is motion; the posterior alone is motion"' [438.1-4]. In the later redactions he deals with motion very briefly, put- ting it in a chapter dedicated to his third major category: action: "On 'action' and 'motion' and 'substantive verbs"' (except that he even drops "and 'motion"' from this title in his second redac- tion). He has little to say and nothing new in these versions. The term is used by Aristotle in association with "generation", "cor- ruption", "diminution", "augmentation", "alteration", and "change of place". "However, speaking properly, motion is change of place: for if something is changed in smell or taste, we do not say a 'mo- tion' occurs but a 'change', which is properly called 'alteration'. It happens from this that there are not as many species of move- ment as Aristotle made" [132.18-26]. The discussion of action in this same chapter is a very impor- tant one for Valla, for "action" is the third of his triad of "sub- stance", "quality" and "action" replacing Aristotle's ten predicaments. For Aristotle "act" is also distinguished from "sub- stance" as an "accident" which can happen; it is also distinguished from "substantial form" as an "accidental form". Hence Valla be- gins his chapter by saying, "There remains 'action' which I don't know whether I would suitably call it an 'accident' since it does not 'happen' ['accidat'] but flows forth from spirit, from body, out of the animal, out of quality. For instance writing, which is an 318</page><page sequence="41">VALLA'S ANTI-ARISTOTELIAN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY action of my fingers, does not happen to my fingers, but comes into existence from fingers. Though Aristotle may have seen the reason of his term: there is no necessity that we use it" [127.2-7]. Valla will work his way toward the true point of this chapter: the unsuitability of the scholastics' usage of "potency" and "act" as key terms of their natural philosophy. "Action" and "act" mean the same thing, as do any other words with different endings of the same stem. It is a word or meaning that is employed in many contexts, as for the right of acting in judicial cases. "But now we are not speaking of this sense but of that more general one which is 'work' or 'working' [opera or operatio] ... 'Actus' is indeed a general word, either for the words or the thing which is done, as in stipu- lation or novation. It does not matter whether you translate Aristo- tle's word 'energeian' by 'act' or 'action' or 'work' or 'operation', which also means efficacy. They [isti, i.e. the scholastics] always translate it as 'act' as though it is not possible otherwise. They translate 'entelecheian' in Aristotle by the same word; Plutarch be- lieves this should be understood for 'energeia' as if this word is for 'having perfectly', that for 'operating'. There is, as though a companion to this, 'dunamis', which Quintilian translates as 'force' [vis], saying it is translated by some as 'power' [potestas], by others as 'potency' [potentia] as the recent [i.e. the scholastics] do. Two of these three [Greek] terms are ancient and therefore can be trans- lated as 'actus' and 'potentia'. The third was concocted [Victus] by Aristotle and therefore cannot be translated literally" [127.25-128.16]. He is speaking of entelechia, which Aristotle described in his Metaphysics [IX, 8, 1050a] as follows: "... everything that comes to be is moved toward a principle, i.e. an end. For that for the sake of which a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality [entelechia] is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired ... For the action is the end, and the actuality is the action. Therefore even the word 'actuality' is derived from 'action', and points to the fulfillment". It is the teleological aspect of this conception that Valla will find objectionable, especially when it is applied to inani- mate objects. For he continues, "There is a certain ignorant knowledge of all these things in Aristotle, as I say it openly. For he says, 'This piece of wood or this tree trunk is an arch, not in 319</page><page sequence="42">CHARLES TRINKAUS act but in potency. Are you saying, Aristotle, that as from this piece of wood an arch is made we may say this wood is an arch in 'act'? Who ever spoke that way? Who would not laugh at some- one speaking thus? for whose is that act, the wood's? But wood does nothing. Or the carpenter's. But the carpenter 'makes' the arch, he does not 'perform' [agit] it. Therefore no artisan or work- man is called an 'actor', but an 'author' [i.e. a 'fashioner']. What does it achieve to add 'in act'? ... It is one thing for the wood 'to be able to become an arch', another thing 'to be an arch in potency'. When we say to be able to become an arch, we deny it is now an arch, because what already is is not able to become again since it has been made. How much better it would be to use the common practice of speaking! this piece of wood 'is able to be made into an arch', namely because the form and figure of this wood is changeable into the form and figure of the arch" [128.16-129.12]. What Aristotle means by 'potency' is better handled by the suffix 'bilis' on Latin words indicating that "this possibility is the nature itself of the thing or, as some say, its 'aptitude': hence it is customary to say 'apt by nature' or 'prepared by nature'. But 'nature' is nothing else than the innate quality of a thing which even the Greek word 'phusis' indicates, although we also translate this into 'God' who has nothing of 'having been born' in Himself. Therefore it ought to be said 'this trunk is convertible into an arch', but it is not 'an arch in potency"' [129.17-23]. This brings him back to the problem of the transformation of the elements or simple bodies into each other which we examined at the start of this paper. "See how shamelessly he escapes through the door he has opened for himself, so that he would say that the cold is the hot, the hot the cold, that evil is good and good evil, that small is large and large is small. Likewise, that air is water and fire, and likewise that water is air and earth, and earth is water and fire, fire earth and air, and what is most of all false, that moisture is dryness and dryness is moisture not in act but in potency. For it is possible to say that a quality is changed into a quality and a body into a body (and if Aristotle does not say 'to be able to be' but 'is' another quality or another body), it is not so absurd as to say that moisture, which is a body is changed into dryness, which is not a body" [129.23-130.5]. 320</page><page sequence="43">VALLA'S ANTI-ARISTOTELIAN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY Valla adds a further defect: that Aristotle applies this term to inanimate as well as animate things: "What does the third term 'entelechia' mean? If the same as 'actus', what need was there for inventing it? what does he wish it to be? what does he seek in already occupied territory? what does he choose? Aristotle attrib- utes it not only to the soul and to animated things, but even to a trunk and a stone. What can there be in a stone except quality, either natural or adventitious? Thus these awesome and preten- tious terms of Aristotle are powerful, in which, when he wants to seem shrewd, he seems rather to be debatable. For there is wind in that madness, as certain of them affirm that God is 'act'. Will 'energia' be God, or 'entelechia', that is 'action'? To me this seems to be a monstrosity, not a word" [130.5-16]. Valla declares: "Therefore we act more simply and more ac- commodated to natural sense and common practice" [130.17-18]. Many verbs and statements of actions also indicate qualities, and he gives many examples. As for instance: "Likewise other names, as 'labor' sometimes is 'elaboration', sometimes 'lassitude'. Life is action, hence life is called 'good' and 'bad' when someone does well or poorly, nevertheless it is a quality when it said 'to have life' or 'to lack it"' [131.14-181. In fact action never ceases; even when there is cessation, there is sleeping or other activity. "There- fore doing nothing, we do something, and sleep itself should be called a certain action. For just as fire never ceases from its own action, ... so no animated body, so no water nor earth nor air ever ceases to act, which is its own nature. Therefore, truly there is no rest and quiet in things". Valla adds that because cessation and quiet are not actions they will be qualities. "This is proved by its composite 'requies' [re + quies or rest from labor] which is loved by all as though a delightful quality" [132.8-17]. I referred above to Valla's treatment of the Aristotelian predica- ment of pati, to "suffer" or to "be acted upon", and quoted pas- sages that argued that the meanings of terms and things were indifferent to grammatical categories and that the perception of the senses was active not passive. It is appropriate to add one more here as our analysis is coming to an end. "Therefore, as I have said, to be acted upon is action because to feel passion from it is an action such as to understand danger, or it will be 'passion' itself which is now a quality, and indeed this occurs in animated 321 21</page><page sequence="44">CHARLES TRINKAUS beings. However in insensible things there is no passion because nothing is suffered but they act according to their own natures. For either you bend wood, or you throw a stone into the air, or you smother or extinguish a fire, or whatever body you may break suffers nothing by the very fact that it is affected by no passion, and that it never departs from its own nature, nor ceases to do what is natural to it. For a stone does not desert from the action of gravity but tends downward from the air, and fire upward, and as long as it lives it does not cease to vibrate, light, illuminate, heat, make hot, burn". This leads him to a conclusion which is important for showing his view that humans and other animated creatures stand above and enact their own purposes on the inani- mate objects of nature: "And thus it is in the other things of which nature is the efficient cause in them, or the cause of acting. For there is no final [cause in them] because they lack the purpose of mind" [154.14-29]. Valla's puzzlement concerning Aristotle's entelechia (shown above) is here revealed to be part of his reluctance to see a "final cause". Instead he sees natural efficient causes and the purposive- ness of ensouled beings." This is consistent with his belief in the primacy of the will, in God and in man (and all animals), and with his rejection of all ontology, whether in ancient or medieval or Renaissance philosophy. And here we end our exposition of Val- la's anti-Aristotelian natural philosophy. But not without some comments. It has not been my aim to secure a place for Valla in the history of natural science, and in- deed he does not have one. But he does have a place as part of the internal dissidence within the dominant natural philosophy of his own age, the late middle ages and the Renaissance. He is pre- 55 Valla declares three times that God is to be loved as the efficient cause of man's joys in this world and the next, but not as a final cause for Himself. De vero bono, III, 13, 3: "Quare non placet mihi ut dicatur Deum propter se est amandum quasi amor ipse et delectatio propter finem sit et non ipsa potius finis. Melius diceretur Deum amari non tanquam causam finalem sed efficientem...". Repastinatio dialectice (1439, first redaction): I, 14, 31, ZIPPEL 4 17.27-29: "Non dico Deum 'propter se', ut aliqui loquuntur: nihil enim propter se nec propter aliud amatur, quasi propter alium finem, quia ipsa delectio finis est". Retractatio totius dialectice (1448 and 1453 versions): I, 10, 53, ZIPPEL 90.1-5: "et iccirco non placet mihi, cum dicitur 'Deum amandum propter se', quasi quis aliquem amet ob finem. Amandus est Deus ob efficientem causam, non finalem: quia creator,- quia bo- nus et cetera huiusmodi, non autem ob remunerationem". 322</page><page sequence="45">VALLA'S ANTI-ARISTOTELIAN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY Copernican, pre-Keplerian, pre-Galilean. His cosmos is not heliocen- tric but possibly geocentric or terraquecentric. The heavenly bod- ies are not thought of as planets but only as stars which are "lights" or "fires" (although he is not ignorant of the planetary arrange- ment since he can point out that Aristotle has it in the wrong ord- er). He prefers chapter I of the Book of Genesis to Ptolemy or even Pliny, though he is in some ways more like Pliny in recurring to a natural history. Nature is comprised of the things that God created and that mankind has encountered, fixed upon and desig- nated by names arising from the qualities experienced in its en- counters. From these namings a collective forging of languages occurred, piece by piece over a long period of time. Adam, with Gods' guidance, gave mankind a headstart in this, but it was set back at the Tower of Babel, and fresh starts were required. Valla was not a naive person, and this historical process - in which various peoples assembled knowledge about nature, as a kind of lore, just as Pliny's history is a collection of lore - grew, as Valla saw it, in close relationship to the human intercourse which made language possible and was made possible by language. Hu- man institutions were established with common language and com- mon experiences of the natural world which were being utilized for the fulfillment of physical needs as its qualities became familiar and for warding off the dangers of harmful things and hostile animals and people. Valla's indications of his conceptions of this collective interweaving of language and social life are for the most part in- cidental, but are given more directed expression in the proem to his translation of Thucydides and his inaugural oration at the be- ginning of his university course in the last year of his life.'6 This 56 VALLA'S, Proemium in translationem Thucydidis Histoniarum is reprinted in Ora- ciones y Prefaciones por Lorenzo Valla, Introducciones, textos y notas a cargo de F. ADOR- NO, Santiago, Chile, 1955, pp. 278-289. Valla says, "Nam quid utilius, quid uberius, quid etiam magis necessarium librorum interpretatione? Ut haec mihi mercatura quaedam op- timarum artium esse videatur. Magnae rei eam comparo, cum mercaturae comparo: quid enim illa in rebus humani conducibilius quae omnia ad victum, ad cultum, ad praesidium, ad ornamentum, ad delitias denique vitae pertinentia comportat, ut nihil usquam desit, omnia ubique abundent? Et quod in aureo saeculo fuisse fertur, sint cunctorum quodam- modo cuncta communia. Idem fit in translatione linguarum, sed tanto praeclarius quanto potiora sunt bona mentis corporis bonis; siquidem ex rebus, quas ista transferendi negotiatio nobis apportat, animi aluntur, vestiuntur, roborantur, delectantur ac prope diviniores ef- ficiuntur", pp. 279-280. VALLA'S Oratio habita in principio sui studii, die 18 Octobris 1455, 323</page><page sequence="46">CHARLES TRINKAUS is his version of the myth of the origins of human society, polity and culture, paradigmatically recounted in Cicero's De inven- tione,"7 but to be found in the fragments of the sophists, in Iso- crates, Quintilian and other ancients, and repeated endlessly by Renaissance humanists, illustrated in Piero di Cosimo's cycle of paintings on the history of early man.'8 Valla's version is a high- ly sophisticated one. His criticism of the scholastics and Aristotle is for the obscuri- ty of their proposition of natural philosophy, the seeming incon- sistencies of their theories, and above all the seeming lack of relationship of their ideas to ordinary human experiences of the natural world. It would be hard to outline his own natural philosophy in positive terms, apart from his criticism of Aristotle, though many of his criticisms of Aristotelianism are shrewd, not only those of ingredients that have some false phenomenal consequence but also those of the basic postulates. Valla's critique of the Porphyrian tree of predicaments is impressive and apparently not so distant from similar criticisms by Ockham and others, who nevertheless remained entangled in the apparatus of scholastic formal discourse. His observations on the incoherence of such doctrines as matter and form, potency and act, action and contemplation, substance ed. M. J. VAHLEN, is reprinted in Opera omnia II, ed. E. GAUN, pp. 281-286 Valla says, "Namque ita natura comparatam est, ut nihil admodum proficere atque excrescere queat, quod non a plurimis componitur, elaboratur, excolitur, praecipue aemulantibus invicem et de laude certantibus. Quis enim faber statuarius, pictor item et ceteri, in suo artificio perfectus aut etiam magnus extitisset, si solus opifex eius artifici fuisset? Alius aliud in- venit, et quod quisque in altero egregium animadvertit, id ipse imitari, aemulari, superare conatur. Ita studia incenduntur, profectus fiunt, artes excrescunt et in summum evadunt, et eo quidem melius eoque celerius, quo plures in eandem rem homines elaborant: veluti in extruenda aliqua urbe et citius et melius ad consummationem pervenitur, si plurimorum quam paucissimorum manus adhibeantur... Neque enim minus operosum est artem ali- quam omni ex parte consummari quam urbem. Itaque sicut nulla urbs ab uno, immo nec a paucis condi potest, ita neque ars ulla, sed a multis atque a plurimis, neque his inter se ignotis - nam aliter quomodo aemulari possent et de laude contendere - sed notis et ante omnia eiusdem linguae commercio coniunctis", pp. 94, 95. It is notable that in both these quotations the comparability of learning and social intercourse, indeed the necessity of both are affirmed. " In his exordium to book I. 58 Cf. E.

In a significant measure these are the result of both his own familiarity with natural phenomena and his knowledge of scholastic teachings, together with his concentrated thinking about them. I believe that an important explanation of the capacity of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century scientists to think about natu- ral phenomena in more effective ways is that there was a changing mentality, particularly among educated persons. This mentality was beginning to find some of the fundamental postulates of Aristotelian scholasticism questionable, despite the continuing influence of scholastic natural philosophers through their university teaching and their own erudition concerning the enormous Aristotelian litera- ture, and also their own deeply entertained convictions of the cor- rectness of their theories. This new mentality emerged predominant- ly under the influence of humanists such as Valla, and also of Platonists. The increasing study and reading of Aristotle's Greek texts may have had the effect of weakening the hold of scholastic thinking as well as the more likely one of reinforcing it. But in this period of changing intellectual perception Valla's writings, in- sofar as they were read in the sixteenth-century editions of his work and works, may well have contributed to the gradually changing mental environment. They were at least a striking fifteenth-century example of it. 325</page></plain_text>
