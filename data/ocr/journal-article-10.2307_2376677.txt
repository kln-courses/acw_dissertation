<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE TRUTH OF RELIGION. By Rudolf Eucken. Translated by W. Tudor Jones, Ph.D. London: Williams &amp; Norgate, 1911. Pp. xiv, 622. This is a translation of Professor Eucken's most important contribution to the study of religion, "Der Wahrheitsgehalt der Religion," originally published in 1907 and since repeatedly reviewed and enlarged. When the difficulties of an adequate rendering of such a work into another language are fully con- sidered, the translator may be congratulated on the general ac- complishment of his task. Yet the latter half is so much better than the first that one is bound to infer the acquisition of an increasing skill with practice and to regret that the earlier por- tions of the translation had not been subjected to a revision after such skill had been acquired. Religion is for Eucken the supreme human fact. It might seem indeed at first sight as if his whole philosophic system had been elaborated solely with a view to the defense of re- ligion. Yet a closer study of his work reveals how unwarranted such an assumption is. The facts on which he founds his view</page><page sequence="2">346 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. of human nature are primarily independent of religion, even if it is only in and through religion that they attain their full scope and significance. These facts may be briefly stated thus. Man, the individual human unit, is a part of nature. He is the effect of a given series of causes which are the 'subject-matter of the knowledge that is gained by observation and experiment, even though that knowledge has not yet succeeded and may never completely succeed in enumerating the causes. But if man were nothing more than this, his whole history would be inex- plicable. For that history witnesses to an original self-sub- sisting whole in man which is therefore unanalyzable. There is no other way of accounting for the irrepressible effort of man to create a unity out of the confusion within him and without. He does not respond merely mechanically to his circumstance. Neither does he merely control it in the interests of his limited and isolated self. His most sustained and permanent effort has been to control it in the interest of the whole which he may never be able to attain, but which none the less he never ceases to 'seek. All human culture and civilization are the expression and result of this effort. They cannot possibly be explained as the chance outcome of an indefinite number of human efforts each of which is tethered to its own limited needs. All in human civilization that is due to such effort is subject to immediate ruin and decay. It is of the things that are continually pass- ing away. But there is something which does not pass away, which cannot be shaken. It is the permanent spirit which in- forms civilization, which enables it to endure throughout all revolutions and often to emerge from them purified and re- newed for further and higher achievement. This spirit is rep- resented by the quest of truth in which the most diverse intel- lectual aptitudes are guided by the belief in-perhaps I ought rather to say the vision of-a single significance in reality. It is represented by the inspiration which urges the artist to cap- ture a singleness in reality more adequate, to our seeming, than that which the intellect at its best can achieve. It is represented above all by the desire of and the belief in a vital human unity which have inspired the highest activities of man throughout all the ages. Now this quest of the whole to which man has so consistently devoted himself implies the prior existence in some sort of the whole in his own nature. To this share in the wholeness of</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS. 347 reality which distinguishes man, which indeed constitutes him, Eucken gives the name of the Spiritual Life. Man's history is the history of the struggle of this Spiritual Life to establish itself with ever increasing certainty and permanence against all the opposition and distractions of his impermanent nature. But this struggle depends in the last resort for its hopes of success on man 's complete consciousness of the Spiritual Life in himself and of its dependence on the Absolute Spiritual Life which encompasses all reality. In other words, religion, as the fullest activity of the Spiritual Life in man, far from being a dispensable adjunct, is the necessary form of his perfected life. Man's characteristic life has not even begun to be realized until it has reached the consciously religious stage. From this view of religion its universal affirmations receive a new significance and value. The dualism which underlies such terms as revelation and grace is justified as the only sufficient explanation of the fullest human experience. But it is also robbed of the crudity with which it is held in popular religious belief. The self-subsistent wholeness of reality which appears within the world of experience as the Spiritual Life in man must necessarily be conceived as of another order than that world. Yet it is only as it enters into that world, subduing and transforming it to its own purposes, that it can be known to us. In us the Spiritual Life is fighting for its autonomy. We are the responsible instruments of its victory or of its defeat. We can know it because it is in us, because we are fundamentally constituted by it. But we can also fail to know it because we may have allowed it, instead of transforming to its purposes the immediate demands of mere nature, to be transformed by them to their purposes. The supreme role of religion is just to enforce and sustain this claim of the Spiritual Life to autonomy in man. Revelation is involved in the increasing consciousness, grace in the active recognition and effectuation, of this claim. It will be seen that for Eucken the key to reality is to be found in man. Yet if he would adopt the Protagorean maxim that "man is the measure of all things," it is with a profound difference. He would accept it in no merely pragmatist or humanist sense. Not to man the actual creature of history, but to man the destined master of history, not to man's instinctive and self-centered activity which is dispersive and in the end destructive of reality, but to such activity as helps to establish Vol. XXIII.-No. 3. 23</page><page sequence="4">348 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. in each individual life a self-subsistent wholeness of reality and to extend its sway throughout the whole area of life, does he turn for the ground of a satisfying philosophy. The self-sub- sistent whole of the Spiritual Life is immanent in man as a gen- eral possibility, as the universal constituent of his essential na- ture. But only in a few outstanding members of the race has it actively realized its possibilities and achieved its true destiny. H-ere arises the distinction between what Eucken calls Uni- versal and Characteristic Religion. Since the Spiritual Life is the foundation of all that is distinctively human, revelation and grace are in some sense universal. But it is only through the influence of outstanding religious personalities that they be- come in any sufficient sense effective. In such personalities the active claims of the Spiritual Life, nay its very existence, be- come able to enforce their undeniable presence and authority. Characteristic Religion is therefore, in spite of its inevitable tendency to narrowness and exclusiveness, higher in the scale than Universal Religion. The latter is but the framework which the former fills in with a living content. Not only does the fact of the Spiritual Life become for the first time urgent through Characteristic Religion, but through it also is revealed clearly the cost at which that life achieves the mastery of na- ture both within and without. Above all, through it religion becomes a social achievement, an actual human unity founded in the Spiritual Life and witnessing to the essential transcend- ence of all accidental human diversities. This is the kernel of Professor Eucken's conception. From this as a constant center he surveys and analyzes all the vari- ous forms of human activity. His work perhaps lacks due com- pression. So anxious is he to make his analysis complete that it becomes unnecessarily diffuse and repeats itself almost to weariness. But after all there is hardly a page but rewards us with its flash of insight to which we return again and again for its illuminating force. The book is on the whole far and away the most convincing defense of religion and the justest exposi- tion of what religion is which the modern mind has yet pro- duced. It does justice to every aspect of religion, to the human closeness and intimacy of its popular conception as well as to the abstract remoteness of its theological speculation. The anthropomorphism of the one witnesses to and preserves the human intimacy of the Spiritual Life, the closeness of per-</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS. 349 sonal relations between it and ourselves. The abstractness of the other affirms and enforces the irreducible otherness of the Spiritual Life over against the world of nature, both within ourselves and without. But if it justifies both, it also insists on the dangers to which both are exposed. The anthropomorphic element in religion tends to assimilate the truths of religion to even the pettiest and most variable of man 's experiences in time. The speculative element, on the other hand, tends to make of those truths mere empty frameworks of thought with- out any substantial content of life. It may safely be said of Professor Eucken 's book that it marks an era in the appreciation of religion. We are pass- ing through an epoch of religious revolution when none of the customary and traditional forms in which religion has estab- lished itself among men can be regarded as sacred and in- tangible. At such a moment of crisis this book will prove one of the most trustworthy of guides as to what may pass and what must remain, under it may be renewed forms, in the recon- struction which is coming, and which only an enlarged and deepened religious life can prepare.
