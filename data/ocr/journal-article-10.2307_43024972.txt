Scott Momaday .</page><page sequence="2">Pan-Indianism and Tribal Sovereignties in House Made of Dawn and The Names P. Jane Hafen As an American Indian (Taos Pueblo) undergraduate student, I enrolled in Anthropology 317, North American Indians, to fill my general education social science requirement. We studied social structures and kinship of the historic Iroquois, The class was a prime example of scientific empiricism and objectivism heavily applied to indigenous peoples of the past. Our only venture into the modern age was a viewing of a dated black-and-white film about Indian relo- cation policies of the 1950s. I remember only an overview of the fed- eral policies and generic Indians from various unknown tribes, thrown together in an alien urban environment, trained certainly not for professional positions but for manual labor. At the end of their work week, the end of the film, these Indians, who appeared tribally nondistinct but certainly knew each other's affiliations, gath- ered on top of a hill outside of Los Angeles. They circled around a drum, shared their traditional songs, and came together in a union that transcended tribal differences. N. Scott Momaday closes "The Night Chanter" section of his clas- sic novel, House Made of Daum (1968), with a similar scene, portraying the merging of three distinct tribal traditions - Jemez (Walatowa), through the main character, Abel; Kiowa, through the priest, Tosamah; and Navajo (Dineh), through Ben Benally - in the relocation mecca of 1950s Los Angeles. Yet unlike the Native men of the film, who remain tribally anonymous, each character maintains his own tribal distinction. Although the three major characters come together in an urban setting to help one another, removed from their tribal com- munities, like many contemporary Native peoples who have encoun- tered mainstream education, army service, and other non-Indian institutions, each finds reconciliation by claiming his own specific tribal tradition and identity. Abel will return to his tribal home, and although the novel leaves Tosamah and Ben in Los Angeles, readers sense that they each eventually will return to their motherlands as well. Indeed, Momaday s The Way to Rainy Mountain (1969) rein- scribes Tosamah's voice into Momaday s own personal journey of</page><page sequence="3">8 WAL 34(1) SPRING 1999 return and reconciliation with his Kiowa tribal past. House Made of Dawn and The Way to Rainy Mountain are land- marks in twentieth-century American Indian literatures. These books represent a mainstream recognition of ancient literary tradition; they are not a Native American renaissance as much as a perseverance fil- tered through Momaday's prestigious formal education. The story con- tinues with his self-writing in The Names : A Memoir (1976). In his works, Momaday tells interconnected stories of identity that stress the preeminence of place, the influence of the oral tradition and the importance of language and voice, the blurring of temporal signifiers, and the subordination of the individual to the tribal and communal whole. Yet Momaday never subordinates the individual tribe to a Pan- Indian communal whole. While he creates characters with diverse tribal backgrounds who learn from each other's traditions, he consis- tently affirms sovereign tribal identity. Pan-Indianism, the grouping together of distinct tribal entities that began with the European nomenclature "Indian" itself, has a long tradition of failure. Ultimately it fails Abel in House Made of Dawn . Individual tribal interests supersede broad coalitions of indige- nous peoples. Europeans, though somewhat diverse, had in common patriarchy, market economy, and a single anthropomorphic male deity, and were more racially, religiously, and ideologically homoge- nous than the discrete indigenous populations. In their commonal- ity, the non-Indians constructed a mirror opposite of themselves in the idea of ubiquitous Noble Savage Indians, failing to recognize cul- tural, linguistic, and tribal diversities. Although some disparate groups federated, like the Haudenosaunee (also known as Iroquois), or were categorized together, as were the Five Civilized Tribes, most groups remained independent. Tribal groupings that functioned out of despair or default often resulted from Euro- American policies and practices. For example, faced with dire circumstances and hopeless- ness, various nations attempted to unify by learning and practicing Wovoka's Ghost Dance, but their misplaced belief in the invulnera- bility of the Ghost Dance shirts contributed to the tragic massacre at Wounded Knee in 1890. Tribal individuals were also thrown together in institutional tools of assimilation such as the infamous Carlisle Industrial School. Deprived of language and individuation, the students bonded together before returning to their tribal home- lands or disappearing into urban centers. Ironically, products of the boarding school system were among</page><page sequence="4">P. Jane Hafen 9 the first to formally organize a Pan-Indian group. The Society of American Indians, founded in 1911, counted among its members such luminaries as Carlos Montezuma (Wassaja, Yavapai), Charles Eastman (Ohiyesa, Wahpeton and Mdewakanton Dakota), and Gertrude Simmons Bonnin (Zitkala-Ša, Yankton Sioux), all literate leaders who had been successfully alienated from their tribal roots by mainstream education. These individuals would become significant mediators between traditionalists and the federal government, and their work would lead to the American Indian Citizenship Act of 1924- Particular tribal interests conflicted, however, and factionalism led to the society's dissolution in the early 1920s. In an additional irony, though, the Society of American Indians was simultaneously most united and most divided by the issue of pey- ote use. Opposition to peyote even brought bitter adversaries such as Colonel Richard H. Pratt, Carlisle founder, and his former employee, Zitkala-Ša, into unanimity. Pan-Indianism has had one of its most sue- cessfiil manifestations in the peyote culture of the Native American Church. As an accommodating strategy, this organization is a product of cultural mediation, blending traditional practices with Christianity and developing new rituals. The church was chartered in Oklahoma in 1918 with a variety of tribes represented (Hertzberg 272-73). This unification of diversity appears in "The Priest of the Sun" section of House Made of Daum . Led by Kiowa visionary Reverend John Big Bluff Tosamah of the Holiness Pan-Indian Rescue Mission, Henry Yellowbull, Cristóbal Cruz, Napoleon Kills-in-the-Timber, and Ben Benally communally partake of the peyote buttons and par- ticipate in the sacramental ritual. Benally and Tosamah are the only individuals with specific tribal identities. Along with Abel, this group resembles the Indians I saw in the movie in my anthropology class: desperate for community and companionship. Each character in House Made of Daum is displaced from his tribal homeland but finds temporary communion in the peyote ritual led by Tosamah. Even though Tosamah has his parish in urban Los Angeles, his heart and identity are in his Kiowa roots. While he serves as media- tor for his culturally mixed congregation, he has distinct ritual ges- tures. One gesture is the tribally mixed peyote ceremony itself, derived from the Kiowas' early use of peyote as their culture spread northward from Mexico in the late nineteenth century.1 The other ritual gestures are oral recitations. Tosamah is probably best known for his wonderful discourse on thought and language in his response</page><page sequence="5">IO WAL 34(1) Spring 1999 to the Gospel according to St. John. Choctaw-Cherokee critic Louis Owens observes: As a peyote priest, Tosamah is involved in the appropri- ation of biblical discourse to bear the burden of a new, syn- cretic American Indian spirituality, a spiritual order that arose out of the darkest days for Indian cultures in the nine- teenth century. As a trickster priest, Tosamah mocks, ridicules, and challenges every fixed meaning or static definition. (108-9) Tosamah's jeremiad on "The Word" is a comeback to the religious education on reservations and in boarding schools, again a Pan-Indian experience. Yet despite the commonality and verbal virtuosity, the fundamental ritual gesture of storytelling and oration returns him to his Kiowa origins. While Tosamah functions as trickster in the novel, he also becomes Momaday s surrogate voice and recites, practically verbatim, sections from Momaday s autobiographical work, The Way to Rainy Mountain . Laguna critic Paula Gunn Allen has classified Tosamah as "assimilated," but his Kiowa heritage is inescapable (89). He ritually retells the history of the Kiowa Tai-me, sacred emblem of the Sundance. He transcends time in recounting his Kiowa grandmothers story. In one of the novel's prominent themes, Tosamah finds an articulate voice - through Kiowa sovereignty and an intellectual and spiritual return to place. Tribal sovereignties have prevented any prolonged national Indian political movements as individual tribal interests, like those in House Made of Daum, ultimately prevail. After the demise of the Society of American Indians, Zitkala-Ša and her husband, Raymond Bonnin, founded the National Council of American Indians (NCAI) in 1926. Among various reform groups, such as the American Indian Defense Association, the Indian Rights Association, and the Lake Mohonk Conferences, the NCAI was the only organization whose membership, according to Bonnin, was comprised only of Indian peoples. With the appointment of the Indian Rights Association's John Collier as Commissioner of Indian Affairs in the FDR adminis- tration and the passage of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, the Bonnins' council foundered. A National Congress of American Indians emerged after World War II, but its effectiveness has been limited (Warrior 14). While this congress has been able to forge coalitions over national issues, such as the return of the Blue Lake to</page><page sequence="6">P. Jane Hafen 11 the Taos Pueblo, it, too, has been marked by intertribal conflicts. In House Made of Daum, however, Momaday reveals the long his- tory of cooperation among the Pueblo peoples, including the Jemez, and with neighboring tribes. This background helps establish the foundation of Abel's association with Navajo Ben Benally. Fifteen hundred and ninety-eight is the first recorded meeting of a Pueblo council in response to European intrusion (Sando, Pueblo Nations 248). In 1680 the Pueblo tribes united victoriously to expel European invaders. For twelve years the Spanish were kept out of what is now New Mexico and Arizona. Although most tribes set conditions for readmission of the Spanish, the conquerors were, nevertheless, venge- ful. In the subsequent violence, many Jemez took temporary refuge with the Navajos. Members of the Jemez coyote clan stayed and intermarried with the Navajo (Sando, "Jemez Pueblo" 429). The July 20th date that opens the main narrative in House Made of Daum is the anniversary of Diego De Vargas's 1694 punitive attack on the Jemez Pueblo (Owens 96). The Jemez had been involved in disputes over cattle with the neighboring Zia Pueblo and four Zia men were killed. De Vargas retaliated against the Jemez village, killing eighty- four. Five were burned to death and seven were thrown over San Diego canyon cliffs (Sando, "Jemez Pueblo" 429). In this century Jemez Pueblo again participated with other Pueblos in the formal organization of the All Indian Pueblo Council. The council's initial mission was a successful lobbying effort against the 1922 Bursum Bill, which would have removed Indian sovereign land rights. In typical federal fashion, the congressional bill was "a mon- ster in the cloak of deceptive language," complicated and oblique with one sentence that contained 190 words (Sando, Pueblo Nations 116). The All Indian Pueblo Council still operates to represent various Pueblo interests with the federal government and the state of New Mexico. It consists of nineteen Pueblos with five separate languages and dialects. It is not a Pan-Indian group because it represents a lim- ited group of peoples from similar cultures and land interests. Each Pueblo asserts its own individuality and sovereignty. Nevertheless, practicalities and strategies of survival have placed the Jemez in an unusual relationship with neighboring nations, particularly the Pecos Pueblo and the Navajo. Although Abel and his grandfather, Francisco, share similar connections to these other tribes as well, their ultimate identity is defined by adherence to Jemez. Yet Momaday suggests that Jemez traditions themselves sometimes incorporated other tribal rituals. By 1838 only seventeen members of</page><page sequence="7">12 WAL 34(1) SPRING 1999 the Pecos Pueblo survived. The Jemez took them in and accepted some of their traditions. Momaday refers to them as the Bahkyush. The August 2nd San Diego Feast Day described and celebrated in the novel was a Pecos import, as was the Eagle Hunt Society, whose ritual practices Abel violates by killing the eagle (Schroeder 434). United for nearly a century, the two Pueblos were not legally joined until June 1936 by a legislative act. Late in the novel Francisco's dying thoughts recall his affair with the daughter of a Pecos emigrant: She was the child of a witch. She was wild like her mother, that old Pecos woman whom he feared, whom everyone feared because she had long white hair about her mouth and she hated them and kept to herself. But the girl was young and beautiful, and her name was Porcingula. (204) The historic separation and distrust between tribal nationalities seem difficult to overcome with the mother, but young love prevails between Francisco and Porcingula. The daughter's name is a version of the Pecos patroness saint, Our Lady of Portiuncula (Owens 105; Sando, Pueblo Nations 273). Both of their names represent European colo- nialism. However, the child of this intertribal union is stillborn, reasserting tribal sovereignties. The history of alliance between the Navajo and Jemez goes far- ther back than Jemez relations with Pecos. In the 1640s, Jemez and Navajos killed a Spaniard, Diego Martinez Naranjo; the Spanish governor hanged twenty-nine Jemez leaders (Sando, "Jemez Pueblo" 419). As previously mentioned, after the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 the Jemez sought refuge among the Navajo during Spanish retribution. The Jemez Pueblo maintained friendly relations with the Navajo and in 1818 became a neutral place where the Navajo negotiated their own political issues with the Spanish. This historical sense informs the prominent Navajo themes of House Made of Dawn and Momaday's own Indian experiences, as I will suggest later in reference to The Names . During his relocation in Los Angeles, Abel is befriended by Navajo Ben Benally. The section of the book that represents Benally 's voice and point of view is titled "The Night Chanter" after the Navajo healing ritual. The title of the book itself, House Made of Daum, comes from the text of that Navajo ritual. The Night Chant invokes a beauty that is more accurately represented in the linguistic concept of bikeh hozho, a sense of har- mony and balance with the surrounding world:</page><page sequence="8">P. Jane Hafen 13 May it be beautiful before me, May it be beautiful behind me, May it be beautiful below me, May it be beautiful above me, May it be beautiful all around me. In beauty it is finished. (147) Arguing that the inclusion of the Navajo Night Chant in this novel is an aspect of four-part structural ritual that facilitates Abel's heal- ing, Paula Gunn Allen makes specific correlations between the plot and the mythic background of the novel: The narrative that accompanies the Navajo Night Chant, one of the many chantways used among the Navajo for heal- ing, is about Crippled Boy and Blind Boy, who are aban- doned when the tribe moves. Thus condemned to certain death, Blind Boy carries Crippled Boy on his shoulders, and so teamed they make their way. They come to a high cliff and climb it. At the top they encounter some Holy People who teach them the Night Chant. (89) Ben and Abel climb to the hills of Los Angeles; Abel is not blind but inarticulate. The parallels with the Night Chant are an impetus for Abel to find his Jemez reconciliation. Abel learns much from Ben: survival techniques in an urban set- ting, endurance, acceptance of both good and evil. Ben tells his story of Navajo culture and remembrances from the reservation. He con- nects a sacred Navajo story of the bear and the maiden to Abel's life and his sexual encounter with the white woman, Angela St. John. The story has archetypal resonances as the Kiowa have a powerful myth of the bear and the Jemez have their own story of the Mother Moon and the Great Bear (Owens 115). Yet the traditions remain distinct, and Gunn Allen's description of the ritual life is accurate. Although Abel moves toward reconciliation, the Navajo rite does not and can- not directly heal him; he must return to the Jemez traditions. Despite the support of Ben and Tosamah, Abel has a disastrous relocation experience, not unlike many others. As John Wunder states: "Some Indians called this a new Extermination program/ Youngsters were enticed to the city to die, while the old starved on the reserva- tion. The result was another land grab" ("Retained by the People " 106). Abel's determination to return to Jemez is an act of individua- tion through tribal affiliation. The night before his departure, he and</page><page sequence="9">14 WAL 34(1) SPRING 1999 Ben, like the men of the anthropology film, went to watch the sun rise over Los Angeles. Ben narrates: We are going to get drunk, I said. We were going to be all alone, and we were going to get drunk and sing. We were going to sing about the way it always was. And it was going to be right and beautiful. It was going to be the last time. And he was going home. (189-90) While Abel's idea of beauty, harmony (hozho), and healing may be influenced by Ben's Night Chant, he can finally only be healed by going home to his Walatowa traditions and bloodlines through his grandfather, Francisco. His resonance to the Navajo healing ritual may come from the suggestion that his father might have been Navajo, but the Jemez are matrilineal and that is his tribal identity. The novel begins and ends with the Towa words for invocation and benediction in storytelling, as Jemez is the only Indian nation that speaks Towa. As Owens notes, the novel also begins and ends mythologizing the time and place of Jemez, an aspect of "attempting to place Abel . . . very securely within the timeless space that defines [his] tribal identity" (94, 117). Abel begins and ends the novel with the image of the Dawn Runners, who Gunn Allen also identifies as the "Runners- After-Evil" (90). It is the same image that gives him hope when he is beaten and lying helpless on the beach in California. While various Pueblos have footraces as part of feast day celebra- tions, Abel's participation with the Jemez Dawn Runners signifies his reconciliation with and acceptance of the Walatowa community. On a more individual level, Abel finds strength to make his own ritual gesture by preparing the body of his dead grandfather, Francisco. He finally finds an articulate voice to summon the Padre for the proper Catholic rituals. Pan-Indianism cannot rescue Abel; only his return to Jemez can produce the individuation within the tribal community that will give him a sense of identity. Abel can be reconciled only through partic- ular tribal traditions and through the assertion of specific tribal rites. The empathy he feels for the Kiowa and the peyote ritual and, espe- cially, his affinity for the Navajo cannot replace the necessity of tribal sovereignty. Similarly, Momaday's intimacy with Jemez and the Navajo can- not replace his Kiowa perspective. His novel seems compelled to include his own Kiowa heritage and his subsequent works are more Kiowa centered.</page><page sequence="10">P. Jane Hafen 15 The Pueblo of Jemez continues to assert its tribal sovereignty. Last summer in preparation for this essay I returned to visit the village. Although there is a small visitors center and shop for Jemez pottery, the Pueblo itself has become very restricted. A stern sign at the entrance warns visitors: "No photography, no video recording, no sketching, no cassette recording, no alcoholic beverages. Items will be confiscated or fined by Governor's orders." Without the infrastructure to support a tourist economy, the nineteen hundred residents cannot accommodate outsiders. Visitors are not banned, but the Jemez peo- ple have asked for respect and no publicity for the ceremonial dates. While this may appear unfriendly, the Jemez have asserted their tribal rights to preserve their privacy. In a world of commercial exploitation, gawking tourists, sentimental literary critics, and nosy anthropologists, they have chosen to resist intrusion. This assertion of tribal sovereignty is, unfortunately, still necessary. In the current Congress new legal assaults on tribal sovereignty are disguised as legislative riders; in 1997, for instance, United States Senator Slade Gorton of Washington attached a rider to the Interior Appropriations Bill that would have required tribal governments to relinquish their sovereignty and immunity from civil suits in order to receive operat- ing funds. ipiļj) (jjxjj) HUP In The Names : A Memoir , a family and tribal history, Momaday traces his pedigree, pan-tribal encounters, and particular events that shape his Kiowa identity. The book, published in 1976, has parallels to Momaday's earlier writings, particularly The Way to Rainy Mountain , and identifies the sources of his multitribal approach in House Made of Daum. Rather than simply a "Native American version of Roots" as one review calls it, The Names subtly assaults political issues of American Indian identity while demonstrating Momaday's commu- nal construction of the tribal self ( Choice review, reprinted on the back of the memoir). Like The Way to Rainy Mountain , The Names has a visual organi- zation that ameliorates a strictly narrative presentation and questions genre categorizations. On the title page is a multigenerational family portrait. As the representative bear figure of his generation, Momaday plays with the language of the dedication: "In devotion to those whose names I bear and to those who bear my names." Even before the narrative begins, Momaday positions himself in the context of</page><page sequence="11">16 WAL 34(1) SPRING 1999 the past, future, and present and of Kiowa tribal identity. The next page has a genealogical chart of pictures and names. For those whose photos are missing, Momaday supplies a line drawing, except for his great-great-grandfather. On the chart he identifies him- self as "Tsoai-talee" with his initials, NSM, in parentheses. Prior to the prologue, Momaday establishes his self, his method, and his purpose: My name is Tsoai-talee. I am, therefore, Tsoai-talee; there- fore I am. The storyteller Pohd-lohk gave me the name Tsoai-talee. He believed that a man's life proceeds from his name, in the way that a river proceeds from its source. In general my narrative is an autobiographical account. Specifically it is an act of the imagination. When I turn my mind to my early life, it is the imaginative part of it that comes first and irresistibly into reach, and of that part I take hold. This is one way to tell a story. In this instance it is my way, and it is the way of my people, (n.p.) Momaday acknowledges that much of how we think about who we are stems from our imagination. Though he starts with the act of individuation by proclaiming, "This is my name, this is who I am, I exist," that singular self is submerged into the language of the Kiowa, the tribal act of storytelling, the communal "way of [his] people." Additionally, the first part of Momaday 's Kiowa name, Tsoai, repre- sents rock tree, or Devil's Tower, the Wyoming geographic landmark that plays an integral role in Kiowa mythology and Momaday 's writ- ings. Indeed, when the prologue begins on the next page, page one, Momaday recounts an origin story of the Kiowa. The story of the Kiowa coming to the earth through the hollow log is familiar from House Made of Dawn and The Way to Rainy Mountain . As a prologue, it establishes a beginning and a worldview. Where a people believe they originate, whether it is through a hol- low log, the Garden of Eden, primordial soup, or, as with my tribe, through a sacred lake, shapes how they see themselves in the world. For Momaday, the world is defined by his Kiowa origins. Part one of the narrative is faced with a photo of Pohd-lohk, the storytelling arrowmaker. Momaday begins: The names at first are those of animals and of birds, of objects that have one definition in the eye, another in the hand, of forms and features on the rim of the world, or of sounds that</page><page sequence="12">P. Jane Hafen 17 carry on the bright wind and in the void. They are old and original in the mind, like the beat of rain on the river, and intrinsic in the native tongue, failing even as those who bear them turn once in the memory, go on, and are gone forever: Pohd-lohk, Keahdinekeah, Aho. (3) He shows the connection between language and definition, naming and beginning. He also merges language with place and people who, through memory and narrative, transcend time. The very next paragraph introduces Momaday's non-Kiowa pre- decessors: And Galyen, Scott, McMillan, whose wayfaring lay in the shallow traces from Virginia and Louisiana, who knew of blooded horses and tobacco and corn whiskey, who pre- served in their songs the dim dialects of the Old World. (3) Momaday is frank and clear about establishing his family lines. In doing so, he confronts the difficult issue of Indian identity and blood quantum. Novarro Scott Momaday's mother, Natachee Scott, had a great-grandmother who was Cherokee. With the preponderance of Euro-Americans who claim scant Cherokee heritage, her thinly threaded connection is sufficient to make many Native peoples giggle and authentic Cherokees squirm.2 Momaday explains his mother's act of self-invention: In 1929 my mother was a Southern belle; she was about to embark upon an extraordinary life. It was about this time that she began to see herself as an Indian. That dim native heritage became a fascination and a cause for her, inasmuch, perhaps, as it enabled her to assume an attitude of defiance, an attitude which she assumed with particular style and satis- faction; it became her. She imagined who she was. This act of the imagination was, I believe, among the most important events of my mother's early life, as later the same essential act was to be among the most important of my own. (23-25) This passage is crucial in many ways. Natachee Scott creates her own Indian identity in a time when it was becoming increasingly safe, and popular, to be an Indian. For example, from the same period, Will Rogers (1879-1935), with his Cherokee great-grandmother, had created a popular Indian persona in film and radio. As a transitional figure, he demonstrated that mixed-blood Indians could live and</page><page sequence="13">18 WAL 34(1) SPRING 1999 function in the modem world. Gertrude Bonnin, Zitkala-Ša, also played Indian to a receptive public in this era. Laughing Boy , Oliver LaFarge's 1929 novel of imaginary Navajos, won the Pulitzer Prize. Natachee claimed this cultural opening to dress in buckskins, attend Haskell Institute, and become an imaginary Indian. In the contem- porary world of wannabees and New Agers who imitate and colonize anew, it is easy to scorn those who isolate such a meager Cherokee heritage and play it into the defining factor of one's being. However, Natachee Scott's life is not a facile acquisiton of Indian identity. As Momaday acknowledges, her choices led her to meet his father, Al Momaday, Kiowa, and establish a life beyond reproach among Indian peoples. Her "exotic" physical appearance aided her ability to "pass" as Indian, and Momaday implies that it was a factor that attracted his father to her. Although there was apparent "turbu- lence" with Natachee 's Kiowa in-laws, she participated in the Navajo and Jemez communities where she lived (39). As an Indian family, the Momadays - Natachee, Al, and Scott - merge tribal cultures. One of the most interesting consequences of Natachee's assump- tion of Indianness appears in the birth documents of Scott. To whom it may concern: This is to certify that the records of this office show that Novarro Scott Mammedaty was born February 27, 1934 at Lawton, Oklahoma and is of 7/8 degree Indian blood, as shown on the Kiowa Indian Census roll opposite Number 2035. The official Government agency records further show that his father is Alfred Mammedaty and his mother is Natachee Scott. By Act of June 2, 1924 (42 Stat. 253), all Indians born within the territorial limits of the United States were declared to be citizens of the United States. (42) The reader who has been following Momaday 's narrative in the book or .this retelling will recognize that, at best, Momaday's blood quan- tum is 9/16 not 7/8 (or 4/16 less than Spokane writer Sherman Alexie). Although the insertion of this legal document fits the flow of the narrative, it also challenges the notion of blood quantum as the defining factor of Indian identity and reveals the absurdity of the federal authority to grant citizenship. By this point Momaday has already established his Kiowa origins through events, place, narra- tive, familial and tribal relationships. His Kiowaness is unassailable, despite the fact he does not fluently speak the language. Critics do</page><page sequence="14">P. Jane Hafen 19 N. Scott Momaday. MAMMEDATY. 1976.

Scott Momaday. not challenge his Indian identity, as other Indian authors have been challenged, even by Indian critics. Certainly those fraudulent writers like Jamake Highwater and Forrest Carter should be exposed. At the same time it seems futile and hostile, for example, to attack select Indian authors on the basis of blood quantum.3 The tribes know who their people are despite the imposition of governmental definitions and fractionalization of body parts. Momaday validates these tribal definitions by exposing his own inaccurate CDIB, Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood. Momaday contrasts the arid legal language, naming, and defin- itions by immediately imagining "a day in the life of a man, Pohd-lohk,</page><page sequence="15">20 WAL 34(1) SPRING 1999 who gave [him] a name" (42). This subsequent narrative about Pohd- lohk affirms Momaday's communal and tribal identity. It underscores the paradox of the individual defined not by distinctive blood but by being part of a greater whole - a past history and future compounded in the present and understood in the imagination. As Momaday chronicles his growing years, he maintains, in a multilayered awareness, his Kiowa sensibilities that are tribal specific and place connected. At the same time he was treated as the racial and Indian "other" by the mainstream population of Hobbs, New Mexico, where he was growing up. In the following passage, he dis- cusses gendered behavior that also has racial implications: In my day there were two classifications of boys at Hobbs, the toughs and the sissies. I was big and strong, and so I most often aligned myself with the toughs. It was convenient to do so, for I had then a stake in the dominant society, and the world of children is simply informed by the principle of dom- ination. On the other hand, some of the boys that I liked best were sissies, and I got on with them very well in the main. The truth is, I moved more easily across the dividing line, back and forth, than did most of my fellows, and I learned to deal in crude diplomacies, strategies of choice and adjustment. (88) Those "strategies of choice and adjustment" continued to play out in Momaday's young life. His parents worked on the Navajo reserva- tion. As for many Indians who grow up in proximity to Dinetah, Navajo- land, the Navajo influence seems omnipresent.^ Because the Momadays are Kiowa, they are lumped with the dominant tribe by the main- stream premise that fails to acknowledge tribal specificity and differ- entiation. At the same time, the Navajo people recognize that they must have more in common with this Kiowa family than with the outside Euro- American perceptions and influences. Momaday layers the Navajo experience on his existing Kiowa and Euro- American perceptions. He learns limited Navajo vocabulary, including place names, and becomes acquainted with the Navajo ceremonies that will emerge in the healing ritual and title of House Made of Daum. Momaday learns from the Navajo, and later from the Jemez Pueblo, fundamental principles about ritual, healing, place, history, and time. However, tribal specificity remains preeminent. The Navajo Night Chant is not equivalent to the Kiowa Gourd Dance; ritual process may be empathetic, but it remains tribally specific. As Momaday notes:</page><page sequence="16">P. Jane Hafen 21 If you have ever been to the hogans in Canyon de Chelly, or to a squaw dance near Lukachukai - if you have ever heard the riding songs in the dusk, or the music of the yei bichai - you will never come away entirely, but a part of you will remain there always; you will have found an old home of the spirit. (119-20) This homing and grounding of the spirit does not, nevertheless, make one Navajo. When, in the closing section of The Names , Momaday shifts the setting to his young years at Jemez, he describes the Pueblo with the voice of an inside observer. He does not displace cultural practices with a foreign or ethnographic "othering" but describes with an inside knowing, privileging details from a Native point of view while preserving tribal distinctions. And throughout the year there were ceremonies of many kinds, and some of these were secret dances, and on these holiest days guards were posted on the roads and no one was permitted to enter the village. My parents and I kept then to ourselves, to our reservation of the day school, and in this way, through the tender of our respect and our belief, we earned the trust of the Jemez people, and we were at home there. (147) When Momaday embarks on his literary career with House Made of Daum , he fictionalizes his observations from Jemez through Abel. The epilogue of The Names returns Momaday to the place and narrative that is Kiowa specific and again refers to the hollow log of Kiowa origins. When considered with the intertexuality of Momaday 's writings, his self-writing falls clearly in the context of the tribal com- munity as he speaks the names of those who have bestowed his Kiowa name and being. Like House Made of Daumy The Names reveals vari- able tribal influences and aspects of Pan-Indianism yet adheres to tribal sovereignties. One significant aspect of contemporary Indian identity is the intertribal awareness that comes with university classes with American Indian topics, urban centers, professional associations, geographic dis- placements, and detribalization. As part of the two-thirds of Native peoples who do not live on reservations, we flock together like lost birds because we recognize each other and common experiences, par- ticularly the ways we are treated by mainstream society.

The first question is always: "What tribe are you?"^ Despite affinity for many Native col- leagues and friends, I will always specifically be tied to my own tribe, as Abel returns to Jemez, Ben Benally to Dinehtah, and N. Scott Momaday to the rainy mountain of the Kiowa. Notes 1. See Wunder, The Kiowa , for a detailed discussion of the Kiowa use of peyote. 2. For treatments of Cherokee claims and identity definitions, see Merskin. 3. In a review of The Beet Queen , Silko attacks Louise Erdrich for being 1/2 Indian, but in a private communication with me, Alfonso Ortiz (San Juan Pueblo) noted the absurdity and indicated that Silko herself is 1/8 degree blood quantum. 4. I once had a student from Albuquerque who thought that Laguna Pueblo was a Navajo village. 5. In Alexie s Indian Killer , the adopted and detribalized main charac- ter, John Smith, responds to this question according to who asks it. To non- Indians he assumes the role of Sioux so fixed in popular culture; to Indians he states that he is Navajo, an unlikely probability considering his six-and- a-half-foot height.
