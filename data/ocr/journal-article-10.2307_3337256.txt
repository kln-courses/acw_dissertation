<plain_text><page sequence="1">TANZANIA Masterworks of African Sculpture Haus der Kulturen der Welt Berlin, Germany April 29-August 7, 1994 Reviewed by Kerstin Volker "Tanzania: Masterworks of African Sculpture" opened last April to considerable excitement. Curated by Wolfger P6hlmann in cooperation with Helmut Friedel of the Sttidtische Galerie im Lehnbachhaus, Munich, and designed by Tonis KAio, the exhibition displayed more than 400 figurative sculptures from several areas of Tanzania. Although this show was said to have been made possible through the united efforts of museums of the former GDR and many private as well as institutional lenders (catalogue, p. 12), only the Museum fiir Volk- erkunde, Leipzig, was mentioned as a partici- pant from the former East Germany. The art was well organized into eight sec- tions. Six of them focused on stylistic traits of six regions: Midsouth, West, Northeast, East, and Central Tanzania as well as the Makonde area. The two remaining sections each concen- trated on a specific art genre: regional masks and high-backed stools (karyatiden). The sculp- tural traditions of over one hundred ethnic groups were surprisingly well represented in light of the limited space (900 qm). The unusu- ally large number of objects, and their arrange- ment, allowed the unique opportunity for a thorough comparative stylistic analysis. Entering the main hall, the visitor encoun- tered a dense, eerie forest of Nyamwezi and Sukuma wooden figures. Each was positioned on its own unenclosed pedestal, forming seven rows six figures across-forty-two trees. The statues' worn, abstract faces ap- 84 african arts * winter 1995</page><page sequence="2">PHOTO WILLIAM STRAUCH peared to be staring intently at the observer and led to the question: Who is looking at whom? This sense of reciprocity created an inescapable tension and enabled one to feel intuitively the figures' intrinsic power. Male and female Sukuma marionette statuettes, some with signs of decay and intensive usage, displayed grotesque faces, bits of human hair, teeth, and articulated limbs. During the dry season one type of these figures was used to entertain and to imitate dancers. Another type was used as an oracle to prove adultery. A prominent Sukuma ancestral male-female pair was from the Sultanate of Kelunde. Many fine examples of Nyamwezi art were displayed along the wall. As primus inter pares there was the famous tall male figure from the Collection Mestach, Brussels: highly stylized, with elongated proportions, it in- spired Giacometti and has long been regarded as an East African masterpiece. It was juxta- posed with superb small female sculptures (one of them showing signs of steatopygia) with refined, naturalistic faces and bodies. The art of Midsouth and West Tanzania was represented in the second hall. First on display in the Midsouth area were Ngoni neckrests in the shape of stylized animals, and carvings from the Pangwe and Bena. The West Tanzania area contained pieces from the various groups of peoples living along Lake Tanganyika. Tanzan- ian culture is a synthesis of influences, brought about by ethnic group mobility and internation- al trade. This fact was apparent here as well as elsewhere in the exhibition. For example, a number of Jiji standing figures had body and facial scarifications similar to those seen on Tabwa figures from Zaire; Tabwa carvers re- sided in the Jiji area and altered their style to conform to local requirements. The stylistic syn- thesis was also exemplified by the collection of Ngoni neckrests with pyrographic decorations, reminiscent of South African Zulu techniques. A subsequent room devoted to the tradition- al art of East Tanzania was occupied by a collec- tion of fine Zaramo mwana hiti torso figures, anthropomorphic staffs and marionette staffs, and musical instruments with sculptured heads. The display also included highly stylized Kaguru ritual posts and Luguru and Kwere staffs and flywhisks crowned with elaborately carved pickaback figures, female figures, and heads. All these objects were connected themat- ically by their function in initiation rites. The predominant representation of female attributes was noteworthy, pointing to the matrilineality of these East Tanzanian ethnic groups. Closely linked to this section was a remark- able collection of Pare, Shambaa, Zigua, and Ngulu clay and wooden figures from North- east Tanzania. The pieces displayed were com- monly used in rites of passage, as instructional models in female puberty rites, and in agrarian PHOTO: GEORG MEISTER fertility rites. They also functioned as power objects. Some of the dried, unfired clay figures were highly abstract, resembling lumps of clay. Some stressed certain human physical features like feet, hands, nose, ears, or the whole head. Despite the difference in materials, the wooden objects were very similar to the clay models. Most of them had cavities in which magical substances would be placed to increase the desired effects. In interesting contrast to most exhibitions, Makonde art was represented not by ujamaa or shetani figures but by little-known pieces pre- dominantly from the Museum fiir V61kerkunde in Leipzig, collected between 1850 and 1950. The display included objects from different time periods representing the cultural areas north and south of the Rovuma River. There were excellent examples of asymmetrical masks, hel- met masks, masks that were caricatures of living people, and masks with the typical lip plug. Some face masks were shown with breastplates (njorowe) that were part of the costume; these plates had naturalistic contours delineating breasts and protruding navels, and displayed wax applique or pyrographic decoration. The undisputed masterworks among the masterworks were the high-backed stools of the Nyamwezi, Gogo, Kaguru, Luguru, Kwere, Doe, and Zaramo. These were highlighted in a 0 0 0 W Mu 2 w (L Left: Anthropomorphic high-backed stool. Luguru, East Central Tanzania. 101cm (39.8"). Private collection. Above: Marionette figure.

Decorated backs, each topped with a carved figure, or sometimes a carved human head, were characteristic. They were used as thrones, seats of ancestors or of chiefs, and their carvings told of the history of cultural and stylistic exchange along the caravan route, the only place they were collected and in all likeli- hood produced. It is said that only twenty-two stools are still in existence, of which eighteen were shown in this exhibition. A row of forty masks organized by region, each placed on a separate uncased pedestal, was displayed on the final part of the exhibi- tion wall. The masks were arranged like com- memorative marble portraits of the gods of classical antiquity, allowing an unprecedented close analysis of their style and of their mor- phological development. In the exhibition cat- alogue Meurs says of masks that "the original wooden block is not taken over by the intend- ed form, but remains a fragment of nature..." (p. 371). In this sense the masks appeared to be partly worked tree trunks, still a part of the natural cycle and thus connecting with the for- est metaphor of the first exhibition room. The number of objects and the rich diversity of forms and styles in "Tanzania" put it in a superior class. Chosen with great care, the pieces were of high quality and were excellent examples of their types. The exhibition made an important contribution in pointing up the state of research on Tanzanian traditional woodcarv- ing. It fulfilled its purpose, stated explicitly in the catalogue and on wall texts: to show that Tanzania was not poor in sculptural art. One of the catalogue authors, Allen F Roberts, points out that a lack of interest rather than a lack of material explains why Tanzanian art has never occupied much space in general exhibitions on African art (p. 350). In light of this statement, it could be overlooked that in part the master- pieces were continually competing for attention. One question remains, however. If so little has been known up to now about Tanzanian art, why did the design of this exhibition fol- low such a puristic approach? Although wall texts stressed that these objects were not pro- duced as self-explanatory l'art pour l'art, that is exactly how they were presented. Captions tended to classify the objects rather than give information about their meaning, use, or other background. Luckily the catalogue fills any gaps in ethnographic information. An educational program, "Tanzania: Colonial Heritage and New Beginning," orga- nized by the independent research institute Forschungsschwerpunkt Moderner Orient in Berlin, accompanied the exhibition. Children were offered a 90-minute workshop, "Learning about Life in Tanzania." 0 The catalogue, with introductory articles by Marc L. Felix and Maria Keckskisi (text in German and Swahili: 528 pp., 522 b/w photos, 6 maps, bibliog- raphy; DM 48 hardcover), was published by Jens Jahn for the Haus der Kulturen der Welt, Berlin.
