<plain_text><page sequence="1">Psychology and Education: Where Did All the Psyches Go? W. R. WEES Ontario Institute for Studies in Education The discipline of psychology and the art of education have been related only in that, historically, as most of experimental psychology has done its level best to turn itself into a natural science, it has also done its level best to keep education tied to the hitching post of the middle ages. Unfortunately, too much of psychology is still living in its own history, like a child who has never grown up. It is true that a few psychologists recently have turned to study the in- finite complexity of the human mind and spirit and that some educational psychologists, in spite of what they learned in psychological laboratories, have turned themselves into educators psychologically inclined. In their humanistic inclinations, however, the psychologist and the educational psychologist are not two of a kind. The psychologist, philosophically, is an ontologist, concerned with being. The successful educational psychologist is an ontogenist, concerned with becoming. The difference between the two is the difference between "it is" and "it ought to be." It is the difference be- tween asking oneself "What is it?" and leaving it at that, and asking oneself "What can it be at its best?" then getting to work to ensure that it becomes what it can be. If I am right that psychology has not yet got far beyond its beginnings, we might look at the beginnings. Psychology as a science was a kind of accident. As a modern science and a discipline it began with the philosophers. In the first half of the seventeenth century, Descartes began the modern psychological thinking with the assurance of complete separation of body and soul. The body is inanimate but operative matter, a machine. The soul is animated consciousness. And they are separate entities. Three cen- turies later dualism appears by implication in the writing of those who think about the mind, leaving the body out, and those, like John B. Watson and his successors, who experiment and write about the body, leaving the mind out. Leibnitz's ideology, on the other hand, was a world view and posited the activity and the unity of both mind and substance. In this he antici- 323 INFORMAL SECTION/CURRICULUM THEORY NETWORK 5:4 (1976)</page><page sequence="2">324 w. R. WEES/CTN pated, by a couple of hundred years, Gestalt psychology. About the same time, John Locke, inspired by Descartes, denied the Cartesian theory of innate ideas and founded ideation in experience, thus initiating the concept of empiricism on which, in some degree or other, all experimental psychology has been based ever since. In the early eighteenth century George Berkeley set thinking on its ear with his own brand of idealism. Relying on empiricism as Locke did, he reversed the process. With Locke, matter is the cause of mental function. With Berkeley mind conceives the matter, which is also to say that the mind creates the meaning out of its experiences. Good theory today for those humanists in psychology who believe that each of us creates his world and, as he creates his world, he creates himself. It would hardly be possible to detail the influence of philosophy on psychology in no matter how many pages. In these few lines we have re- ferred only to the four most influential philosophers whose thinking is still reflected in the work of most psychologists, even in the work of those who pride themselves on their originality. The effect of philosophical thinking on psychology persisted through the nineteenth century, so effectively, indeed, that psychology was not psychology, but was called mental philosophy in British universities. As a mental philosophy it moved to North America under its chosen name of psychology, in time, and into education. In 1877 the minister of education of Ontario, reporting on the normal schools, said, "Psychology has hitherto had no place in our course for teachers, though it is admitted to be the basis of all true principles of education" (Phillips 1957, p. 585). Perhaps it was: ninety years ago. Continuing throughout the nineteenth century as a mental philosophy in university teaching, psychology was to find its experimental basis in physics and physiology. Sir Charles Ball, anatomist, physiologist, expert surgeon, in 18 11 pub- lished his discoveries of the laws of difference between motor and sensory nerves, the specificity of sensory nerves in the six senses, and the reciprocal innervation of extensor and flexor muscles. These discoveries, especially that of motor and sensory nerves, together with Cajal's discovery of the synapse in 1883, became the basic tenets on which E. L. Thorndike relied for the rationale of his mechanistic stupefaction of the minds of school chil- dren in the 1920s. Fechner, a physicist who was philosophically minded, determined to prove experimentally the interdependence of mind and body. To prove his bias he measured the strength of stimuli, related them to just noticeable differences in sensation, and, although he could not measure sensations, he thought he could infer their strength from the measurements of stimuli. In this way he measured one aspect of the mind and mathematically proved his philosophical creed. But he had done much more. By inventing a new kind of measurement he had set in motion the whole apparatus of quantitative, experimental psychology. Helmholtz, however, physicist cum physiologist, was the great one, and though he would never have admitted that he was a psychologist, the history</page><page sequence="3">INFORMAL SECTION 325 of psychology claims him. He used Fechner's mathematics in extensive studies of sensation, delved deeply and experimentally into problems of perception, and as a result of his experiments deduced the concept of "unconscious inferences." Unconscious inferences, of course, are a far cry from the measurement of operations of the mind. Unconscious inferences turn out to mean that what you see depends on where you sit and where you sit depends on where your previous experiences have landed you. Ex- perience, then, is a major factor in all our individual differences. But just try to measure unconscious inferences! These three, and there were dozens of others. Then came Wilhelm Wundt. Physiologist turned philosopher, Wundt made psychology his life. He created a laboratory, used all the work that nineteenth century physicists and physiologists had done, published a journal, wrote prodigiously, sent uncounted students out into the world to preach the gospel of quantitative, experimental psychology. So, in the mid-eighteen-seventies, only one hun- dred years ago, the science of psychology was born and Wundt has been named its father. He was a bold man to conceive and breed a new discipline out of what he had to start with. About all he had was a bundle of studies of sensation, a meager inventory with which to start the study of the mind. William James wondered about that too. Twenty years later, com- menting on Fechner and his measurement of sensation, James wrote: "It would be terrible if even such a dear old man as this could saddle our Science forever with his patient whimsies. .. in a world full of more nutri- tious objects of attention.... Those who desire this dreadful literature can find it." Then he added: "And everybody praised the duke Who this great fight did win." "But what good came of it at last?" Quoth little Peterkin. "Why, that I cannot tell," said he, "But 'twas a famous victory!" [Boring 1929, p. 285] As I look at the titles of many of the articles in the Canadian Journal of Psychology and try to read them, I often wonder whether William James, commenting on experimental psychology today, might not say the same thing. One modern-day psychologist, looking at his pile of one hundred- odd published reports of his experiments, said exactly that. "And what are they all good for?" he asked. "Pretty bubbles in the air!" However, in spite of the James comment, psychology seemed to be on the way to becoming a sort of natural science. In his study of per- ception, for example, Helmholtz had laid down the Law of Sufficient Reason, which he described as the mind's urgent desire to comprehend everything. Then Wundt, disregarding mental measurement, reinterpreted Helmholtz with his Law of Psychic Causality, which he described as the interdependence of conscious data, a causality quite unlike physical causa- tion. Thought, he added, is a power of the mind not amenable to experi- ment. Less than half a century later, Spearman and Piaget proved him</page><page sequence="4">326 W. R. WEES/CTN wrong. But of course when Piaget first appeared nearly fifty years ago, to most North American psychologists he was just a doodler: He used his head instead of "instruments" to report what he observed. Then, in 1895, along came Ebbinghaus with his nonsense syllables, the curve of forgetting, and his invention of the completion test, completely disregarding Wundt, and relying entirely on his misinterpretation of Fechner's slide rule. Since teaching, so far as the children were concerned, was mainly nonsense syllables, Ebbinghaus's curve of forgetting appeared in nearly every text book on educational psychology for the next thirty-five years. For the teacher, that forgetting curve was reassurance that he was not a failure: If forgetting so much so quickly is a natural function of the mind, how could the teacher be blamed if his students remembered hardly any- thing he said? Ebbinghaus's completion test was but another form of objective tests that laboratories had been cooking up in Germany since 1890. In 1905 Binet, with his assistant, Simon, came along with their test of intelligence to bedevil so many hundred thousand school children and their education with its IQuation. Exported to the United States, the test fad had quickly be- gun to clog the laboratories there as well. Today it is hardly possible to do acceptable research in educational psychology without an "objective" test to test whatever it is that the researcher may imagine that he is testing. The basic problem with all the various forms of objective tests is that they are based on the philosophical assumptions of elementalism, dis- credited and discarded in the early nineteenth century. This was the assumption that the brain can be packed jugful with possibly an infinite number of elements called ideas. And since infinity is too big a number to juggle, the testmongers take a few random samples, assuming that the samples represent the whole. The results, of course, are quite similar to the amusing drama of the blind men and the elephant in that old Eastern legend. Even worse, if the results don't suit the researcher, it is a simple matter to invent another statistical formula and cook the pot of informa- tion to his own taste. At the end of the nineteenth century also, the psychology of animals appeared. Under the name of comparative psychology (comparing men and animals) the new studies, inspired by Darwin's observations and con- clusions, undertook to discover psychological continuity between man and animal. The result was an anthropomorphic, from-the-top-down study which tried to identify in animals such human attributes as intelligence, consciousness, and memory. It was not long, however, before the compara- tive aspect disappeared and psychologists were studying animals for their own sake. And not long after that change, anthropomorphism was re- versed and become animality-the study of animalism in man-a lot of it ostensibly for the man's sake. The two animalist researchers whom we select for comment are John B. Watson and E. L. Thorndike. We shall comment on Watson first, not be- cause he was the forerunner of the two (though he was), but because he was less honest, more culpable, invented Behaviorism in 1913, and in the harm he has done to education is still very much alive.</page><page sequence="5">INFORMAL SECTION 327 In his great A History of Experimental Psychology (1929) Edwin Boring said that psychologists are philosophically naive. Certainly in Watson's books, Psychology from the Standpoint of a Behaviorist, 1919, or Behav- iorism, 1924, there is no sign that he had ever heard of philosophy as a discipline. Yet in his pronouncements Watson resolved the dilemma of Descartes's dualism in the way that Berkeley did, except inversely. Berkeley had said that mind is dominant over matter, in effect that mind makes matter. Watson completely disregarded mind, and indeed did his best to drive the concept of consciousness out of psychology. Pavlov, working in a similar vein, insisted that he was a physiologist, and under the circumstances it is difficult to understand how Watson could have continued to be accepted as a psyche-ologist, which he claimed he was. As a contrast between American materialism and British idealism of the time, I suggest you might read James Ward's Psychological Principles (1920o). Unfortunately, American materialism in psychology has persisted strongly until this day. The basic tenet of materialism, whether in Watson- ian Behaviorism or any variation of it, is the stimulus and the response. Al- though Wundt had already said that physical cause and psychic cause are quite different causal forms, many of the people who were dabbling in the occult of the mind still could think of science only in terms of the natural sciences that they knew. And since much of experimental psychology was still of the Helmholtz type (relating stimulus and sensation), the stimulus- response relationship was an easy idea to invent and hang on to. For the scientifically minded people of the day its great advantage was that its definition was almost exactly that of Newton's third law of motion. Having been refined by time, the definition of the stimulus-response assumption, given by Leonard Troland in The Psychologies of I93o, reads: "The exact relationship which exists between a given stimulus and the motor reaction which it sets off" (Murchison 1930, p. 460). Newton's third law of motion reads: "To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction." Then, for science, the really significant statement from Troland: In stimulus-response theory, "the reaction is a mathematical function of the stimulus" (p. 461). We have a science-a science that is still abusing children and bemusing teachers. Troland's distinction is perfectly illustrated by R. E. Silverman's example: "It is of little value for a student to learn the name of Napoleon Bonaparte unless he can give the response in the presence of such relevant stimuli as-'Who was the powerful Emperor of France during the first decade of the nineteenth century?' The question, in this case, is the stimulus that sets the occasion for [sets off] the response" (1974, p. 65). The stimulus-response is Kant's thing-in-itself, like the irrel- evant tasks on a standardized test. With respect to the contribution of the stimulus-response theory to education, Donald Snygg, one-time president of the educational division of the American Psychological Association, wrote as follows: "For fifty years [the stimulus-response theory] has almost monopolized the facilities of the experimental laboratories and during that time this theory has not led to the invention of a single educational technique which was not already in</page><page sequence="6">328 W. R. WEES/CTN use and originally derived from the prescientific folk theories of exercise, reward and punishment" (1966, p. 82). And I would add: "On the contrary, it has done incalculable harm." Take Thorndike's laws of learning: 1. Thorndike in his materialism said that the teacher runs the talk down the sensory nerve to jump the synapse so that the same words excite the motor nerves that start the vocal apparatus to repeat what the teacher said. The teacher's trick is to repeat the performance often enough to break down the resistance of the synapse so that the response becomes automatic. This is the Law of Exercise. 2. Obviously, by way of stimulus-response there can be only one response appropriate to a stimulus. This is the Law of One to One Correspond- ence. And to ensure that it occurs there must be no relationship among the stimuli; otherwise you confuse the motor nerves and the response is just one big blunder. Then, of course, back the poor kid has to go to the synapse. 3. The third was the Law of Effect. If the student made the right response, goody-goody and a star beside his name on the success chart on the wall. If he made the wrong response, back to that horrible synapse again, or even worse; one wonders how there could be anything much worse. St. Augustine in his Confessions wrote, "Two and two, four; two and two, four; that hateful sing-song." The major problems with the laws of learning are also three. i. There is nothing scientific about them. They are right out of folklore: practice makes perfect; spare the rod and spoil the child or what a good little boy am I; and "Jump, Fido, jump!" 2. All that Thorndike did was to justify, in pseudoscientific lingo, what teachers had always done in school since formal schooling was first established, perhaps three thousand years ago. That was why he was so popular. 3. He set up a base, completely acceptable to teachers, from which a strong successor like B. F. Skinner could take off. Just when we had thought that time had washed the relics of Thorndike down the drain, along comes Skinner with his teaching machines, behavioral objectives, and be- havior modifications to repaint the prison walls of school with his own graffiti of Behaviorism. In Educational Researcher, W. J. McKeachie of the University of Michigan wrote an article entitled "The Decline and Fall of the Laws of Learning" (1974). It has been Skinner's self-appointed task to make sure the laws don't decline. Because behaviorists' assumptions still fit almost exactly the nonsense that 90 percent of teachers call education, Skinner's "behavior mod" (as they call it) has spread like an old-time prairie fire across the United States. How long before it burns itself out is hard to say. Fortunately there is quite a strong wind developing, which, given time, may blow it out. The opposition started as a breeze in 19i2, a year before animalism blew its horn. In 1912 Wrertheimer blew the whole idea of sensory atomism with his paper on phenomenology: sensations are not individually invoked by</page><page sequence="7">INFORMAL SECTION 329 external stimuli; the whole sensory experience is the perception of phe- nomena out there; it's not what's out there that determines me: through my experience, I determine what's out there. When Wertheimer, Kohler, and Koffka put their heads together the result was Gestalt psychology, the fore- runner, if not the procreator, of child study at the University of Toronto, of Piaget's study of intellection, and certainly of phenomenological psychology today. With his laws of formation, closure, and figure and ground, Wertheimer may have had Aristotle in mind. Aristotle said, "As the hand is the tool of tools, so the mind is the form of forms." Or he may have remembered Helmholtz's "urge to comprehend." To comprehend is to put perceptions, ideas, concepts together so they fit, and the result is form. Or he may have taken off from Wundt's "psychic cause"; the relationship of cause and con- sequence is a form. Or he may even have had in mind the first chapter of Genesis, in which the old Hebrew authors found God so fed up with chaos that He got to work creating Earth and all the forms of life upon it. Where- ever he got his notion, Wertheimer, experimentally and logically, went at the job that Wundt had said could not be done: to study the workings of the mind. And that's what we teachers have to do if we are to make any- thing out of what we do in classrooms. (1) The first thing we have to do is to make a note that man's humanity resides in his power of thought. I feel silly in having to mention it-it's so obvious. But the fact is that very few teachers at any level seem to have heard of thinking. In my own experience of thirty years of schooling I had only two teachers who permitted thinking; and those two even encouraged it. They were my first teacher and my last one. For all the others in between, my mind was only a playback machine, boxed inside a human skull. I was invited to do no thinking on my own. On the contrary, I was forced only to reproduce each teacher's thinking. In most classrooms that I visit now, from grade 1 to the Ph.D., the process of so-called education has not changed. The consequences are pitiful. And so that I don't get tangled up in any- body else's hair, let me again recall my own experience. Because of the way I had been taught, I didn't do a particle of educational theorizing until I was thirty-three. Of course, having been psychologically brainwashed into a confirmed behaviorist by years of study of psychology, I was not supposed to have a mind, anyway. But since thinking is the only way to generate one's power to think, consider the loss of those wasted years in school. (2) Next postulate: Disraeli said, Experience is the child of thought; and thought is the child of action. A century and a half before, John Locke had said the same thing in his own way; and so did Thomas Aquinas, four centuries before Locke. But school people never seem to listen to wise men; or if they do they say to themselves, "But, of course, they aren't talking about schools. Schools have never been like that." Too true; and I doubt that elementary and secondary schools will ever be "like that" until faculties of education turn themselves inside out. As for universities and some com- munity colleges that I know, I have little hope. Unless the teacher, by hook or by crook, involves the student in his own</page><page sequence="8">330 W. R. WEES/CTN experience, the student has no conceptual frame into which to fit those oral or alphabetical symbols that he hears or reads. All that he can possibly remember are the words, and he remembers them only long enough to get some sort of grade on the examination paper that he writes. Starting with Ebbinghaus, a host of research papers prove the point. For me, the main proof is my own experience. For six years, a long, long time ago, I taught psychology to student teachers, practicing teachers, and student nurses. (I almost forgot the policemen.) For a while I used to evaluate my teaching with posttests a couple of months after examinations; but the results were so discouraging I stopped testing. I was losing my self- respect. All that anybody could ever remember was my little story about Pavlov's dog. So I stopped teaching, too, and began thinking. (3) Our third postulate, or at least some aspect of it, could be picked up from the words of wise men almost anywhere along the time-line of the ages, beginning with Solomon. For references, we'll select the two that we have mentioned, Aristotle for the ancients and Wertheimer for the modems. Both defined the function of the mind as formation-making form-and since nobody can do anybody else's thinking for him, obviously the one responsibility of the teacher (and the only one) is to help the student in the formation process-formation of his world and formation of his self. There are three aspects of the process of formation that are highly significant in our teaching. The first observation we are bound to make is that the mind cannot make a form unless it perceives some degree of formlessness to start with. Wertheimer's concept of closure makes no sense unless the mind sees some- thing out there that needs closing. Perceiving formlessness, the mind goes to work at figuring out how to make that new form. And we call that force inquiry. Inquiry is the constant dynamic of the mind, the constant urge to put perceptions, ideas, concepts together in some neat fit to create a form. In teaching, the trick is to find or to create within the student's ex- perience some sort of issue or conflict that his mind, for its own satisfaction, must go to work on. A very bright grade 13 student said to me the other day, "I just don't care any more. Sure-I can remember all that stuff they hand me, and get first-class marks. But so what? They won't let me go to work on anything that I want to sink my cerebral teeth into." The second function of the mind's exciting project of formation is to go to work on the perceived disharmony (Berlyne calls it perceptual dissonance) and invent the new harmony of form. If it is a simple job, like fitting two or three disparate perceptions together, Spearman calls the invention an idea. If it is a matter of harmonizing two or more ideas, he calls the product a concept. That's a simplistic definition of the difference between the two, but I find it a handy sort of differentiation to use when- ever I have to do a spurt of thinking about thinking; as, for example, when my students want to get Piaget's stages of concrete and formal thinking sorted out in their minds. So I may say to them, "O.K., what's your concept of human goodness and where did it come from?" They separate themselves into huddles of four or five people and within an hour or two they've worked out answers</page><page sequence="9">INFORMAL SECTION 331 by which they have more or less satisfied themselves. Going back as far as they can remember, they decide that they started with experiences of people, experiences that they liked: a little girl wiping away another's tears, a big boy picking up a little one who had fallen and scraped his nose, and so on. Following through, they decide that from a host of such real experiences they abstracted qualities of people such as kindness, helpfulness, generosity. Then their minds were freed from the nitty-gritty of ideational reality in the raw; they could fit together their abstractions of reality, they say, within their overall concept of goodness. So they think they under- stand the difference between concrete and formal thinking. In the process they also started learning how to think about abstraction and the function of that concept in curriculum development, which is the subject that we were studying. Conceptual development is the power that generates the power of thought. Marc Belth takes conceptual development so seriously that he defines education as "the nurture of conceptual invention" (1965, p. 15). For us teachers, there's a real hooker in that statement. The third aspect of the making is the mind's fulfillment. A new con- ceptual formation floating around in the mind can evaporate as quickly as a cloud of vapor. And the one sure way to stabilize it is to get it out of the mind so that the mind can hear it, see it, touch it, or even smell it. Doing the concept, performing it, is the one sure way to make it real and healthy. The universal mode in which thinking gets itself out into the open is speech, supported by language in any form. The hand gets into the act in the myriad artifacts that "the untiring mind of man" makes out of the earth's resources. One of the reassuring values in the performance of a concept is that it is quite likely to start an experientially determined cogitative cycle. The doing of a concept is itself experience. So we look at what we have done and don't think that it is good or good enough; so we start the whole process over again to try to make a form that we think may really work. This, unfortunately, is exactly what happened in the preparation of this paper. I finished the thing and, except for some undefined, niggling appre- hension, I was quite happy with it. Then a week later I went back to it, and the niggling surfaced. So-back to the drawing-board, and I tried again. The same thing happens with students in any school-if the teacher sets the stage for it. It can occur especially with students who are planning their career. They have got their sights set and they've just got to keep on beam. In any career these days the formation of success lies in the relationship between me and you. In the thirty-four years during which I had stopped teaching, I spent twenty-eight of them in industry and six of them in the army. In industry, when we were hiring anybody, we had three criteria that directed our interview: alertness of mind, sense of responsibility, and most important, the ability to work comfortably and happily with people. (An abrasive personality working in a team at a machine is practically certain to break the machinery with the monkey-wrench of his tongue.) If the appli- cant passed these three criteria successfully, then we might look for expertise if we needed it.</page><page sequence="10">332 W. R. WEES/CTN A person who can work helpfully with other people and for other people is a person who can recognize human values and put his value con- cepts to work. As with concepts (and values are concepts) the one and only way that anyone can create for himself a set of human values is to do them, to live them, to harmonize himself with others in human relationships. In industry, whether in the productive or service industries, the concept of human value has to work in both directions. In the army the whole purpose of the operation in which I served was to find each man's concept of himself, then to find an army placement for him in which he could play the role that was his own. Psychology does not seem to have done much thinking about human values. The difficulty is that you can't measure them, any more than Helmholtz could measure sensation. Helmholtz had to infer the strength of the sensation from those just noticeable differences. But there simply are not any j.n.d.s in a person's thinking or expression of his values. Some of my friends are trying to use objective tests to measure values such as self- respect. But they're in the same box as that experimenter who found delinquent kids knowing more about right and wrong than good kids do. It's as plain as all get-out that if we are to go to work on values we've got to use our heads and forget the yardsticks. Besides, as I said at the beginning, our main concern, as teachers, is not the "is" but the becoming. I don't know enough, either about the concept of value or about how to teach for values, to be able to generalize either one. The best that I can do is to tell you how I go at it. I teach mature teachers, many of them with long experience in the rut that the Romans wore into the concepts and practices of education. My responsibility, I feel, is to get them thinking themselves into education for today and for beyond today. All of their children who keep on living will be here to welcome century number twenty-one. For both today and then, the United Nations in its Declaration of Human Rights drafted the new design in Article 26. It reads, "Education shall be directed toward the full development of the human personality." So that's where we begin; and since a person is what his values are, we're over our heads in values and floundering around in them before we know it. The way we go at the task is the way of those three postulates: (a) We think ourselves into any changes in our thinking that we may make. (b) We work on Disraeli's assumption that experience is the child of thought. And we apply the concept both ways: we draw on all the ex- perience that we have had, and we experience our thinking as we talk our- selves into new ways of looking at education. If it's a small group (of ten or twelve, say) we usually stay together. If it's a large group, we break into threes, fours, or fives so that nobody has to worry about squeezing his thinking in edgewise. (c) The inquiry/invention/production triad in thinking we apply these ways: First, I throw their minds into conflict with themselves by making some obvious statement that they cannot possibly refute but that ordinarily is completely at odds with what most of them have always thought and practiced in education.</page><page sequence="11">INFORMAL SECTION 333 Second, they go to work to see what they can do with the new idea. All they do, really, is to dredge up and apply their own human experience to the disturbing concepts that previously they had assumed had no relation to what must go on in school. Third, gradually during the course the new concept-forms that they have made in their minds appear in their discussion. Then, after the course, I give them a few weeks in which to organize their new thinking, try it out in school, and write me a twenty-five page letter telling me all about it. There's nothing fuzzy about this way of teaching and learning; the course is thoroughly structured. What we are concerned about are the personal human values that are the very structure and the stature of every human being's personality. We start with the thinking mind as the basic humanity of man. When we reach the doing/making aspect we note that only through what he does can anybody know his own identity. By looking at what he does and evaluating it, man discovers his own self-worth. Self- worth breeds self-respect; and self-respect provides man with the confidence and assurance of success in making judgments, coming to his own decisions, thinking things through on his own. But not his own, either: working with other people (if we start the person soon enough) man learns the inter- dependence of man and man, learns how to make his contribution to in- dividual and social needs. There is an interesting side effect of all this. Having spent so much time thinking about the personal needs of children and youth, the teachers them- selves grow. I should have expected the change, I suppose: a person cannot spend all that time thinking about what he can do for the good of other people without achieving a new design of goodness in himself. Not antici- pating it, as always I am surprised to see how pleased with themselves those people are, wearing their new cloak of humanity to school. REFERENCES BELTH, MARC.
