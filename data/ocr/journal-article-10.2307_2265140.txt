GOLDSTICK An Alleged Paradox in the Theory of Democracy In his essay "A Paradox in the Theory of Democracy,"' Richard Wollheim outlines what he regards as threatening to "constitute a paradox in the very heart of democractic theory" (p. 79). He imagines a "democratic machine" which, given "at fixed intervals the choices of the individual citizens . . . aggregates them according to the pre-estab- lished rule or method, and so comes up with what may be called a 'choice' of its own" (p. 76). His problem is that if a man expresses a choice for A and the machine expresses a choice for B, then the man, if he is to be a sound democrat, seems to be committed to the belief that A ought to be the case and to the belief that B ought to be the case (pp. 78-79, italics in the original). It might be thought that the man choosing A is not really committed to the position that A ought to be the case but only to the position that, considerations of democracy aside, A ought to be the case. However, what could this mean but that, hypothetically speaking, it would be A that ought to be the case in preference to B if the machine zuere to be silent? But might not a "sound democrat" hold that neither A nor B ought to be the case until the democratic machine has actually spo- ken? Moreover, it does seem exceedingly odd to construe the citizens who vote for A as thereby expressing merely a preference for A over B in the hypothetical event of the "democratic machine's" silence. For why on earth should it make so much difference what the hypothetical I. In Philosophy, Politics and Society II, ed. Peter Laslett and W.G. Runciman (Oxford, I962).

In- deed, must not the supporter of A have expressed more than a hypo- thetical preference for A when he cast his vote? How could a mere hy- pothetical preference have motivated him to take the positive action of voting for A, not to mention his having, perhaps, campaigned very hard on A's behalf in advance of the vote? It takes a non-hypothetical pref- erence to motivate a definite action in a particular situation, and so this imagined minority voter simply cannot be denied genuinely to favor A over B. But on the other hand he cannot be a "sound democrat" if he is going to favor A's being the case in preference to B-no matter how the vote actually goes-any time that he himself opts to vote for A over B. Or so, at any rate, it would seem. The outvoted democrat imagined in the example does appear committed both to "A ought to be the case" and to "B ought to be the case." Wollheim accordingly insists that either the two assertions are compatible, or else Democracy is in- consistent. I doubt that any of us are prepared to regard Democracy as inconsistent . . . (p. 84, italics in the original). Here Wollheim may have been a little hasty. In his book, In Defense of Anarchism, Robert Paul Wolff has maintained that democracy, and any form of political decision-making that requires less than unanim- ity, is necessarily inconsistent, if not with itself, at any rate with the concept of "autonomy" which Wolff sees as bound up with "the funda- mental assumption of moral philosophy."3 The outvoted minority, he says, simply cannot retain their "autonomy" if they accept an obliga- tion to go along with the decisions of the majority.4 2. Cf. Wollheim, pp. 8I-82. 3. Wolff, In Defense of Anarchism (New York, 1970), p. 12. 4. Ibid., p. 39. Wolff's "philosophical anarchism" (page viii) is severly limited in practice, however. He doesn't deny that one may on occasion be morally ob- ligated to obey a law simply in virtue of the fact, independent of the law's actual content, that it has been duly enacted in accordance with the relevant positive norms; and he doesn't deny that a good moral case may in some social circum- stances be made out for norms prescribing decision-making by simple-majority vote. But he does deny that the democratic enactment of any law can ever morally obligate a member of the electorate to obey it any more because he is a</page><page sequence="3">183 An Alleged Paradox in the Theory of Democracy Wollheim himself defends the compatibility of "A ought to be the case" and "B ought to be the case" in his example by saying that the former expresses a "direct principle" of the voter imagined in the ex- ample and the latter expresses something which is derivative from a (procedural) "oblique principle" of this voter (viz. democracy); and a "direct principle" is always compatible with the derivative of an "oblique principle" (Wollheim says) "provided that the direct and the oblique principles are not themselves incompatible" (p. 85). Wollheim does not explain how a "direct principle" and something derivative from an "oblique principle" can really be compatible when they issue, relative to numerically the same historical situation, in the judgment that "A ought to be the case" and also the judgment that "B ought to be the case" even though A and B are incapable of joint realization.5 Nevertheless, the solution to be proposed here can be taken as an answer to just that question. Let us set out as follows the (fallacious) line of argument that might be employed in order to get a convinced democrat to acknowl- edge that the minority position must be wrong: (i) The majority favors policy P. (2) Therefore, policy P ought to be implemented. (3) Therefore, the majority is right to feel that policy P ought to be implemented. member of the electorate than it would obligate him to obey it if he were simply a visiting alien (pages 39-40, 18-19). 5. Two other attempts at solving the problem are worth noting: that of Brian Barry in his book Political Argument (London, I965), chap. IV, sec. 3; and that of Marvin Schiller in his article, "On the Logic of Being a Democrat," Philosophy XLIV, no. I67 (January, I969). Barry's solution is essentially to propose that an individual may consistently allow his "primary judgment" in favor of A to be overridden in the light of considerations favoring the preferability of demo- cratic decision-making in the long run (op. cit., pp. 65-66). Wollheim's problem, however, was how such an individual could still be said to consider that A ought to be the case rather than B. Similarly, Schiller's basic argument is that anyone who has "subscribed to the principle of majority rule as a rule of adjudication" is thereby "rationally committed"-though not necessarily morally obligated, he stresses-to go along with the majority. It is, Schiller says, "consistent to main- tain that it would be judicious to implement B and not A because the majority has voted for B, even though A is the judicious policy" (op. cit., p. 55). The problem, however, is what precisely being a "judicious policy" can mean in that case, if not being a policy it would be "judicious" to implement.</page><page sequence="4">I 84 Phzilosophy &amp; Public Affairs This line of argument is indeed incogent and, one would think, ob- viously so when spelled out explicitly. One might well think that, for anybody but an outright anti-democrat, the only serious question would be, not, Is this line of argument actually fallacious? but rather just, Where does the fallacy in this line of argument actually lie? Nevertheless, it does appear that some, even among convinced dem- ocrats, have in fact been taken in by this line of argument. Could it perhaps be that it was something like this (not explicitly formu- lated) at the back of Rousseau's mind which led him to equate the "general will" with the common good and thus got him notoriously into such a theoretical tangle6 that some uncharitable commentators have even sought to brand him a proponent of tyranny; while it was all the time in fact a democratic, if misguided, line of argument that was leading him astray? Before considering this line of argument further, one point needs to be mentioned if only to get it out of the way at the outset. Practically no one today will be such an extreme democrat as to say the majority will should always prevail. One sufficient objection to that is the well- known fact that the majority will is sometimes inconsistent.7 But any- 6. "When in the popular assembly a law is proposed, what the people is asked is not exactly whether it approves or rejects the proposal, but whether it is in conformity with the general will, which is their will. Each man, in giving his vote, states his opinion on that point; and the general will is found by counting votes. When therefore the opinion that is contrary to my own prevails, this proves neither more nor less than that I was mistaken, and that what I thought to be the general will was not so. If my particular opinion had carried the day I should have achieved the opposite of what was my will; and it is in that case that I should not have been free." (The Social Contract, Everyman ed., trans. G. D. H. Cole [London, 1913], book IV, sec. II, p. 88.) Wolff (op. cit., pp. 48-57) seems right to identify as a crucial error of Rous- seau's here his forgetting that, even if everybody in the popular assembly does aim at the common good, so that the latter is indeed "generally willed," the majority may nonetheless fail to judge the common good aright, so that the com- mon good will then not be the "general will" in that use of the phrase in which it is true to say that "the general will is found by counting votes." 7. The well-known fact referred to is the fact that sometimes people's wants are such that, unbeknownst to them, not everything they want is in practice cap- able of simultaneous realization. The technical proof that, even if each individ- ual voter is fully consistent in his personal preferences, there may not be a con- sistent scale of majority preferences, is, of course, not so "well known," though it is indeed notorious among specialists. See Kenneth J. Arrow, Social Choice and</page><page sequence="5">185 An Alleged Paradox in the Theory of Democracy one who wants to call himself a democrat at all is committed to main- taining that the step from (I) to (2) is sometimes a cogent one, indeed, that it is so characteristically in certain crucial cases at least. And so, for any democrat the problem will remain of how to resist in such cases the inference from (I) to (3). We can see at once that this form of argument in any case cannot possibly be considered to hold good universally since, pace Rousseau, it cannot possibly be right to suppose the majority to be infallible. Such a supposition would be self-refuting in view of the empirical fact that the majority of people disagree with it. However, it is of course one thing to make an observation such as this against the particular form of argument we are considering but quite another thing to be able to specify just wvhat is wrong with it as a form of argument. The first specific objection which may suggest itself is perhaps that the word "ought"' in (2) will have to be a moral "ought," whereas the "ought" in (3) need not be. But the objection collapses when it is noticed that the line of argument given would still be just as wrong- headed as it is if we had an extra premise expressly to the effect that the majority are in favor of policy P just because they regard it as the only morally acceptable course open-even though in such a case the "ought" in (3) would then have to be taken as being as much a moral "ought" as the "ought" in (2). It is worthwhile pausing here briefly to cite three different classes of examples which reinforce the point that this form of argument, though doubtless its appeal can seldom survive its explicit formula- tion, is nevertheless, in a comparatively inarticulate form, not at all without influence on the way people think in our society: (i) Some theoretical opponents of democracy do take the line that a democrat is committed, absurdly, to the infallibility of the majority. (ii) Proponents of minority positions sometimes encounter the objection that their proposals are undemocratic just because they Individual Values (New York, I951); "Values and Collective Decision-Making," in Philosophy, Politics and Society (Third Series), ed. Peter Laslett and W. G. Runciman (Oxford, I967). In the latter paper, Arrow attributes the first discov- ery of the above-stated technical result to the Marquis de Condorcet (p. 227 n. 8).</page><page sequence="6">i86 Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs are a minority position. The reply that they are not undemocratic because they are a proposal to the majority will not be valid unless the line of argument from (I ) through (2) to (3) is incogent. (iii) Mathematical welfare theorists sometimes assimilate the social "aggregation" of individual interests to hypothetical voting systems, thus implicitly identifying the public good with the popular will in a tighter way than almost any historical or living normative theorists, however populist in tendency, have actually been disposed to do.8 It is also worth calling attention to the point that the form of argu- ment with which we are here concerned and its inherent defectiveness -whatever in fact that may prove to be-are really not essentially pecu- liar to the political theory of democracy. A democrat may be said to be somebody who holds that the rightful sovereign is the people. If the word "majority" in (i) and (3) is amended to "rightful sovereign," the form of argument will still be essentially unchanged, retaining 8. I. M. D. Little makes what is essentially this point among others, in his article in the Journal of Political Economy LX, no. 5 (October, 1952), entitled "Social Choice and Individual Values," critically discussing Kenneth J. Arrow's book of the same title (op. cit.): "Thus we can legitimately call the machine, or function, a decision-making process. "But what would it mean to call the machine a social welfare function? One would be asserting, in effect, that if the machine decided in favor of x rather than in favor of y, then x would produce more social welfare than y or simply be more desirable than y. This is clearly a value judgment, but it is, of course, a value judgment made by the person who calls the machine a social welfare function. Thus, in general, to call the machine a social welfare function is to assert that x is better than y whenever the machine writes the sentence 'x is better than y'" (Little, p. 427). By way of rebutting Little's criticisms, Jerome Rothenberg, in part V of his book The Measurement of Social Welfare (Englewood Cliffs, N. J., I96I), seems will- ing to embrace explicitly the value judgment that what is best for society is a matter of what the members of society predominantly want, however erroneously -or rather, it would follow from this position that, if the majority really do want something, then they simply cannot be in error, since their predominantly wanting it is a sufficient condition of its being best for them. As most people have surely had the experience of concluding, on occasion, that they have been mis- taken in wanting something (or not wanting something), the claim that our value judgments, collectively aggregated, are by contrast infallible will hardly appear very plausible.</page><page sequence="7">187 An Alleged Paradox in the Theory of Democracy whatever original cogency or incogency it possesses in its major- itarian formulation. Precisely what, then, is the matter with this particular form of argu- ment? It is obvious that we must succeed in finding some equivocation between (2) and (3), specifically between the appearances in both of the words, "policy P ought to be implemented." The object will be to show that a democrat, no matter how extreme, is not necessarily being at all inconsistent in believing (i) and yet still voting against policy P. In such a case, he accepts what "policy P ought to be implemented" conveys in (2), but, unlike the majority, he rejects what "policy P ought to be implemented" conveys in (3). Now, saying that something ought to be done is always logically equivalent to saying that it is or would be unfitting not to do it. In the case of "policy P ought to be implemented" as it occurs in (3), it is a question of (morally or otherwise) finding fault with the body politic as a corporate whole in the event of failure to put P into execution. But this is not the case with "policy P ought to be implemented" as it occurs in (2); from the standpoint of what these words express in (2), it is only a question of finding fault with those constitutionally responsible for the taking of such action, in the event of a failure to implement P. However, to treat the body politic as a corporate whole for purposes of finding fault is a literary anthropomorphism, permis- sible only on condition of replaceability with fault-finding couched in explicitly individual terms. The individuals with whom "policy P ought to be implemented," as it occurs in (3 ), opens the door to finding fault, are those individuals responsible for the non-adoption of P as official policy. To the extent that the polity is democratic, these individuals will simply be the majority of the people. Otherwise, the individuals in question, with whom in such a case fault will have to be found, will simply be the community's political decision-makers, whoever they are. Let "'X" represent "policy P ought to be implemented" as it occurs in (2), and let "Y" represent "policy P ought to be implemented" as it occurs in (3). The present suggestion, then, is that the difference be- tween X and Y is a difference regarding what individuals it will be a question of finding fault with in the event policy P is not implemented. In the case of Y the individuial(s) in question will be the sovereign.</page><page sequence="8">i88 Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs In the case of X the individuals in question will be those constitution- ally responsible for executing the sovereign's will. This, it is suggested, is the ambiguity which will account for the incogency of the line of argument from (i) through (2) to (3). Our interpretation of Y, after all, must allow for the fact that Y can express the way the majority feels whether or not the majority is able, or even wants, to have its way in such matters. (That is, e.g., it is at least conceivable the subjects of an autocracy might overwhelmingly give their loyal allegiance to the autocrat and be content to accept his decision not to implement policy P even if, in their majority, they themselves would have preferred the implementation of P.) It might seem that there will be no one to find fault with in an undemocratic polity apart from the effective sovereign, and that for such a case the present account must therefore collapse X and Y; and this would seem to be a defect in our account, for surely there could be a genuine dem- ocrat in such a community who dissented from the majority's pref- erence for P, and hence subscribed to X but not to Y (an individual, in other words, who felt that P was a bad policy but that it nonetheless ought to be implemented because the majority favored it). However, that our account does preserve the distinction between X and Y in this case, is still shown in the following fact: the sentiments of such an individual would be such that in the event of P's nonadoption he would find fault with both "the masses" and "the authorities"; but, if the authorities had put P into execution by way of deferring to the popular will, he would have then found fault (on this score) with the masses but not with the authorities-for then the polity would have become, pro tanto, democratic, and it would be the popular majority which then constituted, at least proximately, the set of "individuals responsible for the adoption of P as official policy" (i.e., the sovereign pro tanto). These reflections suggest the following construals for X and Y: X "Those constitutionally responsible for putting P into execution or not doing so, ought to do so." Y "Either it is the case that the rightful sovereign, being in power, ought to see to it that P is implemented, or else this would be the case if the rightful sovereign were in power."</page><page sequence="9">189 An Alleged Paradox in the Theory of Democracy What have we learned from all of this? In the first place, we should now be in a better position to evaluate critically such social phenom- ena as (i), (ii), and (iii) cited above. We shall be able, e.g., to justify our disagreement with attacks on dissident agitators for undemocrat- ically "taking it upon themselves to know best what is good for the people"-phenomenon (ii). Presumably, there should be no need to underline the necessity to be extremely careful in the handling of "oughts." At any rate, an espe- cial need for care will be indicated in the case of "oughts" which take a main verb in the passive. It can sometimes be not merely indefinite but ambiguous to say something ought to be done, without saying who ought to do it.</page></plain_text>
