<plain_text><page sequence="1">By the hunter, for the gatherer: art, social relations and subsistence change in the prehistoric Great Basin David S. Whitley Since the writings of Roland Barthes (1967), certain literary critics and now some archaeologists have embraced the notion that cultural products may be read, in the sense that they fulfill communicative functions parallel to language, and in that they may be semantically structured in manners similar to texts (e.g., Hodder 1986; Tilley 1990). There are obvious epistemological and ontological commitments attached to this textual approach to archaeological analysis (cf. Taylor 1971), taken literally. It can also be perceived more generally as an analytical metaphor, however, for surely our archaeologi- cal record is neither a text in the denotative sense, nor must an interpretation of this record proceed only in a way that is fully equivalent to reading. But that 'reading art' may be taken literally or metaphorically is more than merely anecdotal. Just as there are two different meanings of this phrase, so too does a similar tension exist between literal and metaphoric interpretations of prehistoric art and symbolic systems. Indeed, as Lewis-Williams and Loubser (1986) have demonstrated, understanding prehistoric art requires acknow- ledgement of its fundamentally metaphoric intent. In considering metaphoric readings of art, my concern is the Late Prehistoric (post-AD 500) archaeological record of the Coso Range, located in the southwestern Great Basin of North America (Fig. 1). This region was occupied to Euro-American contact (c. 1860) by hunter-gatherers speaking Numic languages, and is notable because it contains one of the largest concentrations of rock engravings in the hemisphere. It is also advantaged because directly relevant 'salvage ethnography', collected early in the century, provides a useful adjunct to archaeological data. In this study I combine analyses of archaeological and ethnographic data to build an interpretation of the traditional Numic culture of the Coso region, and to explain why people who principally ate seeds and nuts made art that emphasized mountain sheep and bows and arrows. I begin with the archaeological record, as traditionally described, before turning to an analysis of aspects of the ethnography. Then, in conjoining these two lines of inquiry, I examine the implications for art, social relations and gender amongst these putatively egalitarian hunter-gatherers, and show how the metaphor 'killing a mountain sheep' played a central symbolic role in changing prehistoric subsistence practices.

Settlement and subsistence in the Coso Range The archaeological record of the Coso Range region has been studied in a relatively thorough manner through a series of large-scale settlement surveys and test and intensive site excavations. Abstracting from a previous synthesis (Whitley 1992a; Whitley et al. 1988), the Late Prehistoric settlement and subsistence pattern for the Cosos can be summarized as follows. Late Prehistoric Coso settlement, to c. AD 1200, represents a continuation of a pattern first established during the Late Archaic at c. 1500 BC, itself reflecting a local manifes- tation of a major, far western North American-wide expansion in human population and settlement (W and S Consultants 1991). In the Cosos this was expressed, first, by the</page><page sequence="3">358 David S. Whitley establishment of three large seasonally occupied, aggregation-phase villages. These are found at permanent water sources, on the western (wetter) side of the range, at elevations of approximately 1,200m. Second, this was matched by the first intensive use of upland environments (to above 1,830m), where a series of smaller, multi-functional sites was established. These include 'residential bases', representing dispersal-phase camps, as well as special activity areas, used for plant collecting and processing, hunting, quarrying and lithic production around a major obsidian source, and ritual activity in the form of rock engraving. Subsistence to c. AD 1200 was based on a generalized hunting-gathering strategy. At aggregation-phase villages, occupied during the winter, faunal assemblages are dominated by black-tailed hares (Lepus californicas) and other small game. There is also a small but probably significant proportion of large game in the assemblages (mountain sheep, Ovis canadensis, and mule deer, Odocoileus hemionus), with surface finds of projectile points in upland environments confirming the importance of mobile, big-game hunting strategies. Paleoethnobotanical remains suggest the seasonal exploitation of pifion nut (Pinuts monophylla) sources, and of small, local catchments of seeds (Gumerman 1985). This contrasts with the paleoethnobotanical evidence from the residential bases, where seed exploitation, involving a wide diversity of species, is indicated. That is, settlement and subsistence data suggest the use of a wide-range of lowland to upland environments, the exploitation of essentially all available resources, and seasonal variability in plant gathering and use. After c. AD 1200, during the Numic temporal phase, a shift in subsistence and settlement occurred in the Coso region. Aggregation-phase village occupation dimin- ished, with one of the three villages abandoned, while the remaining two were used with reduced intensity. Exploitation of upland areas also changed: with the exception of one class of Numic phase sites (see below), upland occupation was limited to residential bases, typically represented by small middens near springs. Special activity sites such as hunting locales and quarries are all but absent during this phase. Although low Numic archaeological visibility makes the interpretation of subsistence difficult, the tool assemblages from the aggregation-phase villages suggest a shift from the earlier temporal phases: at one of the Coso villages, Lanning (1963) reported that 52 per cent of the plant processing implements was derived from the Numic occupation levels, while projectile points from these same levels contributed only 7 per cent to the site total. This dramatic reduction in the use of projectile points during Numic times has been confirmed by recent, extensive re-excavations at this site (Yohe 1992). That is, Numic phase evidence suggests an increasing importance in plant foods at the expense of hunting and game, and a more logistically organized, less mobile use of the upland zones relative to the previous phase. A similar pattern has been noted in other portions of the western Great Basin. Noting that the Numic phase was marked by the migration of Numic- speaking peoples out of eastern California, Bettinger and Baumhoff (1982, 1983; Young and Bettinger 1992) have suggested that this migration was effected by the widespread adoption of a higher cost, lower mobility subsistence strategy. This emphasized the exploitation of small seeds, and provided a competitive advantage over the greater reliance on big game by earlier peoples, as well as allowing the Numic to achieve higher population densities than their competitors.</page><page sequence="4">; X 2 E C .' o 2; E I~~~~~ -0s o Q Q ! e C.) -o2 th~~~~~~~~~~p 0 C)C</page><page sequence="5">360 David S. Whitley Coso engravings and literal readings As implied above, there is one variation on the pattern of diminished use of specialized activity areas during Numic times: rock art sites. These are very common in the Cosos, with rock engravings present virtually wherever non-vesicular basalt outcrops are found. Grant (1968: 120-1) estimated that there are more than 14,000 individual engravings in the Cosos; subsequent field checks suggest that this may be an underestimation by as much as two-thirds. Regardless of exact total, however, his counts of motif types provide a fair estimate of the themes and subject matter of the art (Plate 1). Most common by class are engravings of mountain sheep (51 per cent); followed by various 'geometric' patterns (29 per cent); male anthropomorphs (13 per cent); canids/felines (1.6 per cent); 'medicine bags' (1.3 per cent); and snakes (1 per cent). Thematically, 'killed/hunted sheep' represent 0.7 per cent of the total and 1.5 per cent of the sheep alone. Depictions of weapons, 'hunting scenes' and anthropomorphs with weapons comprise 1.9 per cent of the corpus. This emphasis on putative game, weaponry, hunt scenes, and anthropomorphs resulted in a widely accepted, literal reading of the art: sympathetic hunting magic (e.g., Heizer and Baumhoff 1959; 1962; Grant 1968; Wellman 1979). Aside from the general logical, methodological and empirical problems inherent in this hypothesis (cf. Lewis-Williams 1982), it was problematic in the specific case because it contradicted existing ethnographic information that categorically denies the existence of Numic mountain sheep hunting magic. This contradiction was 'resolved' by Heizer and Baumhoff (1962: 226-30) who, in an inferential circumlocution, argued away the existence of directly relevant ethnography on the rock engravings: if the ethnography did not support their inductive interpretation, they argued, then the art must be older than ethnographic Numic culture. Their conclusion was then straightforward: all of the art was necessarily prehistoric rather than potentially historical/ethnographic in age. Bettinger and Baumhoff (1982) extended this inference by contending that the hunting magic ritual was solely attributable to Late Prehistoric 'Pre-Numic', hunting-oriented peoples and that, with the appearance of the Numic peoples and their intensive seed exploitation strategy at AD 1200, the manufacture of this 'hunting art' terminated. This literal reading of the engravings began to unravel empirically once real attention was paid to dating. The Coso rock engraving corpus has been dated in three ways. Direct, numerical and calibrated ages on a limited number of engravings have been obtained using cation-ratio and AMS 14C varnish dating (Whitley and Dorn 1987; 1988; Dorn et al. 1992). This indicates production beginning in the Late Pleistocene and continuing through the Numic phase, and provides no support for previously suggested, intuitively defined stylistic chronologies (e.g., Heizer and Baumhoff 1962; Grant 1968). Thematic evidence also yields important temporal information, in two ways. First, anthropomorph engravings include a number of 'hunter' motifs, portrayed with weapons. According to Grant's (1968: 120-1) tabulations, 96 per cent of the hunter engravings carry a bow and arrow, which was only introduced into the region after AD 500 (cf. Yohe 1992), whereas 4 per cent hold the earlier atlatl. This indicates that a significant proportion, if not large majority, of the art dates to the last 1,500 years. Second, that the production of this art continued into the Numic phase, contrary to previous speculations, is also demon- strated by certain historical motifs. Although not common, a handful of Coso horse and</page><page sequence="6">Art and change in the prehistoric Great Basin 361 rider engravings clearly indicate creation of the art after Euro-American contact at c. AD 1860 (Whitley 1982). This is confirmed by the large amount of ethnographic data now known to exist on this art (see below). An examination of the degree of re-varnishing on certain motif types also allows some indication of relative age. Dorn (1982: 15) has noted that although the relative darkness of a rock varnished surface is more contingent upon the manganese to iron ratio than age once a surface has a complete varnish coating, a general assessment of relative age can be obtained by visual examinations of motifs prior to complete re-varnishing. A systematic visual examination and comparison of 352 sheep engravings (5.2 per cent of this motif class, using Grant's (1968) totals) from the three major Coso sites (Lower Renegade, Big Petroglyph and Sheep Canyons) indicates that fully 81 per cent had little or no evidence of re-varnishing; 18 per cent were moderately re-varnished; and 1 per cent completely re-varnished. An equivalent examination was made of 392 anthropomorphs (21 per cent of the Coso total) from the same sites, including 'patterned body', 'solid body' and 'hunter' types. Little or no re-varnishing was visible on 56 per cent ol the anthropomorphs; 35 per cent were moderately re-varnished; and 8 per cent completely re-varnished. All of the 'hunter' anthropomorphs with bow and arrow, which must be less than 1,500 years old in the region, had little or no re-varnishing. Since varnish formation can begin within approximately 100 years in eastern California (Whitley and Dorn 1987), the engravings that exhibit little or no re-varnishing can be interpreted as less than roughly 1,000 to 1,500 years old. That is, the majority of these classes of engravings appear to be relatively recent in age. The obvious inference is that the Numic phase experienced not simply continued rock art manufacture, but in fact an accelerated production specifically of anthropomorph, mountain sheep and 'hunter' motifs, that far exceeded the number of engravings made during earlier periods. That is, the seed-eating Numic produced a massive corpus of art that, taken literally at least, emphasized hunting, an activity of reduced importance to them. Art and vision quests Understanding this apparent paradox, 'hunting art' produced by a seed gathering culture, is aided by a consideration of aspects of Numic ethnography. T'he first of these concerns the art, per se. I summarize here a series of detailed descriptions of the ethnographic evidence for Numic rock art production (Whitley 1992b; 1992c). Numic rock art was produced by shamans and shaman-initiates following the altered states of consciousness (ASC) experiences of their vision quests. These were considered perilous and usually began with a supernatural test of worthiness and inner strength. They were conducted at locales believed to concentrate poha, or supernatural power. The distribution of engraving sites, then, corresponds to the perceived distribution of poha across the landscape, which was correlated with high peaks, rocks and caves, and permanent water sources. Notably, the Coso Range was thought the point at which humans were created during mythic time, and thus was particularly potent. Shamans undertook vision quests and entered the supernatural world at these locales to acquire</page><page sequence="7">362 David S. Whitley poha, usually manifest in the spirit helpers, shamanistic songs and ritual paraphernalia they received during their ASCs. Because of his intimate, personal connection with poha, a shaman was a pohagunt, 'man of power', while rock art sites were pohakanhi, 'house of power'. Some sites yielded specialized kinds of shamanic power; from other sites, any of a variety of kinds of poha, including generalized curing power, could be obtained. The ethnography is also explicit concerning what is depicted in the art: the spirits (including spirit helpers) and visual hallucinations experienced during the ASC, as well as the shaman himself transformed into a supernatural being. In that we have a number of descriptions of culturally-conditioned visions, it is possible to abstract the common ASC imagery experienced by shamans and compare it to the art. It includes: male anthropo- morphic figures; animal spirit helpers; weapons; power objects (e.g., feathers, crooked staffs); fighting/battle scenes; hunt scenes; footprints/tracks; and geometrical forms (entopic patterns; cf. Lewis-Williams and Dowson 1988). As should be expected, this ASC imagery correlates very closely with the motif types and themes found in Numic rock art. Because certain spirit helpers/trance experiences conferred specific kinds of poha, it is then possible to relate particular engravings to specialized types of shamanic power. 'Rattlesnake shamans', who cured snake bites, saw rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.) during their vision quests and, correspondingly, made snake engravings. The historical class of 'bullet-proof shamans', derived from earlier 'arrow shamans', had two kinds of power: the ability to cure wounds from, and invulnerability to, arrows/bullets. They saw images of weapons, and scenes of battles and fighting during their ASCs. Another specialty, 'horse cure shamans', was important historically as horses became important means of transportation. Horses were their spirit helpers. Perhaps the most important of the shamanic specialties, however, was weather control. Rain shamans could summon the wind, thunder and lightening, and thus bring rain. The ethnography demonstrates, in a number of different ways, the strong association between the rain shaman and the mountain sheep, not incidentally the dominant rock engraving type in the Coso Range. First, much of the rain shaman's ritual paraphernalia was derived from mountain sheep products. His characteristic ceremonial object, for example, was the bull-roarer. As noted by Kelly, 'wooden bull-roarers were toys, but those of mountain sheep horns were for rainmaking (1936:137), while 'a mountain sheep singer [i.e., shaman] always dreamed of rain, a bull-roarer and a quail tufted cap of mountain-sheep hide' (ibid: 142), indicating that the bull-roarer and quail tufted sheep-hide cap were ritual objects 'obtained' during his vision quest (Fig. 2). Similarly, he hung a thong of mountain sheep hide wrapped with eagle down from his belt or staff 'to strengthen his power and aide his spirit helper' (Kelly 1939: 160); and demonstrated his power by throwing pieces of dried sheep fat or meat onto coals, magically transforming them into 'fresh kill' (ibid: 164). Second, the mountain sheep, along with the natural phenomena of rain, thunder, lightening and ripe fruit, served as the rain shamans' specialized spirit helpers (Kelly 1936: 138-9, 142; 1939: 159, 165; Steward 1941: 262; Laird 1976). But the mountain sheep vision of a rain shaman was not simply a dream of a sheep as a beneficent spirit helper, with whom the shaman maintained a symbiotic supernatural relationship. Instead, 'It is said that rain falls when a mountain sheep is killed. Because of this some mountain sheep dreamers thought they were rain doctors' (Kelly 1936: 139). That is, 'a dream of killing a mountain sheep gives power' (Steward 1941: 259). 'Killing a mountain sheep', then, was a</page><page sequence="8">Art and change in the prehistoric Great Basin 363 Figure 2 Coso patterned body anthropo- Figure 3 'Killed mountain sheep' and 'hunter morphic engraving, depicted wearing a head- and mountain sheep' engravings.

Note also hunting magic, 'killing a mountain sheep' was a that the figure is depicted with bird claw feet Numic metaphor for the practice of rain (height of figure, 1 .5m). shamanism (maximum size of 'killed mountain sheep', 1.1I m; height of 'hunter', 29cm). metaphor for the acquisition and application of a particular kind of shamanistic power, weather control. The large proportion of Coso mountain sheep engravings, including killed sheep and 'hunters' shooting sheep (Fig. 3), thus, should not be interpreted in a literal sense, as the remains of a prehistoric hunting magic cult that disappeared prior to the historical period, and that (conveniently enough) cannot be documented ethnographically. The majority of the Coso motifs, as the ethnography demonstrates, were graphic expressions of the visions of rain shamans that, themselves, were metaphors for the rain shaman's supernatural control over weather. Importantly, Numic ethnography provides independent support for this inetaphoric interpretation. As noted above, certain Numic vision quest/rock art sites were cited as endowing specialized poha; the Coso region was widely acknowledged as the center of weather control shamanism. Not only did surrounding groups seek out shamans from the Coso region for rain-making ceremonies, but the last living Numic rain shaman travelled specifically to the Cosos to make rain (Zigmond 1977: 89). Thus, while there is no reason to assume that only weather control power could be obtained in the Cosos, it is</page><page sequence="9">364 David S. Whitley none the less apparent that this was a major emphasis of the vision questing and resulting production of rock engravings in the region. Gender and power Although the interpretation of Coso engravings as resulting largely from rain shamanism provides us with one reading of the art, more insight is gained by examining their social context, as Lewis-Williams (1982) has demonstrated in a parallel example for the southern San. In the Numic case this is obtained by, once again, looking to the ethnographic record. But in that much of this was collected under the guise of Julian Steward's (e.g., 1955) cultural ecology, the importance of art, symbolism and ritual are diminished. Using the existing ethnography to define the social context of the art necessarily, therefore, requires a re-analysis of it; specifically, of Numic social relations, and how the engravings articulated with them. The Numic are often viewed as the archetypal egalitarian society (e.g., Steward 1936: 561-2). Summarizing from a detailed analysis presented elsewhere (Whitley 1992a; in press) however, asymmetrical social relations were established by the institution of marriage, creating a system of gender inequality in Numic society. Additionally, poha served to further distinguish and inequitably differentiate two categories of males, shamans and non-shamans. After showing how these two structures of inequality manifest in Numic social relations, we can turn to how the art articulated with social structure. Male versus female Although Numic society was demonstrably kin-based, non-stratified, and lacked leaders with rights to give orders to others, it is evident that kinship, through the institution of marriage, established a system of inequality that favored males over females, and married men over bachelors. This is apparent, following Collier's (1988) model of marriage and inequality in classless societies, when it is recognized that inequalities are expressed not only in the rights held by individuals, but equally by the differing obligations they maintain. For the Numic these were most dramatically expressed by the sexual division of labor and the subsistence obligations these entailed; through differing access to means of production; in forms of circulation within the family, as opposed to outside the family; and in social discourse. Numic men were solely responsible for big-game hunting. Women were the suppliers of gathered plant foods and small (captured) game, such as rabbits and rodents. Little or no specialization in craft was practiced, so that each individual made his own tools and implements. Meat obtained by a male was communally shared, guaranteeing that all inhabitants of a camp would have access to some large game. Gathered plant foods and the other subsistence products of the woman, in contrast, were reserved for her immediate family, were not considered a commodity (Park 1938: 68), and therefore were not traded. The implications of this sexual division of labor and pattern of circulation are extreme. Women's subsistence activities were the primary contributors to diet and, except in winter, had to be conducted daily. Male hunting was less important, uncertain in its returns, and</page><page sequence="10">Art and change in the prehistoric Great Basin 365 could be undertaken less frequently, if at all. Women, in other words, did not need husbands, because the division of large game in a camp guaranteed them some portion of this meat; they were economically independent. Marriage, however, tied them to a relatively strict plant-gathering regimen, as well as burdening them with primary responsibilities for child care, and the hauling of water and firewood. For the male, in contrast, a wife was necessary to obtain a steady supply of dietary staples; the only alternative was to accrue obligations to other married males (usually by entering into a polyandrous marriage, and temporarily sharing a wife). Marriage was thus necessary for a man to be independent of other men and, given that hunting was optional, it did not burden him with any obligations he did not already hold. Marriage, then, resulted in an asymmetrical division of obligations that released men from duties, as well as potential obligations to other men, while tying women to them. Moreover, although women were not necessarily considered inferior to men, the prescribed Numic means for acquiring and maintaining respect, prestige and ultimately authority essentially excluded them from it. Prestige, for example, was measured by the number of wives a person could obtain and hold, and discourse emphasized masculine traits and accomplishments, to the complete exclusion of feminine activities and undertakings, as hallmarks of success. Since success was exclusively defined in masculine terms, causality was necessarily linked to male activities and attributes, and feminine skills like gathering and child-rearing were devalued. And shamanistic power, believed the key to all success and authority, was inimical to menstrual blood, thereby effectively excluding women from prestige. Given that the concept of femininity was then unelaborated among the Numic (cf. Collier 1988: x), it is apparent that women were the objects of prestige, not the subjects of it. As implied above, marriage also established an asymmetrical relationship between groups of men: husbands and bachelors. Since prestige was in part measured by the number of wives a man maintained, and because marriages were brittle and often short-lived, conflicts over women were a major source of Numic social disruption. Bachelors were, by definition, men looking for women; due to the fact that divorce threatened a man's independence from other men, bachelors were then seen by husbands as competitors over women. This had one important outcome. Although the Numic lacked leaders with the power to dominate and order all others, it is nonetheless true that authority, the ability to influence, convince and/or coerce fellow men towards a desired action, existed and was prized. This was obtained by senior men who had gained prestige and demonstrated their trustworthiness to their cohorts. Trust resulted in part when it was recognized that another male was not in competition for one's women. Until bachelors married, in other words, they were considered the consummately untrustworthy members of Numic society. Marriage, then, in structuring men's relationships with other men, enabled men to become political actors and, in a reversal of Numic conceptions of causality, allowed them to accrue prestige. Shamans versus non-Shamans Marriage structured one kind of relationship between men, but access to supernatural power created an additional asymmetrical relationship, pertaining specifically to the</page><page sequence="11">366 David S. Whitley incipient forms of political leadership present among the Numic. Although the Numic are often conceived as egalitarian and as representing the base-line stage in human sociopolitical evolution, it is nonetheless true that authority and leadership were invested in particular individuals. Typically this was limited to the village or band level, although leadership for occasional district-wide communal activities (e.g., ceremonial fandangos, raiding parties) was exercised when needed. The most common leader, though, was the village or band headman. He was a 'man of influence who "told his people what to do and where to hunt" - who entertained visitors at camp, interviewed thiefs [sic] and directed [the] return of stolen property' (Kelly 1932: 182). His authority also covered hunts, dances, war and ceremonies; he kept himself informed about seasonally-available plant resources, and was responsible for organizing group gathering forays (Steward 1938: 246-7). The headman ruled at the will of the people, in the sense that allegiance was by residential preference: the dissatisfied could simply change their village and ally themselves with a new headman if unhappy with their existing conditions. There were limits, then, to the authority of the headman, and his power was constrained by the fact that he ruled by achieving consensus rather than by exercising dictatorial prerogatives. Still, the headman served as the organizational nexus for Numic society, in terms of both ceremonial and subsistence activities, and represented the pinnacle of prestige within the male population. Thus, although the headman did not accumulate wealth over and above his fellow villagers, this was not due to some inflexibly egalitarian social structure, but because stockpiling material wealth was maladaptive for these nomadic peoples (Park 1938:68). The critical point of this is that headmen were, almost invariably, shamans (Park 1938: 67, 103; Steward 1938: 82, 88, 159; Harris 1940: 59, 77; Whiting 1950: 22; Laird 1976: 28). It is important then to note that shamanism was largely hereditary (Lowie 1924: 294; Kelly 1932: 191, 1939: 161; Driver 1937: 141; Park 1938: 22; Harris 1940: 70; Steward 1943: 282; Whiting 1950: 31; Malouf 1974: 81; Laird 1976: 19, 35); as was village headmanship (Kelly 1932: 183; Steward 1938: 82). Thus, although the Numic may represent the most egalitarian society known to anthropology, it is nonetheless true that a certain degree of incipient hereditary social differentiation existed among them. Not all shamans, however, were headmen; any individual theoretically could receive a spontaneous shamanistic 'calling'. Like the headmen, though, their poha gave them a considerable amount of prestige and influence. According to Park, shamans, whether headmen or not, were 'very influential in every aspect of the political and social life' (1938: 103). In fact, Numic cultural logic specified that it was exactly the possession of supernatural power that allowed success, whether measured in health and long life, status, hunting skills, or the acquisition of numerous wives: poha enabled a man to become an 'outstanding member' of society and, by the same logic, success was taken as a de facto demonstration of shamanistic power. Thus, as Kelly (1936: 134) noted, people 'are always jealous of an older man and think he must be a doctor [i.e., shaman]. They cannot understand how he has lived so long. . Although marriage served to structure the relationship between husbands and bachelors, individuals' perceived relationships to supernatural power served as a deeper foundation for these relationships. It was only through the acquisition of shamanistic</page><page sequence="12">A rt and change in the prehistoric Great Basin 367 power that men could truly become political actors, and gain prestige and status in Numic society. In turn, this advantaged them in a number of ways: women desired such1 men as preferred marriage partners (Whiting 1950: 100), and the population at large respected them, largely out of fear of their potentially malevolent poha (Park 1938: 69). And in that shamanistic power was partly inherited, but in any case limited to a small segment of the population (estimated at about 2 per cent by Harris 1940: 102 and Whiting 1950: 28), it is apparent that a very restricted, incipient 'elite' group, comprised of shamans/headmen, existed within the ostensibly egalitarian Numnic society. Art, ideology and social relations As stated at the outset, my goal has been to explain the apparent paradox by which principally seed and nut eating peoples made art emphasizing mountain sheep, bows and arrows, 'hunters' and male anthropomorphic figures; and to explain in a larger sense the workings of Numic society. My perspective is informed, however, by a cognitive, not behaviorist, theory of culture (cf. Whitley 1992a: 60). Thus, I seek explanation in cognitive cultural systems, rather than simply in adaptive behavioral responses. The articulation between culture and society then results because of the inherently ideological, albeit conservative, nature of culture (cf. Keesing 1987: 161). That is, culture can be defined as a cognitive system of beliefs and worldview. Recognizing that, even in classless societies, culture in part serves an ideological purpose by masking the real nature of social relations and thereby supports the status quo, it is then apparent that the articulation of art and social relations occurs within a larger cultural system of ideological symbols. How the Coso rock engravings relate to Late Prehistoric and especially Numic subsistence patterns, as well as Numic social relations, can then be reconstructed as follows. The Late Prehistoric but Pre-Numic (pre-AD 1200) occupation of the Coso region involved a generalized, mobile hunting and gathering strategy. With the transition to a less mobile, seed-oriented gathering economy at c. AD 1200, it must be inferred that the then-existing social relations were, at least, threatened: the increasing emphasis on foods supplied by women and diminished importance of game hunted by men had the potential to change gender relations. In particular, this change made women effectively indepen- dent economically. And since male independence (from other males) was predicated on marriage and the resulting control of a woman's gathered foodstuffs, this increased men's dependence on women and marriage. While there could have been a series of solutions to avert the potential social disruption that might have resulted by this changing subsistence pattern, the archaeological evidence suggests that a response in the Cosos involved a dramatic increase in the production of rock engravings. As noted previously, a majority of certain key classes of engravings appear to have been made in roughly the last 1,000 years. These are the mountain sheep, anthropomorph, weapons and 'hunter' motifs; i.e., those engravings that are literally read as pertaining to a sympathetic hunting magic cult. But as we know from the ethnography, no such cult existing among the Numic. Instead, as the ethnography also demonstrates, these motifs were metaphors for the shaman and his relationship with the supernatural world, while the mountain sheep - the dominant engraving in the region - specifically was</page><page sequence="13">368 David S. Whitley associated with the rain shaman. That is, the changing subsistence system in the western Great Basin appears to have precipitated a dramatic increase in weather control shamanism. The adaptive logic for this is straightforward. Rain shamans called the wind to bring rain clouds. In turn, following Numic cultural logic, this served an important purpose: to enable plants to grow during periods of drought (Harris 1940: 60; Zigmond 1977: 88). As Kelly noted: 'When the ground was parched and food plants were withering, the [rain] shaman sang night and day, accompanied at times by the people. He dreamed and told the rain, "We need moisture so that the seeds will grow"' (1939: 159). And, of course, when the rain shaman dreamed to bring the rain, he dreamed of killing a mountain sheep, as recorded in the rock engravings of the Coso Range. The response to the threat to established gender relations precipitated by the change in subsistence, then, was to emphasize male - specifically, the male shaman's - control over women's plant gathering activities. In a region of extreme aridity, it was the rain shaman who brought the rain and, by controlling nature, caused the seed plants to grow. It is also apparent, however, that all of the symbols of the shaman are masculine. Completely absent in the Coso engravings are representations of women's crafts and utensils (e.g., basketry) or, for that matter, their product: the plants they gathered and that served as the staples of diet. Male shamans controlled women's plant gathering, then, not because they controlled plants and the ritual symbols of women. Instead, it was because of their relationship with an important part of the world of men, the supernatural, from which they obtained poha, as symbolized metaphorically by hunting mountain sheep; and due to their control of the symbols of men - hunted game and weaponry. Women's plant gathering, in other words, was only possible when the importance of male hunting was valorized and ritualized. The shaman thus demonstrated his importance to women's subsistence activities by metaphorically killing a mountain sheep and by recording this supernatural act in rock art, as well as emphasized the continuing importance of male hunting, in general, by the selective use of these literal masculine symbols. In this sense, parallels with Lewis-Williams's (1982) analysis of the social context of southern San rock art are immediately apparent. Not only did the Numic shaman control nature through his rain rituals, and thereby directly aid the material reproduction of society, but he also fostered the stability of Numic social relations. In this case it was by maintaining the established gender asymmetry, by re-affirming the dominance of males even in the face of the changing importance of the sexes's differing contributions to diet. But as I have emphasized earlier, Numic social relations did not solely consist of an asymmetrical relationship between the sexes. Also present, and equally requiring explanation, was an asymmetry between groups of males: those with and those without poha. This is particularly important because, given the correlation between political and shamanistic power, in the origin of this distinction lies the origin of the incipient political organization of the Numic. My contention is that changing subsistence practices, and thus the potential for changing social relations between the genders, precipitated an alteration in the relationships between males. The asymmetrical relationship between men and women was maintained, even in the face of changing contributions to diet, by an acceleration in shamanistic activities, as recorded in the art. But this was not without cost for the males as a whole. By</page><page sequence="14">Art and change in the prehistoric Great Basin 369 allowing the emergence of shamans as part-time ritual specialists, responsible for maintaining the position of men in relation to women, the males effectively laid the stage for the emergence of asymmetrical relationships between men. This favored those with poha - the shamans - over those without, as measured by prestige, respect, authority and, in some sense (given their enhanced desirability to women), increased access to females. Moreover, given their ownership of esoteric knowledge, shamans were advantaged at a fundamental level: their access to the supernatural enabled them not only to cure (and cause) disease, and thereby exercise some social control through fear, but more generally enabled them to manipulate the workings of the universe to their own benefit. And, of course, since political authority was homologuous with shamanistic power, and because both were at least in part inherited, the emergence of incipient political organization was the immediate result. Although speculative, there is archaeological support for this reconstruction. Given that village/band headmen were responsible for scheduling and directing subsistence activities, it follows that the appearance of these political functionaries should correlate with observable changes in subsistence organization; specifically, with an increase in the logistical organization of hunting and gathering. As noted earlier, and in addition to the obvious increase in rock art ritual during Numic times, the transition from Pre-Numic generalized foraging to Numic seed-oriented subsistence involved a dramatic reduction in the number of small, specialized activity sites, in favor of upland residential bases. Apparently, the transition to the Numic subsistence pattern involved just the kinds of logistical changes the emergence of incipient political organization would be expected to have precipitated. Finally, if the status quo domination of men over women required ideological support, it follows that the emerging asymmetry of shaman-cum-headman over other males also necessitated ideological bolstering. This was provided in two ways. In part it resulted from the shaman's use of exclusively masculine symbols. By emphasizing such metaphors as killing mountain sheep to make rain, the shaman underscored the relationship of the supernatural to male activities, as well as the importance of men to social relations and subsistence in general, thereby mediating the disparity in authority, prestige and respect between him and other males. Further, cultural perceptions held that all success and authority resulted from poha. Since the receipt of this power was believed somehow to be predicated on the independent agency of the supernatural world in its own right, then the distinction between males was, in a sense, cosmically ordained: power was believed to 'select' its recipient, while belief in the inherently dangerous nature of the vision quest apparently stymied most males from seeking power without a previous 'calling'. Thus, ethnographic informants consistently stated that anyone could be a shaman or a headman, even when ethnographic genealogies systematically demonstrate that shamanism and political authority ran, patrilineally, in family lines. Conclusion One general point needs be emphasized in concluding this reading of the rock engravings of the Coso Range, particularly in light of Julian Steward's (1938: 46) oft-cited contention</page><page sequence="15">370 David S. Whitley that Numic culture was principally 'gastric' in character. This is that subsistence change is not simply a mechanical or even evolutionary alteration in diet, as much of our recent archaeological literature might suggest. A subsistence system is, after all, a conceptual entity, only indirectly expressed in the archaeological record, that is based on cultural perceptions of food preference, sexual divisions of labor, decisions about scheduling, selections between competing resources, social organization, and so on (cf. Levi-Strauss 1969; Hastorf and Johannessen 1993). It is actualized neither solely by hunger, then, nor only through competition with other members of an ecosystem, but by negotiated commitments from various groups in society. To divorce these cognitive aspects from the analysis of subsistence, thus, can only result in something very different: a study of the physical act of eating - bodily movement and digestion. Moreover, subsistence change can require larger cognitive adjustments, exactly because it can result in changing social relations between groups in a society. Just such a change is evident in the Coso engravings, with the transition from a generalized foraging to more specialized seed-oriented subsistence, and the potential disruption in social relations that this could have engendered. To study subsistence change, then, is to commit to the study of prehistoric cognition, something many materialist archaeologists have been reluctant to admit. But as I hope I have demonstrated here, understanding subsistence change requires an understanding of prehistoric culture, a cognitive system of beliefs and worldview, and the study of art and symbolism more generally are a necessary adjunct in such an endeavor.

By the hunter, for the gatherer: art, social relations and subsistence change in the prehistoric Great Basin The western Great Basin witnessed a transition from generalized hunting and gathering to a strategy emphasizing seed gathering at c. AD 1200. This was matched by accelerated production of ritual art: rock engravings, depicting big game and hunters. To explain this paradox, seed gatherers creating hunters' art, I examine directly relevant ethnography to show that the art concerns an application of a shaman's power: killing a mountain sheep was a metaphor for making rain. This was increasingly important with a seed-oriented economy but, siiice subsistence is more than diet, involving things like the sexual division of labour, it has implications for social relations. An examination of these shows two systems of inequality: men over women, and shamans over non-shaman males. The increase in male-oriented ritual art with subsistence change can then be understood in terms of ideological efforts to maintain gender asymmetries, and the growing forms of incipient political organization present in this region.</page></plain_text>
