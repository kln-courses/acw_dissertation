<plain_text><page sequence="1">find that buffalo apparently do not take account of predation when selecting grazing patches, and that there is no evidence to suggest that there is any effort to time activity patterns to avoid predator activity; all this in spite of the fact that nearly 88% of adult and subadult animals end up as a lion's meal! The author extends his consideration of social behaviour in this species by looking at cognition, intel- ligence and decision-making. Inclusion of such a con- sideration may be seen as potentially disastrous in 'credibility terms since it becomes all too easy to fall into the twin pitfalls of anthropomorphism and anec- dote. Prins, however, manages to keep this discussion firmly in the field of behavioural ecology by con- sidering this in terms of adaptive significance of the species' social evolution. By stressing the variation of individual buffalo within the herd from the general advantages of the 'average' group member, he high- lights the social inequality which exists between indi- viduals and leads into the concept of the herd as a means by which behavioural adjustments of indi- viduals may be a response to information garnered from the behaviours of conspecifics. In all, this is a highly informative and easily read- able text which makes an excellent companion to, and extension of, the earlier work of Grimsdell (1969) and Sinclair (1977), and helps dispel many of the old myths propagated by white hunters about this animal.

EDITORIAL ANNOUNCEMENT Winner of the Charles Elton Young Investigator's Prize for 1995 We record that the winner of the Charles Elton Young Investigator's Prize for 1995, announced at the AGM meeting in Sheffield in December, was Mr Gareth Russell. Gareth Russell's paper, 'A century of turnover: community dynamics at three timescales' (Vol. 64, pp. 628-641) with Jared Diamond, Stuart Pimm and Timothy Reed arose from his PhD programme currently being conducted at the University of Tennessee. The paper aims to develop a model of how the observed turnover of bird communities changes with the interval over which they are censused. It is the first such model to incorporate the effect of a non-equilibrium number of species. The model fits well the data from 13 small British and Irish islands and suggsts two, asymptotic components to turnover that are important over different timescales. Gareth will graduate in May of this year, after which he will be taking up a post-doctoral position. For 2 years, he will be spending 8 months of the year at the newly formed National Centre for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis at UC Santa Barbara, and 4 months of the year at the Centre for Population Biology at Silwood Park in the UK. ? 1996 British Ecological Society, Journal of Animal Ecology, 65, 398-400 400 Book Reviews</page><page sequence="2">"This is an exciting, significant, and important work. .. ." -The Quarterly Review of Biology New in paperback With a new introduction by the author Adaptation and Natural Selection A Critique of Some Current Evolutionary Thought GEORGE C.

In this new book, experts from the Institute of Marine Research in Bergen synthesize our current understanding of both basic and applied fish behaviour and, in light of the many advances of recent years, examine the influence of fish behaviour on fish capture and abundance estimation. Marine Fish Behaviour in Capture and Abundance Estimation is an essential source of up-to-date and topical information and practical, professional guidance for fisheries technologists, gear manufacturers, fisheries researchers, and fishermen. 60 illustrations, 256 pages.

SUTHERLAND The British Ecological Society was founded in April 1913, when it replaced the British Vegetation Com- mittee (founded in 1904). The objects of the Society are to advance the education of the public and to advance and support research in the subject of ecology as a branch of natural science, and to disseminate the results of such research. It does this by publishing the Journal of Ecology, the Journal of Animal Ecology, the Journal of Applied Ecology, Functional Ecology and a Bulletin for members, and by holding regular meetings and symposia on subjects of current ecological interest. At present these are held in December, March or April, and July, in various places. The meeting in March or April is a symposium and that in July is devoted primarily to excursions to places of ecological interest. Additional meetings are organized by six specialist groups. MEMBERSHIP of the Society is open to all, whether or not they reside in the British Isles, who are genuinely and personally interested in Ecology and wish to receive the Society's journals for their own use. The minimum subscription for ordinary membership for 1996 is ?19.50, due on 1 January, and this entitles members to attend the meetings and make use of other facilities that the Society may offer, to vote in the election of Council and Officers and to be eligible for election to Council and Office. For a subscription of ?34.50 (?59.50) members may receive one journal, for ?49.50 (?74.50) two journals, for ?64.50 (?89.50) three journals and for ?79.50 (?104.50) all four journals (rates in parentheses are for copies on CD-Rom). Student membership is available at ?8.00 (no journal), ?15.50 (one journal), ?23.00 (two journals), ?30.50 (three journals) and ?38.00 (four journals), the equivalent CD-Rom rates for students being ?40.50, ?48.00, ?55.50 and ?63.00, respectively. There is a discount of ?1.00 for those paying by Direct Debit. These rates apply to the United Kingdom. Separate rates apply to the USA and there are concessionary rates for Eastern Europe (including the former USSR) and Africa (excluding South Africa).
