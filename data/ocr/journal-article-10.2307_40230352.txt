<plain_text><page sequence="1">CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Volume I, Number 3, March 1972 Ways and Means ANNETTE C. BAIER, Carnegie-Mellon University In this paper I shall give reasons for rejecting one type of analysis of the basic constituents of action, and reasons for pre- ferring an alternative approach. I shall discuss the concept of basic action recently presented by Alvin Goldman,1 who gives an in- teresting version of the sort of analysis I wish to reject. Goldman agrees with Danto2 that bodily movements are basic actions, and his definition of 'basic' resembles Danto's fairly closely. What is new is a useful concept of level-generation between actions, which Goldman uses both in his recursive definition of action (45) and in his definition of a basic action (67, 72), as one whose performance does not depend on level-generational knowl- edge. In brief, an action is an event which is level-generated by or capable of level-generating another action, and a basic action is one which is not level-generated by any other action. I shall examine this concept of level-generation, and point out incoherences I think endemic to views of this sort.3 In the last part of the paper I shall indicate the direction in which a more satisfactory account of basic action is to be sought. The cri- terion of basicness I shall sketch will select as basic actions not bodily movements, but a more interesting class of actions, and one whose demarcation can help us see the relation between actions and intentions, and the differences between intentions and other states of mind. I. Level-Generation Level-generation is the relation whose converse is usually ex- pressed by the preposition 'by'. If I signal by raising my hand, 1 Alvin I.

Goldman's defini- tion of level-generation (45) specifies that there be a set of con- ditions such that the lower level action, performed in these condi- tions, constitutes a case of the higher level action, for one agent at one time. In the case of signalling, the conditions whose satisfaction makes the hand-moving into a signalling are the conventions decreeing what counts as a signal. In other cases the conditions may be causal, as when by raising my hand I knock over the vase, or "simple" (involving contextual conditions, but not rules) as when by signalling I carry out my intentions, or augmentative, as when my hand-raising is also a clumsy hand-raising. I share Goldman's doubts concerning the details of this list of types of level-generation, especially about the in- clusion of augmentative generation, which cannot be expressed with the preposition 'by' (I do not raise my hand clumsily by raising it, nor the reverse), But I consider his recognition of a variety of sorts of dependence between actions to be one of the main strengths of Goldman's position, making it an improvement over the views of Danto and Chisholm,4 in which all types of dependence between actions are forced into the causal mold. However, as I shall show, there is a price to be paid for this flexibility of the concept of level generation. "A person's action often has far-reaching effects on the world, but whatever one does in the world at large must come, in one way or another, from one's body, especially the movements of one's body" (18). Goldman lists, as bodily movements, such things as extending one's arm, bending one's knee, opening one's eyes. These are basic actions, the roots of those branching action trees one can construct by mapping the level-generational links between the different things an agent does at one time, or the different ways of labelling what he does. Bodily movements are the roots both of those trees which include unintended doings, and of those projected fully intended trees-to-be, which Goldman calls action plans. Goldman defines a basic action as one which is intentional ("caused in the characteristic way by an action plan" (72) ) and such that, to perform it, the agent needed no level- generational knowledge (67). The claim that actions in this sense basic are bodily movements is qualified in several interesting ways. First, "bending the knee is a basic act-type, and so is not bending the knee" (67). Thus bodily non-movements, as well 4 Roderick M. Chisholm- "Freedom and Forbearance," in Freedom and Determinism, ed. Keith Lehrer (New York: Random House, 1966), and "Some Puzzles about Agency," The Logical Way of Doing Things (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1969). 276</page><page sequence="3">Annette G Baler Ways and Means as bodily movements, are basic. Secondly, there is a problem concerning augmentative generation. Moving the hand slowly is level-generated by moving the hand, but seems no less "bodily." One might expect Goldman simply to say that while all basic actions are intentional bodily movements, the-converse is not true. What he in fact says is that the criterion of basicness must be relaxed to allow a basic action to be augmentation generated (66 note and 72). This reinforces one's doubts about augmenta- tion generation, which seems to have more differences from than likenesses to the other sorts of level-generation. As a result of this emendation of the definition of basicness, Goldman can regard both the arm movement and the slow arm movement as equally basic, although the latter is of a higher level than the former. The third qualification of the claim that basic actions are bodily movements is the addition of the rider "unless they are mental acts." Gold- man sees that his definition of basic actions, as those which can level generate without being themselves level-generated, will al- low mental acts to count as basic. From his brief discussion on this point (69) it is not clear whether Goldman thinks they are basic only to other mental acts, or whether he thinks that trees with mental acts as roots can have overt actions among their branches. As he does not seem to treat mental acts as serious counterexamples to his bodily movement thesis, it is reasonable to adopt the former interpretation. Even so, it is worth raising the question - what do bodily movements and mental acts have in common, that fits them both for the role of basic action? I now come to the last and most significant qualification Goldman makes to his identification of basic actions with bodily movements. He is aware that some intentional bodily movements are non-basic by his criterion, and have as their base something other than a simple bodily movement. His example is the action of typing the letter "S" (68). A skilled typist need not think what finger to use, nor know what finger he has used to type the letter "S". He may have to pretend to type it to find out what finger is used. This seems to make the typing more basic than the finger movement. Goldman, from this case, concludes thathis concept of a basic act-type is "not as clear as I would like ... for the sake of simplicity, however, I shall henceforth assume that basic act types include only bodily movements" (68). He sees this move as "idealisation," useful for theory construc- tion. I am not sure how one would distinguish such idealisation from a disregard of counterexamples, but I propose to build, 277</page><page sequence="4">Annette G Baier Ways and Means on this counterexample, a counter-thesis which involves less idealisation. It is not often that one finds, in a theory, not only the seeds of its own destruction, but also the seeds of a pre- ferable theory. Before nurturing those seeds, however, the ground must be prepared. II. Bodily Movement What are, and what are not, bodily movements? Why is Gold- man sure that the skilled typing of the letter "S" is not a bodily movement, and so presents a difficulty for his thesis? Goldman does not tell us what criterion selects, as bodily movements, opening the eyes, opening the eyes slowly, not opening the eyes, while it rejects typing. He gives us a list of sample bodily move- ments (18): Extending one's arm Moving one's finger Bending one's knee Shrugging one's shoulder Opening one's eyes Turning one's head Puckering one's lips Wrinkling one's nose The list is supplemented later by such cases as inhibiting a sneeze (67), grimacing, and coughing (70). The original list might suggest that an action description is a bodily movement description if it mentions part of the body, and a movement made by that part. The later examples, however, do not meet this requirement, as they do not explicitly mention the part of the body that moves. Even in the original list, the mentioned part of the body is not always the part which moves - the eyelids, not the eyes, move when the eyes are opened. The criterion generating the list cannot then demand that a movement be attributed to a mentioned part of the body. Would we have more success if we dropped the requirement that the moving part be mentioned, and instead stipulate that a bodily movement description must imply, not mention, a move- ment in some restricted range of body parts? A smile would imply movement in the face, not the leg; an eye opening a movement of muscles near the eyes, not a lifting of the eyelid with the fingers. The trouble with this criterion is that it would let in too much. Opening the eyes with the fingers would meet the 278</page><page sequence="5">Annette G Baier Ways and Means criterion as well as does opening the eyes. Biting off one's tongue, gouging out one's eyes - both require restricted movements of restricted parts of the body, but I do not think Goldman would be happy to have these on his list of basic bodily actions. Another possibility would be to demand that a bodily move- ment description not imply any results beyond a change in the position of parts of the body. This might effectively exclude maiming oneself, but it would also exclude breathing, which im- plies air movement, and swimming, which implies water dis- placement. It would also seem to exclude smiling and grimacing, which are less easily analysed as rearrangements of bodily parts than are biting the nails or smoothing the hair, which we pre- sumably want excluded. This criterion would also let in unwanted cases, such as signalling and insulting, which need imply no effects beyond the body movements made, since the signal need not have been received, nor the insult noticed. What these last two cases imply are not results beyond the agent, but observ- ance of conventions on his part. Should we then exclude any implication concerning the existence of conventions, as well as excluding implication of results beyond the agent? I think the difficulty is now becoming clear. It begins to look as though, to generate Goldman's list of bodily movements, we must explicitly exclude all implications suggesting level-genera- tion. We must exclude implied external effects, we must exclude implied rules, and contexts. But the thesis that all basic actions are bodily movements will be trivialised, if we must exclude level-generation to define a bodily movement. The problem for Goldman is to find a criterion for 'bodily, movement' which saves his thesis from triviality. It is, however, important to note that, even by explicitly prohibiting level-generational implications, we have not succeeded in generating Goldman's list, and also to note that we could not exclude all causal implications, since we had to allow for the effect of eyelid movements on the state of the eyes, and perhaps also allow for the context of the face to get a smile from a mouth movement. It is instructive to see what non-trivial claim would be involved in claiming that basic actions are bodily movements, had we succeeded in getting a satisfactory definition of bodily movements by excluding level generational implications. While it would be tautological to assert: P: Basic actions, that is, those that are not level gen- 279</page><page sequence="6">Annette C Baier Ways and Means erated, are those whose description does not imply that level- generational conditions obtain; it would not be tautological to assert: Q: Basic actions, that is, those that are not level-generated, are those whose description does not imply the obtaining of any level-generational conditions beyond those involved in specifying bodily movements. Indeed Q will avoid self-contradiction only if the substantive thesis, R, is true: R: No level-generational conditions, that is, no conditions involving contexts, rules, or effects, are implied in the specifica- tion of bodily movements. But we have seen reason to reject R, since the action descrip- tions on Goldman's list of bodily movements did imply effects, and perhaps other sorts of level-generational conditions as well. Once we are free to reject R, that is, once we do not expect bodily movements to be lowest level actions, then it becomes easier to suggest a criterion which will generate Goldman's list. I suggest that what unites the items in that list is not context- neutrality, but rather that they are all things one might be asked to do by one's doctor, physiotherapist, or gym instructor. Once one sees them in this light, the temptation to think of them as basic will vanish. Only a hypochondriac or a muscleman could think action contexts as very special as the doctor's surgery or the gymnasium are fundamental to all others. If one wants, in a basic action, a stripped down neutral nucleus, to which can be appended the various consequential layers, both natural and cultural, which characterize complex actions, then bodily move- ments will lose their appeal, if they can be defined only by reference to such richly cultural and specialized activities as the practice of medicine, or the pursuit of the body beautiful. Before leaving bodily movements, I note that, if one of the reasons for wanting to locate a basic action within the set of simultaneous actions of one agent is the wish to get a clear principle of individuation for actions, then bodily movements could serve this purpose only to the extent that they do pre- suppose rules and contexts. We can count knee-bends and push-ups because they are standard exercises, but how could we 280</page><page sequence="7">Annette C Baler Ways and Means count arm movements? Only when the dance instructor has shown us the precise arm movement wanted can we count the number of times we have done it. I conclude that bodily move- ments can be defined and individuated only by unfitting them for the context-free role which basic actions must play for Gold- man. III. Action Trees and Action Vines So far I have argued that, whatever might be basic, on Gold- man's level-generational definition of basicness, it is not bodily movements, since they are either an incoherently demarcated class, or a class defined in a way which unfits them for level- generational basicness. What I want to argue next is that Gold- man's criterion of basicness may fail to select any action at all as basic. Goldman claims that level-generation is an asymmetric irreflexive transitive relation (21), and it must be asymmetric if it is to select anything as basic. But the very variety of sorts of dependence included in the concept of level-generation puts that asymmetry in jeopardy. For all that the definition of level- generation guarantees, an action which is causally dependent on another action might conventionally generate the same action. Level-generation is either causal generation, or conventional gen- eration, or simple generation. Even if each one of these, singly, were asymmetric, their disjunction need not be. Nor is it clear that each ihdividual type of level-generation is asymmetric. If we require cause to precede effect, then causal generation will be asymmetric (hence its popularity as a selector of basic actions in earlier theories), but conventional and simple generation can- not in the same way derive asymmetry automatically from temporal asymmetry. There seems no reason why there should not be mutual conventional dependence between actions, or mutual dependence of one sort or another. If such possibilities are actualities, then, by mapping level-generational links between actions, we will get not action trees but a veritable action jungle in which "roots" rejoin "branches" and no simple direction of dependence will be discernible. Goldman has no objection to branching action trees, or to multiple roots (34, 35), but he does assume that level-generation will distinguish roots from branches. That assumption depends on its asymmetry. A simple example shows the problem. Take the case of the man who, asked to say 'no' in French, responds, "Non." He has said 'no' in French, and, given the conventions of both languages, 281</page><page sequence="8">Annette G Baier Ways and Means this level generates saying 'non\ Equally, saying 'non,' given those same conventions, level-generates saying 'no' in French. In any case where the conventions decree only one correct way to do a particular thing, conventional dependence will be mutual dependence. We cannot dismiss this case with the hope that such mutual dependence will occur only at levels higher than that where we expect to find one-way dependence on a basic action. In this case, as in the case of typing the letter "S", the speaking does not seem to depend on anything more basic, since one might need to actually speak the word 'non' to find out what tongue movement one must make to speak it. Only if the lowest level dependence were always causal dependence would there be any hope of selecting a basic action "below" the mutually con- vention generated pair, saying 'no' in French, and saying 'non.' Does the speaking depend on the mouth movement? Is there causal generation between them? Goldman, discussing the typing case, says "his ability to type the letter "S" at will does not seem to depend on his knowing what finger movement acts would generate his typing the letter "S" " (68). He seems to think that his criterion shows the typing to be more basic than the finger movement, but here I think he is mistaken. The case of typing is a counter example to his thesis, not because his criterion here selects the wrong thing as basic, but because here it selects nothing. For surely the skilled typist does know, must know, what finger to use to type the letter "S". His inability to say, without experimentation, which finger it is, is quite compatible with his knowing what finger to use. The finger movement does causally generate the typing, and there seems no reason to deny that the finger movement is intentional, and could be done "at will," by pretending to type. Both the typing and the finger moving are intentional actions and each is done by doing the other. The finger movement causally generates the typing, and the correct typing of the letter "S", given the fingering rules of typing, conventionally generates the particular finger movement. Here we have a case of 'mixed' mutual action dependence. We see then, that level-generation as defined by Goldman is not asymmetrical, so cannot select basic actions. Mutual depend- ence occurs both when there are various sorts of dependence involved, and also can occur within conventional dependence. The same is true of "simple" or contextual dependence. To say 'non,' is, in the context of the question "What is the French for 'no'?", to answer correctly. To answer correctly is, in the same conditions, to say 'non'. f conclude, then, that Goldman's criterion of basic- 282</page><page sequence="9">Annette C Baier Ways and Means ness not merely fails to select what he expected it to select, but fails to select any actions as basic. IV. Competence I can now summarize my negative results. I have presented two arguments against Goldman's claim that bodily movements level-generate other actions: 1. The only way to demarcate bodily movements from other actions, and to individuate them, is by the use of con- textual criteria. This means that, if by 'basic' one means 'context-free/ bodily movements are not basic. 2. Goldman's concept of level-generation has the advantage of comprehensiveness over earlier concepts of action de- pendence (Danto's and Chisholm's). It applies wherever there is plurality of action descriptions. A relation used as a criterion of basicness, however, must not only be present whenever there is action complexity; it must manage to select among the actions related by it. Unlike Danto's and Chisholm's preferred relation of causal dependence, Gold- man's relation of level dependence fails to be asymmetric. It seems that now we have a dilemma. If we emphasize a rela- tion which does justice to the variety of ways in which one action may be done by doing another, we do not get an asymmetrical relation. If we fasten on one asymmetrical relation, such as causal dependence, we cannot deal with other sorts of com- plexity in action. The problem is to combine the asymmetry of causal dependence with the comprehensiveness of Goldman's level generation. Can this be done? I think it can,5 and I think we are helped to see how it can be done if we see why we want it done. Why do we want a concept of basic action? What job will it do once we have it? Goldman seems to need basic actions to be suitable effects of wants as causes. If wants are inner episodes (62), their effects must be of a similar simplicity, and movements then seem eminently suitable. Goldman says that he does not want to assimilate all causation to mechanical causation be- tween "colorless movements" (80) but "colorless movements" seem to be precisely what he wants his basic actions to be. I have no wish to analyse actions as want-caused movements, so no motive for peeling off cultural layers from wants and s See A. C. Baier- "Act and Intent," Journal of Philosophy, LXVII (1970), 648-658. 283</page><page sequence="10">Annette G Baier Ways and Means actions until each has become sufficiently soul-less to make a suitable cause-effect pair. The job I see for the concept of basic action is indeed that of indicating what is basic to action, but I do not find it helpful to say that actions, unlike other events in the world, are caused by wants. So many things- twitches, pimples, indigestion, psycho-somatic paralysis- can be caused by wants that we do not seem any closer to understanding action by classifying it as want-caused bodily movement. Goldman thinks that actions are caused by wants in "a characteristic way" (62) but he does not see it to be his job as a philosopher to char- acterize that way - that is a job for the neurophysiologist. I do see it as a philosopher's job to explore the conceptual ties between action, wanting, and intention, between competent action and fluke or miracle. The neurophysiologist cannot give us neuro- logical correlates until we have made clear what they are to be correlates for, and what conceptual structure the neurophysiolog- ical structure is to mirror. When we look at the differences between intentions, predic- tions and aspirations, between competent action and fluke, what we want to say is that the man who intends to type a letter, unlike the man who hopes he will, must know how he will come to type a letter, and how to type. He must be able to map a route from where he is now to the effect he intends to bring about. But map it in terms of what? To list a sequence of inter- mediate effects, such as 'first secure a typewriter, then get the paper put in, then the message typed upon it/ will not do, since we will still want to know how he intends to secure a typewriter, and whether, once he has it, he is able to type a message with it. What we want to get from him is an action plan, each part of which blocks our re-raising the question 'how?'. If there were a form of action description which itself implied an answer to the 'how?' question, this would give us the basic units from which we could construct action plans which could be distinguished from mere daydreams or miracle-sequences. What we need to find is an action description which could not also be a fluke description or a miracle description. I want to suggest that we have precisely this in those words we use to name standard abilities, those words whose meanings incorporate criteria of competence, which specify, not effects somehow brought about, but operations whereby unspecified effects may be secured. Not all action descriptions are specific with respect to the ability which was exercised. Arriving on time is something I may do, and so can do, but it would be un- 284</page><page sequence="11">Annette G Baler Ways and Means natural to speak of an exercise of my ability to arrive on time. I arrive on time by exercising such abilities as the ability to run, or to drive. I get the letter typed by exercising my ability to type, or by my ability to persuade someone to type it for me. To have an ability is to meet certain criteria of competence which are not reducible to success in somehow securing particular effects. To type is not to get words on paper by depressing keys with fingers. If the machine were out of order, and I depressed the keys with my fingers, prayed for and got typed results, I would have demonstrated my competence at praying, not at typ- ing. Most of our ordinary verbs, both those which name untaught abilities and those which name skills in which we have been trained, resist analysis into the form 'somehow bring about effect e.' Jumping is not somehow (anyhow) getting one's feet above the ground, but getting them there in a particular recognizable if unspecifiable way. There is a time-honored cluster of distinctions which may help us here, stemming from Aristotle's6 distinction between praxis and poesis, or doing and making. Kenny7 interprets Aristotle's distinction as paralleling his own distinction between an activity and a performance, where 0 is an activity if 'x is 0ing' implies 'x has 0ed,' a performance if 'x is 0ing' im- plies 'x has not (yet) 0ed.' If this is indeed what Aristotle meant, then his distinction is not quite what I need, since many verbs of ability seem to meet neither Kenny's test or activity nor his test for performance. If I am jumping, have I, or have I not already jumped? If I am adding, have I, or have j not already added? Aristotle has an associated distinction between actions which bring about a change in the agent only, and actions which effect some change external to the agent. This too is not quite what is wanted to characterize the difference between what I shall call competences, or exercises of ability,8 and effectings, or result-gettings. 'Competence' is too pompous a word to use of simple skilled activities such as digging, stirring, walking, but it may be preferable to 'ability' which has been debased by phil- * Aristotle- Nich. Ethics, 1140a 1-24, 1174a 31, Metaphysics 1058a. 7 Anthony Kenny- Action, Emotion and Will (London: Routledge Kegan Paul, 1963), 173. 8 G. H. Von Wright, in Norm and Action (London: Routledge Kegan Paul, 1963), distinguishes several senses of ability, and calls the sense which I am stressing the "ability to perform a certain activity" (49) as distinct from the ability to do a certain act. It is the latter which he stresses. He refers to the "activity" ability as "mastership of a technique," or "skill" but thinks that one is not said to "know how" to perform such activities, and he reserves "know how" for the ability to perform "an act." Thus he would say that one knows how to open a complicated lock, but not that one knows how to speak. I think, on the contrary, that "know how" applies to techniques and skills mastered more naturally than it does to individual or repeated achievements such techniques make possible. 285</page><page sequence="12">Annette G Baier Ways and Means osophical usage until it has lost any discriminatory power. When 'x has the ability to 0' is equated with 'x is able to 0/ and that in turn is equated with .'it is possible that x will 0' or 'x is not causally necessitated not to 0/ then the distinctive features of abilities are hopelessly lost. Since the word 'competence' still re- tains a strong suggestion of a context in which one man is critically evaluating the performance of another, it is the best word for my purpose, since it is just this, norm-governed aspect which I want to stress, in the actions I am calling, exercises of a competence. In the simple cases mentioned, these norms or criteria are not formulable, but are implicit in our recognition of cases of such actions. Since some ways of disturbing the soil are the wrong ways, if one is attempting to demonstrate digging, digging counts as a competence, not an effecting. What it shares with grander examples, such as deducing or congratulating, is its resistance to analysis into a sequence of effects somehow brought about. As Davidson has pointed out,9 the only way to force many ordinary action verbs into Chisholm's preferred action locution, 'to bring it about that p/ is to create a cognate effect out of the action itself. To cough is not to bring about anything except a cough, to jump is not to bring about anything except a jump. Even in cases where some non-cognate effect is implied, the cognate result is not reducible to such detachable effects, so the meaning of the action verb is not exhausted by listing its implied non-cognate effects. To have washed clothes implies that the clothes became cleaner, but not all ways of clothes having become cleaner be- cause of some relation between them and the supposed agent are ways in which clothes get washed, nor are all ways of getting clothes cleaner ways of washing them. Sending them to the dry- cleaner gets them cleaner, and being caught in a rainstorm while wearing them may result in their becoming cleaner. The difference between my washing the clothes and their becoming cleaner due to some relation to me, does not lie in an implied effect on me, as agent, when I wash them. Praxis need change the agent no more than poesis does, and it may change the world no less. Creating a garden (poesis) may do more for me than the mere praxis of digging, and neither implies a change 9 Donald Davidson- "The Logic of Action Sentences," in The Logic of Decision and Action, ed. N. Rescher (Pittsburgh: Univ. of Pittsburgh Press, 1966), 84, 119. Davidson's own solution is to create a cognate competence for every action description, but this is to replace pseudo-effects ('he brought about a cough') with pseudo-competences ('there was a getting, and it was a getting of the feet wet . . .'), where what is needed is a way of recognizing and distinguishing genuine effects and genuine competences. 286</page><page sequence="13">Annette G Baler Ways and Means in me. Cases of praxis, in my sense, include insulting, congrat- ulating, forgiving, and these all involve changes in the world (Heideggerian). Neither agent nor patient may register any change, when one has forgiven the other, but things are different between them. For these reasons, I do not think that the difference be- tween praxis and poesis, analysed as exercises of competence, as distinct from effectings or bringings about, can be reduced to a matter of where the implied changes are to be found. A later member of the classical cluster of distinctions of the praxis-poesis type is Spinoza's distinction between natura naturans and natura naturata, between the action seen from the viewpoint of the agent, and the same action seen, as if from the outside, as a sequence of alien states in agent-or-world.10 If we substitute a human agent for Spinoza's natura, and reject the assimilation of this contrast to the mind-body distinction, this is pretty much the contrast wanted. There will now be two languages for describing what happens, one involving categories distinctive to agency (categories such as skill, correctness, norm-directedness), the other using only neutral event categories, enabling one to list sequences of states of the natural world, including the agent. This latter language could be called an observer's language, as long as we see the observer as more like a recording camera than like a human observer. A human observer, if he shares the know-how11 of the agent he is observing, will observe the skills exercised, not merely the state-sequences. Indeed the category of correctness which I am making central to the concept of a competence, requires that there be a community of competent practitioners, any of whom can 'observe' the degree of competence of the others. Thus the distinction between praxis and poesis cannot be equated with the distinction between what the agent knows and what the outside observer observes, unless the latter be really an outsider- that is, one who does not share the competences of those he observes. The most recent version of the praxis-poesis distinction which I want to bring to bear on this discussion is Herbert Simon's12 distinction between a change in the "action space" and a change 10 c. H. Von Wright, in Norm and Action analyses action as effecting a transition from an initial state to an end state, although he implies (36) that there may be other sorts of action not covered by tis theory. 11 Perhaps this is what is meant by "verstehen," which Danto, in "Causation and Basic Actions" (op. cit. 122,125) sees to be a valuable but misunderstood concept. He sees the norms involved as needed for the interpretation of norm-free basic actions, as adding the layers which make a complex action out of a basic one. 12 Herbert A. Simon- "The Logic of Heuristic Decision Making," in The Logic of Decision and Action, 1-35. 287</page><page sequence="14">Annette C. Baler Ways and Means in the "state space/' or between command variables and state variables. Simon sees the solving of a problem, for man or computer, to involve a translation from the state space descrip- tion of the wanted state of affairs into an action space specifica- tion of operations (values for the command variables), which will lead to that state of affairs. "A problem of design exists when (1) there is a language for naming actions and a language for naming states of the world, (2) there is a need to find an action which will produce a specified state of the world or a specified change in the state of the world, and (3) there is no non-trivial process for translating changes in the state of the world into their cor- responding actions." Simon also says "Natural language blurs the distinction, because one of the main goals of learning is to dis- cover programs of action that make the connection between actions and states of the world reliably predictable and unprob- lematic."12 I take this to imply that the words which name the skills we learn, and the natural abilities we recognize, already embody "non-trivial" solutions to design problems. No wonder then that they resist analysis into the form "bring about state of affairs s," if their whole point is to incorporate our knowledge of how that can be done, where 'how' here means not 'by what succession of changes in the state space/ but 'by what sequence of operations, or changes in the action space/ Simon does not discuss the question of how one recognizes a change in the action space, as such, although he associates his contrast with that between efferent and afferent channels in an adaptive organism. Perhaps one knows changes in one's action space "without observation," in Anscombe's sense?14 I have suggested that what typifies our recognition of exercises of competence, or actions described, at least partially, in the language of Simon's action-space, is not privileged access by the agent, but the use, by the agent and knowledgeable critic, of norms or standards not reducible to the demand that there be a sequence of non- cognate effects. This may seem a negative characterization, but it is not a trivial one, as I shall show. Before doing that, I should make clear that my distinction between exercises of competence and effectings does not parallel the distinction between means and end. Simon's discussion suggests that our ends are always described in the language of the state space, our problems solved 13 Simon, op. cit. 10. 14 C. E. M. Anscombe - Intentions (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1957). D. C. Dennett, in Content and Con- sciousness (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1969), 165-69, suggests that "knowledge without observa- tion" is a matter of knowledge which has an efferent rether than an afferent source. 288</page><page sequence="15">Annette C Baler Ways and Means when we find a sequence of operations, changes in the action space, as means to that end. But for men, if not for computers, action can be autotelic, so praxis need not be for the sake of poesis. Is the distinction I have been attempting to articulate a real distinction? An exercise of a competence is defined as an action whose recognition requires more than the recognition of non- cognate effects, but the use of standards which are not reducible to the demand for such detachable effects. Cannot such standards always be invented, by mere verbal maneuvering? I have said that an exercise of a competence, such as walking, implies a cognate result, a walk, which is not reducible to non-cognate effects. Could we not also say that an effecting, such as 'getting oneself from place A to place B/ implies, not only the non- cognate effect of one's transfer from A to B, but also the cognate result, a getting of oneself from A to B? Are not bringings about cognate results of bringing it about that . . ., as much as jumps are cognate results of jumping? The answer is "no." We do not call into being a set of norms by coining a verbal noun. There simply are no ways to recognize a "getting" or a "bringing about." What sorts of transfer of oneself from A to B would not be cases of getting oneself from A to B? The only criteria for the pseudo-cognate result getting oneself from A to B are the same criteria as for being transferred from A to B. To put the matter in Simon's terms, "getting" contains no non-trivial solution to any design problem, it is not a way of securing some effect. V. Basic Actions Now I can return to the question of basic actions. We wanted an asymmetric dependence relation between different actions- under-a-description, done by one agent at one time. We also wanted a way of indicating how action differs from miraculous visitation, or possession by the gods, how intention differed from prediction and from aspiration. I think that the contrast between praxis and poesis, as developed, can do all these things for us. The asymmetric dependence is that of poesis upon praxis. An action description such as 'getting the feet wet' is non-specific with respect to how the feet were got wet, but implies that there was a way, either a wading or a washing or a hosing or ... By contrast, a praxis description need not, although it may, imply an effecting. This guarantees that whenever there is action, there is praxis or exercise of a competence, and that all effectings 289</page><page sequence="16">Annette G Baier Ways and Means will depend on competences. If the question 'by doing what did he do this?' is interpreted as 'by exercising what competence did he do this?' then, by asking it of the various things an agent did, we will be led to a basic action, or set of them. Some competences will depend on others, not just in the sense that one is unlikely to acquire one if one has not the other, but in the sense that one must exercise one in exercising the other. To prove, one must do some deducing. To insult, one must use some language. Sometimes we may be satisfied that a man has exercised some complex competence (that is, one which can be analysed as involving simpler skills, and perhaps monitored results of them) without needing to satisfy ourselves that he has in fact exercised each of its component skills. A mathematical genius can solve, without "calculating," problems which lesser men must analyse into simpler skills. Hence if by 'basic com- petences' we mean ones which cannot be seen to contain simpler competences, there need be no basic competences, since someone may always succeed in analysing out a component competence, that is, succeed in training others to recognize it, and perhaps, then, use that "new" operation as a way of teaching the now more "complex" old one. Simplicity or complexity of a com- petence will be relative to the norm governed practices of the group. For this reason, I do not want to identify the class of basic actions with any set group. A society of physical culturists will no doubt have bodily movements as basic actions, but more intellectual or soulful societies may succeed in inventing and im- parting other less hearty norms. The competences whose exercise will be basic enough to sat- isfy a skeptic that one achieved a certain result by competent action, rather than by luck, will be those which are generally shared. The magician will be able to satisfy fully only his fellow magicians, the water diviner only his fellow water diviners, that he is competent rather than lucky. Continued success in "de- livering the goods" is not enough to establish competence, al- though it would be good reason to investigate the secret of that success, to discover a competence new to one, or invent one where previously there was none. To distinguish action from miracle, it is enough to have shown that there was an exercise of competence, and that any effect achieved resulted from that. As long as it is a recognized com- petence, there is no need for it to be even relatively basic. But to distinguish intention from aspiration, and from prediction of 290</page><page sequence="17">Annette C Baler Ways and Means effects or of action, a little more is needed. If I announce an in- tention to be in Mexico tonight, you will need to be satisfied not merely that it can be done, but that I can do it. If I spell out the intention in more detail by saying that I shall fly, I must satisfy you that a plane is available and give you some reason to think I can fly it, or find someone to fly it for me. It is not enough to know that it can be flown, that is, that there is such a competence as navigating a plane. In the absence of a demon- stration, that is of actually carrying out my announced intention, I must tell you what I shall do, in steps involving competences simple enough to satisfy you that even a person of my limited skills may be able to do what the intention implies must somehow be done. It is here that the concept of relative basicness in com- petence is needed. But, even here, I see no need for absolutely basic actions. One will have analysed one's action plan into sufficiently basic actions when one has reduced it to a sequence of moves, each involving a skill which there is no reason to doubt that one possesses. The actions one intends to perform, unlike the actions one hopes to perform or predicts one will perform (for example, to contradict at least six people in the next month) must be reducible to such relatively basic moves which one reas- onably expects to have opportunity to make. One's ground for believing that one will contradict six people need not involve this mapping of a route from here-now until the prediced action. If there are basic beliefs15 on which other beliefs are based, and I see no reason to think there are, they do not provide the sort of base which basic actions provide for actions. Basic actions, in the relative sense I have sketched, are exer- cises of competence standard enough for the question 'how?' asked at that stage, to take on a special sense. If Salome announces her intention to get Herod to give her the head of John the Baptist on a platter, and one asks her how she will do it, she replies by telling us her means or method. She will do it by seducing him, and her method for that will be to dance the dance of the seven veils. If at this point we still raise the question 'how?' it can no longer be interpreted as a request for her method. She may interpret it as 'how does one do the dance of the seven veils?' and answer it by showing us, or in- structing us, or perhaps giving us a choreographic specification of it. 'How will you do it?' changes to 'how does one do it?' when one reaches the competence-core of an action, and even « Danto, in "Complex Actions," op. cit. 71, draws a parallel between basic beliefs and basic actions. 291</page><page sequence="18">Annette G Baier Ways and Means that question becomes answerable only by a lesson in the art when one reaches a basic competence - in this case, the moves the choreographic descriptions refer to. There are some other possible interpretations of the 'how?' question which can be given when one gets beyond the how of the method or means. Salome may respond to the 'how?' asked of her intention to dance, by saying 'slowly and langorously/ that is, by describing her manner of doing the dance, not by telling us how one does the dance. The 'how' of manner, unlike the 'my means how' and the 'the way how,' is not answered with the preposition 'by,' and so is less relevant to this investigation into the fundamental way in which one action is done by doing another. To summarize, I have argued that no account of basic actions can succeed in specifying a dependence relation between a man's simultaneous actions which is both comprehensive enough to cover all varieties of action complexity, and also asymmetric, unless the distinction between an exercise of a competence and an effecting is taken into account. One cannot first define a basic action and from that build up a derivative concept of ability, as Goldman tries to do. A theory of human action which omits altogether the norm-governed character distinctive of action will be, of necessity, inadequate. Norms cannot be reduced &lt;to the securing of effects, nor can they be tacked on to a sequence of events. If one sees them to be at the heart of action, and makes the admittedly difficult concept of a criterion of correctness cen- tral to one's analysis, then the basic core of every action turns out to be a move, not a movement. Basic actions will include exercises of innate competences, exercises of untaught but acquired competences, and exercises of competences we have been trained to acquire. It will include abilities whether they be natural or part of one's second nature. The resulting concept of action will enable one to distinguish action from mere process, see how action links with transaction and social action, see the relation of intention to action, do justice to the difference between intention and aspiration, intention and prediction. It may also make it more understandable that we are of two minds whether the concept of action applies to the behavior of animals, whose competences and standards we do not share, while we are willing to speak of the action (singular) of acids on metals,16 and may not be reluctant to speak of the actions 16 D. G. Brown, in his book Action (Toronto: Univ. of Toronto Press, 1968) from which I have profited greatly, draws attention to this fact, but explains it differently. 292</page><page sequence="19">Annette G Baler Ways and Means of a robot to whom we have given competences. Where we can discern a standard typical mode of operation, we speak of action and of something acting.17 We can speak of a plurality of actions where we can discern a distinct plurality of standard moves or modes of operation. In our own case we do this by recognizing a variety of operative norms, a variety of competences, but in the case of animals the behavior is too adaptive, too varied, to be described, like the acid's, as action, yet its variety cannot, without anthropomorphism, be norm-individuated, so we do not feel free to speak of actions either. Once we see action as norm- individuated, it becomes easier to see why there is action at the pre-animal level, and at the highest human (and divine) level, but not in between. These last remarks are no more than hints of lines of thought which could be explored if one sees action as essentially praxis, and praxis as essentially norm-involving. What I hope I have done in this paper is to have shown the difficulties involved in other approaches, and to indicate how such difficulties could be avoided if one takes as central the concept of competence, or prax/s.18 April, 1971 17 It is worth pondering the fact that non-philosophers rarely use the verb 'to act' except in reference to what is done on a stage, or in a law court, two very script-directed or norm-dominated fields. « It will be obvious that there is nothing really original in this sketch, which is only an application, to the particular issue of basic actions, of an approach to action I find in the writings of Wittgenstein, and in books such as Gilbert Ryle, The Concept of Mind (London: Hutchinson, 1949), R. S. Peters, The Concept of Motivation (London: Routledge Kegan Paul, 1960), A. I. Melden, free Action (London, Routledge Kegan Paul, 1961), Peter Winch, The Idea of a Social Science (London: Routledge Kegan Paul, 1958). I have also been influenced by Florian Znaniccki, Cultural Sciences (Urbana: Univ. of Illinois Press, 1955), and Julius Kovesi, Moral Notions (London: Routledge Kegan Paul, 1967). 293</page></plain_text>
