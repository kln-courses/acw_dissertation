But greater than your word is your body which does not say I but performs I. - Friedrich Nietzsche 1 Bodies are both Zombies and Cyborgs. We have never had a mind of our own and we often perform invol- untary - conditioned and externally prompted. Ever since we evolved as hominids and developed bipedal locomotion, two limbs became manipulators and we constructed artifacts, instruments and machines. In other words we have always been coupled with technology. We fear the involuntary and we are becoming increasingly automated and extended. But we fear what we have always been and what we have already become - Zombies and Cyborgs. - Stelarc 2 During Stelarc the has last been three experimenting or four decades, with the the body, Australian-based mapping its limits performance and probing artist its Stelarc has been experimenting with the body, mapping its limits and probing its potentials in what are often perceived as thought-provoking and spectacular perform- ances and projects. Pushing the body to its biological and architectural limits, the early suspension events explored the boundaries of the skin, seeing the body neither as object nor subject but rather as transformable and evolutionary matter in flux. Stelarc then went on to his prosthesis performances through his Third Hand. Here, the focus was rather on the possibilities of technology and media in conjunction and symbiosis with the body as an evolutionary and architectural being. In Ping Body and Parasite the body was suspended once again, but this time in a network of information and communication with absent agencies. The body performed involuntarily through a series of voltage-in and voltage-out impulses, creating choreographies of decentred, split, and fractal bodies. These performances of the body becoming in mutual symbiosis and emergence with its technological milieu radically question transcendental notions of the agency of the bounded self and traditional Euclidian conceptions of spatial con- figurations: 'Electronically connected and coupled bodies can extrude agency with a © 2007 SAGE Publications 10.1177/1474474007075364</page><page sequence="2">cultural geographies 14(2) body's awareness being neither "all-there" nor " ail-here ".'3 The body is caught up in a system where agency and volition are decentred and suspended, thus allowing for informational feed-back loops and machine-body emergences to enter the stage of performative, bodily action. Echoing the McLuhanian ideas of media as our extended nervous system, Stelarc argues that '[pllugged in, the body becomes a parasite sustained by an extended, external and virtual nervous system.'4 Stelarc's more recent and ongoing projects and performances include the Prosthetic Head - an artificial, proto-intelligent, and communicational virtual replica of the artist's head. The head answers (with varying accuracy and success) the questions asked and, consequently, reveals the possibilities and limits of artificial life and intelligence.5 Another recent and ongoing project is the Third Ear, the ear was originally to be placed onto Stelarc's head, next to one of his already existing ears. Due to the hazards of such a surgical and medical intervention, it is now going to be placed on his left arm instead. The ear will be equipped with a Bluetooth receiver and a microphone allowing the artist to communicate right into it in mobile communication. The speaker on the other hand will be placed in the mouth allowing Stelarc to 'hear' whomever he is speaking to from within the cavity of his mouth. As in many of his other perform- ances and experiments the boundaries of inside and outside are made ambiguous and permeable, perhaps even made abundant, superfluous: the obsolete body. Although Stelarc's work implies a re-figuring of the spatialities of the body and its environment as well as the temporalities of communicative practices and bodily performance, there has been little interest in Stelarc from a geographical perspective.6 Most commentators come from the areas of art, cultural critique, philosophy or science studies.7 Stelarc's performances and projects can be used as a fulcrum within geogra- phy for discussions on the performative enactments of space and time. The relevance of Stelarc's performance art is particularly evident in relation to discussions of the embodied subject and its spatial and temporal situatedness in the world. We argue that Stelarc's performances open up and create new spatialities and tem- poralities that carry with them a potential of creative encounters with affective, pre- cognitive, and non-representational aspects of reality, aspects often glossed over or passed by in more traditional aesthetic approaches.8 We propose that geographers should engage with his work, actualizing its potential for the subject-matter of writing the world. During the performance festival Frictions in Uppsala, Sweden, Stelarc - being the guest of honour at the festival - presented his work in a session entitled 'Obsolete, Involuntary and Avatar Bodies: fractal and phantom experiences'. We met up with the artist the morning after the session and discussed his work and the performances over a cup of coffee. The outcome of this interview is presented in the following pages. Sebastian - To begin with I would like to evoke Norbert Wiener's statement concern- ing the body and its relation to the environment. Wiener says that we have altered our environment as drastically and fundamentally that it is now time to change the human body.9 294</page><page sequence="3">Abrahamsson and Abrahamsson: The body conveniently known as Stelarc Stelarc [laughs] - I completely agree. I haven't read it, of course I know who Norbert Wiener is, but I am delighted that he makes this kind of statement, because my feeling has always been that, well I guess that I haven't focused on the culture and the kind of social changes as such, but rather specifically the technology in relation to the human body. But I always said that up until now we have designed our machines economically to better match our bodies and our metabolism, but because machines now generally outperform us in precision, speed, and power perhaps it is time to change the body to better perform with its machines. So it's a kind of similar sentiment I think and I am very interested that he said that. Sebastian - Nowadays you often hear people talking about an information overload and that the human body can't fully appreciate the mass of information. Stelarc - I think what exasperates the idea of information overload and in effect whať happens is that our new technologies generate more and more information and more and more alien information - by alien I mean information that biologically we couldn't sense in the electromagnetic spectrum beyond the human scale - so it's a problem not only of quantity of information but quality of information. So it's a qualitative problem as well as a quantitative problem. Information overload is not just the sheer amount of information, information overload is a situation where the technology expands the electromagnetic sensing of the body and hence the body has to constantly generate paradigm shifts to under- stand itself in the world. FIGURE 1 'Sitting/Swaying: Event for Rock Suspension', Tamura Gallery, Tokyo, Photographer: Keisuke Oki. Stelarc 295</page><page sequence="4">cultural geographies 14(2) Sebastian - We have focused a lot on your internet performances, the Ping-Body and the Para-Site. You could say that, although this is a problematic suggestion, the agency of the body is dispersed; that there is action without intention and voli- tion. What are your thoughts on that in regard to the philosophical dilemma of the supposedly free will? Stelarc - Yeah, these ideas of agency and intention bring up the general issue of causality as well. Not really issues that I had thought about very much until I had done those series of performances. The Fractal Flesh, Ping-Body and Para- Site performances sort of exposed the problematic of agency, locating the self under the skin. I mean we know also, for example that the body's experience of personal and public space is constantly ebbing and flowing. So in certain sit- uations bodies can be very intimate, in other words have close proximity. In other instances we are communicating remotely by various kinds of multime- dia. So what happens I think with technology is that it simultaneously extends our operational capabilities, giving us a greater sense of agency, but it simulta- neously undermines that very illusion of agency that it is promoting. It becomes problematic to situate the self under the skin or inside the skin if you can proj- ect your physical presence and in a sense connect with people in other places in such immediate ways. But the other thing too is that I think we have kind of a metaphysical history in Western philosophy of promoting the subject, of prefacing most of our statements with the word 'I', which I maintain only indi- cates this body. But people metaphysically want to ascribe some kind of intrin- sic inner essence with the T. I think it is totally unwarranted. The T in language only indicates this because of our other kind of metaphysical baggage. So we have this problem of, on the one hand feeling increasingly augmented and empowered and that is the corporate desire to promote technology. On the other hand you have techno-sceptics like [Paul] Virilio saying things like 'with every new technology there is a new kind of accident', and this is certainly something that we have to attend to. Christian - I want to follow up on that question and ask a more 'personal' question concerning control and agency. Five years ago I was diagnosed with epilepsy and I am thinking about these kinds of neurological conditions when you very clearly loose control over your body movements. I mean an epileptic fit can come about through the sound and the light in the environment and depriva- tion of sleep and so on. Do you have any thoughts on these kinds of non- human affects on the body and the self? Stelarc - Well, of course I haven't directly experienced that kind of experience and I think it certainly in an ordinarily sense to be very frightening when you have a moment of total loss of control and agency. We generally think of these condi- tions as pathological but of course we know that historically even important people have managed and for example shamanistic displays of power had been associated with these kinds of mental or neurological sort of disruptions or dis- locations. I think they certainly would be interesting to study as another means to try to understand the issues of self and agency and so on. I am particularly 296</page><page sequence="5">Abrahamsson and Abrahamsson: The body conveniently known as Stelarc interested in ideas like phantom-limb experiences and what's called the alien- arm pathology where sometimes a person totally loses control of their arm. There is this famous medical case of this person who kept trying to choke him- self. In fact they have done some studies on this and they have discovered that if a person with an alien-arm pathology is standing in front of a mirror and if you ask them to button up their shirt one hand goes to the shirt but the other goes to the mirror image. They think that there is some cross wiring between the left and right hemispheres of the brain that might be indicative of that kind of pathology. My virtual arm project was a kind of phantom limb experience without the loss of my limbs, in fact I needed two limbs to actuate the one phantom limb. So I am very interested in these kinds of phantom experiences but phantom as in phantom limb, which is a neurological and physiological experience. Not as in phantasm, this is more on the spiritual side or the disem- bodied side. I think we have to be careful about that idea of disembodiment because it is one of these experiences that technology in a sense promotes but in reality we are increasingly more grounded, pacified, and constrained by the vast technological terrain that is required. I mean to have the internet you need all sorts of computer servers, you need computer terminals, you need satellite systems; it is a huge technological terrain. However, it is necessary to perform in an extended way. I mean if I want to accelerate my body and come to Sweden in 24 hours we now have machines that can do this, if we didn't have these machines I don't come to Sweden; maybe I don't even travel from my part of the city. The other thing of course is that although I am travelling when I am in a vehicle at 100 km/h, my body is actually pacified and constrained and performing very small movements, but in doing that I am moving at 100 km/h. There are those kinds of simultaneous effects of technology that need to be examined I think. Christian - I want to ask another question about agency. For example Nigel Thrift has written recently about the precognitive or pre-conscious affective registers in relation to technology and the ethico-political implications of this; that you can affect a person without them being aware that they are being affected.10 What are your thoughts on this? Stelarc - Yes, I haven't read a lot on that except I am generally familiar with the notion of forward masking that we do constantly and so the more and more experience of the world that we have the more and more expectations are generated. This allows us to function as if the world is predictable and as if the world is a kind of smooth continuous terrain and in fact surprise is what happens when our sen- sory information doesn't match our expectations. So if I go to touch this table I am assuming I have an expectation that this is a hard surface and my finger will not go through it, if my finger would go through it I would be surprised. It is this kind of idea of forward masking that the brain through its conditioning and experience of the world generates a certain expectation that allows it to perform without having to compute and process everything in real time. I guess we perform successfully when we perform automatically in the world. 297</page><page sequence="6">cultural geographies 14(2) Sebastian - This sounds a lot like an article on the prosthetic head in which you say that awareness is what is constructed when the body malfunctions.11 Stelarc - Yeah, I mean I guess what I was trying to point out there is that ordinarily our interface with the world is smooth because it is automatic and because it is made up of expectations. There is always this forward masking. The moment that one has to think or one really generates a focus or an awareness, for exam- ple if I am walking along the street and I trip or if I normally don't care about my body and then I get sick and my stomach is feeling bad or my physicality in a sense implodes into an awareness. Or if I do something like yoga or some other activity that tries to generate a certain awareness, I mean for example we alternate our breathing through the left or right nostril throughout the day - we don't equally breathe through our two nostrils and in yoga there are exercises that make you aware of this kind of breathing. I think it does question that idea of agency and that you are not constantly stopping and processing before you make a decision. Most of your so-called decisions - to cross the road or to stop at the red lights even to get up and brush your teeth (that is more of a social conditioning) - are the result of expectations that has been generated through experience of the world with your social institutions and your cultural condi- tioning. Sebastian - I was thinking about this, because, one can see this discussion here about the relationship between a mind and a body. Some commentators of your work have argued that your work is Cartesian.12 Stelarc - [laughs] Sebastian - The body/mind split, how do you approach this? Stelarc - I would say the opposite. I think that there are two issues here, one issue is the problem of language, if this body stands up in the auditorium and starts dis- cussing the projects and performances inevitably this body will start speaking 'I did this, I did that, I came to Sweden, I am at the Frictions International Festival' and so on. So it is a problem with language and if this body then delib- erately does not use T and talks about the body doing this and the body doing that, then again it seems strange from our normal language and our ordinary subjective experience of the world or our usual experience of the world. When you force me, because I now say when this body speaks about the body it means this physiological, phenomenological, operational entity in the world that is interacting, that is immersed in the world and words like ťminď and 'body' are convenient and arbitrary constructs that help us to understand or allow us to talk about something in a more convenient way. So within a small frame of reference we can assert that we can affect the world. I mean I can say now that within this spatial and temporal window, T intend to pick up the glass: I pick up the glass and I have agency. Why should you doubt this? But of course as the spatial and temporal window of reference expands then it is not so easy to point to only this body. I mean why is this body here to begin with? This body met another body called Susanne a year ago and this set up a whole series of exchanges of communication and then finally this body comes 298</page><page sequence="7">Abrahamsson and Abrahamsson : The body conveniently known as Stelarc to Sweden and then you guys heard I was coming somehow. You get what I mean? The causal complexity can be conveniently described as one of a body with agency in a small spatial and temporal window but as soon as you start expanding that to a larger time and space frame then it is a much more com- plex phenomena. You can't just conveniently say, 'I did it!' Christian - What we have been talking about now, for me relates to the idea or con- cept of the in-between, human and non-human relations, the kind of spatial and temporal relations where everything takes place. I wanted to expand on that notion because one of the best texts, for me at least, on your work is Brian Massumi's.13 Stelarc - Yeah, actually I like that text. It is actually very cleverly written and it is as critical as any text but it's not a confrontational critique. It is a critique that tries to get inside to unfold and extend the discourse. Christian - Yeah I get the impression when reading it that he understands what you are trying to do in a very corporeal way. But I wanted to ask you about what he says about the prosthesis and how you can understand it either as a possi- bility or as a potential. Depending on if you regard it as simply an addition, that you add a prosthesis seeing it only as a quantitative aspect and not as a quali- tative aspect that effectively changes both the body and the prosthesis.14 Stelarc - Yes I understand your point. Christian - Could that possibly be one of the points where it could be misunderstood as the Cartesian mind/body dualism if you understand it only as an addition, because for me what is interesting is the interface in-between and the limit between technology and the body. Is it dissolving this limit? Should it be con- ceptualized as a limit or a threshold? Stelarc - Yeah it is in the way that we can talk about these things, for example I don't think in terms of whether something has a potential or something is a constraint or is there a limit or is there an infinite extension possible. In a sense I accept the existence of both possibility and constraints, so for example with my Third Hand if I am writing one word with three hands this seems to point to an addi- tional capability. On the other hand of course it is also a constraint. You know there is an extra weight on my right arm; my two eyes don't always follow what my three hands are trying to do. So when I construct an interface I don't see it in either a Utopian or dystopian way. For Paul Virilio even if technology is OK 'out there', one of his harshest criticisms of my work is when I start putting technology inside the body because he sees the boundary of the skin as a kind of insulation to the world and as a bounding of the self, and that if this is threat- ened then our whole human essence is threatened. In a sense he is construct- ing the body in a kind of renaissance way. A body navigating a public space looking outwards objectively analysing and performing in the world. I don't see it with those kinds of positives and negatives in that sense, so I don't see technology as a polarizing event. It is an event that I accept as one of possibilities - some beneficial and some creating complications with our interactions. 299</page><page sequence="8">cultural geographies 14(2) FIGURE 2 'Ping Body', Artspace, Sydney, Diagram: Stelarc Christian - If you take Virilio for example, he would probably talk about the coloniza- tion of the body by technology whereas Brian Massumi would talk about a sym- biosis. I think that this notion of symbiosis is probably more accurate. Stelarc - Yes and the human body is also full of bacteria and viruses. What is fascinating to me is the idea that the human body might be constructed in the future not only with these natural entities but also with micro miniaturized machines. I see no dif- ference in these two things. I think when you function at a level of surface then you function at a level of subjectivity. In a way, the body has been designed to function on a surface to propel itself forwards on a surface, to feel a surface, to see a surface. In a sense the body has evolved to function on a surface and con- sequently the body feels reticent and vulnerable when these surfaces rupture, when dislocations occur, when the sensing goes beyond the human scale the body is no longer in its comfort zone. For me that is what generates heightened awareness when disruptions and dislocations and where ambiguities and ambiva- lences are exposed. I think that is in a sense how we should function in the world rather than function purely on this smooth surface of our evolutionary evolvement. Sebastian - Thinking of Marshall McLuhan, you could understand him as saying that media and technology has a potential of expanding consciousness, situating the nervous system outside the body.15 300</page><page sequence="9">Abrahamsson and Abrahamsson: The body conveniently known as Stelarc Stelarc - I think that one of his most beautiful statements is the one I mentioned yes- terday that technology is the external organs of the body. I think that is just a wonderful statement about our relationship with our technologies. Technology is an essential but external organ. Christian - I wanted to ask you about something else regarding this notion in relation to what we just talked about, this rather bleak vision of technology. I just recently saw a picture in some American or British paper, the picture was of an American soldier in Iraq illustrating the kinds of technologies that they use for example body armours, different visual technologies etc. In relation to one of Virilio's ideas that war is just another way of communicating various technolo- gies. Is it still the military-industrial complex that is the driving force behind these kinds of technological innovations or evolutions? Stelarc - Well, I think the world doesn't work in such simple hierarchies. Because what happens is that I might not have the money to develop a virtual reality system but when that is developed I can turn it into a means by which I can explore awareness and agency. The internet is another good example of military tech- nology that has become widespread in use and totally transformed in function. So, yes undeniably our political, medical, and military complexes drive most of what we would call technological innovation. On the other hand I think that part of that process of technology is the deconstruction, reconfiguration, and transformation of its possible use. Christian - That was my follow-up question. Do you see your performances as acts of resistance or as counter-forces? Stelarc - Again, I don't work in that kind of polarizing environment of political state- ments or taking a particular side or having a Utopian or dystopian view. One might articulate the projects and performances as acts of resistance but of course as soon as you use that terminology you bind it to a whole history of political discourse that I am not so engaged in. Christian - Are destabilizing or deconstruction better terms then? Stelarc - Well, I think so. These performances and projects are done often tentatively with a very limited financial means. Sometimes taking very long periods, I mean this has now taken nine years [the Extra Ear project] and maybe it is going to happen in a few months time, it will be complete. I guess what I was express- ing too about this idea that we perform with expectation in the world is in fact that when I do a performance or a project I try, this body tries not to have expectations, because expectations collapse the world into this small, you know, performative operation, which becomes predictable and which does not need to be questioned. Whereas if you do a performance not with intention and expectation, I was trying to think of the word that I've used to counter that idea of expectation - indifference. The idea of indifference often has a negative connotation in English but the way that I use the word is that, if I perform with a posture of indifference I delay the collapse of possibilities and allow the performance to unfold. In other words I try not to get emotionally involved; I try not to think too much about the consequences. I mean if I sat 301</page><page sequence="10">cultural geographies 14(2) here thinking 'there is an implant in my arm now, I have to inject myself twice a week' and there is no guarantee that this will happen. There are two surgeons who are going to do the final operation to construct the ear, there is always a five percent chance of something going wrong. If we start thinking and doing things in this way we would not. . . I think it was Nietzsche or Wittgenstein who wrote, 'there is a point in time when thinking ceases and the action must begin'. You don't think when you act, you can think until the point of acting but then you ... so it is that kind of. . . So of course I enjoy the conceptual terrain, the philosophical ideas and sometimes trying to articulate what some of these proj- ects and performances mean. On the other hand I am not a philosopher so I don't manipulate words or texts. I don't have an education that allows me to do this effectively. The ideas that we are discussing are ideas that have been generated or authenticated by the actions and so it is this kind of approach. How can you be indifferent in the world and expose the problematic of expec- tations? If someone in another location can access my body and prompt it to move, like for example, if I had the funding I could come up with a two-way system whereby I could be sitting here and then suddenly my arm would move and perform an action or touch the person because my partner in Australia wants to feel the person who is with me. So this idea of the acceptance of the fragmented and fractal body becomes very important and the notion of fractal flesh is an interesting one. The idea of bodies and bits of bodies interconnect- ed on the internet being able to interactively generate similar loops of activity - of interactivity. I think this idea of the body not simply being located in one place and not simply located in one form, that when I look at your body now, of course the initial appearance is generally of a biological form similar to any one else in the human species [laughs], but of course what I don't see is maybe the mobile phone in your pocket or the implant in your body or the contact lens. So in fact you are composed of a much more extended array of objects. Christian - I thought one thing that you said yesterday was beautiful, this notion of the gravitational landscape in relation to your suspensions. I was wondering if this is an idea that you can see active in your other performances as well or is it only in relation to the suspensions and the stretching of the skin? Stelarc - Well, the notion of the skin both as a surface and as a boundary is interesting. I mean this is an idea that goes through all of the projects and performances. Initially with the suspensions the skin was stretched and it becomes this visual modification of the body. The stomach sculpture was a project that went beneath the skin to produce an artwork. Here [pointing to the arm where the extra ear is going too be located] I am stretching the skin for a medical surgical construct. I guess with the early performances I always saw the stretched skin as a gravitational landscape but in the more recent performances the stretched skin is a different context, but it is still dealing with the notion of the skin both as a surface and as a bounding of the body or as a perceived bounding. Sebastian - How do you see your performances in relation to everyday life where people go around with cell phones, connecting to the internet everywhere? 302</page><page sequence="11">Abrahamsson and Abrahamsson: The body conveniently known as Stelarc Stelarc - Well it's sort of... the problem is always this kind of mundane explanation or connection and yes we can talk about all of these projects and performances really being an extension of the mundane. I mean to me I see them as visual and aesthetic gestures that explore this alternate and intimate interface with technology. I mean I don't like to talk about the performances as ... or explain- ing the performances in relation to our mundane technologies. As an artist you are dealing with intense images and alternate experiences and perhaps this exposes or extends people's perceptions of how the body becomes hybridized with its technology. Heidegger has a definition of a tool where he says that, 'a tool is designed both for the world and for the body'. So for example with a saw the handle is interfaced to the body and the saw does work in the world. I really love that definition of a tool. It is describing a mundane, seemingly mundane, object but it highlights that a tool has a relationship with the world as it does with your body. Sebastian - It connects your body to the world. Stelarc - Yes. It connects the body to the world; it allows the body to interact and the world to interact with the body. I mean the world provides resistance; if you saw a log of wood it's not easy. Your muscles fatigue, unless you have a chain- saw [laughs]. Sebastian - This example with the saw relates to another point of concern, namely that of applicability. As for example Brian Massumi has pointed out there is at least not yet any field of applicability for your experiments.16 Do you see in the future if there are some possible fields where your performances and prosthe- sis's could be used? Working towards some means? Stelarc - You know it has never been a concern. If everything that I have done remains useless in terms of its utilitarian use, I think that an artist is functioning in the realm of aesthetics and the role of an artist is not, unless you are a designer, in the production line of consumer society. Art functions in excess of those utili- tarian needs, so I think that artists are more in the realm of desire rather than in the realm of necessity and needs. It is always a frustrating question to answer especially when a journalist asks it and wants to know what uses the extra ear will have, or what use a third arm will have. It is just not an issue, whether it is Utopian or dystopian, it is just not something that comes into play as an important discourse. Having said that NASA was working on a three armed plat- form for an astronaut, the idea that one arm can grip to the side of the space station while the other two arms could do work. Stuff like that. It is just not an issue that I am interested in. Christian - When I see the Exoskeleton and the Extra Ear I am reminded of the comics that I have been reading since my childhood and still do, for example the X-Men comics. I cannot help to see the similarities between you and someone like for example Dr Octopus. Did you get your inspiration from these kinds of cultural expressions? Stelarc - [laughs] I was very envious of him actually. I might have a vague recollec- tion of my childhood with comics and I don't remember that being any kind of 303</page><page sequence="12">cultural geographies 14(2) an influence. Even now I can say that most of the books that I read are not sci- ence fiction books. Most of the books I read are either on media theory, phi- losophy or aspects of cognitive sciences. I constantly purchase Scientific American as a magazine; although sometimes a few of those articles can get awfully mathematical and I can't understand them. Generally speaking it is the sort of science magazine that I subscribe to. I guess the way that I function is not ... I don't want inspiration for artistic ideas; I seem to have that. I feel the need to try to understand the world through the philosophies and writings of others because it is something that I lack. What I am trying to do is to cope with the lack of basic technical knowledge and philosophical history and this is what grounds my work. Whatever I try to do I try to make it state of the art. The extra ear will also be a state of the art surgical construct and I am really excited about the idea that... I don't know if we can actually realize it in the one operation but the idea that the ear becomes a kind of blue tooth con- struct... that if you telephone me or if we are communicating by VoIP over the internet I will be able to speak to you through my ear but your voice will come in my mouth, it will happen in my mouth. If I open my mouth and you are close to me you will be able to hear what someone says through my mouth. To me that sort of idea or rewiring of the human body is aesthetically and con- ceptually exciting. Whether it has a practical use... that's got nothing to do with it at the present time. It is that kind of conceptual experience and artistic endeavour that is exciting. Actually if I try to lip sync the voice that is coming from my mouth I will be like a bad foreign movie [laughs]. Sebastian - Will you have speakers and a microphone inserted? Stelarc - Yeah, basically a blue tooth headset is a microphone and a little speaker and of course the electronic circuitry that goes with it and the receiver and trans- mitting coil for the wireless connection. It is distributing that technology between the ear and the mouth and the sensory wiring of the possibilities. Sebastian - Speaking about the future do you have any other projects or performances that you are currently working on? Stelarc - The two works I have done and that I am completing now for this show on the 16th of July I am really excited about. One is called The Walking Head and the other is called The Partial Head. The Walking Head began I guess with the Prosthetic Head, The Walking Head is, imagine, a two meter diameter six- legged walking robot. So it's a small robot and mounted on the top of it in a vertical configuration is an LCD-screen, which has a computer-generated head on it so it's a visual 3D head. What will be interesting about this project is that it is a mechanical virtual interface. In other words the movements of the mechanical legs will influence the behaviour of the face, and the face will also make sounds. So when you walk into the gallery the robot will be just sitting down waiting, doing nothing. But when you walk towards the front of the robot a little sonar detector tells the robot that someone is in the room in front of it and then the robot stands up. Then it selects from its program the differ- ent kinds of movements that it can make and for how long it will make it. Then 304</page><page sequence="13">Abrahamsson and Abrahamsson: The body conveniently known as Stelarc it will do a kind of walking performance and then the walking head will be influenced by the movements and will behave differently depending on what the legs are doing. The Walking Head project is an autonomous, six-legged walking robot with a computer-generated head. The Partial Head project is this idea of not simply growing an ear but growing a whole face. A face that has been modified, we scanned my head and we scanned a hominid scull and what we have done is that we transplanted, digi- tally transplanted, my face over the hominid scull. So the shape of my face has changed a little bit, it has a bigger jaw, a receding brow - not much different than it is right now [laughs] actually. The image looks post-hominid but pre- human; it has this kind of evolutionary comment. Over the surface of this scaf- fold, which is kind of half human and half hominid, will be growing a living skin using living cells. This head will be a partially living head; well it's called the partial head [laughs]. It will be maintained in an installation, which is a com- bined bioreactor/incubator. So imagine the face under a glass dome which is filled with nutrients medium growth hormones and so on. Every five minutes the liquid drains down clearly revealing the growing face and then fills up again and the face is actually on a turntable slowly rotating. We will keep it alive about ten days and it will cost about three thousand dollars of nutrients, growth hormones, and serum to keep it alive for that long. The exhibition is actually three months long so after the ten days we will drain the nutrient and fix it with some combination of formaldehyde and ethanol to preserve it. But for ten days there will be this layer of living cells growing over the face. Christian - Can you imagine a future where artists might work with cloning themselves? Stelarc - Just printing [laughs]. That is really interesting; if you Google 'organ printing' you can find some scientific papers on this. I mean the principle is very inter- esting, this combination of rapid prototyping techniques with tissue culture work. This idea that if you can specify in a 3D-model what you want to print and you replace the ink cartridges with cartridges with living cells, if you print with little droplets of living cells one of the characteristics of living cells is that they will fuse together. They will start growing together; they will create a kind of semi-living object. Sebastian - The notion of self-emergence and auto-poiesis. Stelarc - Yes, in other words what is happening here is that we don't understand exactly how the cells grow together but we understand that if we print these cells in certain conditions and we can provide the nutrients and the blood supply these will become living organs that we can then implant. So the whole stem cell ethical problem sort of disappears and in fact it is going to take us a long time to map all the chemical tags that will enable us to tell a stem cell to grow into a heart or grow into a kidney. At the moment I think they know only 13 or 14 chemical tags so that they can make a stem cell to grow into a certain complexity but then not fully. Sebastian - Here, we are touching upon the concepts of artificial intelligence and arti- ficial life. In relation to this I would like to ask what you think about Ray Kurtzweil and his notion of the singularity.17 Kurtzweil predicts a future in 305</page><page sequence="14">cultural geographies 14(2) which, as I understand it, you can no longer tell human intelligence apart from machinic intelligence. This will happen, he argues, somewhere in the time span of 30 years from now. Stelarc - The way that I like to think about it is that the world is constantly unfolding multiple possibilities; every now and again we collapse those possibilities into an actuality. The world collapses from possibilities into actualities and there is a constant negotiation about this collapse of possibility into actuality through a number of technological, human, and other environmental interactions. Once you start becoming predictive then you are in a sense buying into a kind of Utopian trajectory. But this kind of modern day prophetic projection is of course very seductive and whether it happens in 30 years or in 300 years does that really matter? I don't think so. Take for example Orwell's 1984 or Huxley's A Brave New World and the notion of the Big Brother concept. Actually every- one believed that the Big Brother concept would basically develop from a cen- tralized computerized society. One can argue now that it has gone the other way; that with the availability of computers it actually creates a more complex, fluid, and dynamic exchange of information. It is very difficult to control peo- ple, you know people have mobile phones they can organize protests much more easily, they can disseminate information without being centrally con- trolled. So the business of predicting the future is futile because if the future is not unpredictable then the future is the present and hence not a meaningful concept. I think that the future is only meaningful as a concept if it allows for a diversity of multiple possibilities. We constantly negotiate these possibilities and some are useful and collapse into an actuality and some possibilities never occur. Like for example with the idea of the Cyborg, which we thought, was a medical-military kind of Cyborg or it is a Manga Cyborg kind of a body, which is the controlling system of a large robot. But in fact, recent developments in technology point to other possibilities. One possibility is that you will look the same but your body becomes a host for all these machines and technologies. So technology in the future might be invisible because it is microminiaturized and it is all inside your body. The body becomes a host for its machines; the body isn't in a landscape of machines. That is a possibility; it is not inevitable it is a possibility. Another possibility is that the realm of the post human may no longer reside in the realm of bodies or machines but rather autonomous intelligent viral entities or images that are sustained in electronic media or on the internet. So the future of intelligence may neither be about bodies nor machines. So when someone makes a prediction they are assuming that by pro- jecting the present and extrapolating a certain Utopian trajectory they can say what will happen, but it is also an anthropomorphic projection. I think that the complexity of the world should be interacted with rather than simplified into Utopian or Dystopian visions. I think that all of these things are exciting but the problem is when we eugenically or in Utopian ways try to constrain, because once you say that there will be a singularity in the future you are constraining the world you are not in a sense celebrating the complexity of the world. 306</page><page sequence="15">Abrahamsson and Abrahamsson: The body conveniently known as Stelarc Acknowledgements We want to thank Stelarc for taking time out of a busy schedule to sit down and talk to us and for the inspiration that his work constantly offers us. Thanks also to Catharine Nash for her enthusiastic response when we first contacted her. Finally Christian wants to acknowledge the inspiration of Gunnar Olsson through whose work he first encountered Stelarc.

Fleming writes that 'Stelarc's work would seem to stand as a kind of performative research, as a mode of speculative ontology which doesn't hope to represent possibility but to enact possibilities in real time and space.' 307</page><page sequence="16">cultural geographies 14(2) C.
