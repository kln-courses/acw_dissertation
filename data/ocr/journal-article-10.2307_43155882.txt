<plain_text><page sequence="1">Considering the Role of Invitations to Inquiry in ScienceTeaching and in Teacher Education Pinchas Tamir The Hebrew University of Jerusalem This article is dedicated to the memory of Dr. Joseph J . Schwab, a master of science teacher education and a curriculum scholar whose ideas continue to illuminate classroom practice. The notion of inquiry was introduced to education by John Dewey. However, it was Joseph Schwab who operation- alized inquiry and actually demonstrated the potential role of inquiry in education in general and in biology education in particular. Schwab (1962) observed that: The phrase the teaching of science as enquiry, is ambiguous. It means, first, a process of teaching and learning which is itself an inquiry, "teaching as enquiry." It means, second, instruction in which science is seen as a process of inquiry "science as enquiry." (p. 65) The distinction between "science as inquiry" and "teaching as inquiry" is an important one. The first defines the substantive focus of the classroom, what is taught and hopefully learned. As Schwab (1963) noted: The essence of teaching science as enquiry would be to show some of the conclusions of science in the framework of the way they arise and are tested. This would mean to tell the student about the problems posed and the experiments performed, to indicate the data thus found and to follow the interpretation by which these data were converted into scientific knowl- edge. (p. 40) The second, teaching as inquiry, refers to how teaching and learning are executed, the nature of classroom transactions, providing opportunities for first-hand experience in doing sci- ence, and the development of inquiry skills, such as identifying and defining problems, formulatint hypotheses, designing experiments, and collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data. Theapproach also teaches important attitudinal "metalessons" such as curiosity, perseverance, experiencing failure or success, and dealing with doubts. There are many ways to teach science as inquiry, ranging from lectures presented and texts written as narratives of inquiry, on the one hand, to individual investigative projects in the laboratory or outdoors on the other. The more closely we get to individual research projects, the more opportunities we offer for learning by inquiry. Similarly, the level of inquiry in the school laboratory may vary from low to high, that is, from investigations in which the problem, the hypothesis, and the method and procedures are all given, so that the student has to follow detailed instructions, to investigations in which the student defines the problem, formulates the hypothesis, designs the experimental procedures, and carries out the investigation according to his or her own designģ However, as observed by Welch, Klopfer, Aikenhead, and Robinson (1981): All students should not be expected to attain compe- tence in all inquiry-related outcomes....There is a large scope here for legitimate variations in desirable inquiry-related outcomes for different students, (pp. 45-46). I have found the use of "invitations to inquiry" to be very effective for all kinds of students, since it is "technically possible to match each student's learning to individual traits and needs" (Welch et al., 198 1 , p. 45). What are Invitations to Inquiry? An invitation to inquiry is a module of one or two lessons focusing on particular concepts. The module is struc- tured in such a way that students are engaged under the guidance of the teacher in an investigation which leads to the invention of concepts as well as to discussion which clarifies the meaning of the concepts and their applications. The class, although not manipulating materials and organisms, actually goes through the phases of planning, collecting data, reporting, inferring, concluding, analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating empirical evidence, eventually leading to the formulation of scientific knowledge claims. Thus, the class is engaged in learning science as inquiry by inquiry. Invitations to inquiry were invented by Schwab. The Biology Teachers Handbook (Schwab, 1963) presents 44 invi- tations to inquiry with detailed instructional sequences. Later, the Biological Science Curriculum Study produced 40 invita- tions to inquiry, each based on data, phenomena, and experi- ments presented on 4-minute super 8 film loops, as well as 20 invitations to inquiry based on slide sequences. Hence, a large collection of modules accompanied by helpful teacher guides are available, covering many topics and adaptable to a wide range of students in terms of age and ability. The purpose of this article is twofold: (a) to describe how invitations to inquiry have been used in presentations to effectively demonstrate and explain the notion of inquiry and its role in science teaching; and (b) to describe the use of invitations Journal of Science Teacher Education • Spring 1990 Correspondence regarding this article should be addressed to: 4 1 Dr. Pinchas Tamir, School of Education, The Hebrew Univer- sity of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel 91904</page><page sequence="2">to inquiry in teacher education and explain their unique advan- tages. Explaining Inquiry The particular invitation to inquiry used to demon- strate the inquiry approach deals with an interesting natural phenomenon called mimicry . A lesson script of six steps is pre- sented in Figure 1. Although details may vary from one presentation to another, an attempt has been made to include typical questions as examples. The script may also be helpful to teachers who are interested in using this invitation to inquiry with their own students. After experiencing an invitation to inquiry, partici- pants are asked to say what they think and how they feel about the lesson. While most comments offered by the participants are positive, some reservations were also expressed. Four common reservations are: 1 . This kind of teaching is very time-consuming, therefore it cannot be done in our schools, since we have to cover the prescribed syllabus. 2. Only above-average students can learn in this way. 3. It is difficult for teachers to teach in this way. 4. This kind of teaching requires careful preparation. Through guided discussion, we have reached the following conclusions: 1 . It is certainly time-consuming if one thinks only in terms of the information acquired about mimicry. However, a unique characteristic of an invitation to inquiry is the opportunity to experience and practice inquiry skills. While we should realize that time does not permit to study everything in this manner, it would be highly desirable to conduct an invitation to inquiry on the average of once every three to four weeks, depending on the current topics and the availability of suitable loops or slide sequences. 2. Invitations to inquiry can be matched and adopted to students of a wide range of abilities, including very slow learners. 3. Teachers can learn from others or on their own how to use invitations to inquiry. 4. While teaching a particular invitation to inquiry for the first time, careful preparation does take a lot of time. However, after teaching it several times, it becomes familiar and requires almost no further preparation. When the general discussion, as just described, has been com- pleted, we move to a more detailed analysis based on the specific questions asked during the lesson. The use of two taxonomies, Bloom's (1956) and a taxonomy of inquiry skills, has been found to be very effective (see Table 1). The reader can compare items in Table 1 with those presented in the lesson script (Figure 1). In the first experiment shown on the film, for example, a bumble bee tied to a string is given to a toad. The toad catches the bee, holds it in its mouth for a short while, and then drops it. The students are asked (item 6) to write down what they have observed. In the many times Figure 1 Initial Segment of an Invitation to Inquiry Script Teacher: Today we are going to study an interesting phenomenon . I shall show you three pairs of animals. Please observe carefully and write down your answer. ( 1 ) In which of the pairs are the two animals most similar in appearance? [Three pairs of animals are seen on film: (a) a bee and a fly, (b) two different kinds of snakes, and (c) two kinds of butterflies.] Students: Some select the first pair, others the second, still others the third. ALL ANSWERS ARE ACCEPTED. Teacher: (2) In which pair are the animals most closely related taxonomically? Students: Many do not know the answer. THE BUTTERFLIES. Teacher: (3) The phenomenon of similarity we have just observed is quite common in nature . Formulate one question that you would ask about it . Please write down your answer. Students: Following are some questions which were formulated by students: (a) Why are different animals similar in appearance? 42 Journal of Science Teacher Education • Spring 1990</page><page sequence="3">Figure 1 Continued (b) How have they become similar? (c) Can the similar animals mate? (d) Do similar animals live in the same habitat? (e) What do animals gain by being similar? (0 Do these similar animals eat the same food? (g) Do the similar animals have the same enemies? STUDENTS READ THEIR QUESTIONS TO THE CLASS AND ALL SUGGESTED QUESTIONS ARE AC- CEPTED . Teacher: All these are very good questions . We are going to follow a study in which the researcher asked question e. (4) Please suggest a hypothesis related to this question . Students: Following are some answers offered by students: (a.) Predators may avoid one kind of animal for some reason and the other animal may benefit by being avoided as well. (b.) If one of the two animals is dangerous and the other not , potential prey may befooled by the similarity and will not escape from the dangerous animal believing it is not dangerous. STUDENTS PRESENT THEIR SUGGESTIONS ORALLY. ALL PLAUSIBLE ANSWERS ARE ACCEPTED. Teacher: Our researcher selected hypothesis a . (5) If you were this researcher, where will you carry out your investigation , outdoors or in the lab? Give your reasons . Students Following are some answers: (a.) In the outdoors so that we can observe natural behavior. (b.) In the lab so we can control the environment. (c.) First outdoors and then, for more controlled study , continue in the lab. STUDENTS OFFER THEIR ANSWERS TO THE CLASS . ANY REASONABLE ANSWER IS ACCEPTED. Teacher: Our researcher carried out his study in the laboratory and decided to use toads and insects . I shall show you his experimental set-up and some of his experiments . (6) Please observe the following experiment and write down what you have observed. [The film shows a toad designated inexperienced and a string to which a bumble bee is attached. The bumble bee is brought close to the toad's mouth. The toad waits awhile and then catches the bee in its mouth and holds it for a short while. Then with a sharp movement, the bee is released and the toad freezes.] Students: Following are some students' answers: (a.) The toad tried to catch the bee but did not succeed. (b.) The toad caught the bee and after awhile let it go away. (c.) Unsuccessful hunt. (d.) A bee held by a string is offered to a toad. The toad catches the beet gets stung, and spits it out. (e.) A toad tries to catch a dead bee and then gets disgusted and spits it out. THE ANSWERS ARE NOT DISCUSSED IN CLASS Teacher: From now on a toad that had such an encounter with a bumble bee will be designated as "experienced." [From here on the interactions among students and the teacher continue to follow a similar pattern.] Journal of Science Teacher Education • Spring 1990 43</page><page sequence="4">that I have tried this with such groups as high school students, student teachers, and even university professors, answers to this item read by the participants from their notes were of the following kinds: 1 . The toad caught the bumble bee and then let it go. 2. A bumble bee was given to a toad, the toad caught it, then it was stung and let the bee go. 3. The toad first tried, but then had second thoughts. 4. An unsuccessful hunting. 5. A frightening experience. 6. A bumble bee tied to a string is offered to an inexperi- enced toad. The toad tried to eat the bee, but suddenly something unpleasant happened and the toad spat the bumble bee out. The discussion highlights the difference between observation and inference, the desirability of reporting observations and inferences separately, the tendency of people to report only what they consider to be important, the variety of reports of the saine event, and the use of anthropomorphic inferences. In a similar way, the discussion deals with other items thereby providing a valuable experience in classification and categori- zation of teachers' questions. If time permits, the discussion may shift to other pedagogical matters which have occurred in this lesson such as: 1 . The advantages of students writing down their answers. 2. The need for teachers to refrain from passing premature judgements on student answers. 3. The behavior of the teacher while students arc working in small groups. 4. The advantages of inventing new concepts to prepared minds. 5. The wait time of the teacher and its implications. Invitations to Inquiry and Teacher Education I have found invitations to inquiry to be especially suitable for the version of microteaching that I employ in preservice teacher education methods course. I devote 10 to 12 sessions of four periods each to microteaching. All the lessons take place at the university in a room equipped with video cameras and microphones and which seats 20 to 25 pupils and about 30 student teachers. The first lesson is taught by me to the student teachers. The analysis follows the description given in the first part of this article. In addition, the student teachers are encouraged to raise any point of criticism or query while we watch the videotape. Where appropriate, I stop the videotape and ask: "Why do you think I did that?" or 44 What has happened here?" During the next week I teach a different invitation to inquiry to high school pupils of either grade 9 or 10. Again the lesson is videotaped. At the end of the lesson I hold a brief discussion with the high school pupils asking them questions such as: What do you think about this lesson? How is it different from regular lessons in your school? What did you like about this lesson? What did you not like about this lesson? Would you like to have more lessons like this one? After the high school pupils leave, we view and analyze the videotape. During these two weeks the student teachers form groups of three, and each group selects a particu- lar invitation to inquiry. The most popular topics are: the im- portance of cell nucleus; regeneration in acetabularia; social be- havior of chickens; mitosis; the importance of color in nature; desert plants; desert animals; convergence; reptile adaptation to temperature; maintaining the sugar level in blood; mating behavior of the cockroach; communication in ants; and the peppered moth. Each group plans the lesson as a group and then the lesson is divided into three parts so that the first student teaches for about 15 minutes, the second continues for the next 15 minutes, and the third completes the lesson. The whole lesson is videotaped. At the end of the lesson, the high school pupils are asked to make comments. The student teachers have an op- portunity to ask any questions they wish. Sometimes the instructor asks specific questions to illustrate specific points, such as the extent to which a particular concept, treated by the student teachers as if it were well-understood, had actually not been understood. When the pupils leave, the analysis begins, usually by the teachers of the day commenting on their plan- ning, their expectations, and how they feel about their lessons. Then we begin to view and analyze the videotape. The analysis is not carried out within the context of predetermined schemes of behavior. Rather, it is aimed at the application of psychological and didactic principles to specific situations within the actual setting. A student teacher may be asked to justify a particular line of activities, and then his or her classmates are free to criticize, to suggest other alternatives, and so on. At strategic points the instructor may stop the tape and ask some of the student teachers: 44What would you do if you were the teacher?" Quite often hot debates arise in which different alternatives are suggested and defended. Because they arc analyzing their own behavior, most student teachers find this activity highly interesting. When, at the end of the methods course, they are asked to evaluate it, participants say they regard the microteaching experience as one of the highlights of their teacher preparation. I feel that these procedures make use of the most beneficial ingredients of teacher education: accurate feedback, self-confrontation, building self-confidence, small-scale teach- ing experiences without the risk of failure in the regular class- room, and providing the basis for weighing alternatives and conducting fruitful deliberations about actual teaching situ- ations. It is too early to tell what will be the lasting effects of these teaching experiences. However, the feedback from the student teachers has been encouraging. Recently I have docu- mented what student teachers report they have been learning while participating in the experiences described above (Tamir, 1988). 44 Journal of Science Teacher Education • Spring 1990</page><page sequence="5">Table 1 Analysis of the Questions in the Lesson on Mimiciy Item Inquiry Skill Bloom's Taxonomy 1 Observing - 2 - Knowledge 3 Identifying and defining a problem Synthesis 4 Formulating hypotheses Synthesis 5 Designing investigations Evaluation 6 a Reporting observations - b Differentiating between observation and inference Analysis Note . The numbers match those in the script presented in Figure 1. It was found that student teachers had learned a lot, not only through confrontation and analysis of their own teaching, but also through observation, analysis, and reflection on the lessons of their peers. The concrete classroom events provide unique opportunities for the instructor to raise and discuss important issues related to teaching, curriculum, general peda- gogical knowledge, as well as subject-specific pedagogical knowledge. Conclusion Invitations to inquiry have been shown to be not only an interesting and effective way of teaching science as inquiry by inquiry, but also as a highly effective means for teacher education. It is recommended that institutions which employ the classic model of microteaching (Allen and Ryan, 1969) revise their approach and adopt a more holistic approach such as the one described here.
