Tally Oman's The Triumph of the Symbol is a thorough and well organised study of the iconography of deities in Mesopotamia that considers the possible links between the development of these representations and the image ban in the Hebrew biblical tradition. The book is written in a clear and orderly manner.</page><page sequence="2">422 Besprechungen It is also heavily illustrated with good line drawings. As such it is a much needed contribution to the literature on deity iconography in the Ancient Near East. The book's focus is on images of deities that were produced in Meso potamia from the second half of the second millennium through the first millennium BC. In the main body of the text, Oman argues that there was an increasingly dominant tendency in Mesopotamian art, to avoid anthropo morphic images of deities and to favour aniconic emblems to represent the gods instead. She maintains that the anthropomorphic images of the gods gradually came to be replaced by the type of deity emblems that we see on the Neo-Assyrian palace reliefs and stelae, for example. The primary thesis of the book, argued in the concluding chapter, is that this gradual movement away from anthropomorphic deity representation in Mesopotamia inspired the subsequent image ban in the Hebrew tradition. The book is thorough and clear in making its points, but the claim for the reluctance to produce anthropomorphic images in Assyria and Babylonia may not be acceptable to all scholars who specialise in Mesopotamian antiquity. While deity emblems such as the sun burst of Shamash or the crescent moon of Sin are known already in the arts of the third millennium, these types of representation of deities never replaced the anthropomorphic statues. They were always used alongside, and not as a replacement for, the cult image. The cult statue, which was a presence of the god on earth and not the god's representation, as far as we can determine by means of ancient textual accounts, was anthropomorphic. The reason for the increasing use of deity emblems on the arts of the first millennium appears to have been due to the function of the object upon which they are represented, and I would not describe this as "a refrain from divine anthropomorphic representations" (p. 3). In other words, there were several ways in which a deity could be represented in the Baby lonian and Assyrian traditions, depending on context and function: the reasons and placement of the representation as well as the type of artefact in question. For example, I would be reluctant to assume that glyptic imagery mirrors cultic practice simply because the reasons for such representations differed, as did the development of pictorial styles and seal carving techniques over the centuries. In the Neo-Assyrian period, the emblems were favoured on the palace reliefs because those narratives did not require the depiction of a cult statue. In chapter six; "God and King Vying for the Eye of the Beholder" Oman makes the argument that the decreasing anthropomorphic images of gods made space for the domination of the Assyrian king in the reliefs. This discussion rightly points out that it is only within the religious framework that the royal ideology could be maneuvered to exalt the king, and this is no doubt correct. In fact, the</page><page sequence="3">Alter Orient und Altes Testament 423 discussion of Assyrian palace reliefs has for too long neglected the magical and theological power of reliefs such as those of Ashurnasirpal II at Nimrud. Yet Oman believes that the Assyrian King dominates the Assyrian palace reliefs, an assertion that I do not agree with, even if it is in keeping with the work of the majority of scholars working on Assyrian palace art. There are no cult statues in Assyrian palace reliefs, other than the depic tions of the occasions when cult statues, say from Babylonia or Anatolia, where abducted during battles. The practice of abducting images, and the numerous textual accounts that we have of it, is the best indication that for the Meso potamians the power of images was beyond question. The display of the cult statue was an activity imbued with power. Oman makes reference to the unique sacredness of the cult image in the first millennium textual accounts (p. 174). She briefly addresses the idea that the cult statue's sacredness was pre served by means of the limited removal of the statue from the sacred precinct. Thus, the fact that the relief carvings and glyptic arts did not represent the cult image, because the cult image had a differing function, is implied in the con clusion of the book. Indeed, it may have been that fundamental ascription of power to images that subsequently inspired the Hebrew Biblical image ban. Iconoclasm and image bans, as we know from a number of studies in the field of art history, are not a result of indifference to images. On the contrary, icono clastic acts and the banning of images emerge from a fundamental belief in the power of images. Whatever the case may be for the question of the development of deity representations, the multiple manifestations of the gods in Mesopotamia need not counteract the author's primary thesis for the inspiration for the image ban in the Hebrew tradition. The Babylonian and Assyrian cult statues had a limited viewing, and the emblems (which I would not say are aniconic since they do indeed represent things iconically, even if these do not always bear anthropomorphic) were perhaps more accessible to the general viewer. If these deity emblems were more easily accessible to the general public, they may well have provided that inspiration that Oman maintains spurred on the Hebrew image ban, even if anthropomorphic cult statues remained the norm. The author's insistence that we begin to look at the various ancient tradi tions within the broader perspective of that area, rather than in isolation from one another should be heeded, and I hope this will lead to more studies that consider the farther ranging influences of iconographies and representational practices in Near Eastern antiquity. Oman's investigation of the relationship between the two traditions is an interesting approach, and the influence that she argues for between Mesopotamia's public preference for deity symbols in</page><page sequence="4">424 Besprechungen the representational arts of the first millennium on the Hebrew image ban, may indeed have been the case, however complicated the reasons for that inspira tion. The Triumph of the Symbol is a book well worth reading. It is a very good discussion of the representation of gods in Babylonia and Assyria. The book is certainly thought provoking, and an interesting read regardless of whether the reader will agree or disagree with all the details of the arguments, or whether the image ban had its origins in Mesopotamia.
