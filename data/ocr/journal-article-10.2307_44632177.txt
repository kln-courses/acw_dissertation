ABSTRACT A prototype multi-directional neck (MDN) which exhibits improved kinematic biofidelity in both frontal and lateral impacts has been developed. This prototype's primary goal was to reproduce the kinematics illustrated by volunteers in the Naval Biodynamics Laboratory tests, because current dummy necks were developed before these results were acquired. The prototype achieves this motion with ball- and-socket joints at the head and thorax connecting a rigid link. Rubber bumpers control the neck linkage's range of motion at the joints. Two posterior springs connecting the head and thorax improve head position throughout the impact. Anatomically, the joints correspond to the occipital condyle (OC) and T1 vertebra. The torques measured at the MDN joints approximated the observed human joint response. The MDN can be adapted for use on the Hybrid III dummy and the Advanced Dummy, and incorporates angular motion sensors (AMS) to measure the kinematic performance. MADYMO models were used to determine design parameters. The prototype's behavior was evaluated in pendulum and sled tests. The head and neck kinematics of the multi-directional neck, the Hybrid III neck, and volunteers are compared to show the prototype's improved frontal and lateral kinematic responses. INTRODUCTION The neck performance of an anthropomorphic test device is significant for two reasons. Neck injury evaluation is important because severe injuries, while not frequent, can be devastating for the victims. Minor neck injuries can induce long-term distress as well. The neck also controls head kinematics. Because head injuries are frequent and extensive, a biofidelic neck is crucial for studying head injuries accurately. The Concept Definition of the NHTSA's Advanced Anthropomorphic Test Device Development Program (4) contends that current necks could be improved to better replicate human response with respect to these two roles. This paper discusses a prototype neck with improved response, as defined by the Concept Definition summarized below. The primary criteria for neck response has been the torque at the occipital condyles. Mertz's definitive works (5,6) developed desired torque-angle response corridors for flexion and extension and devised a test procedure for evaluating the torque response of an anthropomorphic neck. The Hybrid III torque response falls within the established corridors.(3) However, Mertz did state that his torque corridors were "necessary but not sufficient" for defining neck response. Patrick and Chou have generated similar corridors for lateral occipital condyle torque.(4) Since the development of the Hybrid III, the Naval Biodynamics Laboratory (NBDL) has run an extensive series of volunteer tests to study head kinematics under a wide range of non-injurious acceleration levels. Cadaver tests run under similar conditions extend the data set to injurious exposures. Spenny and Wismans have analyzed these tests (12,13,15) and modeled the neck response as a neck link pivoted at both ends. Later work by Wismans (11) modeled the * Numbers in parentheses designate references found at the end of the paper 2081</page><page sequence="2">neck similarly, but with anterior and posterior springs which further control the motion. The work done by these researchers has introduced guidelines for incorporating kinematic biofidelity into the design of anthropomorphic necks. Bowman et al. has also modeled the volunteers with a two-pivot extensible neck model. The multi-directional neck (MDN) aims to reproduce the kinematics established through the volunteer testing by using the modeling concepts developed, while continuing to meet desired torque specifications. T| FIGURE 1 - Typical volunteer frontal head/neck trajectory DESIGN CRITERIA The first step in designing the multi- directional neck was to concentrate on reproducing the kinematics of selected volunteers. The MDN design process focused on replicating both the frontal and lateral responses simultaneously. The volunteers experienced distinct phases of motion. Figure 1 shows a typical volunteer frontal trajectory. Initially, the head translates forward and stays upright while the neck rotates. In the next phase, the head and neck essentially rotate together, with little relative rotation. The initial motion of the head is called the "lag" phase, because the head initially lags behind the neck. The posterior neck muscles seem to cause the lag, because cadavers generally did not demonstrate this behavior.(14) Computer models also support this conclusion. The lag is more prominent in frontal impacts, but exists in lateral impacts. Seemann et al. (8) compared the Hybrid III head and neck to the volunteers. They found that the timing, range of motion, and relative position of the Hybrid III lateral response correlated fairly well with volunteer lateral impact response. However, the Hybrid Ill's frontal flexion response exhibited insufficient rotation and early rebound. The head also rotated before the neck, so it did not experience any lag. The MDN would try to reproduce the Hybrid Ill's satisfactory lateral motion while increasing the range of motion and the amount of lag in the frontal response. The other neck design requirements included durability and reasonably simple assembly. The neck's torque-angle characteristics should be similar to those described by Mertz, Patrick, and Chou. DESIGN &amp; TESTING A modified Wismans MADYMO model (11) was used to help design the neck. The concept of Wismans 3-link, 2-joint model was retained, but the physical constraints of building a neck based on the model were considered more thoroughly. The major change from Wismans' model was the addition of two posterior springs to help control the lag. The spring endpoints were positioned through a four-bar mechanism graphical analysis, with the neck, head, springs, and ground as the four bars. The modified MADYMO model was also used to study the effect of certain parameters of the motion. The volunteer was modeled with and without instrumentation; the analysis confirmed the minimal effect of instrumentation on the head/neck motion. The volunteer model characteristics were varied to determine what caused the lag. Increasing head mass only increased the angle through which the head and neck traveled. Increasing the moment of inertia slowed the motion down, though the lag remained the same. The lag depended almost entirely on the stiffness of the posterior springs. A cross-sectional view of the MDN appears in figure 2, and photos appear in figures 3 and 4. The design consists of a rigid steel link with ball-and-socket joints on each end. A rubber sleeve screws onto the link and provides the resistive torques at the joints. Nylon-tipped set screws produce a frictional torque on the balls. The frictional torque is minimal and basically 2082</page><page sequence="3">i?-. FIGURE 2 - Cross-sectional side view of MDN provides only static support. Steel cables with threaded end joints position the springs to control the lag. Nylon washers on the cables reduce the metal-to-metal contact between the cables and the springs. Previous researchers (9-15) have developed a format for studying head/neck kinematics. Three angles describe the planar motion, as shown in figure 5: theta, phi, and delta phi. Theta is the neck angle measured from vertical, while phi is the head angle relative to vertical. Delta phi is the angle of the head relative to the neck, and quantifies the amount of lag achieved. An additional angle psi quantifies the twist of the head in lateral impacts. Angular motion sensors (AMS) mounted on the neck and in the head measure these angles. The neck includes both frontal and lateral AMS mounting positions.

Test configurations were similar to Mertz's study (6) and Wismans' mini-sled tests (12) as shown in figures 6 and 7. To compare the MDN motion to the volunteers seated in upright positions, the neck and head assembly was mounted on a post at an initial angle typical of a volunteer. A Hybrid III assembly was tested the same way for comparison. Peak sled acceleration values ranged from 5 to 32 g's. To study kinematics and torques in the vehicle position, the neck was also tested on a Hybrid III dummy according to Mertz's test method. A five-point belt and an additional chest belt restrained the dummy. The torques were measured with load cells specifically designed for the MDN, although the electronics are the same as the Hybrid III neck load cells. The sled acceleration pulses were similar to the volunteer tests and Mertz's specifications. Sample acceleration curves for both types of tests appear in the appendix. FIGURE 7 -- Head/neck test configuration, similar to Wismans' mini-sled tests EVALUATION OF PERFORMANCE The MDN's range of motion better corresponds with the ranges of the volunteers. In figures 8 through 11, data points from the volunteers, cadavers, Hybrid III, and MDN are plotted against peak T1 acceleration. The data plotted are the maximum angle minus the initial angle for either the head or neck. The corridors shown were derived from the volunteer and cadaver data. A regression of angle as a function of acceleration and square root of acceleration yielded R2 values between 0.88 and 0.91. The regressed curve was parabolic because the volunteer data ended at the injury threshold (approximately 15 g frontally and 9 g laterally). The curve indicated that range of motion should decrease with higher accelerations. Because this physically would not happen, the curve was extrapolated to the injury range. The average curve depicted is the regression curve in the volunteer range plus an extrapolation to the injury range. The corridors drawn are 20 degrees above and below this curve, to include all of the volunteer data 2084</page><page sequence="5">150 M ^ O* -g 100 - **- 0 ^ / , £ r&gt; s'ź * , $ â - "S- r&gt; ° / * * Jż Ār*~ $ V ^ 1 * ■C ¥ / *..^ * **** """" ~ X ■C / ^ #; * £, - """" i s'* *ï* ! á X X X X (0 / / £ a; 50 - / / a; ii/ n i i s' •~ / / / / / _ o HYBR ID iii O iii O _ III MON- I I X ļ j / CADAVERS O / / O VOLUNTEERS * / / ! / / / / / 11 i i i 0 *&lt; - &lt; 1 i i 1 i 1 0 10 20 30 40 Peak Acceleration Çg} FIGURE 8 - Frontal theta - theta(O) vs. peak acceleration for volunteers, cadavers, Hybrid III, and MDN 150 [ 1 o¡ 100 - Q) w X ^ ^ * * &lt;î )ä v ^ * * * it &lt;î I )ä ---'r ' ° s y* * £ J-*'*' w ' - - - 1 /' 4--S'*«1"»» X w - / ""U-or-"^ j a so - / 'i--"" a / / * &gt;&lt; / / / / * / / / O HYBRID III O / / y. / / / MDN-II X ' / / CADAVERS O / / VOLUNTEERS * / / / / / / ' / 0 * !■ 1 1 1 0 10 20 30 40 Peak Acceleration Cq3 FIGURE 9 -- Frontal phi - phi(O) vs. peak acceleration for volunteers, cadavers, Hybrid III, and MDN 2085</page><page sequence="6">100 - 80 - n / O» / a; ^ D ^ w / * s w 60 - /' / , } * .... - x « ,/ * 1 o 1 40 - / * * y x / ,.' f * * y x ,-' 2 ¡ / ' * o 0) / /' f 1 ' ^ &gt; &gt;' ^ / / X HYBRID III O 20 !*- / MON- I I X / / VOLUNTEERS * / / / / / / r / / / / / o - Z 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Peak Acceleration Çg} FIGURE 10 - Lateral theta-theta(O) vs. peak acceleration for volunteers, Hybrid III, and MDN 100 80 - / ^ X X r' * £ x « x 5 60 - / « / * J r' ! ^ I / #-*'r ' • « . / /ļī * » ' a Z / /' I * * a / / * *„./•' / / ^ / I / ' ,' / HYBR ID III O 20 - / / MDN- I I X ¡/o W j j W VOLUNTEERS * / / / / / / / / / j o ļ - í 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Peak Acceleration CqD FIGURE 1 1 -- Lateral phi - phi(O) vs. peak acceleration for volunteers, cadavers, Hybrid III, and MDN 2086</page><page sequence="7">(except for one atypical volunteer on the frontal neck angle graph). The generous corridors should render insignificant any errors in extrapolating to the injury range of accelerations. As shown in figure 8, the MDN frontal neck angle theta approaches the volunteer corridors more closely than the Hybrid III neck. Figure 9 shows that both the MDN and Hybrid III head angles fall within the corridors, although the MDN comes closer to the average head angles seen on the volunteers. Future modifications will bring the MDN neck angle closer to the center of the corridor. The same comparisons are shown for lateral impact in figures 10 and 11. As reported from Seemann et al. (8), the Hybrid III falls within the corridors laterally. The MDN neck mimics the Hybrid Ill's acceptable lateral behavior by also falling within the corridors. The MDN neck angle lies closer to the center of the corridor, but its head angle rotates slightly too far at higher accelerations. Planned design changes should bring the angles closer to the average curve. Qualitatively, the MDN experienced approximately the same degree of twist as the Hybrid III. MfÜíl-DIKCTIMN.

His specifications, as well as the same data for the MDN and Hybrid III, appear in figures 12 and 13. The straight reference line illustrates a lag of zero degrees. Spenny's curve shows typical volunteer lag behavior. The MDN, while not attaining the magnitude Spenny recommends, achieves some degree of lag frontally. The Hybrid III head/neck does not experience any lag in this impact direction. Laterally, the MDN experiences initial lag, but the head travels too far at the end of motion. The future effort to reduce the lateral head range of motion should bring the lateral lag closer to Spenny's specifications. The kinematics of the neck when mounted on the post correspond well with neck kinematics when mounted on the dummy, as illustrated in figures 14 through 17. The head and neck angles both frontally and laterally correlate within a few degrees. In the lateral dummy test, a modification to reduce head range of motion was introduced, leading to the smaller head angle. The apparent difference in timing for the lateral dummy test occurred because the dummy slid across the seat before the head and neck rotated. The frontal test did not have this problem because the seat belt configuration restrained the torso more securely. 2087</page><page sequence="8">Wj » I ' CT) «m TXT* - - e- XF0/KT1 ne* I '' «fi f / &gt;v' • y f &gt;v' ' ' s ' ' Ä ( 0 50 100 150 200 Í: ne (msec) FIGURE 14 - Neck angles are similar for MDN mounted on dummy and post subjected to same frontal acceleration 3H 1 1- WHIT PHI e- »ew/HPrji pní * // //'' '' 2 ? // '' 2 / I '' rõ" j I - ^/L ' ^ 50 100 150 200 Time (msec) 7IGURE 15 -- Head angles are similar for MDN mounted on dummy and post when subjected to same frontal acceleration si ■ ■ h OUWMT THETA S- l-CAG/NECK THETA I I 8- 9 O» -m ^ Í 100 Time (msec) FIGURE 16 - Neck angles are similar for MDN mounted on dummy and post when subjected to same lateral acceleration 8-1 ' ' ' f DOM ST PHI • HCAO/HCC* PHI 8" / / ' 'c» I I XL 9 / '' 0« J 0 50 100 150 200 Time (msec) -IGURE 17 -- Head angles are similar for MDN mounted on dummy and post when subjected to same lateral acceleration 2088</page><page sequence="9">100 ļ - LOADING UNLOADING 80 ~ M6RTZ AND PATRICK CORRIDORS / i - 60 " ; I § / / / / ? / ' / / j ?

They approach the loading corridors shown on the graphs except for the initial opposing torque. This results from the springs effecting the lag. Although the published corridors do not account for this opposing torque, some of the volunteers also exhibited 2089</page><page sequence="10">it.(9) The Hybrid III neck also has a slight opposing torque initially.(3) CONCLUSIONS The MDN exhibits improved frontal and lateral kinematic biofidelity when compared to volunteer data. The first torque-angle data gathered indicate that the MDN approaches the necessary requirements. Structurally, the neck has proved to be durable throughout testing. Results have been repeatable. Further development will incorporate extension kinematics and kinetics and appropriate axial stiffness. The planned modifications to the MDN will also increase the neck range of motion and decrease the lateral head range of motion so they fall closer to the center of the corridors. Increasing the spring stiffness and stroke should bring the lag curves closer to Spenny's specifications.
