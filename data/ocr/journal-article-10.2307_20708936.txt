<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reply to Phillip Ferreira JAN OLOF BENGTSSON Lund University PERSONALiSM in all of its forms turns against the reduction of the person to or dissolution of the person in matter as well as in ideas. In my book, I argue that both of these reductions are often related to pantheistic modes of thought. In the course of modernity, such modes became increasingly promi nent, not least due to the influence of Spinoza, whose philosophy displayed the characteristic ambiguity of modern pantheism in that it could be interpreted as either idealistic or materialistic. In the Enlightenment period, pantheism assumed rationalistic forms, inclining sometimes toward deism, sometimes toward materialism. German idealism retained much of the rationalism and was perceived to reduce the person to ideas rather than matter, but the broadly Spinozistic ambiguity persisted so that it did not take long before, at the hands of the Left Hegelians, it was itself transformed into materialism. The romantic era also added irrationalistic forms of pantheism. On my analysis, modern personalism began as a reaction against the threat against the person in all of these forms of pantheism. But as defined with reference to the American school as founded by Bowne, personalism is an idealistic philosophy and not a materialistic one, and rationalistic rather than irrationalistic (although "rationalistic" is a misleading characterization). This, of course, does not mean that it is an idealism of the kind that dissolves the person in ideas. There are different forms of idealism. Platonic, Leibnizian, Berkeleyan, and German idealism are not the same (and there are different forms of at least Platonic and German idealism). And there are all kinds of combinations, many of which also assimilate positions from other philosophies that cannot in themselves be regarded as idealistic. Aristotelian and other elements were taken up in the broad, Platonic tradi tion already in antiquity, and this synthesis was in turn taken up in Christian philosophy and theology. Idealism is a vague concept.

Its main characteristics are its focus on the central category of the person?understood in terms that in themselves warrant the designation of their whole philosophy as idealism?and its rejection of the impersonalism of all other philosophies, including other forms of idealism. The personalist criticism of impersonalism in other forms of idealism focused on the one hand on the "generalistic" interpretation of Plato's theory of ideas or forms and the related tendency in subsequent philosophy to el evate an impersonal rational or moral order above personality, including the personality of God. On the other hand it focused on the contemporary, dominant form of German idealism, based on a certain interpretation of Kant and developed by Fichte, the early Schelling, and Hegel; and later, in a variation of Hegelianism, by British idealists like Green, Caird, Bradley, and Bosanquet. The latter form of idealism is often called "absolute idealism," in contradistinction to personal idealism, but this can be misleading inas much as the early idealistic personalists did not turn against the concept of the absolute itself but only the impersonal understanding of it. The debate with the absolute idealists having been so central to the early development of personalism, it is of considerable value to be able to respond to the comments of Phillip Ferreira, a prominent living representative of the absolute idealist school. After generously acknowledging the merit he finds in my book, Ferreira devotes the rest of his essay to the argument that, as formulated by Pringle-Pattison, personal idealism is either not idealism (in Hegelianism and Personality) or not personal, or rather, no more personal than absolute idealism and in reality basically in accord with it (in The Idea of God). This argument is also formulated as a criticism of my general account of the relation between personal and absolute idealism. Ferreira defines idealism narrowly in terms of the absolute idealist version only. Insofar as Pringle-Pattison does not accept the Hegelian modification of Kant's understanding of the categories, perception, etc., and retains elements of realism from the Scottish tradition, he is not an idealist at all; to the extent that his position can properly be called idealistic, it must be consistent with Ferreiras absolutism. In the light of what I have said above, this seems to me historically incorrect. Pringle-Pattison does speak of his position as a "larger idealism," but by this he does not mean that it is less idealistic than abso lute idealism; due to the latter's ambiguities, the opposite is the case. What Ferreira legitimately does is to investigate some similarities and differences between Pringle-Pattison's philosophy?which I concur with the historians</page><page sequence="3">BENGTSSON : Reply to Ferreira 49 who have dealt with this in designating personal idealism?and absolute idealism primarily of the British variety. A discussion of the absolutist response to the personalist criticism of which Ferreira notes the absence could not, I think, easily or naturally have been included in a book devoted mainly to a historical argument about the origins and early development of the worldview of personalism. But Ferreira is right in calling for it inasmuch as I do defend, in a broad perspective, the lasting value and relevance of early personalism and in doing so imply the correctness of many of its criticisms, including that of absolute idealism. And the value of Ferreiras contribution is not least that it gives me an opportunity to do at least a little of what I could not reasonably do in the book. Ferreira is wrong when he says that I tar with the same brush Hegel and the variation of Hegelianism in the British absolutists, viewing the latter as the legitimate target of the critique of the former. I explain how the British absolutists differed from Hegel, the reason for this being, as it seems, not least the simple fact that they were British and thus incapable by nature and tradition of disregarding experience and indulging to the extent the Germans did in speculative excess. I show how Pringle-Pattison was well aware of this, which is also at least one of the reasons why he is closer to them than to Hegel, this being especially but not exclusively true of The Idea of God} More generally, Ferreira fails to see the extent to which I agree with him. It is correct that I regard Hegelianism and Personality as an important and historically significant book in the development of personalism, and that?as in the other essays, I am addressed by Ferreira to some extent as a philosopher and not only as a historian and thus have to respond accordingly?I am in agreement with many of its analyses and arguments. But when Ferreira cur sorily remarks that I largely endorse its attack on absolute idealism and then plunges into a detailed criticism of the attack without taking notice of the several places in my book where I problematize it in a manner similar to his own and make reservations with regard to it?returning to me only in the last few paragraphs and adding after this extensive argumentation no more than that "Bengtsson acknowledges the 'inadequacy of Pringle-Pattison's position in this area"?it is necessary to protest. Pringle-Pattison approved of Hegel's method inasmuch as it aims at sys tematicity of thought, and, as Ferreira writes, he holds a dialectical criticism of categories to be at the heart of philosophy. As Claes Ryn notes in his essay, I suggest in several places in my book that idealistic personalism, includ ing Pringle-Pattison s, did not incorporate enough of the Hegelian insights regarding dialectical thought and the concrete universal?an incorporation</page><page sequence="4">50 THE PLURALIST 3 : 2 20 8 which I agree with Ryn is feasible without the adoption of the whole of He gel's impersonalist metaphysics and with the insistence on the importance of the personalist criticism of the latter. I note that dialectical thought and the idea of the concrete universal were imperfectly assimilated and developed due to the personalists' perception of their problematic, more precise formu lations and meanings in Hegel's work.21 make clear that I do not mean to say that the analysis of understanding and reason that Jacobi bequeathed to personalism was complete and satisfactory.31 explain that the early personal ists, building on this analysis, sometimes misunderstood Hegel, but that it is their conclusions regarding the status of personality in his system that are important.4 I point to the significant influence Hegel nonetheless exercised on early personalism5 and give exemples of this and of tendencies compatible with or pointing toward a possible further development in this direction.6 While pointing to what he thinks is the presence of a dialectical criti cism of categories in Pringle-Pattison, Ferreira finds fault with it inasmuch as Pringle-Patisson's understanding of the categories seems to be that they are merely "broadly applicable empirical concepts" or merely psychological, and inasmuch as for him sense experience is as such "pure matter of fact ness," "wholly alogicaT." I agree with regard to the limitations of the latter position; and it is hard to see what is categorical at all in the former position ascribed by Ferreira to Pringle-Pattison. But Ferreira rightly displays caution and expresses reservation with regard to the interpretation of Pringle-Pattison on this point, and he even writes that Pringle-Pattison "insists upon . . . the fact that empirical apperception is present in all self-conscious experience." It is not clear to me that "anthropomorphic," and so forth, necessarily im plies psychologism and cannot be descriptive of a partial acceptance of the Kantian epistemology. What Pringle-Pattison turns against is the hypostasization of Kant's abstract conditions of knowledge in general?the categories and the unity of consciousness?into a self-existent reality, the "real Knower," the "One Subject" in all finite minds, a hypostasization which "wipes out the selfhood and independence of the individual" and "deprive [s] both God and man of real existence" (Hegelianism 67-6$; Bengtsson, Worldview 119-20). He rarely discusses the distinction between empirical and transcendental apperception in the way Ferreira does. But neither acceptance of the empirical appercep tion nor even of the transcendental apperception as it seems to have been understood by Kant suffices for Ferreira. For him, the only tenable alterna tive to Pringle-Pattison's position is precisely the one that Pringle-Pattison, quite clearly, turned against?even, on my interpretation, in his later work:</page><page sequence="5">BENGTSSON : Reply to Ferreira 51 the full acceptance of the unabridged absol ute idealist hypostasization apart from the finite subjects, the hypostasization that was turned into the abso lutists eternal consciousness, their version of absolute. Personalists have often accepted the abstract analysis of empirical and transcendental apperception and their shared nature for all finite rational persons. But they have normally sought to modify it in significant respects, and Pringle-Pattison's rejection of the way in which a transpersonal status was ascribed to apperception, and of the impersonalist consequences of this move, was one of the most important. Ferreira notes that Pringle-Pattison is "even willing" to accept the transcendental apperception; but to the extent he did so it was in the Kantian version only, not that of the post-Kantian development. Ferreira complains that he reduces it to a "logical presupposi tion," a mere idea. But this is not so very far from some of the things Ferreira (and of course Kant himself) says about it, namely that it is in some sense a "postulated unity" of the experienced world, a "largely unconscious . . . con viction." It is not perfectly clear what is meant by saying that it "constitutes" this postulated unity. If it means that it constitutes what is postulated in the sense that it is the reality of what is postulsted?and that this reality, this unity, is a transpersonal self?it certainly says more than does Pringle-Pattison. But if it means that it constitutes the postulate itself qua postulate, and that this postulate is of a unity which is not a transpersonal self, the difference is not so clear. An unconscious?or even a conscious?conviction in itself in no way implies a transpersonal hypostasization. Ferreira writes that it is not self-conscious?perhaps not at all and at least not in the sense of empirical apperception. And if, as constituting the experiential awareness of the finite being and perfectly continuous with and fading off into empirical conscious ness, it is not for the finite being distinct from the latter, it does not imply the identity of one finite self with another. It could be all of these things without being in itself a self transcending the finite selves; it would seem it can only be impersonal as abstractly analysed. But Ferreira the absolutist says more than this. Not accepting the mini malist version of transcendental apperception as a logical presupposition, he writes that for Pringle-Pattison the metaphysical boundaries of the subject stop with something like empirical apperception, that selves do not "spill beyond their boundaries and somehow merge' with other selves." It seems to me that Pringle-Pattison could accept that selves can in a certain sense spill beyond their boundaries without thereby losing them and merging with other selves. What Ferreira notes about Pringle-Pattison's view of how we be come aware of our moral limitations seems to me to apply, mutatis mutandis,</page><page sequence="6">5* THE PLURALIST 3 : 2 20 8 here too. Ferreira writes that Pringie-Pattison demands, in Hegelianism and Personality, that "selves be seen as absolutely separate and distinct." What Pringie-Pattison actually writes in the passage cited by Ferreira is that the self is "the very apex of separation and differentiation." Apex does not indicate absoluteness; it means the highest point. Absolute separation from the rest of reality Pringie-Pattison certainly did not accept even in Hegelianism and Per sonality; no personalist in what I regard as the main line defended the position of strict metaphysical pluralism, and, as I show, Pringie-Pattison turns quite as sharply against it as against impersonal absolutism.7 That selves belong to a common, unitary reality does not imply their merging or their reduction to identity. Again, it seems to me the personalist position can be reconciled with a modified, broadly Hegelian, dialectical criticism of categories?what Ferreira, in somewhat one-sided terms, speaks of as "laying bare the rational structure of the external world" (it would be better, I think, to speak of the substantial, idealist logic of the content of experience)?and can thus overcome Pringle Pattisons too sharp opposition of subjective categories (however he may more precisely have understood them) and abstractive thought on the one hand and concrete reality as given in immediate sense-perception on the other. Imper sonal hypostasization is not, as far as I can see, required in order to understand reality as having on all levels something of a logical structure in the dialectical and substantial sense and to accept the process of true, systematic thought as one through which finite selves can to some extent lay it bare. Pringie-Pattison accepts in Hegelianism and Personality not just the idealist emphasis on the centrality of the self-conscious knower but an absolute con sciousness. His whole point in that book, however, is the distinction betwen the finite and the infinite selves qua selves. On his analysis, the distinction and their nature as selves were lost in the hypostasization of the abstractly analysed conditions of knowledge. Transcendental apperception, even as de scribed by Ferreira, being at most the common nature of the consciousness of unity, is not a self qua self and cannot therefore constitute an identical self of all finite beings or an absolute self. What Pringie-Pattison writes in the famous passage cited by Ferreira is that the self is impervious to other selves, and that in its character of self it refuses to admit another self within itself. That the experience of one finite self may be continuous with that of another finite self or the infinite self, Pringie-Pattison did not deny. For selves are certainly not impervious to all the contents of experience, all the "influ ences of the universe," as he writes when, in a footnote in The Idea of God, he returns to and defends his early formulation.8 We most definitely possess</page><page sequence="7">BENGTSSON : Reply to Ferreira 53 an experience more or less in common with others of what is beyond the "boundaries" of our own subjectivity. Why is there a contradiction in speak ing of ourselves as impervious in our character of selves and at the same time making claims about what lies outside ourselves, understood in this sense? The self qua self being aware of its boundaries certainly means that it can go beyond them in a certain sense; but this going beyond them is?even ex hy pothesis it would almost seem?precisely what makes it aware of them. Such as they are, the boundaries are not abolished but confirmed. The distinctions are quite as real as the unifying commonalities. Any immediately given perceptual experience is indeed only relatively concrete, and thus partly abstract in the sense intended by the absolutists. But even as for this reason in need of supplementation, it is relatively concrete. That it is not given independently of thought does not mean that it is given without any concreteness. If perceptual experience were not immediately given as concrete at all, it would not be possible for one such experience to become more concrete by being brought by thought into relation with other such experiences. This is one of the main points on which Hegel displays the ambiguities that caused so much criticism. As I show in my book, the "realist" element in personalism was originally introduced by Jacobi, under Scottish influence, in connection with his analysis of abstraction in Spinoza. It was this analysis which, combined with the perceived ambiguities, influ enced the later personalist interpretation of Hegel on this point, of which Pringle-Pattisons is but a late statement (with renewed inspiration from the same Scottish philosophy). In my view it certainly goes too far, as does, more generally, Pringle-Pattisons and some of his predecessors' onesided view of thought's abstractive nature. At the same time, the personalists are right that there is in Hegel the spurious abstractive excogitation in the absence of the concrete datum, inasmuch as he loses the person as understood by the per sonalists and fails to make the personalist distinction between the finite and the infinite selves. Pringle-Pattisons analysis of perception and thought was part of this argument, which is in my view where the "precise motive" for writing Hegelianism and Personality is to be found.9 Having explained the point about concretion and abstraction, Ferreira makes a leap when he writes that the criterion of given perception is "hence" Bradley s feeling base, which "comprises all aspects of our experience." It may be that this feeling base "provides us with our concrete sense of 'reality as a whole'," but so does also the growing coherence and comprehensiveness of our concrete thought itself. The feeling base may provide a sense of the per fectly concrete totality, but it is thought that achieves explicit, approximative</page><page sequence="8">54 THE PLURALIST 3 : 2 20 8 apprehension both of this totality and of concrete specificity through their dialectical and systematic interrelation. Ferreira defends the common interpretation that Pringle-Pattison moved closer to the position of the absolutists in The Idea ofGod and abandoned the notion of the self's imperviousness to other selves. To me it seems that much of the impression that he did so arises because The Idea of God has a so much wider scope than the limited criticism to which Hegelianism and Personality is devoted. The later work sets out so much more of Pringle-Pattison's own, positive alternative, and deals with so many more things. It is also important to consider that Pringle-Pattison was close to absolute idealism in his first works, before Hegelianism and Personality, and that he was from the begin ning, and not just in The Idea of God, closer to the British absolutists than to Hegel on the issues of experience and reason.10 And in the later work, Pringle-Pattison refers, for instance, to Bradley's insistence on the dialectical progress of thought demanding concrete experience as the criterion that goes beyond mere thinking, and to his famous passage on the "spectral woof of impalpable abstractions" and the "unearthly ballet of bloodless categories." The similarities are also accounted for by the fact that, like Pringle Pattison, the later British absolutists on whom he focuses in The Idea of God followed Lotze in making value a central theme. But Pringle-Pattison devel oped his value-based idealism explicitly as a negation of and an alternative to the kind of German and Greenian idealism which he had criticized in Hegelianism and Personality. As I show, in emphasizing, with the absolutists, the content of the universe, its infinite values as open to appropriation and enjoyment by the finite being, rather than the latter as a bare point of existence in itself,11 Pringle-Pattison did not abandon the understanding of the finite self as impervious to other selves in its character of a self. He never defended an "absolutely finite" self "shut up within the four walls of its independent entity" or the "spurious independence or self-existence" conferred upon the finite by the inaccessible beyond in the theories of radical transcendence that he was at pains to reject. But as I show, Pringle-Pattison again and again?it is indeed his main theme?defends partial independence and self-existence of the kind he thinks is decisive and which in his view sets his position clearly apart from that of the absolutists, in continuity with his earlier criticism. As I point out, complaining about the misunderstandings his formulation about imperviousness had led to, and regretting that he had not stated his position more clearly, Pringle-Pattison even reasserts it.12 Ferreira even himself confirms that Pringle-Pattison's epistemological position in The Idea of God is continuous with that of Hegelianism and Per</page><page sequence="9">BENGTSSON : Reply to Ferreira 55 sonality when he says that it is "still greatly influenced by the Scottish com mon sense school," i.e., the "realism" that, since long before Pringle-Pattison, was part of the broader idealism that is personal idealism, to a considerable extent because of the influence of Jacobi. Pringle-Pattison, as we have seen, from the beginning accepted the abso lute while rejecting the German post-Kantians' way of reaching it. I have also argued that he never denied the self's openness to what is beyond its boundaries but did reject merging and the dissolution of these boundaries. It seems clear to me that to the end he therefore conceived of the self's continuity with God in terms different from those of the impersonal absolutists. It is important to note that Ferreiras two quotes on our relation to God are out of the Kantian and post-Kantian sphere of ideas, as, with regard to the first one, Ferreira is himself aware when he observes in a footnote that it is made with reference to Descartes. The continuity with God and the finite-infinite nature of man that are here affirmed are not, it seems to me, the continuity and finite-infi nite nature of transcendental apperception as hypostasized by the absolutists. What Pringle-Pattison discusses in these passages seems to me to be closer to the positions that had distinguished personalism from mainstream German post-Kantian idealism from the beginning: the special view of higher reason in Jacobi s sense, and its idea of God, and so forth, understood in such a way that they could be used as arguments against pantheistic monisms failure to distinghish the finite from the divine self, as well as, more generally, the higher from the lower?failures, needless to say, also of that significant corollary or variation of this pantheism in the romantic age, narcissistic individualism, and of an absolutely finite and independent self, whatever that could be. But the passages Ferreira cites as supportive of the interpretation that Pringle-Pattison has come to accept the post-Kantian view of apperception do raise some difficult questions. Does language from other philosophical contexts, as that which Pringle-Pattison employs here, describe substantially the same position as that expressed by the language of hypostasized apper ception? Clearly there are some difficult problems of interpretation involved here. With regard to the continuity with God (although precisely this differ ence in terminology?God instead of the absolute?is significant; Ferreira cannot possibly argue that the absolutists accepted with the personalists the personal absolute), Ferreira is right that Pringle-Pattison does seem to come closer in substance; I cite in the book many more passages of this kind.13 But the decisive point here is that it is certain that he does not do so to the point of obliterating the fundamental distinction, the importance of which is the central message of both his earlier and his later work.</page><page sequence="10">56 THE PLURALIST 3 : 2 20 8 A comparison with Vedanta philosophy might be in place here, not least since I point to the parallells in that tradition in several places in my book. Re jecting Shankaras advaita?nondualist?interpretation of Vedanta, Ramanuja did not deny the unity but insisted only that differentiation was equally real; stopping short of the position that was to be taken by Madhva, the next major critic of Shankara, namely the position of dvaita, dualism, Ramanuja defended the position called vishishtadvaita, qualified nondualism. Nimbarka found both alternatives to Shankara unsatisfactory, and proposed his own solution called dvaitadvaita, simultaneous dualism and nondualism, or bhedabheda, simultaneous distinction and nondistinction. The considerations among the various schools of Vedanta exegesis that were critical of Shankaras advaita are not just about unity and differentiation in general; their concern is very much that of the Western personalists as well, including Pringle-Pattison: the partial independence of the finite beings, the personal conception of the absolute, and the relations between the finite and the infinite beings. Their counterpart of personalism can, like early personalism in the West, be described both as a qualified monism and as a qualified pluralism.14 It seems not unlikely that inasmuch as Pringle-Pattison would probably accept that God is a self for whom we as finite selves are at least not imper vious in the same sense and to the same extent that we are so to each other, he would have accepted that a special kind of continuity does obtain in the relation to God which, although beyond the mere logical unity of reality as a whole, and, a fortiori, beyond this logical unity as a mere postulate, could still be seen as quite close to the results of the further idealist development of Kant in one aspect. Despite the different ways of reaching it?the one leading to impersonalism and the other to personalism?the idealism of hypostasized apperception and that of reason understood in the personalist sense might be said to overlap or agree with regard to the result concerning the aspect of continuity and unity, just as Ramajuna and Nimbarka converged with Shan kara in this respect. I want to point out here that the Pringle-Pattison of The Idea of God is not at all closer to absolute idealism in this respect than many of the earlier European speculative theists or idealistic personalists, who often seized on this partial agreement. But again, the decisive thing is that neither they nor Pringle-Pattison ever abandon the main point Pringle-Pattison had made in Hegelianism and Personality?that the distinct person, the finite individual s as well as God's, must not, and cannot without contradiction, be lost as in the idealist development of transcendental philosophy. Ferreiras argument from Pringle-Pattison's moral positions is important, yet this argument too fails wholly to convince me. Has Pringle-Pattison</page><page sequence="11">BENGTSSON : Reply to Ferreira 57 come to agree with the absolutists about self-realization and the community of persons? It is not clear to me that these are necessarily new positions of his. The passage about self-realization through self-sacrifice is just one of many statements of the theme of the universe's contents in The Idea of God, and its criticism of the culture of one's own personality is a quintessential expression of the early personalist rejection of individualism; here Pringle Pattison points to a typical, narcissistic variety increasingly common ever since romanticism. And when the passage is read in its context, the strong formulations appear almost as part of his rhetorical composition. As Fer reira notes, "the final sentence emphasizes the dependency of the whole on the individuals it comprises." After this sentence, Pringle-Pattison goes on to say that "just 'from the side of the Absolute' the meaning of the finite process must lie in the creation of a world of individual spirits; for to such alone can He reveal himself and from them receive the answering tribute of love and adoration."15 Ferreira, in my view, describes a too simple opposition of the egoistic self and the community as a whole.16 As far as I can see, the fact that we are joined by an abstractly analysable aspect of sameness, and in a common larger reality, does not imply that we are pervious as selves to other selves. When the egoistic self is transcended, the higher self remains as nonegoistic but nonetheless unique. There are vast issues involved in the questions of self actualization and the determinations of the self which space does not allow a treatment of here; in the book I discuss the position of some personalists?a position which is of course also that of Vedanta?that the self brings a spiritual content, beyond empty subjectivity and what could be actualized through the larger experiential contents of the world, a position Pringle-Pattison too suggests in a few places.17 The most important part of Ferreiras essay is, in my view, the one where he confirms some of what I have here said in response to his criticism and ar gues that according to the absolutists the finite individual self is, after all, not "merged" in other selves or the absolute. It seems to me that, regardless of the question of the truth about Bradley's and Bosanquet's understanding of the ultimate destiny of the finite individual, Ferreiras account of their position, as related to the issue of the finite individual's development of knowledge (and, in the last footnote, of his apprehension of value), would, with some modifications and additions, certainly be acceptable, as a description of the situation involved, by personalists who embrace a supplementary reason and logic of the kind discussed above or even just approve of Hegel's method to the point that Pringle-Pattison does. I for one would thus fully endorse it. It</page><page sequence="12">58 THE PLURALIST 3 : 2 20 8 seems quite clear to me that as it progresses, the finite self's growing experi ence, as grasped in its logical structure, as knowledge, ideally converges with and approximates the absolute and that to the extent it does so, the partiality of the self-enclosedness and perspectivity inseparable from its finitude is re duced. But its perspectival experience is in this sense supported by an experi ence that is not that of "no one in particular" but that of the one that is not particular, i.e., the one that is the absolute. And that one being what it is, in this process of larger experiences of the content of the universe the finitude itself, and thus its perspectivity, cannot be cancelled. Rather, it is precisely through the proper coordination with the whole that is the concrete universal in the widest sense that it is discovered in its concretely determined unique ness on this level, in its status as the apex, the highest point, of separation and differentiation, properly conceived. It finds itself as, in Claes Ryn's words in his essay on my book, an in tensification of unique individuality at the highest moral, aesthetical, and intellectual level. The perspectival convergence also in itself implies the identification of the very boundaries. Retaining them in the manner of the alternative idealism that is personal idealism does not signify a relapse into scepticism. But it is, among other things, a realistic safeguard against epistemic, and indeed moral, illusions. Ferreiras account concerns self-actualization and the growth of knowledge only with reference to the contents of the universe appropriable by more than one finite self, and there may, as I suggested, be contents and determinations of such selves that go beyond these. My point here is merely that at least on one level, or as far as it goes, the account here discussed is not inherently impersonalistic, as Ferreira would perhaps even agree. But it should be noted that personalists always insisted against Hegel the gnostic, and stronger than the British absolutists, that the constitutive differentiation ever precludes the finite being's exhaustive appropriation of the absolute perspective, or man's becoming God. And not least importantly, this differentiation also has ac cording to the personalists a meaning that seems to be lost in the philosophy of the impersonal absolutists. Ferreira writes that "while it is certainly the case that our individual per sonhood cannot be eliminated or undone, this does not imply that we are self-sufficient creatures whose nature does not ultimately depend upon our relation to the whole of existence." The first part of this seems to indicate that there is for Ferreira after all not in reality only One Self which can be understood in terms of the idealist analysis of apperception; that Ferreira accepts ineliminable boundaries, and so forth. And again, the second part is explicitly taught by Pringle-Pattison. He very clearly held that as a member</page><page sequence="13">BENGTSSON : Reply to Ferreira 59 of the whole, the finite self is related to and dependent on it. But why can such a member?especially if it is granted that it cannot be eliminated or undone?not be impervious in the sense Pringle-Pattison describes? It is perfectly understandable, I think, that Pringle-Pattison objected to the de scription of the finite being's relativity to the absolute as "adjectival." Ferreira first says that Pringle-Pattison changed his position from "impervious" to "ineliminable," but, in dealing with eliminability, he says that it also included that of the finite being's "self-sufficiency." But it seems to me the latter would be quite as strong a position as that of imperviousness (the position which, as we have seen, Pringle-Pattison did in fact not change but only explained more clearly). In reality, what Pringle-Pattison had in mind with regard to the finite individual as substantial was, as he makes explicit in many places, never anything more than relative independence. I quote him as saying that as the mere "denial of unrelated reals," he has no problems with the adjectival theory (Pringle-Pattison, Idea of God 274; Bengtsson, Worldview 247). I also show that appearance did not mean for him illusion, and that he did not really think Bradley meant to deny the reality of appearances. In the appearances "we already grasp the nature of reality" and "we can attain to it in no other way" (Pringle-Pattison, Idea of God 217; Bengtsson, Worldview 180-81). I agree with Pringle-Pattison in the many passages discussed in my book that Bradley's and Bosanquet's accounts of the destiny of the finite person are not satisfactory from the personalist standpoint.18 Their idealisms are still too much locked in the dynamic of modern pantheism, whose typical ambiguities abound in their work. In reading them, it is not difficult to see why the personalista could insist that personalism alone was the true idealism. To note this is not, however, to deny their greatness as philosophers. As will have become clear from this reply, not only are there areas where personal ism and absolute idealism overlap; it is also my understanding that there are fields of philosophy where the absolutists surpass the personalista.19 Ferreira claims that Pringle-Pattison's criticism with regard to the ultimate destiny of the finite individual self is due simply to misunderstanding. But on Ferreiras own showing, imperviousness in the precise sense explained by Pringle-Pattison was, and is, rejected by absolutism. And that point alone is enough to uphold Pringle-Pattison's argument. For it is the very impervious ness that is the distinctive thing about persons. The irreducibility, inexhaust ibility, and unpredictability of the other person's uniqueness and alterity are essential aspects of his dignity. Without reducing Hegelianism, and most emphatically quite apart from anything Ferreira stands for, it must be said here that Communist totalitarianism, as it emerged out of the transformations</page><page sequence="14">6o THE PLURALIST 3 : 2 20 8 of Hegelian absolutism, conceived tragically of the person as reducible?and his body was certainly not impervious to its executioners' bullets. The same imperviousness is also the interesting thing about the first-per son perspective, the fascinating reality of persons and the relations between persons, which the absolutists say little or nothing about. If we were wholly pervious, wholly transparent, we would not only be wholly controllable; we would also soon lose interest in each other. And, I venture to suggest, the definitely impervious person of God would soon lose interest in us. Ferreira notes that his claims could be adequately established only on the basis of a lengthy examination of the texts. I look forward to deepening on another occasion, and on the basis of such examination, the discussion with this competent exponent of absolute idealism. Meanwhile, I am grateful to him for having started it and for having thus provided me the opportunity to explore, beyond what was possible in the book, aspects of the relation be tween absolute and personal idealism that are of central importance to me.

The footnote where Ferreira says that Pringle-Pattison sets forth in The Idea of God a criticism of Green different from the one in Hegelianism and Personality and states it in terms of the distinction between the empirical and transcendental apperception, and where he implies that Pringle-Pattison had come to accept the absolutist understanding of this analysis, I have to admit I do not understand. I cannot find it in the pages Ferreira refers to. It seems to me that Pringle-Pattison restates his early criticism of Green and rejects this whole type of idealism?the idealism that turns the Kantian analysis of the conditions of knowledge into metaphysics?in terms no less explicit and unambiguous than in the earlier book. He also restates it in the famous debate with Bosanquet at the Aristotelian Society which followed the publication of The Idea of God. 13.
