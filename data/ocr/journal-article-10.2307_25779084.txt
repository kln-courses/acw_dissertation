<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Polish Review, Vol. LXIII, No. 4, 1998:475-483 ?1998 The Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences KAZIMIERZ KOWALSKI and ROMUALD TURASIEWICZ CHRONICLE OF THE POLISH ACADEMY OF ARTS AND SCIENCES Introduction The activities and achievements of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences [Polska Akademia Umiejetnosei - PAU] for the year 1997 are as follows. Organizational Affairs In June of 1997, the General Assembly of the Academy elected 48 new members. As of the end of the year, PAU had 256 resident members and 125 foreign members. The General Assembly also re-elected the Executive Board for the next three year term as follows: President Kazimierz Kowalski, Vice Presidents Stanisiaw Grodziski and Jerzy Znosko, and Secretary General Jerzy Wyrozumski. Wieslaw Bienkowski was elected the General Assembly's delegate to the Executive Board. Janusz K. Kozlowski will continue to function as the Executive Board's representative for international cooperation. The fundamental material support for the statutory activities of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences was a substantial subsidy granted by the Scientific Research Commission which was significantly increased in comparison to 1996. In addition, PAU received funding from the Social Fund for the Renewal of Cracow's Monuments for the overhaul of its buildings in 1997-1998. The realization of many of PAU's projects was made possible by assistance from the Lanckoronski Foundation, which financed foreign fellowships for humanists, to be awarded by the Academy, and covered the costs of work associated with publishing the acta of the Papal Nunciate in Poland and certain other publications. The Foundation also conveyed to PAU a valuable library composed of approximately 3000 works on Polish subjects of great historical value. Last year we also received a number of legacies and souvenirs from distinguished scholars, as well as cash gifts designated for PAU activities. Despite year-long negotiations with the Polish Academy of Sciences [Polska Akademia Nauk - PAN], it still has not proven possible to recover 475</page><page sequence="2">476 The Polish Review the library of the archives taken over by PAN in 1952. Scholarly and Scientific Activities In accordance with the Academy's traditions, lectures were given at the plenary sessions. In June, philosopher Wladyslaw Strdzewski spoke on existence and truth, and in November, in conjunction with the 125th anniversary of the Academy's foundation, historian Wiestaw Bierikowski read a paper on its origins. The Humanities The Class of Philology and the Class of History and Philosophy, together with the various commissions associated with them (Classical Philology, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Art History, Jewish History and Culture, Prehistory of the Carpathians, and Law) were very active in lectures and publications. In the field of Greco-Roman antiquity, the papers read covered essentially seven learned disciplines: classical linguistics and stylistics, the history of Latin literature, ancient philosophy, the history of religion, Roman history, archeology, and Greek litigation. In the area of research on ancient linguistics, Michal Bednarski discussed the current situation of classical linguistics in Poland, and Romuald Turasiewicz presented the results of his research on the nature of Lysias' style. The history of Latin literature was represented by Stanislaw Sniezewski, who explained the concept of historiography in the works of Livy, while history of philosophy was discussed in the paper delivered by Zbigniew Danek, who pointed out the basis of the "midwivery" technique employed by Socrates. An important issue connected with the history of Rome was raised by Michael Crawford of London, who discussed the nature of Roman colonization in Italy, while Maria Dzielska took up the history of religion in Greco-Roman antiquity, reflecting on the profile of the so-called "divine men" and their activities. The paper read by Romuald Turasiewicz on juridical "logography* ? the writing of speeches for the parties in court proceedings ? was on the border between Greek law and literature. In the area of archeology, Janusz Ostrowski presented his analysis of the images of prisoners of war with their hands bound behind their backs ? cum restrictis ad terga mambus ? seeing in such representations of prisoners an element of Roman political propaganda. Joachim Sliwa recalled the scientific profile of Piotr Bierikowski, a professor of the Jagiellonian University and the founder of the first Chair of Classical Archeology in Poland. The area of literary theory was very productive in lectures. Maria Podraza Kwiatkowska took up the problem of "home" in the literature of Young</page><page sequence="3">Chronicle of the Polish Academy All Poland, and considered the question whether the attitudes of the writers of that period were dominated by the element of "stylization" or "nomadism." Franciszek Ziejka presented the origins of the "golden legend" of Cracow during the period of national subjugation, while Krystyna Pisarkowa discussed the semantics of Zbigniew Herbert's Erotyk in German translation. Olga Dobijanka reviewed C. M. Wieland's opinions on the constitution of the state, and Henryk Markiewicz considered the problems of theories and methods in literary research. General and Indo-European linguistics were represented by several papers, including those of Leszek Bednarczyk, who discussed the book by Olgierd Chominski, Ohszar jezyka litewskiego wPafistwie Polskim w latach 1928 1933 [The Lithuanian Language Zone in the Polish State in the Years 1928 1933], while Witold Manczak discussed the name of the first Polish monarch, and Aleksander Szulc dealt with Austrian German and the self-stereotype of its native speakers. In the field of archeology, special attention should be given to the lecture by Jan Chochorowski on the Great Ryzhanovka Barrow in Ukraine in light of investigations carried out in 1996, and by Bernard Hansel on the migrations of peoples in the light of research by archeological methods, using the example of Macedonia in the Bronze Age. Jan Machnik spoke on the significance of excavation work in the Sambor vicinity, while Marek Gedl presented the problem of the development of cultural unity in central Europe in the second millennium BC. The meetings of the Commission on the Prehistory of the Carpathians heard papers on the results of work often done jointly with Slovak researchers. Among these was the paper by Janusz Koztowski on early Neolithic settlement patterns of the Linear Pottery Culture in eastern Slovakia, and information on archeological investigations in Spisz, presented by Pawel Madej and Pawel Valde-Nowak. Jerzy Ginalski spoke on the early medieval fortified oppida in the region of Trepcza on the San, Renata Madyna Legutko on the settlement of the Polish Carpathians in the Roman period, and a research team led by Pawel Valde-Nowak spoke on the excavations at the cave in Oblazowa in the Podhale region. Several papers dealt with ancient and medieval history. J6zef Wolski pointed to certain still unresolved problems associated with the Seleucid state, Kazimierz Radwariski recounted the oldest history of Cracow as the residential city of Vistuli and the early Piasts, Jerzy Wyrozumski presented the results of his research on the Prussian legend of St. Wojciech, while Alicja Gradowska discussed the problem of the testaments of the Cracow nobility from 1650 to 1795. Krystyna Chojnicka spoke on the Empress Zoe Palaeologos and on the extent of Byzantine influence in Muscovite Ruthenia, while Krzysztof Baczkowski pointed to the controversy surrounding the Peace of Bratislava in 1491. Lidia Korczak discussed the activities of the Lithuanian Grand Ducal</page><page sequence="4">478 The Polish Review Council in the fifteenth century. A great deal of attention was devoted to modern history. Antoni Podraza pointed out a central European type of agricultural literature in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries, Theodore Mackiw presented the reaction of the English press to the Peace of Zbordw in 1649, Michal Baczkowski analyzed the Lulx)rnirski military intervention in Hungary in the years 1709-1711, Izabela Roskau-Rydel recounted the participation of Germans in the revolutionary events in Galicia in the years 1831-1945. Considerable research interest was also focused on events from recent history, especially in central and eastern Europe. Andrzej Pilch discussed the role of the Second Corps of the Polish Armed Forces in Austria after the Second World War, Vera Veskovic-Vangel took up the issue of the national identity of Macedonia in the past and in present times, Jozef Laptos focused attention on the attitudes of the UNRRA towards the problem of refugees from central and eastern Europe, while Marek Waldenburg pointed to the destructive role played by nationalism in this part of Europe. JOzef Smaga discussed the situation in eastern Europe five years after the fall of the Soviet Union, and Antoni Podraza considered the possibility of renewing the encyclopedia of knowledge about Ukraine: Ukraina - terainiejszote iprzeszlote [Ukraine - Present and Past]. Jan Jacek Bruski presented the activities of the government-in-exile of the Ukrainian People's Republic in the years 1920-1926. Jan Piskurewicz recounted the activities and history of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences ? prima inter pares ? during the Second Republic. Specifically Jewish matters were dealt with by Tomasz Gasowski, who spoke on the emancipation of Galician Jews in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; Hanna Koziriska-Witt, who presented the activities of the Association of Progressive Israelites in the years 1864-1874; Andrzej 2bikowski, who spoke on the Jewish religious community in the years 1869 1919; Jacob Goldberg of Jerusalem, who analyzed Polish-Jewish-German relations in Poland in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; and Leszek Hondo, who presented the history of the old Jewish cemetery in Cracow and the state of its preserved inscriptions. The art historians carried on a lively research program. Zdzislaw 2ygulski analyzed the content and composition of the painting "The Battle of Kirholm," Jerzy Banach revealed a hitherto unknown view of Cracow from the mid sixteenth century, Zofia Ostrowska-KeWowska spoke on the collegiate Church of Our Lady in Poznarl as a place for a national historic monument, Ewa Sniezyriska-Slot took up the issues of astrological iconography, while Piotr Krasny along with Andrzej Betlej analyzed the esthetic arrangement of the sculpture in the Bernardin church in Radecznica. Tadeusz Chrzanowski analyzed the sculpture of Christ in the church in Staniatki. Zygmunt Wazbirtski discussed the paintings of the Dutch Naturalists (Aersten, Beucklelaer, van Traat) in the Medici collections in the latter half of the</page><page sequence="5">Chronicle of the Polish Academy_479 sixteenth century, Adam Miiobedzki took up selected issues of the Polish architectural scene, Lech Kalinowski presented his remarks on the art of the Renaissance, while Slawomir Skrzyniarz pointed to the anthropomorphic imaginary winged figures of the Devil in Byzantine art. The lectures at the meetings of the Class of Creative Arts inspired broad discussion. Jerzy Nowosielski spoke on pure and utilitarian art, and Wladyslaw Str62ewski considered the problem of the three dimensions of a work of art. Many interesting papers were read in the Class of Law, concentrating their attention primarily on themes of particularly great significance in the present political, social and economic realities of Poland. Aleksander Lichorowicz discussed Polish agricultural legislation against the background of the legislation of the European Union; Ryszard Markiewicz clarified the problems of authorial rights in the Internet; Zbigniew Holda spoke on the liberal penal policy. Stanislaw Biernat presented the problem of economic freedom as a basic principle of the law of the European Union, Tomasz Gizbert Studnicki explained the theory behind the interpretation of the Constitutional Tribunal, Andrzej Maczynski analyzed marital law in the light of the Concordat between Poland and the Vatican, while Jerzy Stelmach considered the relationship between law and morality. On April 27, 1997, the Executive Board of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences organized a formal meeting, during which Dr. Granjo Greguric, Chairman of the Nominations and Administration Committee of the Parliament and former Premier of Croatia, and Dr. Ivan Brnelic, conferred the highest distinction granted by that republic to a member of PAU, Prof. Henryk Batowski. On May 19, 1997, the Executive Board held a formal session at which Prof. Batowski was given a special publication produced on the occasion of his ninetieth birthday. On June 20, 1997, an exhibition entitled "Father and Daughter in the Service of learning" displayed mementos of Karol Lanckoronski (1848-1933) and his daughter, Karolina Lanckoronska. The Lanckoronski family, noted in historical sources since the early fourteenth century, has given Poland many distinguished statesmen. Karol Lanckoronski was interested in art history, and organized archeological expeditions to the monuments of Asia Minor, crowned by the publication of a multi-lingual monograph on the cities of Pamphilia and Pisidia. He was elected a correspondent member of PAU. Karolina Lanckoronska, an art historian, is also a member of the Academy, and its great benefactor as well. We are grateful to her for transferring to the Academy valuable collections of books and mementos, as well as financial assistance for various forms of scientific and scholarly activity. On November 14, another exhibition was opened, presenting mementos of Stanislaw Tarnowski, Secretary General (1883-1890) and later President of the Academy of Arts and Sciences, on the occasion of the 160th anniversary of his</page><page sequence="6">480 The Polish Review birth and the eightieth anniversary of his death. That same day, at a learned meeting devoted to this same distinguished scholar, an organizer of learning and a politician, three lectures were presented. Marta Wyka spoke on Stanislaw Tarnowski as a literary historian, Waldemar Lazuga on his political writings, and Stanislaw Grodziski recounted his role in the Galician Provincial Assembly. The Natural Sciences Five papers were read at the meetings of the Class of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry. Zygmunt Kolenda and Jakub Siemek prepared a co-authored paper entitled "Man and Energy: Needs, Hazards, Hope." Stanislaw Mrowec spoke on the foundations for developing modern fireproof materials, while Andrzej Fuliriski spoke on the impact of noise on ion transport through biological membranes. A foreign member of PAU, Tadeusz B. Massalski (Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh), presented the prospects for the development of the science of materials, and Sir John Meurig Thomas, FRS, Director of the Royal Institution in London, read a paper entitled "Davy and Faraday: a Tale of Contrasting Geniuses." At the initiative of this Class, the Cracow Scientific Institutes of Physics funded an award for works dealing with this sciences. In 1997 it was awarded for the first time, to Wladyslaw Wolter for his work "Investigations of Bremsstrahlung of Electrons in the Energy Interval (1011- 1012)e.V." Under the auspices of the Class of Astrophysics, directed by Kazimierz Grotowski, there were eighteen scientific meetings, with papers presented by scientists from Cracow, Warsaw, and Toruri, and also from Odense University in Denmark. The papers were invariably accompanied by discussion. In January of 1997, at the application of the Class of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, an inter-class Commission on Threats to Civilization was formed. Composed of representatives of various classes, it was chaired by a physicist, Andrzej Hrynkiewicz. Threats to the harmonious development of humanity are associated by the general public with the improper use of the results of scientific research, and with the development of technologies that are dangerous to the natural environment. There are perils to humanity, however, in factors that are not entirely under human control (climatic changes, the appearance of new diseases) as well as in social factors (totalitarian ideologies, fundamentalism). The Commission's activities are to take the form of learned meetings with papers, which will be published; resolutions resulting form the papers and the accompanying discussion; and finally, public meetings. In 1997, the following papers were read: Halina Krzanowska, "Problems in the Cloning of Organisms"; Marian Tischner, "New Methods of Biotechnology in Animal Breeding"; Roman Ney, "Is the World Facing a Lack of Mineral Raw Materials?"; Jerzy Vetulani, "Biological Preconditions for Drug Addiction";</page><page sequence="7">Chronicle of the Polish Academy_481 Roman Pampuch, "Science and Technology in the Face of Paradigm Shifts"; and Andrzej Hrynkiewicz, "The Two Faces of Nuclear Energy." The Class of Biosciences organized three lectures. Stefan W. Alexandrowicz, speaking on the development phases of the movements of masses, pointed out that slides and rockfalls in the course of the last 12,000 years have periodically intensified as a result of climate changes. Zbigniew Wilk presented a paper entitled "Mining and the Water Environment: Fields and Dimensions of Conflict." In the area of biology, Andrzej Bartke (Carbondale, Illinois), a foreign member of PAU, spoke on the research results to date on the issue of whether the growth hormone prolongs or shortens life. At present this hormone, the primary factor determining growth, is produced by industrial methods and finds application in medicine, and will probably be used in animal breeding as well. Its impact on longevity is this an important issue. The Commission on Quaternary Paleogeography, directed by Stefan W. Alexandrowicz, had six meetings, at which numerous papers were read concerning transformations of the natural environment during the most recent period of the Earth's geological history. As examples of the topics covered we may mention papers dealing with the dating of cave sediments, research on carbonate sediments in the lakes of northern Poland, the stratigraphy and mollusk fauna in river sediments in southern Poland, as well as the fossil flora and neotectonics of the Carpathian region. The Commission on Embryology and Morphology held a meeting to hear a paper by Hieronim Bartel on the impact of caffeine on the prenatal growth of animals and humans. This Commission was also a co-organizer of the 22nd Conference on Embryology (Plants, Animals, Humans), which was held in Osieczany on May 11-17, 1997. Abstracts of the 103 papers presented were published in Acta Biologica Cracoviensia (vol. 39, suppl. 1). The Commission on Agricultural Sciences, in conjunction with the Cracow Academy of Agriculture, organized an international conference on "The Use of Agricultural and Forestry Machinery in Scientific Research and Teaching." The results will be published in 1998. The Class of Medicine organized two lectures. Jerzy Stachura spoke on Helibacterpylori and its involvement in mucous membrane infections of the digestive tract. This bacteria is now acknowledged to be the most important pathogenic factor in mucous membrane infections of the stomach, ulcers of the stomach and duodenum, and stomach cancer. The author presented the operating mechanism of this infection and methods to prevent it. Mario Werner (USA) presented a paper on "A Conceptual Model for the Value of Medical Information and Clinical Decisions." The Commission on Medical Ethics joined with lecturers on ethics from the medical schools in Poland to organize a scientific symposium devoted to the teaching of bioethics. The teaching methods and curricula at various medical</page><page sequence="8">482 The Polish Review schools were presented. Papers were read by Kornel Gibinski, Janina Rybicka, Jan Doroszewski, and Kazimierz Szewczyk. This was the tenth meeting of the Commission. The materials presented at the symposium will be available in print. International Cooperation The cooperation between the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Union Academique Internationale continued in the form of the participation of our representative, Janusz K. Kozlowski, in its meetings, and also by the participation of PAU in many international research projects in the humanities realized by the Union. In compliance with a decision made by the Union this year, its next foreign meeting will take place in Cracow. Work is also continuing under the contract between the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Slovak Academy of Sciences, especially as pertains to research in the Carpathians. Jan Machnik, a member of PAU, who has rendered particular service in Polish-Slovak archeological investigations in the Carpathians, received the Ludovit Stur Medal, awarded by the Slovak Academy of Sciences for achievements in the area of the social sciences. The President of PAU, Kazimierz Kowalski, visited Canada at the invitation of the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences of Canada. This Institute was founded in 1943 as a branch of the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences of America, founded somewhat earlier in New York, and in 1976 it was transformed into an independent Canadian organization. In view of its historical ties to the American Institute, which was founded by members of PAU, the Canadian Institute also feels historic ties with PAU. President Kowalski visited the Canadian Institute's headquarters in Montreal and its branch in Ottawa, reading papers on the history and present activities of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences. Together with members of the Institute, he met with Robert Hall Haynes, the President of the Royal Society of Canada. The conviction was expressed that cooperation should be initiated between PAU and the Royal Society, with the Polish Institute in Canada as intermediary.
