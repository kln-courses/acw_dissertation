Louvain : Peeters (Ancient Near Eastern Studies Supplement 15.). By Roger MATTHEWS. The Neolithic of western Turkey is one of the least under- stood and most poorly researched subject areas in the field of Anatolian archaeology. Any publication relating to this topic is to be warmly welcomed and when that publication takes the form of an attractively produced, thoroughly illustrated and well-written volume the welcome is doubly strong. The report under review covers work conducted at the site of Ulucak Höyük, 15 km east of Izmir, by the highly experi- enced team from izmir University, headed by Professor Çilin- giroglu, in collaboration with Izmir Archaeological Museum. They have used the site as a training ground for a now accom- plished corps of field archaeologists who have been able to develop their expertise through work at Ulucak and at other sites in Turkey investigated by the izmir team and beyond. All participants, in the excavation and the publication, are to be warmly congratulated on conducting the fieldwork and on producing this high-quality end-product with such efficiency and skill. The volume takes the form of a series of sections, all of which appear to be joint-authored as no single author is cred- ited for each chapter. This aspect lends a genuinely collabora- tive feel to the work, which does the team credit. After a brief introduction, there is a detailed consideration of the pala- eography of the site and its setting, involving a coring pro- gramme that clearly demonstrates the true extent of the mound underlying more recent alluvial deposits. The main part of the publication treats the various occu- pation levels of the settlement. Ulucak Höyük is a multi-period mound with a total depth of deposits measuring some 11m. The latest levels date to th^ Late Roman-Early Byzantine period but they are severely disturbed at Ulucak to the extent that large quantities of Late Bronze Age pottery are mixed into the latest levels, presumably from pits. Finds from Early Bronze Age levels demonstrate the cultural loca- tion of the settlement within the context of western Anatolia in the Early Bronze Age II phase. There are also rather scant Paléorient, vol. 32/1, p. 149-164 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2006</page><page sequence="2">RECENSIONS 161 architectural and ceramic finds from the Late Chalcolithic period. Of most significance are the remains of the Late Neolithic period, phase IV at Ulucak, which comprise seven successive levels. Structures are built of both mud-brick on stone founda- tions and of wattle-and-daub, and take the form of rectilinear rooms with entrances at floor level. One structure, Building 8, contained collapsed pieces of painted plaster and a striking anthropomorphic pot, leading the excavators to suggest that this building may have been a shrine. The wealth of ceramic evidence from the Late Neolithic levels enables the excava- tors to associate their finds most closely with the Late Neo- lithic of the Lake District. Connections with sites to the north, such as Ilipinar, are much less readily established. A final major section, before a brief conclusion, considers the material from an Early Bronze Age cemetery located 150 m south-east of Ulucak Höyük itself. Here a total of 14 burials was excavated, 12 of the Early Bronze Age and two dating to the Middle Bronze Age. The burials are in the form of inhumations within large pithos vessels, with extremely few burial gifts. This cemetery adds another piece to the mosaic of our knowledge of mortuary practice across Anato- lia in the third millennium ВС. On the whole this volume has been very smartly produced, with ample illustrations as both line drawings and half-tones, although more site views would have been appreciated. The language is on the whole straightforward and readily compre- hensible although there are quite large numbers of typograph- ical errors scattered throughout the report. This volume will be supplemented in due course by reports of various scientific and archaeometric analyses of materials from the site, which will doubtless amplify the interpretations arrived at in this volume: we much look forward to these further investigations and their publication by the Izmir team.</page></plain_text>
