<plain_text><page sequence="1">185 Prehistoric Remains on Historic Sites of India and the Near East. (Cf. MAN, 1935, 159.) SIR,-Since the publication of MAN, 1935, 159, in which I maintained a high dating for certain terra-cottas from Sari-Dheri (N.W. Frontier Province of India)l, I have been able to examine the site, and to verify that the archaic figurines in question lie buried in the lower part of the mound. A full report of these investigations will be found in Iraq, 1937. The opinion there maintained is shared by such authorities as Dr. Contenau and Dr. Coomaraswamy. Most stimulat- ing also was to me the spontaneous comprehension of Sir Aurel Stein, who possesses first-hand knowledge both of the prehistoricIndo-Sumerian material and of the Gandarian remains. The great explorer had the kindness to write, from the scene of his actual labours in Persian Kurdistan: "It is very gratifying to know "that the Peshawar district, the sites of which have "yielded such abundant remains of Grseco-Buddhist "sculptures, etc., to archseological research of the last "seventy years or more, holds out promise of finds "throwing light on far more ancient phases of civiliza- "tion in the Indus region." These encouragements have led me to scrutinize deeper this promising field, and I am now making ready for publication a work whose main conclusions I shall briefly summarize here :- (1) Sari-Dheri is not isolated. It forms part of a vast cultural cycle that will be met in the deeper layers of many sites of historical date. These archaic remains have already come to light incidentally in some places. I have documentation from six sites, foremost among which is Taxila, the rich Indo-Scythian and pre-Mauryan city of the Upper Indus Valley that we owe to the systematic diggings of Sir John Marshall. The archaic remains of these sites offer some hundred parallels to the proto-historic material of Near Asia, belonging mostly to the intermediary period of Susa in Mesopotamia (c. 3500 B.C., figs. 3-6). (2) Most unexpected are the numerous analogies between these archaic Indian remains with regions so far off as pre-Hittite Asia Minor and the Early Minoan ?gean (figs. 9 and 10). These connexions are corro- borated by the presence of an Indian bull among ancient terra-cottas from Anatolia (fig. 10); the humped bull, as was remarked in Mesopotamia some years ago, evidences cultural relations of some sort with India. I believe that a close study of those clues which lead us into Indo-European lands will shed light upon the Aryan question, and that the connexions postulated between Sari-Dheri and Anau III are bound to find links in the northern region of Afghanistan, the natural passage leading from Turkestan to India. This connexion with Anau is confirmed by Dr. Mackay's recent excavations at Chanhu-Daro (SAnd), where he found at the Harappa level the pin terminating in a double-spiral, well known FIG. l.

(3) At a more recent date contact still closer with Europe is disclosed by some finds in Northern India identical with those from the barrows of South Russia (figs. I and 2). Already a gold bracelet of pure Scytho- Sarmatian style, in the Peshawar Museum (ASI.AR., 1919-20, p. xxiv, c.), had been noted by Rostovtzev, who supposed it had come to India by trade. In fact, a whole stratum of Taxila bears the mark of Scythian i The site of Sari-Dheri was discovered by Major I). II. Gordon, who dates it 200 E.C. to 200 A.D. (J.R.A.I., 1932, pp. 163-171; MAN, 1934, 70; 1935, 129). Similar terra-cottas of Northern Indian provenance had been previously published by Dr. Coomaraswamy (Ipek, 1928, pp. 64-76), who, after a thorough analysis of the .style, dated them to the Indo-Sumerian period.

By Scythian is understood here (in the European sense of the term) the nomadic art that flourished in South Russia from the sixth to the second century B.C. and extended through Central Asia to China. (4) Taxila appears to be of first importance also for the history of religions. No temples have been identified as yet in the chalcolithic cities of the Indus Valley, but Taxila gives us a miniature terra-cotta monument (fig. 7) which, if we analyze its elements, faithfully pic- tures the fertility-cult of the Mohenjo-Daro period. Cf. Sir John Marshall's chapter upon 'Religion' in Mohenjo-Daro and the Indus Civilization, vol. I. The Mother-Goddess, the 'linga,' the birds by the small cult-vessels associated with the serpents and the stepped ladder, find exact counter-parts in similar miniature shrines scattered all over proto-historic Near East: in Cyprus (Vounoi), Crete, Mesopotamia, etc. In the light of this votive monument I recognize as a shrine a small - FIG. 7. TAXILA 'A' (ASI.AR-, 1915-16, P. viii, a). building of Harappa that has escaped notice. It is the brick structure found by Ray Bahadur Daya Ram Sahni in 1924-25. It contains a stone ' linga ' in the centre and stepped remains in front of the entrance. The discoverer himself stated: " It is not impossible that the stone obelisk was presented or installed for worship in this very cell," (ASI.AR., 1924-5, p. 78, pl. XXIV, e). (5) A general conclusion emerges, which may provide the terrain d'entente between Major Gordon's views and mine. I refer to the inadequacy of the chronologies actually in use. Relative dating is at present fairly secure, and the synchronisms between the Indus and Sumer appear indubitable. But their absolute date leaves one more sceptical. As an attentive observer has noted: " Si un certain nombre d'indications tendent a faire remonter de plus en plus haut la date de la civilisation de Mohenjo-Daro, d'autres observations inclineraient 'a des conclusions contraires . . . La civilisation de l'Indus n'a donc peut-etre pas une antiquit6 aussi haute qu'on a voulu le croire tout d'abord." (P. Stern, L'Inde antique et la civilisation indienne, p. 402.) We must bear in mind that there is still no general consensus upon the dating of the various civilizations of the Near East; that, according to the high or low chronology of one such country as Sumer, archeologists differ by some 1,500 years; that the second millenium B.C. affords almost no monuments in Mesopotamia (Contenau in a lecture at the Brussels University, winter, 1935); and that the same period on the Indus also remains sterile. To quote Major Gordon, (MAN, 1935, 129): " The gap in Indian archaeology that exists between the " lowest date that has, as yet, been advanced for the " Indus Valley culture and that of the Mauryan period, " is a source of constant irritation." All these con- siderations make us feel the weak points of current \J ~9o FIG. 9. BHITA (ASI.AR., 1911-12, Pl. xxiI, 12). FIG. 10. TROY II (Schliemann, Ilios, Fig. 185). FIG. 1 1.

If there was a time when the Harappa culture had to rely upon Mesopo- tamia for its date, now it is the turn of India to enlighten the datings of the Near East. SIMONE CORBIAU. P.S.-When the above was ready to print, appeared Major Gordon's latest study (' The Mother Goddess of ' Gandhara,' Antiquity, 1937, pp. 70-80). I can here only add a few remarks on it:- The presence of coins of the Kushan period at Sari- Dheri does not invalidate the high dating of certain strata on the site; for, at Harappa also, coins of recent date were found-hundreds of coins belonging to the Indo-Scythian period (cf. Cunningham, A.S.I.R., 1872-3, p. 108). The Khafaje figurine bearing the characteristic eyes, applied and incised, of the Sari-Dheri terra-cottas is not [ 151 ]</page><page sequence="3">No. 185] MAN [September, 1937. a unique parallel, that might be ascr ibed to mere coincidence. Examples are many in proto-historic cultures: at Mohenjo-Daro (Marshall, Mohenjo-Dctro, iii, pl. CLIII, fig. 25; pl. XCV, fig. 15); at Kish (Mackay, Antiquity, 1931, p. 459, fig. 8); at Rakka (Mesopotamia, FUsa, x, p. 92, fig. 16b); at pre-hellenic Argissa (Monte- lius, la Grece pre-classique, p. 116, fig. 364a); whereas that peculiar technique disappears everywhere in Hellenistic times. The anthropomorphic representation of the so-called Hariti and her consort (Major Gordon's, pl. I) cannot, I think, bear direct comparison with the archaic figurine of the Mother-Goddess and symbolical 'linga' from Taxila of the votive shrine (fig. 7). They differ as much as the Christian art of the Catacombs differs from the ieonography of mediaeval times: the idea illustrated may remain substantially the same, but its representa- tion has evolved, an(d that implies a difference of time. XWe read in the excavator's accurate report (Marshall, ASIAR., 1924-25, p. 50) that the votive shrines were found alongside the base of the stupa and his plate shows them in situ (ibid., pl. XIII, 2==fig. 8). If we consider the (lepth at which they lay, we inay presume that they were buried beneath the stupa's occupation level. In my opinion the Buddhist shrine superseded, on the very spot, the cult-place of an earlier religion, that of the Mother-Goddess and 'linga,' which, evidently, have nothing to do with Buddha's creed. Major Gordon's well-documented article brings new material of great interest. Such is the archaic figurine from Hadda (Afghanistan) (his pl. II, bottom right). The mound from which it comes, being reported to be a mile distance from the site where Monsieur Hackin's excava- tions have brought to light an admirable Buddhist culture, is bound to yield most valuable stratigraphical data.
