Ann Arbor: Edwards Bro- thers, 1981; distributed by Scholars Press, Chico, California. Paper, n.p. [American Academy of Religion. Texts and Translations 5] This volume is the result of a fruitful collaboration between a scholar in patristics and a classicist. It gives us the first complete translation in English of Proba's cento written c. 360 A.D., and, in seven chapters, the first sympa- thetic study of Proba as the earliest female Christian poet from whom we have a complete work, her place as a transitional figure in the history of early Christian literature, and her status in Roman Society. Like other centos, Proba's was composed of lines from classical poetry, specifically Vergil's. It tells the story of creation from Genesis, some other events from the Old Testament, and what Proba considered to be the most important episodes of Jesus' life from the New Testament. She conceives of her work as a Christian Aeneid , and her Jesus "resembles the epic hero Aeneas at least as much as he does the biblical lamb of God" (p. 1). Proba's cento may have been the first work of Christian literature written for the education of Christian youth (p. 7). Carolus Shenkl's Latin text and references to Vergil's work are interleaved with the translation. A classicist reading the cento is frequently surprised, amused, delighted, or moved to pity by the lines from Vergil that Proba has chosen, often percep- tively but sometimes ineptly, to convey her Christian message. When she used Vergil's line from Georgics 2.490 ("felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas") of God (Proba, 1.39), we are surprised that she freely associates Him with a farmer but pleased that she could so concretely imagine His activity. Her choice of Aeneid l's "os umerosque deo similis" (1.120) to describe Adam's resemblance to God is at once ingenious and entertaining, and, when Adam explains his first sin to God "ut vidi, ut perii, ut me malus abstulit error" ( Eclogue 8.41), we can only be charmed that Proba (1.242) associated Adam's disastrous decision to eat forbidden fruit with a futile love. The line was quite probably suggested to Proba by "malus" which led her to think of "malum" and Damon is singing of his futile love for Nysa, whom he first saw "parvam . . . roscida mala / . . . cum matre legentem" (Eel. 8.37-38). When God sentences Adam and addresses him, "heu miserande puer" (Proba,</page><page sequence="2">86 VERGILIUS 1.254), the words used by Anchises of the young, doomed Marcellus, Augus- tus' chosen ''e'v(Aeneid 4.882), the effect is doubly pathetic and meaningful for the classicist who knows the original passage: the heir to earthly dominion has lost his heritage. Many more examples could be mentioned. Those related to specific aspects of Proba's work are treated in illuminating chapters which reveal Proba's traditional Roman values (domestic and social), her interests in Christian ritual and theology, her view of the universe, her acceptance of the myth of feminine evil, her use of classical typology and the device of fore- shadowing events, and the means by which she Christianized Vergilian ac- counts of the Golden Age. The authors agree with Amatucci 's speculation that Proba was motivated to begin or to finish her cento by an edict of Julian the Apostate which forbade Christians to teach classical texts to their students (pp. 98-99). Be- cause she wished to make some knowledge of Vergil's style and the best of Latin poetry available to the Christian young, she transformed the purpose and meaning of Vergilian lines by using them to create a Christian epic. She was successful. Her work was a Christian Schoolbook in the eastern Roman empire and continued to be used in the west for Christian education until the seventeenth century. Boccaccio praised Proba in De Claris Mullerbus. Proba was a Roman aristocrat, a woman of consular rank. Her brother, husband, and two sons all held high offices in Roman government (pp. 98-106). She shared their values of filial piety, love of children, faithful friendship, and marital devotion, virtues which were both Christian and Roman. Unlike other Christian writers, Proba never exalted asceticism, and her Jesus does not command the rich young man to sell his possessions and distribute his wealth to the poor. Still, like Aeneas saving Anchises from burning Troy, she says that she would go "through fire and a thousand flying spears" and, like Aeneas, who promises to commemorate Anchises' death even if "exiled on the Gaetulian sands", would follow her Savior to the ends of the earth and practice his rituals. Her new-born Jesus, like the false Ascan- ius, radiates a divine glow. As Metabus in flight carries infant Camilla at his breast, so Mary shelters Jesus from Herod's massacre of the innocents. Less appropriate are Proba's use of lines from the episode of Nisus and Euryalus to describe God's implacable punishment of Adam and Eve, and her transferrai of the far from perfect Euryalus' virtue and grace to Jesus. As Vergil's Creusa calls Aeneas "sweet husband", so Proba addresses her own spouse, Adelphius. Proba's Christianity is chiefly a religion of peace, and she sees herself as a Sibyl-like vates of it. Instead of a muse, she invokes God, and often refers to Him in words used by Vergil for Jupiter. Her favorite episodes from the life of Christ are the baptism and the Last Supper. (She omits the parables and the Beatitudes.) For the baptism, she ineptly uses Vergil's account of Turnus' leap into the Tiber, perhaps because no other passage in the Aeneid could serve her subject as well. Her version of the Last Supper owes much to Aeneas' ritual sacrifices for Anchises, and Jove's promise to Juno that he will give the Trojans new rites. Proba's concept of God is as anthropomorphic as</page><page sequence="3">VERGILIUS 87 Vergil's of pagan deities. She never mentions the Holy Spirit, and thinks of the Father and the Son as menacing givers of biblical laws. Thus Christ is enraged by those who break them. Unbiblically tempted by a snake, Christ calls it perfide , an epithet borrowed, perhaps unconsciously, from Dido's curse of Aeneas. The hell described by Proba's Jesus will receive several groups of sinners who suffer in Vergil's underworld, all described in lines derived from Aeneid VI. When Jesus predicts the Last Judgment, "the flames . . . hostile force" of punishment come, indecorously or through free associa- tion, from Vergil's account of the results of the Judgment of Paris. Neverthe- less, Proba's sense of fitness generally prevails, and unerringly leads her to explain the death .of Jesus, like that of Palinurus, as "one life . . . given for many". Proba's description of the Creation and the Fall is the earliest lengthy account of these events in Christian poetry, but she departs from the ac- counts of Genesis in many instances. For her, there was no "deep" before the Creation, but Vergilian "murky air". Her description of the seasons, derived from Georgics I and II, is unlike anything in Genesis, and the one of God sending rain comes from Vergil's account of the sexual mating of Heaven and Earth in Georgics II. Only four days precede the creation of man. Proba's most important source for the Creation, however, is Anchises' speech to Aeneas in the underworld {Aeneid VI). For Proba, as Anchises says, she and all things (?) exist through "mind" (by which she understands God) and come from heaven as a "seed of fire" which must resist repression by the body, as she hopes her poetic inspiration will. The Son of God, like Anchises' "divine seed", is God's "energy, celestial Source". The visit of Aeneas and the Sibyl to the underworld gives Proba lines to describe her divinely inspired ambition to reveal things "deep. . .mist-veiled", God's words on ejecting Adam and Eve from Eden ("Away, be far away,/ O impious outsiders"), both uttered about or by the Sibyl, and the sufferings of those in hell. Aeneas' attribution of dira cupido to souls awaiting rebirth give to Proba God's question about the motives of Adam and Eve to commit sin. She ascribes the wounds of muti- lated Deiphobus to Christ on the Cross. The "hallowed fruit" of the Forbid- den Tree in Proba's Eden was Vergil's description of the golden bough, the price of Aeneas' admission to the underworld and, as a result of his experi- ence there, to enlightenment and rebirth. Although Proba, unlike other Christian writers, never makes Eve subject to men and gives her the same punishment (death) as Adam, her Eve is the cause of the Fall, and by Vergilian lines that she uses to describe Eve, Proba associates her with a variety of mythological women: Clytemnestra, Dido (more often than with any other woman mentioned by Vergil), Helen, and, as a cause of disaster, Lavinia and Eurydice, not to mention the monstrous Scylla. Obviously, Proba agreed with male Christian writers that woman dis- obedient to God was the cause of evil in the world. Proba employs lines from Eclogue IV, Georgics I, II, and IV, zx'Ã  Aeneid I and VIII, all related to the ancient concept of the Golden Age, to describe</page><page sequence="4">88 VERGILIUS God's happiness at the Creation, his creation of stars, the life of Adam and Eve in Eden before the Fall, the results of the Fall, and the murder of Abel by Cain. In the most striking of her adaptations, the infant Jesus becomes the nova progenies of Eclogue IV, and it is his cradle around which flowers blossom. Because no known Christian interpretation of Eclogue IV predates Proba's poem, she must have been one of the first to use it for a Christian purpose. Although one may question the rendering of a few phrases ("social cons- cience" for pietas . . . Ulla) "to veneer men's ways with peace" for pacique inponere morem ; "keep the Faith" for maneant in religione ), Hatch's trans- lation of Proba's cento is remarkably true to the Latin oiginal, metrical (in iambic pentameter), sensitively phrased, and a pleasure to read. Notes to both the text and individual chapters are designed to aid Latin- less readers as well as classicists and mediaeval ists, and to explain as concisely as possible the passage annotated. The bibliography is thorough and full. This volume merits study by anyone interested in Vergil's influence upon later literature. Hollins College Bettie Forte</page></plain_text>
