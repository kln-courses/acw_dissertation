<plain_text><page sequence="1">Notes ALTDORFER. Thomas Noll finished his habilitation on Altdorfer at the University of Göttingen in 2001, but it took a few years for the book to be finally published (Thomas Noll, Albrecht Altdorfer in seiner £eit: Religiöse und profane Themen in der Kunst um 1500, Munich and Berlin, Deutscher Kunstverlag, 2004, 608 pp., 265 b. &amp; w. ills., €89). It would have been tempting to start a discussion on the terminology of the so-called Danube School or 'Donaustil', including the underlying methodology, but that was not the author's aim. He summarizes the issues briefly, pointing out that the dis- course was pardy driven by a patriotic and sometimes nationalistic understanding. But this traditional explanation does not help us to understand the particular religiosity or the approach to images in Altdorfer 's œuvre. Consequently, following Theodor von Frimmel and Christopher S. Wood, Noll saw in this artistic style or manner of design a more per- sonal approach by Altdorfer and a few others than the reflection of a general movement. The religiosity that imbues this work is the main focus of Noll's book, leaving a much smaller section to the subject of earthly love. A large part of the book is taken up with religious images, mostly prints, in particular the series of the Fall and Redemption of Man and various images depicting the Crucifixion and images of the Virgin, including a Young Man Praying in Front of the Virgin. Noll prefaces the discussions and analysis of the various prints - and also of some carefully included drawings and paintings - with a general overview of religious literature, ranging from Gregory the Great, St Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventura and Nikolaus von Kues to various forms of popular religiosity. This provides a contex- tualization for Altdorfer's works against a background of prints and images by Cranach, Dürer and Baldung. Overall, Noll tries to show Altdorfer's particular approach to a Catholic tradition of religious imagery, both to its official position and to more popular practice. This seems surpris- ing at first glance, because in recent years these images have been discussed mostly in a Protestant context or as back- ground to the misuse of images in the Catholic Church before Luther. But such an approach is a logical response to the deep religiosity of southern Germany during the first quarter of the sixteenth century. Noll succeeds in elucidating this religious practice through the large number of texts and pamphlets that he cites. Even though he cannot prove, in most cases, that Altdorfer knew a particular text, Noll shows the basic use of these and similar images, their relationship to contemporary religious literature, the importance of cer- tain texts for the understanding of Catholic imagery and the rôle of these prints in religious practice of the time. In the overarching discussion of religious imagery in the early six- teenth century this is a new perspective, and the great num- ber of sources will surely open up future insights into these prints. In his second section Noll discusses the devotion that is more carnal, mostly the appearance of couples such as Pyramus and Thisbe, but also their links to contemporary literature, and he then brings in a few prints with the more general subject of the relationship between Men and Women. Some of the discussion is already slightly super- seded by the recent catalogue from Dresden on this subject (see Print Quarterly xxii, 2005, pp. 462-66), but Noll's remarks on the iconographical tradition of these themes remain a very valuable contribution. CHRISTIAN RÜMELIN STEFANO DELLA BELLA. Stefano della Bella: Ein Meister der Barockradierung , edited by Dorit Schäfer (Karlsruhe, Staatliche Kunsthalle, 2005, 254 pp., 402 b. &amp; w. ills., €29) is the catalogue of a recent exhibition held in Karlsruhe (4 June-21 August 2005). With exhibits drawn primarily from the museum's own permanent collection, and gaps filled in by loans from other German institutions, this is both the first time that this collection has been on show to the public and the first time that a German museum has devoted a monographic show to della Bella. Focussing entirely on his print production, the exhibition contained none of his numerous drawings, although some are included as additional illustrations in the catalogue. The commonly encountered problem of choosing which of Stefano's thousand prints to exhibit is largely avoided by the size of the collection from which they are taken, as it consists of c. 440 etchings, of which 375 are reproduced in 68 catalogue entries. The first of two essays in the catalogue is written by the exhibition curator, Dr Dorit Schäfer, and provides an intro- duction to the artist, following his critical reception from the fame he enjoyed during his lifetime, through the negative associations of being termed an 'imitator of Callot', to the recent renewal of interest in his work. She also contributes a technical and stylistic analysis of his etchings, discussing both his early stylistic influences and development and his later technical experiments, in particular his attempts to recreate the effects of watercolour wash in his etchings by brushing acid directly onto the plate. Perhaps the most inter- esting information concerns the collection itself, the bulk of which was amassed by Friedrich V of Baden-Durlach during the artist's life, and which therefore serves both as evidence of Stefano's fame and popularity during his own time and as a case study of contemporary collecting. Interestingly, Stefano della Bella is revealed as the only Italian printmak- er included in Friedrich V's otherwise rich and representa- tive collection, his inclusion only warranted, apparently, by virtue of his stylistic closeness to Callot and Dutch print- makers rather than to that of his compatriots. Friedrich V died in 1659, however, and the last period of Stefano's life is not so well represented in the Karlsruhe collection; even so, PRINT QUARTERLY, XXIII, 2006, 2</page><page sequence="2">NOTES 187 important works such as the Views of Pratolino are to be found there, and others, such as the Views of the Port of Livorno , are covered with loans from other institutions. The second essay, by Jessica Mack-Andrick, deals with Stefano's virtually lifelong enjoyment of patronage by the Medici, his position at the Florentine court as a chronicler of events, both festive and military and his period of resi- dence in Paris, during which he fulfilled a dual function by undertaking commissions for the French royal court, there- by also asserting the high quality and standing of Florentine art. Mack-Andrick also discusses the plate col- lection of the Grand Dukes of Tuscany, which was aug- mented by many of Stefano's plates acquired during his lifetime, as well as by 96 presented after his death by his brother Ludovico to Grand Duke Cosimo III, Stefano's former drawing pupil. The 68 catalogue entries are presented in nine sections, all divided by subject-matter except for one representing his work in Paris, and an opening and concluding section cov- ering, respectively, his early and late works in Florence and Rome. Each section is basically chronological, every exhib- ited work is illustrated in black and white, and those not exhibited are listed at the end of the catalogue. These the- matic divisions, while perhaps useful on one level, seem to create a slightly misleading impression of Stefano's work, making it harder to grasp his simultaneous interest in genres as varied as military movements, landscapes and courtly fes- tivities, and failing to highlight the way in which his works inform one another across genres, such as the naturalistic representation of exotic animals that appear in various stages of metamorphosis in his ornament prints. Although comprehensive in the information provided in individual entries, the catalogue's major shortcoming is in its illustrations, not of the exhibited works, but in terms of those additional images reproduced both in essays and individual catalogue entries. The layout leaves very little space for such illustrations, with the result that preparatory drawings are often mentioned (and even described as 'wonderful'), but either not reproduced at all or appearing in such a small for- mat as to make them practically undecipherable. As all the reproductions are black and white, this is particularly true of the few paintings and large-scale works illustrated, such as Callot's large view of the Siege of Breda or the topographical View of Pratolino , reproduced alongside Stefano's six views of the park, which is so tiny and dark as to render its insertion virtually pointless. I cannot help feeling that in some cases, particularly those concerning stylistic and technical discus- sions, the catalogue might have benefited from slightly short- er entries and rather larger reproductions which might then have served to illustrate the author's point, rather than leav- ing the reader frustratedly squinting at the tiny images sup- plied. In spite of this shortcoming, however, the catalogue does provide an interesting addition to recent work on Stefano della Bella by focussing on one particular collection formed by a contemporary collector, and presents Stefano both as an important artistic figure and as a chronicler of events, whose works can thus serve as visual documents of his age. JOANNA NORMAN NOLLI, VASI AND PIRANESI. The exhibition of the maps and prints of Nolli, Vasi and Piranesi, curated by Mario Bevilacqua at the Palazzo Fontana di Trevi, Rome (27 November 2004-7 February 2005), was accompanied by an informative and well-illustrated catalogue (Molli Vasi Piranesi: Immagine di Roma Antica e Moderna , Rome, Artemide Edizioni, 2005, 96 b. &amp; w. ills., €30). This contains essays by the Curator on the evolution of Nolli's 1748 map from carto- graphic developments elsewhere in Italy, and contributions by other scholars, including Marcello Fagiolo on the maps of Rome, Mario Gori Sassolo on Vasi's Magnificenze, Mary Sponberg Pedley on improvements in map-making tech- niques and the links between cartography, scientific research and antiquarian studies in Rome during the mid-eighteenth century (a particularly interesting study), and Giorgio Marini on the Italian vedutisti. When savants of the Age of Reason sought to impose order on Nature by the precise measurement of the countryside, they could rely on newly improved surveying instruments to enhance the accuracy of the maps that they produced. Accurate maps were not, however, an end in themselves; they were also important both for fiscal reasons and for the preparation of infrastructure projects such as roads and bridges. Hence, in the early part of the eighteenth century, the Emperor Charles VI employed teams of geome- ters to make detailed surveys of the Habsburg dominions in Lombardy. One such official was Giovanni Battista Nolli of Como, who was involved in a number of these surveys before he moved to Rome in 1736. Here he was commis- sioned by a group of scholars in the circle of Cardinal Alessandro Albani to create 'the most accurate map of Rome yet produced', with particular attention to the ancient topography and all traces of Roman remains (see fig. 98). The young Piranesi, who had arrived in Rome in 1740, is said by his early biographer, Legrand, to have gained his first knowledge of the antiquities by working with Nolli, and Bevilacqua plausibly identifies the newcomer from Venice with the 'young man' cited in several contemporary docu- ments as accompanying Nolli on his visits to antiquities to take measurements, and to libraries to check plans and prints. Piranesi could also have had useful exposure to sur- veying through his uncle, Matteo Lucchesi, who was survey- or to the Water Magistrate in Venice, and it is possible that he was introduced to Nolli by Giovanni Filippini, a Venetian surveyor who had worked with Nolli on the survey of Lombardy. Piranesi had come to Rome hoping to make his name as an architect, but soon realized that the age of grand build- ing projects in Rome was over. He was lucky, therefore, to have a window onto the world of antiquity opened to him- through such a stimulating and useful apprenticeship. It inspired him to develop his subsequent career both as anti- quarian and supreme delineator of ancient Rome. Through Nolli, he was introduced to an intriguing puzzle that was stimulating contemporary scholars. Nolli had been invited by Diego Revillas, Professor at the Sapienza and himself a notable map-maker, to collaborate with him in editing the Forma Urbis , a jumble of ancient fragments of the map of</page><page sequence="3">l88 NOTES 98.

Seveřan Rome that had been assembled on the Capitol. It was a tantalizing puzzle because so many of the pieces were lost. Nothing came of the scheme, and when Piranesi came to devise his own layout of the Campus Martius some years later, he largely ignored the fragments as unworthy of the Roman giants who, he believed, deserved a grander magnificence. Magnificenze was the tide of the series of volumes by Piranesi's other early mentor, Giuseppe Vasi. In contrast to many of his contemporaries, Vasi was little interested in antiquity, concentrating his efforts on reproducing the splen- dours of modern Rome, or rather on a pedantic depiction of the principal churches, palaces and urban scenery of the preceding Baroque period. Whereas his printmaking tech- nique is dull, his enormous panorama of Rome from the Janiculum is spectacular both in size and in its comprehen- sive embrace of the city, from St Peter's on One side to the Palazzo Corsini in the centre with the Palazzo Farnese behind it - seat of his patron, the King of the Two Sicilies - and terminating in the gushing waters of the Acqua Paola. It is an impressive achievement, but it could not have been achieved without the basis of Nolli's map. JONATHAN SCOTT THE TABLEAUX HISTORIQUES DE LA REVOLUTION FRANÇAISE . In Print Quarterly , xx, 2003 (pp. 80-82), I gave an account of a major study by Claudette Hould on this famous series of plates that recorded the major events of the French Revolution in 144 plates published between 1791 and 1802. At the end I noted that a complementary volume on the texts that accompanied the plates was promised. This has now appeared under the tide La Révolution par l'écriture , les Tableaux de la Révolution Française , une enterprise éditoriale d'infor- mation iygi-i8iy (2005, 508 pp., fully illustrated, €50). It is jointly published by the Musée de la Révolution Française in Vizille and the Réunion des musées nationaux in Paris, and the author is again Claudette Hould. It performs the same service for the text of the series as the previous volume did for the plates. After a brief introduction (pp. 10-38) the text is divided into five columns that print in parallel the five ver- sions of text that accompanied the first 50 plates of the series (taking us up to February 1791). These come from the suc- cessive editions of 1791-94, 1798, 1802, 1804 and 1817. The texts of the first 48 plates were written after the plates had been made, and so reverse the usual order of precedence of text and illustration. The interest of the later editions lies in</page><page sequence="4">NOTES 189 the way that the text was changed to reflect the political changes in the intervening years. Needless to say the great- est change of all - the Restoration of 1814-15 - led to the 1817 edition having a more or less completely new text. In order to make clear the changes, the text has been cun- ningly laid out so that the full text of the first edition down the left column is matched by the changes introduced (only) in the subsequent editions. These are printed in italics, so are immediately visible. This process must have made the designer's task intensely difficult, and leaves acres of white paper throughout the book. At the end (pp. 490-505) are various appendices of prospectuses and other relevant docu- ments, and a list (pp. 506-11) of copies consulted. Professor Hould will conclude this remarkable series of studies with a third volume on the drawings for the series, announced to accompany an exhibition in Vizille in 2007. We look forward to reporting when this is published. ANTONY GRIFFITHS PIETRO ANTONIO MARTINI. The department of the History of Art in the University of Barcelona has in recent years started its own journal, published under the unusual and delightful tide of Locus Amoenus. In volume vii for 2004, pp. 255-70, is an article by Vicenç Furiò with the title 'Ver la historia del arte: los grabados de Pietro Antonio Martini sobre las exposiciones de París y Londres de 1787'. It con- centrates on Martini's two prints that show the Salons of the two rival capitals in the same year, 1787. Martini also made plates of the Paris Salon of 1785 and the Royal Academy in 1788, although they do not form part of this study. The author's focus is to compare the two prints with contempo- rary written accounts of the exhibitions, and to reflect on the relation between the two methods of description. The London print recendy formed the central piece of the show Art on the Line' held at the Courtauld Galleries, London, in 2001, where it was used to reconstruct the hanging of the 1787 exhibition in the very room in which the 1787 exhibi- tion had been held. REPRODUCTIVE PRINTS. Paper Museums : The Reproductive Print in Europe , 1500-1800 by Rebecca Zorach and Elizabeth Rodini (Chicago, The David and Alfred Smart Museum of Art, 166 pp., 8 col. and 121 b. &amp; w. ills., $24), is the catalogue of an exhibition held at The David and Alfred Smart Museum of the University of Chicago (3 February-15 May 2005) and subsequendy at The Grey Art Gallery of New York University (13 September-3 December 2005). Initiated in Chicago by the Smart Museum as a faculty-based exhibition and supported principally by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Paper Museums draws atten- tion to an aspect of printmaking that has been all too easily underestimated in the recent past. As is admirably demon- strated in this publication, there is not only a particular skill in making reproductive prints simulating a diverse range of original works of art, but also specific reasons why such prints were thought to be desirable and were constantly in demand. As Zorach and Rodini say in their introduction, 'Reproduction held deep cultural value in the early modern period; it was a means of transmitting ideas and developing an artist's own visual vocabulary'. Not only were reproduc- tive prints part of an artist's education as a vital source of inspiration and a useful yardstick, they were also important for the nurturing and development of taste in a wider cul- tural context. This was particularly so when the prints were published in book form, either as a compendium or as a catalogue of a famous collection. Four essays elucidate the ideas underlying the exhibition: 'Creativity, Authenticity, and the Copy in Early Print Culture' by Alexandra Korey, 'The Female Printmaker and the Culture of the Reproductive Print Workshop' by Lia Markey, 'Translating Stone into Paper: Sixteenth- and Seventeenth-Century Prints after Antique Sculpture' by Sarah Cree, and 'Conspicuous Imitation: Reproductive Prints and Artistic Literacy in Eighteenth-Century England' by Dawna Schuld. Such portentous tides somewhat belie the exhibition's fairly limited aim in demonstrating the cul- tural significance of the reproductive print. None the less, this aim is indeed successfully achieved, while at the same time reminding the viewer what pleasure these prints can give if acquired (still at reasonable prices) privately. Clearly, and understandably, there is a tendency today to think of reproductive prints in terms of single sheets. This might be designated a Print Room mentality, but it is perhaps more important to keep in mind that originally such prints, even if not published in book form, were kept like drawings in albums shelved alongside the books in the libraries of grand houses. It would be a pity if this physical dimension for the appreciation of the reproductive print were to be forgotten. The prints exhibited in Paper Museums were admired as much for their subject-matter as for their intrinsic artistic merits, but how and where they were viewed is just as telling. CHRISTOPHER LLOYD EXTRA-ILLUSTRATION. Lucy Peltz has made this subject very much her own, and has produced a series of articles in recent years on aspects of it. The most recent of these is tided 'Facing the texts: The Amateur and Commer- cial Histories of Extra-illustration c. 1770-1840', and is con- tained in the collection of essays, Owners, Annotators and the Signs of Reading, , edited by Robin Myers, Michael Harris and Giles Mandelbrote (New Castie, DE and London, Oak Knoll Press and The British Library, 2005, £25, pp. 91-136). It is very well researched, with 90 footnotes, and is by far the best single discussion of the subject currentiy available. We all look forward to her promised full-scale book on the subject. This is also the place to mention that this volume is the 25th in the series called 'Publishing Pathways' which began in 1979. These have contained the collected papers delivered at annual conferences in London on aspects of publishing history. This volume includes a complete list of the contents of all 25 books, together with an index of their authors and a brief account by Nicolas Barker of the conferences and their history, antony Griffiths YOSHITOSHI AND JAPANESE PORTRAIT PRINTS. Hotei Publishing continues its exploration of</page><page sequence="5">igo NOTES colour woodblock prints produced by ukiyo-e artists in the Meiji era (1868-1912) with John Stevenson's Yoshitoshi's Strange Tales (Amsterdam, Hotei Publishing, 2005, 160 pp., 90 col. and 1 b. &amp; w. ills., €68.50, £45, $95). Stevenson begins with a wide-ranging introduction to the place of folk tales and ghost stories in Japan and their representation in prints (and paintings), with particular emphasis on Meiji artists. He then provides commentaries on the 24 prints in Yoshitoshi's (1839-92) One Hundred Tales of Japan and China (Wakan hyaku monogatari) of 1865 and the 36 prints in his New Forms of Thirty-six Strange things (Shinken sanjürokkaisen) of 1889-92. These are Yoshitoshi's finest sets devoted to the confronta- tion by humans of ghosts, monsters and other supernatural creatures. In the earlier set the artist's heavy debt to his teacher Kuniyoshi (1798-1861), the great master of warrior and ghost prints in the last years of the Edo period, is evi- dent in every design. At the same time, elements of Yoshitoshi's personal style break through. This set appeared at a time of deep political and economic crisis in Japan trig- gered by the forced 'opening' of the country to trade and proselytizing by the Americans and the rest of the Western powers. The Tokugawa regime was struggling to survive; the country faced the prospect of civil war. The images of brave Japanese resolutely facing unknown threats that dominate this set must have appealed to contemporaries as their famil- iar world crumbled. Despite the uncertain times, no falling off in the quality of printing is evident in this set. The second set, New Forms of Thirty-six Strange Things , appeared a quarter of a century later. In this set Yoshitoshi reveals his assimilation of Western modes of representation and his masterly use of imported synthetic pigments. The designs occupy a new and radically different visual world. The artist often chooses to represent the moment of extreme tension when the human hero first senses the presence of an as-yet-unseen monster. These designs display tremendous inventiveness in terms of composition and total command of all the effects possible in the woodblock print medium. These contrasting sets are presented in their entirety in full-page colour plates; each design is accompanied by Stevenson's lively and accessible commentaries on the facing page. The book is designed and produced to a high standard. However, some of the prints from One Hundred Tales of Japan and China reproduced in it are poor quality later impressions. While such impressions attest to the popularity of the set, they have no place in what is intended to be the definitive publication of these prints. In addition, the smudged quality of some of the plates suggests that they were derived from poor quality transparencies. Stevenson writes repeatedly of the special printing effects used in both sets: somenzurì in which patterns are created over a solid block of colour by burnishing the surface; and karazuri in which fine patterns are impressed into the paper. No attempt was made to bring these effects out in the photographs. Strong Women Beautiful Men: Japanese Portrait Prints from the Toledo Museum of Art by Laura J. Mueller (Amsterdam, Hotei Publishing, 2005, 96 pp., 67 col. and 87 b. &amp; w. ills., €21.50, £19.99, $29.95) reveals the strengths and suggests some of the weaknesses of the Japanese print collection in the Toledo (Ohio) Museum of Art. The book is the catalogue of an exhi- bition that sought to reveal 'the changing appearance of the human figure and the evolving approach to portraiture' in Japanese woodblock prints. What distinguished the exhibi- tion was the heavy presence of shin hanga (literally 'new prints') in it. Shin hanga were commercially produced in Japan from the late 1910s onward. They were made in the traditional manner through the collaboration of artists, block-cutters and printers under the supervision of publish- ers - in opposition to sosaku hanga ('creative prints') in which the artist executed all the stages of print design and produc- tion himself. Because they were intended primarily for the foreign market of American and European collections which expected fine graphic art to be available in limited editions, shin hanga were issued in editions of often no more than 150 impressions, in contrast to editions of thousands of impres- sions that were the norm for commercially produced wood- block prints in the Edo and Meiji periods. The Toledo Museum of Art hosted two important sale exhibitions of shin hanga in 1930 and 1936. A local collector purchased a complete set of the 342 prints exhibited in the first show and 58 from the second show and in 1939 donat- ed them all to the Museum. As a result, the Toledo Museum possesses one of the most important collections of shin hanga in the world. For the exhibition, shin hanga prints of actors and beautiful women were selected and hung with examples of Edo-period ukiyo-e prints of the same subjects. While some fine eighteenth-century designs were available for inclusion in the exhibition, fine nineteenth-century actor prints appear to be poorly represented in the collection. As a result, the selection of images published in this book is uneven and unrepresentative. Mueller attempted to fill the gaps by including illustrations of material in other collec- tions in her admirable introductory essay, 'The Changing Faces of Japanese Woodblock Prints'. She also provides informative, extended captions to accompany the fine colour plates of 50 of the 85 prints that were in the exhibi- tion. In an appendix, she offers short biographies of the 25 artists represented in the show. There is also an exhibition checklist with small black-and-white images of all the prints displayed in Toledo. ELLIS TINIOS WHISTLER IN CANBERRA. Thanks to two acqui- sitions made in 1978 and 1980, the National Gallery of Australia owns a significant collection of prints by Whisder. The first of these was a group of prints acquired from the American collector Charles C. Cunningham, which had been previously owned by George Washington Vanderbilt, the subject of one of the artist's late portraits in oil. Two years later the gallery purchased a substantial number of lithographs that had been in Whisder's studio at his death. The first of these acquisitions provided the material for Canberra's recent exhibition of the American's etchings, which was accompanied by a modest catalogue written by Jane Kinsman, An Artist Abroad : The Prints of James McNeill Whistler (Canberra, National Gallery of Australia, 2005, 88 pp., 66 col. ills., A$24-95). The show included a complete</page><page sequence="6">NOTES 191 French set published by the printer Auguste Delâtre on a very yellow ochre paper, if the illustrations are to be trusted; fourteen of the sixteen etchings from the Thames set pub- lished by Ellis and Green; a complete first Venice set pub- lished by the Fine Art Society; and 24 of the 26 etchings from the second Venice set published by Dowdeswell and Dowdeswells. The collection has impressions of the first and eighth state of Nocturne : Palaces and a very early trial proof and an impression of the final state of Fruit Stall. The conservator Andrea Wise provided a brief note on Whistler's papers and their watermarks, which the gallery is in the process of recording digitally. Seven of the water- marks can be found at http: / /www. nga.gov.au/Whisder/ watermarks.cfm. accompanied by scholarly notes by Kassandra Coghlan and Bill Hamilton. These lead the read- er to another source for watermark research at the Institute for Advanced Technology at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, at iath.virginia.edu/ gants/ wm3-foli0.html. devoted to a study of the papers used in the printing trade in late Tudor and early Stuart London, under the direction of David L. Gants. The earliest watermarked paper in the Canberra collection is from the sixteenth century, bearing a Bishop's Crosier from Basel, which was used for an impression oï Annie Haden. Whistler also used a paper with a much later version of this image for a lithograph of his brother, Dr William Whistler. Among the Canberra watermarks illus- trated is the Fortune figure found on the paper from four of Whistler's lithographs. Coghlan and Hamilton attribute this to Van der Ley and Van Gelder's Fortuyn mill from the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century. The most common- ly recurring watermarks among the 118 in the gallery's Whistler collection are Dutch, or variations of Whatman papers. Of its total Whistler holding, 142 prints are on unmarked papers. The most unusual watermarks to be found here, according to Coghlan and Hamilton, are an eighteenth-century Arms of Burgundy and a Beehive from a De Erven de Blau mill in the Zaanstreek region, martin HOPKINSON CUNO AMIET. In 1974 a New York Times critic wrote, Amiet comes as a real revelation', when the exhibition 'Three Swiss Painters' was shown at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. However, this master is yet to be properly discovered beyond the boundaries of his native country. Born in 1868 (he died in 1968) Amiet was one of the leading Swiss painters of the twentieth century.

It is astonishing to see how Amiet's artistic career spanned such diverse artistic movements as academic Realism, Impressionism, Symbolism and Expressionism. He even looked briefly into Cubism, as well as Italian Futurism, although he was less attracted by these movements. He was the only painter to have belonged both to the Gauguin circle in Pont-Aven and to the first German Expressionist group, Die Brücke. Indeed, when he exhibited in Dresden early in 1905, he even contributed to the formation of the latter. Between these two milestone events Amiet had returned to Switzerland, where he encountered first the art of Segantini and later that of Ferdinand Hodler, whose influ- ence on him was to prove strong and lasting.</page><page sequence="8">NOTES 193 A recent exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts in Soleure (20 August-20 November 2005) and its accompanying catalogue, Cuno Amiet: Frühe Arbeiten auf Papier (Heidelberg, Kehrer Verlag, 2005, 160 pp., 80 col. and 79 b. &amp; w. ills., CHF49), have shown that Amiet was an excellent draughts- man as well as a gifted painter. The artist's works on paper have rarely been exhibited, and little research has been done on them. The important retrospective in Bern and Geneva in 1999-2000, curated by the late George Mauner, was ded- icated exclusively to a key selection of early paintings, works from 'Pont-Aven to Brücke'. In the Soleure show, Viola Radlach, who is also the editor of the rich and voluminous correspondence between Amiet and Giovanni Giacometti (Zürich 2003), and Christoph Vögele, the Museum Director, throw new light on the range of techniques Amiet used in his works on paper - pencil, watercolour, pastel, gouache, etchings and prints. These works show even more clearly the stages in the artist's devel- opment from his early school years in Munich (1886-88) and Paris (1888-92), through his important stay in Pont-Aven, Brittany (1892-93), up to the first 20 years he spent in the rural region of Oschwand (1898-1919), revealing the various influences to which he was exposed. Armand Séguin (1869-1903) is said to have introduced Amiet to the art of etching in 1893, and the following year the artist wrote to his long-time friend Giovanni Giacometti that he was busy doing etchings and would soon send him some samples. Fourteen of his seventeen etchings were made before 1905. As early as April 1895 he mentions a lith- ograph, presumably a portrait of his fiancé Anna Luder, made in quick, broad, rather decorative strokes, devoid of detail. He used lithography sporadically during his career, but from the 1920s onwards he regularly sent lithographs, mostly drawn from nature (apple harvest, garden scenes, etc.), of the paintings he was doing at the time, to friends and relatives, usually as a New Year gift. Excellent portraits are also to be found in this technique, including self-por- traits and portraits of colleagues and friends. Physiognomy seemed to have been more easily captured on the stone than at the easel. Amiet was always open-minded and eager to experiment. At the same time he enjoyed drawing and sketching extensively, mostly in a rather painterly manner. His lines are strong and his forms - landscapes, people, ani- mals - tend to abstraction, often dominated by black-and- white contrasts. They almost anticipate the woodcuts, the technique he favoured between 1903 and 1909, and of which 20 works remain today. Among them are various Ex- Libris as well as the famous portrait of Giovanni Giacometti reading (fig. 99), cut in 1904 and published in the collective portfolio of the Brücke artists in 1907. A certain Japanese virtuosity can be recognized, which makes it clear that Amiet was one of the few artists who was able to blend the style of the Gauguin circle with that of the Brücke move- ment. Some of his coloured woodcuts belong to the high- lights of Swiss printmaking (fig. 100). He played a major rôle as a synthesizer, adapting and fusing a range of Modernist techniques and seeking the strongest possible expression of a given subject. To a certain extent he embodied the vari- ous manifestations of artistic exploration and advances in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century. THERESE BHATTACHARYA-STETTLER BRETON PRINTMAKING 1880-1960. Over the last 20 years the Musée de Pont-Aven has regularly organized exhi- bitions featuring printmakers who have worked in Brittany. For the latest show in the series the Curator, Catherine Puget, has selected 100 prints of the 400 that have been acquired by the museum over this period, presenting them in 'L'estampe en Bretagne 1880-1960'. The accompanying catalogue {L'Estampe en Bretagne i8oo-ig6o , Pont-Aven, Musée de Pont-Aven, 2006, 129 pp., 103 col. and 18 b. &amp; w. ills., €25) does not claim to break new ground in scholarly research, but provides a fine corpus of illustrations demon- strating the wealth of high quality prints that were inspired by the Breton landscape and people. Puget divides the artists into five categories: Bretons by birth, Bretons by adoption, visitors who spent a few days or weeks in Brittany, print- makers who depict Breton religious or political subjects, and foreign artists. Of the first group the best known figure is Laboureur, from Nantes, who made surprisingly few prints of his native region. The two woodcuts shown here of a Breton calvary and a Breton chapel are refreshingly unfamiliar. These contrast strongly with the stylized woodcuts of his contem- porary, René Quillivic, in which waves resemble early Celtic decorative sculpture. The most familiar adoptive sons of Brittany are Charles Cottet and Lucien Simon, the two lead- ing members of La bande noire. Cottet's typically bleak aquatint of three women in mourning is partnered by a Simon colour lithograph, indebted to Cassatt, of a much happier subject, a grandmother and two children. Artists on holiday make up one of the larger groups, pro- ducing some of the surprises such as a Gromaire-like group of figures on a quayside in a woodcut by Yves Alix, and an anthropomorphic haystack in an etching by the Nancy dec- orative artist Victor Prouvé, who stayed at Carnac in the second decade of the twentieth century and devoted a series of etchings to the Morbihan. Many of these visitors were associated with La Jeune Gravure Contemporaine. More individual than the works of artists associated with this soci- ety is the etching of the coast at Perros-Guirec, by the under- studied Dutchman Conrad Kickert. Kickert settled in Paris in 1909 and exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants in 19 10, the same year in which he founded the Moderne Kunst Ring in Amsterdam. During a visit to Ploumanac'h in the summer of 1913, where he met Le Fauconnier, he made a set of six etchings, Paysages de Bretagne, which were published that year by the Moderne Kunst Ring. Foreigners include the Englishman Robert Bevan, the Italian Anselmo Bucci and the prolific Irishman Edward Millington Synge, brother of the playwright, here represent- ed by an etching of 1900 of the little town of Pont-Aven itself, taken from a hillside above. Puget records that he also visit- ed Concarneau and that his œuvre consists of 370 prints. It is surprising that there has been no detailed study or exhibi- tion of his work. Artists whom one might not have expected</page><page sequence="9">194 NOTES to have visited Brittany are the Austrians Carl Moser and Max Kurzweil, who were together in Concarneau in 1902. Moser may have returned, as The Fishmarket , Douarnenez, one of the two colour woodcuts in this exhibition, is dated 1929. Woodcuts were published in Breton periodicals such as Kornog and illustrated Jeanne Malivel's Histoire de Notre Bretagne, as Puget notes. Artists in the milieu of the Seiz Breur renewed the old tradition of images of pardons, pulled in large quantities, few impressions of which, however, survive today. Georges Robin of Nantes and Xavier de Langlais contributed to a suite of colour woodcuts of fourteen saints of Brittany, Pevarzek Sant a Vreiz, which Kornog published in 1928. The Brest artist Pierre Péron produced five colour linocuts in a series, Images populaires de Bretagne , published in his home town by the Galerie Saluden in 1935. This review has concentrated on the more unfamiliar prints revealed in this catalogue of the Musée de Pont-Aven's exhibition, which also included works by many of the artists generally associated with Gauguin and the Ecole de Pont- Aven, including fine impressions of prints by Amiet, Bernard, Gauguin himself, Maufra, O'Connor and Seguin. MARTIN HOPKINSON THE FIRST WORLD WAR IN ITALIAN ART. Until very recently far less attention has been lavished on the sub- ject of Italian artists' response to World War I than on that of several other European nations. The Museo Marino Marini in Florence followed exhibitions held in the last cou- ple of years in Venice, Rome and Castel Tirolo near Bolzano with a show (3 December 2005-25 March 2006) and accom- panying catalogue, La Grande Guerra degli artisti: Propaganda e iconografia bellica in Italia negli anni della prima guerra mondiale (Florence, Pagliai Polistampa, 2005, 308 pp., 165 col. and 275 b. &amp; w. ills., €45). Propaganda was addressed by the concen- tration on the work of Cipriano Efisio Oppo (1890-1962), best known as a leading member of the Novecento group and as the long-time Secretary General of the Direttorio Nazionale dei Sindicati delle Arti Plastiche, which was central to the policies of Mussolini's Fascist government from the late 1920s. During World War I Oppo produced caricatures for the Roman newspaper LTdea Nazionale, all 213 of which, executed between 1915 and 1918, are illustrated and accompanied by brief commentaries in an appendix. Other wartime illustrators and caricaturists, including Giuseppe Russo, Enrico Sacchetti, Giuseppe Scalarmi and Adriana Bisi Fabbri, were well represented in the show. A number of illustrated journals produced by the troops were also included, among them La Ghirba, to which Soffici and De Chirico contributed, and Montebello, the fortnightly trench publication to which Sironi provided designs. Posters, however, were excluded. The substantial catalogue to the exhibition includes five essays, of which two, written by its editor Nadia Marchioni and by Vincenzo Farinella, address topics of particular inter- est to readers of Print Quarterly. The latter goes beyond Italian art to discuss the importance of Grünewald's Isenheim altarpiece for German artists at the front, particularly George Grosz and Otto Dix. He also relates the reversal of black and white in Dix's etching of bomb craters to the white line woodcuts of Urs Graf. Farinella sees Graf's series of 152 1 drawings of the brutality of war, housed in the Kunstmuseum, Basel, as foreshadowing Dix. He argues that Beckmann's 1915 etching The Grenade is indebted to Goya, and he sees Beckmann's wartime work as dependent on El Greco, Signorelli and Michelangelo, as well as on Grünewald. Among the artists in the Florence exhibition was the Roman painter and illustrator Duilio Cambelotti, represent- ed here by La siepe of 1914, a horrific woodcut of skulls and bones piled high against a fence, executed ironically in a style indebted to Viennese Secessionist art. The imagery in two other skull-strewn works of the same date by the artist, the ink drawings La pace and Come le acque erano cessate sopra la terra, can be related to Klinger's famous cycle devoted to the life of a glove, and to Flemish prints, engravings after Bosch and the etchings of Cambelotti's contemporary Walter Vaes, whose work he could have seen at the Venice Biennali. A very different source, that of Hokusai's Manga , can be found in Carlo Biscaretti's processional illustration, Il ritorno degli internati, published after the end of the war in Numero, vi, December 1918, p. 222. Marchioni stresses the impact on Italian artists of the work of the great Dutch lithographer and poster designer Louis Raemaekers. His work was regularly reproduced in Italian newspapers and his wartime postcards were widely circulated. Marchioni identifies direct borrowings made by Bisi Fabbri and Oppo. We learn from her essay that Forain was sent to Italy by the French high command in connection with his work on camouflage. There, in Carpi, he met Antonio Discovolo, who was also involved with designing camouflage. Discovolo met him again later in the war in Fontainebleau. Discovolo was one of the artists promoted by Ettore Cozzani in his journal L'Eroica. Although the works by Discovolo in this exhibition seem to have little to do with Forain, it is possible that other Italian artists, such as Plinio Nomellini and the young Romano Dazzi, were aware of the Frenchman's etchings and lithographs. Italian printmakers generally shied away from represent- ing the more dramatic events of modern warfare. The etch- er Anselmo Bucci explained what he saw as the impossibili- ty of representing the conflict itself: 'Nella raffigurazione di questa guerra, dovrà scomparire molto. Scomparirà forse il visibile. L'invisibile dovremo dipingere'. So his drypoint series, Croquis du front italien , depicted more prosaic aspects of military life. Action was limited to a column of bicyclists with rifles on their backs riding at speed to the front. All descrip- tion of the background settings was omitted, whether of sol- diers represented huddled in a group over a map or resting before an attack. Some of his subject-matter, such as the changing of guard at an outpost, recalls that of the military etchings of Fattori made in the last twenty years of the nine- teenth century. Fattori's prints are also brought to mind by the woodcuts of Gino Barbieri, in which the short, roughly cut lines may deliberately echo the sometimes inelegant marks made on his plates by the Tuscan. Barbieri belonged to the more conservative wing of Italian woodcut artists.</page><page sequence="10">NOTES 195 However, he did experiment with tonal effects and chiaroscuro through variations in inking akin to 'acquaforte mobile', as can be seen in a woodcut of soldiers reading and writing by lamplight printed in sepia and blackish-green ink. Barbieri's soldiers were individualized, unlike those in the first wartime woodcuts of the anarchist Lorenzo Viani. The features of the gunners in his woodcut letter heading for the 315 Batteria Nera are left completely blank. Marchioni argues that Viani's illustrations to Marino Ferretti's war diary, Dall' Ermada a Mauthausen , date from 192 1, the year of its publication, as against the opinion of Rodolfo Fini, who in his monograph on the artist placed them between 1916 and 1 92 1. Viani's expressive gouging is well suited to the depiction of the harshness and desolation facing the ordi- nary soldier in captivity. Adolfo Balduini, who Marchioni associates with Viani, dramatized the human costs of war in a series of woodcuts of 1915, depicting a group of war widows and a column of troops being waved off to war. His frieze-like compositions have echoes of the prints of Kollwitz, as does the pathos in such works as Visioni tragiche and Massacro. However, Balduini reverted to a more tradi- tional De Carolisian style for his subscription ticket in aid of the families of those called to arms. The more public nature of this print perhaps prompted this change. Emilio Mantelli, a Genoese artist who became a La Spezian by adoption, was the artist most favoured by L'Eroica , the journal founded in La Spezia by Ettore Cozzani. In one of his most effective prints of soldiers cutting a barbed wire fence, he used crim- son and orange inks to allude to the forthcoming bloodshed. In Gli eroi , a wounded man is carried like the body of Christ by his companions, a comparison made by Marchioni. The bleakness of a woodcut of a troop of muleteers winding their way slowly up a featureless hill is comparable to the wood- cuts of Nolde. Mantelli's portrait prints are direct and sculp- tural, as he crops the top of them, letting the heads of his sitters burst out of their blocks, martin hopkinson GIUSEPPE GUIDI. To print historians, Giuseppe Guidi is probably best known as the artist who in 1922 taught Carlo Carrà to etch, when Carrà was living above Guidi's print workshop in Cremona. The exhibition at the Palazzo delle Esposizioni, Faenza, 'Giuseppe Guidi (1881-1931). Un poeta per D'Annunzio. Incisioni, smalti e ceramiche',, and its accompanying catalogue of the same title (Faenza, Edit Faenza, 2003, 144 pp., 142 col. and 16 b. &amp; w. ills., €45), should do much to expand knowledge of this Emilian artist, whose work as an enamellist attracted the patronage of the poet Gabriele D'Annunzio. D'Annunzio commissioned Via Crucis , a group of fourteen plaques from Guidi in 1924, and later acquired five other major works from him that were included in this exhibition. Some of D'Annunzio 's letters to the artist are reproduced in the catalogue, which also includes several of Guidi's ceramics. The publication reprints the obituary of Guidi that Carrà wrote for L'Ambrosiano in 1931. Forty-eight of Guidi's etchings, aquatints and woodcuts were in the show. Full appreciation of his development is considerably hampered by the lack of dates assigned to them in the catalogue. One can glean termini ante quos for some from their inclusion in early exhibitions and from biblio- graphic references. Two prints bear dates written by the artist. Appreciation and judgement are further hindered by the quality of their illustrations. Each print is reproduced in a uniform light khaki colour, which is hard to credit as being true to that of their supports. This includes the two works described in the catalogue as polychrome woodcuts. At least fourteen of the prints come from posthumous pulls. In a brief essay Alberto Mingotti claims that Guidi's masters were C allot and Goya, and among his contemporaries, Vallotton, Kollwitz, De Carolis, Carrà and Casorati, while Piero Lenzini provides an overview of his life and artistic activity. Guidi's work has also been treated in recent years by his son-in-law, Emmanuele Aicardi, in his Le acqueforti e gli smalti di Giuseppe Guidi 1881-ig^i (Albenga, n.d. 1995), and by Valentino Donati, Un artista nell'ombra: Giuseppe Guidi (1881-igßi) (Castel Bolognese 1991), and L'arte di Giuseppe Guidi ( 1881-igsi j: Rivalutazione di un' artista (Imola 1996), none of which this reviewer has seen. Born in Castel Bolognese, Guidi was active as an anar- chist from his teenage years. It appears that it was politics that led him to travel to Vienna, Budapest and Paris, earn- ing a living there by painting ephemeral publicity material. It was only in his mid-twenties that Guidi took up art, exhibiting his first works in Budapest, at the Vienna Secession and at the Salon des Indépendants in the French capital in 1908. Later that year he attended evening classes with the Faentine ceramicist, Pietro Melandri, at the Accademia di Brera in Milan. Guidi wrote the libretto for Virgilio Ranzato's operetta Velivolo, and from 1909 to 1915 he contributed to the Munich journal Jugend and to the Turin- based Per l'Arte. He exhibited fourteen etchings at the Esposizione d'Arte degli alleati at Milan's Palazzo della Permanente. Organized in support of families, some of whose members had been killed or wounded in World War I, this exhibition had a theme of war heroes. At the end of the war Guidi gave up painting in oil to devote himself to printmaking. In 1919 Ettore Cozzani's publishing house L'Eroica commissioned him to make 40 woodcuts to illus- trate Rodolfo Fumagalli's Ali e Alati. From the single illustra- tion in this catalogue, it seems that at this stage Guidi adhered more to the neo-Renaissance tradition of De Carolis than to the emerging Expressionist alternative strand in contemporary Italian woodcuts. However, the etchings and aquatints in this exhibition devoted to plebeian city life show an affinity in subject- matter with Lorenzo Viani. Comparisons can be made with the pre-war prints of French artists such as Charles Cottet, whose work was shown in the Venice Biennali. Guidi's prints were particularly notable for their deep chiaroscuro and tonal effects. Financial success in a group show held in Cremona in 1922 enabled him to open a print workshop in the city. The following year Guidi had a one-man show of 50 etch- ings at the Galleria La Vinciana in Milan, and later the same year another exhibition of over 40 prints at the Bottega d'Arte in Livorno. The sculptor Adolfo Wildt wrote the pref- ace to the catalogue to the latter show. It was at this period</page><page sequence="11">ig6 NOTES that Guidi took up enamel. The nudes in some of his enam- els approach Wildt's style, as well as echoing Viennese Secessionist art. In 1925 he had a one-man exhibition of enamels and 44 etchings at the Pinacoteca Comunale in Forlì. Lenzini records that the prices of the etchings ranged from 60 to 150 lire, as opposed to 300 to 500 lire for the enamels. Guidi sent three etchings to the 'Prima Mostra d'Arte del Novecento' in Milan in 1926, and seven more in 1927 to the Esposizione Nazionale d'Arte, also in Milan, but refused an invitation to exhibit in the 1929 'Novecento Italiano' show. Most of Guidi's enamels were devoted to reli- gious subjects, and his aquatints include a triptych of The Calvary and a suite of prints devoted to the life of St Francis. Individual prints from this series seem to have been pub- lished in editions of ten to twenty. The largest edition record- ed in this catalogue, of 48, was of a nude, Eve. An etched mar- ket scene is an updated version of Pieter Bruegel. Guidi also etched cows and Roman ruins. Most of his enamels were in a very different style from the prints, some of them deliber- ately echoing Duecento or early Trecento altarpieces, antique intaglios and vase painting. Guidi's portrait enamels, however, sometimes recall the woodcuts of Viani, martin HOPKINSON THE YOUNG AFRO. The city of Udine has recently celebrated the 30th anniversary of the death of one of its native sons, Afro Basaldella, with an exhibition of works on paper that he made between 1930 and 1947. The show was accompanied by a catalogue edited by Isabella Reale, Nel segno di Afro Basaldella. Il giovane Afro. Ricerche , confronti e affinità (Udine, Galleria ď Arte Moderna and Paolo Gaspari Editore, 2006, 96 pp., 67 col. and 53 b. &amp; w. ills., €17). The last works of 1946-47 in the exhibition showed the artist moving towards Abstraction under the strong influence of Picasso. Until then Afro had been firmly figurative and a leading painter among the young artists associated with the Scuola Romana. Isabella Reale and Gilberto Ganzer pro- vide the principal essays in the catalogue outlining Afro's development. Shorter contributions come from Gianluca Tedaldi, Eugenio Manzato and Alessandro Del Puppo. Of these, the first is of the most obvious interest to readers of this Journal, as it discusses the relationship between La rissa, a 1932 drawing by Afro, and Lotta , a 1938 etching by the Roman painter Alberto Ziveri. Both artists exhibited with Libero De Libero 's Galleria della Cometa, but it remains uncertain if Ziveri actually saw Afro's drawing. Surprisingly, none of the essays discusses the processes used by Afro for his works on paper. Quite a number of them are traced monotypes. The works in question date from 1937 to 1945. Afro's subjects range from still lifes and portraits to nudes and a beach scene. This last is touched in watercolour. Also reproduced are two still lifes of c. 1939 that appear to be oil monotypes. The style of these and of some of Afro's other works raises questions as to his knowledge of the work of Filippo De Pisis. A couple of the earliest works on tracing paper presented here, including a copy of a paint- ing by Ë1 Greco, have been traced through from the recto of earlier drawings. One of the later monotypes of 1944, of a nude male, has echoes of the gothicizing emaciated figures in the sculpture of Adolfo Wildt, despite the fact that after seeing his work at the first Rome Quadriennale in 193 1, Afro had written scornfully of it to the painter and collector Maria Perretti, as Reale records. The strongest influence on Afro's work in the early 1930s was Corrado Cagli, who also used tracing paper. Afro was close to him from 1933, when he and one of his sculptor brothers, Mirko, settled in Rome. The three artists visited Paris together in 1937, and the traced technique may have been picked up in the French capital. Mirko also worked on tracing paper, and a self-por- trait of 1938 reproduced in this catalogue has the air of a traced monotype. Afro often used the same models as his brothers. A 1940 monotype portrait of Liliana is juxtaposed in the catalogue with a near contemporaneous bust of her in wood by Dino Basaldella. martin hopkinson ALECHINSKY. A major retrospective covering the long printmaking career of the Belgian artist Pierre Alechinsky took place last year at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France (7 June-4 September 2005). The bulk of the selection came from the holdings of the library itself, which automatically accessions a specimen of every print registered for copyright purposes. Now nearly 80, Alechinsky has amassed over 2,000 prints since his début in 1946. The publication Les Impressions de Pierre Alechinsky (edited by Céline Chicha and Marie-Françoise Quignard, Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, 2005, 144 pp., 119 col. and 10 b. &amp; w. ills., €39) offers a sampling from this huge corpus , along with an inter- view with the artist and essays by the poet Gérard Macé and others. As a student in Brussels, Alechinsky studied book illustra- tion, typography and photography at La Cambre, the National College of Architecture and Decorative Arts. He then turned to painting in a Surrealist vein. It was in 1949 that, thanks to the intervention of Christian Dotremont, he became an ardent convert to the Cobra movement, meeting Asger Jörn, Karel Appel and others and espousing the group's preoccupations with child art and psychotic art, and the kin- ship of poetry and image-making. Stretched between three capital cities (Copenhagen, Brussels and Amsterdam), 'CoBrA' lasted only three years as a co-ordinated movement (1949-51). During this time Alechinsky ran a 'research centre' or communal workshop at the Ateliers du Marais in Brussels, presiding over a lithographic press and editing the group magazine. Later he studied in Paris, absorbing the lessons of the great printmaker William Hayter at Atelier 17. The catalogue illustrations show Alechinsky's skill in adapting the uninhibited spontaneity he had learned from Cobra to the technical demands of printmaking, whether this be etching (his favourite medium), lithography, wood- engraving, linocut, drypoint on celluloid, drawings repro- duced through heliogravure or offset, or any other of his private inventions. In an interview with Curator Céline Chicha, the artist confides a few secrets, such as Hayter's tech- nique of pressing varnished fragments of textured fabric onto the plate, or his own trick of dipping a goose quill in rosin and alcohol, or wielding a brush saturated with dissolved sugar.</page><page sequence="12">NOTES 197 As a painter in oils, Alechinsky achieved fame with flam- boyant abstractions in a vein of passionate Expressionism, and much of this gesturality is reflected in his no less impetu- ous prints. In 1955 he visited Japan to investigate the Zen tradition of calligraphy and made a brilliant film, Calligraphie japonaise , with a commentary by Dotremont, who was him- self an obsessional poet-painter with a penchant for elegant, if usually illegible, calligraphic compositions. One of the hallmarks of the Cobra artists was their commitment to the interaction, if not the collision, of two channels of expression - writing and the visual sign. Whether invoking ancient tra- ditions or simply working intuitively, these artists invested in the iconic dramatization of lettering, producing pictures that are like visual slogans, enigmatic and often aggressive. Alechinsky's style is instantly recognizable, lying some- where between the child's scrawl and the zany cartoon. His inquisitive line meanders, jinks, darts and drifts, often turn- ing back upon itself. Curves and spirals are paramount, sometimes forming mandalas or shapes reminiscent of medieval illuminated capitals. But there is no solemnity here. Alechinsky's adroit squiggling is like slang, blissfully degenerate, blithe and cheeky, often sharply to the point. It generates innumerable funny creatures - imaginary beasts or humanoid grotesques reminiscent of the doodlings of Victor Hugo or Alfred Jarry, or the rampant inventions of Art Brut practitioners like Gaston Chaissac or Jules Doudin. The carnivalesque influence of James Ensor has been spotted by some commentators; as has that of the Art Nouveau artist and designer Henry van de Velde, who taught Alechinsky at La Cambre: caricature and vegetal ornamentation are foremost components of the Alechinsky repertoire. Another facet of the style is the use of squared boxes or cells whose varying content, in mimicry of cartoon strips, suggests the stages of a narrative. The cells are often set along the bottom of a larger image, as though to qualify or explain it; sometimes they form a frame about the larger image, teasing the viewer, who has no fixed starting-point from which to decipher the whole. This delight in margina- lia and irrelevance seems typical. Alechinsky's countless commissions as a book illustrator - many exemplified in this volume - make one want to ask where his priorities lie, and whether the imagery is intended to outstrip, complete or tac- itly converse with the text in question. Alechinsky's collabo- rations are legion: the most notable being with Michel Butor, whose texts he has annotated on numerous occasions, as in a series where he doodles mischievously over the writer's discarded typescript. Such antics suggest a curiously oblique relationship to the text supposedly being 'illus- trated': suffice to say that Alechinsky's printmaking is never subservient to an external directive. It manifests a robust autonomy, and, if it sometimes borders on the puerile, it is never shy or hesitant. This selection of impressions presents an artist who is unabashedly his own man. ROGER CARDINAL MAX BILL. A book accompanied the retrospective exhi- bition of Max Bill's work held at the Kunstmuseum Stuttgart (10 September 2005-8 January 2006) and due to travel to Japan, South America and elsewhere (Thomas Buchsteiner and Otto Letze, Max Bill: Maler, Bildhauer, Architekt, Designer , Ostfildern-Ruit, Hatje Cantz, 2005, 294 pp., 233 col. and 159 b. &amp; w. ills., €34). After three introductory sections on key themes (Max Bill and Kandinsky, Georges Vantongerloo, and the Hochschule für Gestaltung Ulm), the text expands on the four rôles signalled in its title to provide six roughly equal discussions: Bill as architect, product designer, sculp- tor, painter, printmaker and typographer. Each section opens with a short text by Bill himself - he was also a proli- fic writer - followed by commentary on that aspect of his work, in several cases written by a member of his family or his close circle of colleagues, and concludes with a set of reproductions. After a chronology of Bill's life, the book is rounded off with tributes to him accompanied by pho- tographs. This is not a catalogue of his work, but rather an engaged introduction to it. The volume has been thorough- ly designed in the Bill spirit, featuring the lowercase typo- graphy of which he was a lifelong adherent, set in his customary typeface (Monotype Grotesque), and using a well- chosen contrast of papers for the text and picture sections. Max Bill (1908-94) spanned the twentieth century in a more than just chronological sense. After a training in sil- versmithing at the Kunstgewerbeschule at Zurich he went to the Bauhaus at Dessau (1927-28), attending the classes of Klee and Kandinsky, among others. Back in Zurich, he soon began to live out the Bauhaus dream of total artistic activi- ty. By the mid- 1930s he had already embarked on his six chosen areas, with a remarkable and convincing sense of assurance. Unlike Modernist artists of the subsequent gen- eration he never abandoned the assumptions of 'fine art' - in sculpture, for instance, making one-off pieces in highly polished marble or copper - yet his work professed a demo- cratic impulse. This is clearly seen in his 'applied art'. Bill's architecture, product design and graphic design were car- ried out with full seriousness and stand with the best work of those who specialized in only one of these fields. Further, the Constructivist idea in art, of which Bill was one of the for- mative exponents during its emergence in the 1930s, aspired to touch the fundamental structures of life. Through then- very abstraction and mathematical structures, Constructivist forms were intended to inhabit and vivify everyday life more fully than any literally representational work. Bill may well be a case of an artist for whom print rather than paint allowed a fuller expression of his talent. The two- page commentary on the prints is provided by his son Jakob - an artist in his own right - who makes the essential points. Bill's prints were fresh creations rather than reproductions of existing pieces, and he tended to group them in series. The Quinze variations sur un même thème (1935-38) are a striking case in point. Printed by lithography and letterpress, these pieces range from configurations of skeletal lines to the contiguous areas of flat colour that he would pursue in the screenprints of his later years. Although Bill's explanatory text to Quinze variations is transcribed here, its introductory pages are omit- ted; one can see them reproduced in the very well illustrat- ed survey, Max Bill : Typografie, Reklame, Buchgestaltung (Sulgen 1999). In the 1940s Bill worked as part of the Allianz group</page><page sequence="13">198 NOTES of artists and was able to publish further sets of prints in small editions (the context of wartime Switzerland dictated small runs, as did the natural size of the market for Constructivist art). Here, as in later sets of his own prints, Bill's design of the whole portfolio, including the covers and accompanying text pages, makes for an especially coherent whole. The posters and catalogues that he designed for his own shows must also be considered as part of an unusually expansive artistic rôle. The many-sidedness of Max Bill's activities may have obscured our sense of his oeuvre. Certainly a consideration of his work as a painter, sculptor, and print artist needs to incorporate the evidence of his work as a typographer, prod- uct designer and architect. The exhibition and this book will be good prompts in this direction. ROBIN KINROSS CHRISTIANE BAUMGARTNER. An exhibition at the ICON Gallery in Birmingham (27 July-18 September 2005) was the opportunity to see a kind of retrospective of Christiane Baumgartner and to obtain a current catalogue [Christiane Baumgartner , edited by Nigel Prince, Birmingham, Icon, 2005, 89 pp., 21 col. and 73 b. &amp; w. ills., £15). Baumgartner seems at first glance to be too young for such an exhibition, but the number of works on display in Birmingham reveals her creativity and the large number of works she has made so far. After her studies in Leipzig, where she still lives, and in London at the Royal College of Art, she had several exhibitions in Germany and the UK, but also in Switzerland, Norway and Japan. The Birmingham show, however, concentrated on more recent woodcuts, although it also included some older screenprints, a livre d'artiste and a few videos to give a more general back- ground. This is important, because video stills and photos are the basis for most of the woodcuts. In her more recent works Baumgartner uses video stills, either as single images or as sequences to create generally large-scale woodcuts. Jeannette Stoschek describes this process and the artist's approach to modern cities and motion in her clear, precise and highly detailed essay. Stoschek stresses the importance of this process of materialization from the immaterial visual information as a digital image to a much larger print. The prints are usually created through horizontal lines, lending them an unreal and unclear appearance that at first glance overshadows the technique. In the large sheets especially, such as the more than four metres-wide print of two Transall aircraft from 2002, woodcut as a contemporary technique gains new aspects (fig. 101). But it is not just sheer size that distinguishes these prints from other contemporary wood- cuts. The combination of video images and Baumgartner^ particular technique enable her to represent movement, either as one's own in a car, or the movement of others, while she stands still on a bridge looking down onto a high- way. At the same time, some of these prints, like the series One Second (1 Sekunde ), add to the movement the aspect of time. The 25 images are the individual stills of a single second (fig. 102), and through them Baumgartner is able to create the impression of driving through a landscape. It is like a video or film sequence, but in a different technique and split up into individual images. This is not the only series or sequence of prints where Baumgartner deals with this particular issue, and the catalogue illustrates and dis- cusses other series and images as well, resulting in a good survey 01 her work so tar. CHRISTIAN RÜMEUN JAMES DODDS. A note was published in Print Quarterly, XIX, 2002, p. 403 on the Essex relief printmaker James Dodds. A second publication has just appeared on his prints for the Jardine Press. Written by Elly Robinson, James Dodds and the Jardine Press (London, Jardine Press, Wivenhoe and David Messum Fine Art, 2006, 56 pp., 45 col. and 83 b. &amp; w. ills., £15) records the fourteen books illustrated by Dodds that the Press has issued since 1984 and catalogues the 67 individual prints that have been editioned. These are pre- dominantly woodcuts and linocuts, but also include a cork 101.

Since Dodds's exhibition 'Shipshape' in 2001, the Jardine Press has published four more books illustrated by his prints, two of which relate to the artist's part in the rescue and restoration of a 'skillinger', a deep sea smack abandoned as a wreck on Mersea Island, which used to work as a dredger off the Dutch coast. In his most recent book, Longshore Drift, Dodds collaborated with the Northumberland poet and historian, Katrina Porteous. In this case his linocuts illustrate Aldeburgh beach boats, and a basket of the ropes and toggles used by Suffolk fisher- men. MARTIN HOPKINSON ORIGINS OF MODERNITY. Augustana College, Rock Island, has a policy of involving students and staff in the research and cataloguing of its exhibitions. The latest of these was the multidisciplinary collaboration, 'Origins of *</page><page sequence="15">200 NOTES Modernity', for which the catalogue ( Origins of Modernity , Rock Island, Augustana College, 2005, 254 pp., 235 col. ills., free) was edited by Catherine Carter Goebel. Funding by the Paul A. Anderson Endowment has enabled the college to make the publication, in its first edition at least, free. The exhibition ranged from a sixth-century BC Attic black-figure cup to a 1963 red earthenware pitcher painted by Picasso. It was designed to complement various liberal arts courses in the College. Research for the catalogue involved both cur- rent and former students and members of various depart- ments. Among the contributors was the President of the col- lege, who wrote the entry on Philippe Galle 's 1559 engraving after Pieter Bruegel the Elder's Justicia . This pedagogical exhibition ranged very widely over the collections of Augustana, which were supplemented by a few loans from private collections. Introductory essays were provided by the editor and by Errin Coppie, Michael Skelton and Dana Kau. The last of these, on 'Toulouse-Lautrec and Scenes of Modernity', was the most relevant for readers of this Journal, but prints were also referred to in both the other contributions. Page-length entries accompanied full-page reproductions of the works in the show. The catalogue provides an encapsulation of the breadth of the college's print collection, which starts chronological- ly with woodcuts by Dürer and Holbein. There is a spec- tacular engraving by Willem Pieters De Leeuw after Rubens's painting of the hunt of a hippopotamus and croc- odile. High art was not privileged in the exhibition, which included engravings from Diderot's Encyclopédie and a group of prints relating to American history, as well as two of Jacques Villon's outstanding reproductive aquatints after Matisse and Léger, works mistakenly often considered beyond the pale for art historical academic study. A coloured pencil drawing by Henri Edmond Cross in the collection is claimed here to be preparatory to Les Champs- Elysées , the colour lithograph published in Pan in 1898. Also to be found is an unfamiliar colour aquatint by the Puvis de Chavannes pupil, Emile Dezaunay, Messe en Bretagne , very much indebted to Bernard. Major masters are repre- sented as well, generally by impressions of well-known prints, but occasionally, as in the case of Heckel's 1946 woodcut Sächsische Arbeiter, by the relatively little known. MARTIN HOPKINSON COPPER PLATES. Volume xx of the Atti dá Civici Musei di Storia ed Arte di Trieste (of 2004, but published in 2005) con- tains on pp. 285-322 an article by Furio de Denaro on Tl fondo calcografico del Civico Museo di Storia ed Arte di Trieste: osservazioni a proposito di un intervento conserva- tivo'. Few outside the museum itself will have known that it contained a collection of 158 copper plates, bequeathed at various times between 1883 and 1938, and all of them are catalogued in an appendix here. The most interesting are an early copy after Dürer's engraving of the Virgin of the Moon , and many of the plates by Robert van Audenaerde used in the book by Cardinal Giovanni Francesco Barbarigo, the Numismata Vvrorum Illustrium ex Barbadica Gente , printed in Padua in 1732. This was one of the most richly illustrated books of its period, and the plates are beautifully designed and executed. HAROLD WRIGHT SYMPOSIUM. Australian and New Zealand students of prints have more reason than most to remember Harold Wright's name and celebrate his lega- cy. Following his death in 1961, his widow Isobel Holmes established two scholarships, which - through the continu- ing kindness of the Keeper and staff of the British Museum Print Room - allow two scholarship holders to carry out an intensive study of prints at the British Museum for a period of up to twelve months. The scholarships, one named after Harold Wright, the other after Sarah and William Holmes (Mrs Wright's parents), are administered by the University of Melbourne and were first awarded in 1969. An unusual condition stipulates that the scholarships not be limited to a specific project, nor to specialized research, but that the holder should be able to work widely in one of the world's greatest print collections. It is safe to say that such a schol- arship would hardly be dreamt of these days. A half-day symposium, under the heading 'Philanthropy and the Collecting of Prints, or, Harold Wright and His Legacy to the Antipodes', was held at the University of Melbourne on 15 November 2005. All of the papers were given by previous scholarship holders, but only two were concerned directly with Harold Wright. David Maskill (Victoria University, Wellington), who is working on a biog- raphy of Wright, gave a general introduction to his life as print dealer, publisher and scholar, and announced that an exhibition on Wright's various achievements was being planned for 2007. Sarah Thomas (University of Melbourne) spoke about the influence of Wright on the formation of Australia's major print collections in Melbourne, Adelaide and Sydney. Jennifer Spinks (University of Melbourne) pro- vided a detailed interpretation of the monstrous imagery in an anonymous German broadsheet, Ecclesia Militons (1569), with text by the counter-reformer Johann Nas, an impres- sion of which is held in the British Museum. Luke Morgan (Monash University) used seventeenth-century engraved illustrations in his discussion of the origin and function of trompe l'odi gardens. Geoff Gibbon (Adelaide, TAFE, SA) spoke on the sleeping shepherd theme in Samuel Palmer's art in the context of the landscape of leisure. Anne Kirker (Queensland Art Gallery) examined the rôle and cultural significance of photography in the prints of two contempo- rary Japanese artists, Nöda Tetsuya (b. 1940) and Shimada Yoshiko (b. 1959). In a more personal paper, artist and curator Kirrily Hammond (Monash University) spoke about her practice of drawing from prints as an aid to studying them. The symposium convenor, Professor Jaynie Anderson, said she hoped it would become a biannual event. IRENA ZDANOWICZ THE DAVID BROWN COLLECTION. Dr David Brown (1925-2002) was one of the most remarkable British curators in the last quarter of the twentieth century. Originally a vet, his interests in contemporary art as a pri- vate collector led him to become a curator first at the</page><page sequence="16">NOTES 201 Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, and then at the Tate Gallery, London. On his death he bequeathed the paintings, sculpture, drawings and prints that he had assem- bled over a period of over 40 years to the four institutions that were closest to his heart, and to Swindon Art Gallery, for which his friend and former colleague, Richard Morphet, had been adviser on acquisitions. Visitors to the British Museum's Print Gallery will have sampled a selection of his bequest that was exhibited there in 2004 and 2005. The bulk of Brown's collection, some 220 works, was left to Southampton Art Gallery, whose curator Maurice Palmer had been a formative influence on him, and for which he acted as adviser on acquisitions from 1976, during which time the gallery became known for its notably adventurous policy in the purchase of twentieth-century British art. The Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art and the Tate were the other institutions to benefit from his generosity. Southampton celebrated Brown's bequest with an exhibi- tion and the publication, Boom Boom Cluster: The David &amp; Liza Brown Bequest (Southampton City Art Gallery, 2004, 162 pp., 44 col. and 52 b. &amp; w. ills., £19.95). Richard Morphet pro- vides an essay on Brown as a collector. Extracts are printed from several interviews that he had with staff of the Southampton Art Gallery. The book also includes an affec- tionate memoir by Ronnie Duncan and reprints Martin Brunt's obituary from The Times. All the works bequeathed to the five institutions are briefly recorded. In the case of the Southampton Art Gallery, the largest recipient, the techniques of the prints that Brown bequeathed are unfortunately not described. These are identifiable by the description, 'printing ink on paper'. Southampton received a set of William Blake's wood-engravings for Thornton's Virgil, the one group of pre- twentieth century prints that Brown owned. The largest number of works by a single artist were the screenprints and lithographs of the Scottish poet and sculptor Ian Hamilton Finlay, with whom Brown established a close friendship in 1973. The collections of all five institutions were enhanced by gifts of prints by this artist. Brown's interest in landscape, conceptual art, twentieth-century spiritual art and the art of the St Ives and Scottish schools is reflected in the works that he bequeathed to the British Museum. The first exhibition that he had curated was of screenprints and drawings by Agnes Martin. Through Brown's gift, the British Museum acquired notable groups of linocuts and etchings by Barry Flanagan, roneo prints by Cecil Collins, wood-engravings by Gertrude Hermes and etchings by Allan Gwynne-Jones. This last name typifies Brown's eagerness to appreciate artists whom he regarded as unjustly excluded from the usual canon. Indeed, it was Brown who organized the exhi- bition of the then 90-year-old artist at the National Museum of Wales, which restored his work to public view, martin HOPKINSON PRINT COLLECTOR'S QUARTERLY. The history of Print Collector's Quarterly has, to the best of my knowledge, never been written, and I am not sure that the materials survive to enable this to be done. It was founded in America, and was published first by the dealer Frederick Keppel and then by the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. The founder and first edi- tor in 191 1 was Fitzroy Carrington, Curator of Prints at Boston and a member of the firm of Messrs. Knoedler of New York. Its progress was far from smooth, and it folded in 1917 during World War I. Campbell Dodgson, then Keeper of the Print Room in the British Museum, revived it in 192 1 with a new publisher in London (J. M. Dent) and ushered in a period of stability. There is no doubt that the journal's greatest years were under his direction. He commissioned articles both of contemporary printmakers (many of whose first catalogues he published), and on Old Masters, pressing into service not only his colleagues in the print rooms of the world but also many friends in the trade, such as Harold Wright at Colnaghi's, and even such unlikely collaborators as Kenneth Clark, then at the National Gallery, who wrote a pioneering essay on Braccelli's Bizarrie. I have never been able to find out on what basis Dodgson did this work. He was a wealthy man, as well as a generous and philanthropic one, and it is very likely that he provided his services free as a contribution to the study of prints (as does the editorial board of Print Quarterly). The arrangement with Dent worked very well until the Great Depression of the 1930s when the collapse of the print market forced Dent to stop publication in 1936. 1 imagine that the journal was by then worth nothing, and the title went back to America again. It was taken over by a press in Kansas City, where it was kept going until 1942 (albeit with no fewer than three editors in six years). The war stopped publication and there followed a gap of several years, and then a brief revival in Vermont between 1948 and 1950. This last manifestation was so obscure that the Department of Prints and Drawings never acquired copies of these last two years, and indeed I have still never seen copies. According to the indices, the issues concentrate mainly on domestic American contempo- rary printmaking. It is no secret that when Print Quarterly was founded it aimed to supply the void left by the demise of PCQJas it was always abbreviated), and indeed adapted its name from its precursor. So we welcome unreservedly a newly published index to its contents (Yoram Meroz, The Print Collector's Quarterly : Complete Index ign-ig^o, San Francisco, Alan Wofsy Fine Arts, 2006, 128 pp., 6 b. &amp; w. ills., $50). PCQ did itself publish two indices in 1927 and 1936, but the new one, apart from being complete, is vasdy superior. It has started again from the text of the journal itself and supplies four indices: a table of contents by issue, an index of authors, an index by artist and an index by subject or theme. Unlike the ten-year index that Felix Pollak made of PQ (published in i995)j this index of PC£¿does not aim to be complete: it does not index names within articles, and only the most signifi- cant contributions in the Notes section within each issue are indexed. The author of the index, Yoram Meroz, is to be thanked and congratulated. The same author, with Geoffrey B.Jackson, has produced another index of the only other English-language print jour- nal of the inter- war years that I know of ( The Print Connoisseur: Complete Index ig20-ig$2 , San Francisco, Alan Wofsy Fine</page><page sequence="17">202 NOTES Arts, 2006, 120 pp., 14 col. and 45 b. &amp; w. ills., $50). I have never seen a copy of this journal (Dodgson evidently did not consider it worth subscribing to in the British Museum), and to judge from the articles listed here it was certainly not in the same league as PCQ. Rather, it was a domestic journal put out in America, apparendy partly designed to supple- ment for an American readership those topics that were left out of PCQ. It had one aspect that PCQ never touched: it included original prints, and a list of these, together with reproductions, is given in this index. This makes it useful even to those who do not have access to a run of the journal. ANTONY GRIFFITHS THE WILLIAMS PRIZE. We are delighted to be able to announce that Julie Mellby's article on 'The New Republic's Portfolio of 1924', published in our December 2005 issue (pp. 397-411) has been awarded the Reba and Dave Williams Prize for an outstanding contribution on American Printmaking. We warmly congratulate Professor Mellby for her achievement.</page></plain_text>
