Fitzsimmons, Laura Gámez, and Melanie Forné r ~jCozumel (y Island ULUM scansion Bay For over twentyyears thename Hix Witz, or "Jaguar Hill", has hieroglyphic monuments, a royal palace, and several temple been recognized inMaya texts of the Classic Period (250-850 pyramids to edify their own social, political, and even military AD; Mathews 1985). Women from this kingdom appear as prowess (Breuil, Fitzsimmons and Gamez 2004; Breuil et al. royal brides atancient Maya centers alongside maie captives; 2004; Breuil andGamez2005;Fitzsimmons2004a, 2005b; Gamez Flix Witz elites can be found on hieroglyphic monuments 2005,2006). bringing tribute to the lords of sites like Piedras Negras or Yaxchilan. Despite these references, the location of the Hix Witz polity was not discovered until 2003, when a series ofHix Witz emblem glyphs were identifïed at the sites of Zapote Bobal and El Pajaral, Guatemala, by David Stuart (2003 ; Fig. 1 ). Subséquent epigraphic research by Fitzsimmons in 2004 sug gested that Zapote Bobal was the Late Classic center of the Hix Witz polity, with El Pajaral perhaps declining in overall political importance after the end of the Early Classic. These events prompted the Proyecto PeténNoroccidente-previouslybased at the site of La Joyanca - to initiate a long-term program of investigations at Zapote Bobal, with the ultimate goal being a greater understanding of how the polity formed and survived within a web of larger, historically robust kingdoms who described capturing, killing, and even marrying the Hix Witz nobility. Currently directed by James L. Fitzsimmons (Middlebury College) and Laura Gamez (University of Pittsburgh), the project is a long-term international effort by US, Guatemalan, and French investigators to understand ancient Maya State formation and development at Zapote Bobal. In their inscrip tions, outsiders from the Usumacinta, Central Petén, and Petexbatun régions habitually portray Late Classic Hix Witz as a martial proving ground, a valuable (if militarily coerced) ally, and- in the case of Dos Pilas - a refuge for exiled mlers (Graham and Von Euw 1982; Houston et. al 2000; Federico Fahsen, personal communication 2004).

As this is perhaps the best built of the Zapote Bobal befits a long-lived ancient Maya center, with stelae supports investigated thus far - it consists of rectangu large buildings and monuments in such numbers as to evoke lar eut stones held together with mortar - it is perhaps no a sense of a "heroic past" (indeed, this is the impression wonderthatStela2isstillstandinginitsoriginallocation(Fig. conveyed even to modern visitors), the site appears to have 4). All of the other stelae at the site have either broken away really flourished for at most 300 years, collapsing by 900 AD from their "boxes" or been uprooted entirely through natural (Fitzsimmons 2004a, 2004b, 2005b, 2006). Although radiocar bon dates are currently outstanding, the ceramic sequence for Zapote Bobal supports this hypothesis: extant ceramics are largely limited to Late and Terminal Classic (600-900 AD) types common in other parts of the Petén. Moreover, all of the legible hieroglyphic texts from the site, comprising approxi mately eleven monuments and fragments, are confined to the latter part of the Classic epoch, with dates ranging from between 640 and 750 AD. The Acrópolis appears to be very late, with bedrock immediately below Late Classic levels. Nonetheless, preliminary research outside the Acrópolis, parti cularly as one moves towards the periphery of settlement in the core, provides a stark contrast to this picture: ceramic samples outside the Acrópolis suggest a considerably older and longer history of occupation dating back to the Late Prvvlncdr rann RC 9SO a™ Flg' 4- ZaPote Bobal Stela 2 and associated platform Freclassic (4UU BC-25U AU).

It consisted of seven large river cobbles (8-15 cm in length) arranged in what was likely a tight bündle. The cobbles appear to have been set within the front portion of a pit dug for the base of Stela 14, with mortar poured over them and the stela subsequently set. The second cache (Cache 2) consisted simply of two flat, monochrome, unslipped and overturnedplates set within mortar and fronting Stela 5. The third (Cache 3), recovered near the front base of the fallen Stela 11, consisted of two, nearly identical over turned plates set atop five small river cobbles. The cobbles themselves were encountered in the rough form of a quincunx and were also buried within a thick matrix of mortar. The stelae with which these caches were associated were either never carved (Stela 14) or are today badly eroded (Stelae 5 and 11). Fig. 5.

Given the idea that stelae were focal points for Given that Stela 14 was both blank and graced with a royal performance, places where Classic Maya lords enacted number of stones beneath it, it seems plausible to suggest that cérémonies and deposited items (e.g., see Täte 1992; Looper whatwe see hereis an act of completion, a variant of k'altuun. 2001 ; Christie 2005), such caches were almost to be expected. At the same time, we may also view the cache as part of the rich However, the materials used for these caches, as well as their tradition of bundling widespread in Mesoamerica: cloth bun overall layout, have provided several surprises. dies, considered sacred items bearing "great spiritual power" and containing the "heat" of spiritual essence, are featured on painted pottery throughout the Lowlands and can be filled with maize, images of deities, or other materials (Stuart 2005 : 86). Although no trace of a cloth or similar bündle was recovered from Cache 1, the round, smooth river cobbles were clustered tightly enough to suggest that they were being held together as mortar was poured over them. As encountered, the cobbles were in direct contact with one another and did not appear to have been glued together prior to their encasement in the mortar matrix. As a resuit, the activities around Stela 14 may have involved the wrapping of Stela 14 and the déposition of a stone bündle as part of the Period Ending for which the stela was dedicated. Mortar was then poured over the bündle Fig. 6.

Why did the lords of Zapote Bobal choose to bury seemingly mundane items beneath Stela 14, instead ofj ade or similar precious items that, from other excavations at Zapote Bobal, appear in différ ent ritual contexts? Cache 3 provides some preliminary an swers. This cache does not appear to have ever been bundled, tied, or otherwise wrapped (at least, based upon its condition at the time of excavation), with its stones arranged in a form calling to mind Classic Maya conceptions of cardinal direc tions and the axis mundi: the quincunx, as several scholars have observed, represents the ordered world in Mesoamerica. Outside of simple hieroglyphic représentations like the sylla ble-b'i, visual représentations ofthis concept usually consist of four directions, trees, or maize sprouts surrounding a fífth, central image commonly identified as a world tree oraxis mundi (e.g.,seeReilly 1994,1995; Taube 2000; Estrada-Belli 2006). Given this context, the plates of Cache 3 may be identified as offering plates, used in other contexts for bloodletting, in censé "scattering" or similar ritual activities; indeed, Cache 2 appears to been the result of an abbreviated version of the ceremony for the Cache 3. Cache 3, with its placement beneath (after Fash 2001 : fig! 24) ' Stela 11, would thus roughly set the monument within thtaxis mundi, generating a sacred space. It would have explicitly Unlikebundling images, there are not many illustrations of invoked ideas about world création and cosmology even the k 'altuun ritual in action. The best of these, as pointed out without further clarification from those participating in the byChristie(2005:282),isfoundonthepeccaryskullfromTomb stela dedication. Cache 1 appears to be playing with similar 1 at Copan, where two seated figures flank a stela tightly generative ideas as an exercise of royal power and cosmological wrapped in what appears to be cloth or rope; the stela is either renewal. springing from an anthropomorphic stone or simply set behind In the literature, ties between stones and ideas like renewal an accompanying altar, with the k 'altuun event found in the or régénération come from many sources ranging from such accompanyingtext (Fig. 7).

In each of these Création of the World" events from the Colonial-era Book of cases the stelae (or, in the Dresden situation, acantun or ChilamBalamofChumayel,tocontemporary observations of "stone trees") in question are set atop stone platforms ("boxes") Maya communities (Redfield and Villa Roj as 1934:175;T aube or glyphic représentations of stones themselves. 1988:279). As ElizabethNewsome (2001:208-210) has pointed Fig. 7.

A wrapped stela from K718 (photo courtesy Justin Kerr and Associates)</page><page sequence="5">out, the Copan and Quirigua events tie together primordial hearthstones and stelae in création narratives, where the principal actors in these narratives - Waxaklajuun Üb'ah K'awiil ("18 Rabbit") and K'ahk' Tiliw Chan Yopaat ("Cauac Sky"), respectively - relate their actions in historical time to those of deities in mythical time. Their stelae are, for the moment, at the center of the world. They are the product of an invocation of the mythological three hearthstones, upon which the Classic Maya world is cosmologically based. The stones set up to support the sky in the "The Création of the World", seven in number and born together with maize plants in "The Ritual of the Angels", are the "means through which the gods assure the renewal of life for the world they have just created" (Newsome 2001:207). They are both animat ing and transformative in nature, and although they are pillars - not individual stones or cobbles - they clearly overlap conceptually with stelae, world trees, hearthstones and con cepts likeaxis mundi, création, and régénération. Moreexplic itly tied to the idea of individual stones as generative are the crosses surmounting stone piles at the entrances of Yucatec Mayacommunities(RedfieldandVillaRojas 1934:175;Taube 1988:279) that, as Christie (2005:283) has pointed out, clearly overlap ritually with stelae; they are 'bound' in muchthe same way as the acantuun or the Classic Maya examples from Copan and Quirigua. It seems likely that the Maya were engaging similar con cepts in the création of the caches at Zapote Bobal, generating a sacred space through the déposition of stones and, subse quently, stelae above them. Further examples at the site would be needed, however, to be able to specify which of the above archaeological or contemporary examples is the most applica ble for comparison to the practices of the Classic Maya dynasts in the Northwest Peten. Sacred from the Mundane Caches are usually defined as ritual deposits independent from human burials, often hidden or buried, which bear mate rials of ceremonial significance. The expectation is that offer ings so interred - when royal - bear evidence of considerable workmanship or are of an exotic nature, set apart fforn everyday objects. Stela caches are traditionally filled with ceramic ves sels bearing "maize, cacao or blood, small flaked flint or obsidian blades, and even fragments of stalactites" (Newsome 2005: 686). Yet at Zapote Bobal we find stones, mere river cobbles, being used in this capacity. They are serving as Fig. 8b. A stone tree from the Dresden Codex (after Kumatzim Wuj 2001: 26) Fig. 8b. A stone tree from the Dresden Codex (after Kumatzim Wuj 2001: 26) Fig. 9. Detail of Cache 3 (ZB 130-18-964); (drawing by James L. Fitzsimmons) Fig. 9. Detail of Cache 3 (ZB 130-18-964); (drawing by James L. Fitzsimmons) generative agents, aiding in the transformation of a stelae from inanimate to animate. When we think of how a stela is erected ceremonially, the act of "raising" a monument or "driving it into the ground" as referred to in Maya inscriptions, we immedi ately think of a potential text or cache vessel. We might even highlight a complex ritual, such as that performed by Waxakl ajuun Ub'ah K'awiil for Stela A: the monument mentions how the remains of aprevious king were 'peeled' or 'sliced' (susaj) and, 60 days later, a substela cache was set in connection with the raising of that stela. What we do not typically do is view the supportive architecture for a given stela as part of the ritual act. What the meager caches at Zapote Bobal force us to do is to reduce a substela cache, as well as associated architec ture, to its most basic elements. In doing so we find a ritual that is a negotiation with the earth, the création of a sacred space defined for the purposes of erecting a mock "world tree". However hyperbolic in its grandiosity, the act of setting a stela cache, whether as a wrapped bündle or a meticulously planned collection of ideas, makes the items in that cache sacred. At Zapote Bobal as elsewhere, even the most ordinary artifacts can carry meaning, and in the context of caching behavior, the mundane can become the sacred.

Resumen: Los resultados de tres temporadas de investigaciones en el sitio arqueológico Zapote Bobal han demostrado que éste corresponde a la entidad política Maya Clásica Tardía (650-850 DC) conocida como Hix Witz ("Colinadel Jaguar"). Excavaciones realizadas en el Grupo Ritual Central (GRC) y la Plaza Principal del sitio evidencian una rica tradición escultórica, particularmente representada por una "galería" de monumentos compuesta por al menos 25 estelas y altares de diversos tipos, distribuidos en una serie de alineaciones paralelas; así como por pares de estelas y altares colocadas al frente de estructuras piramidales, en el estilo característico de la región central de Petén. Investigaciones en torno dichos rasgos son reveladoras en cuanto a las practicas rituales propiciatorias asociadas los mismos, así como acerca de los métodos utilizados por los antiguos Mayas para erigir tales monumentos. En conjunto con información proveniente de otras áreas del sitio, el estudio de monumentos y escondites rituales contribuye a la caracterización de las prácticas rituales en la antigua Hix Witz. Zusammenfassung: Die ersten beiden Feldkampagnen in Zapote Bobal des Proyecto Petén Noroccidente (PNO) in den Jahren 2005 2006 haben bestätigt, dass die Stätte in der Späten Klassik (650-850 n. Chr.) tatsächlich mit dem aus den Inschriften bekannten Ort Hix Witz, "Jaguar Berg" identisch ist. Die Arbeiten der letzten Jahre, insbesondere in der Grupo Ritual Central (GRC) und dem Hauptplatz haben darüber hinaus eine reiche Skulpturentradition ans Licht gebracht, darunter eine Galerie von mindestens 25 reliefierten und in Reihen aufgestellte Steinmonumente. Darunter befinden sich auch eine auf zwei Seiten skulptierte Stele und verschiedene Arten von Altären, und typisch für den zentralen Peten, Paare von Stelen und Altären, die vor T empelpyramiden auf der Akropolis aufgereiht sind. Die Erforschung der Skulpturtradition trägt zu einem besseren Verständnis der Opferdepots bei, wie auch zu den von den Maya angewandten Methoden der Errichtung der Stelen. Zusammen mit Befunden aus anderen Bereichen der archäologischen Stätte können so zum ersten Mal Einsichten in das rituelle Leben dieses noch wenig bekannten Ortes gewonnen werden.</page></plain_text>
