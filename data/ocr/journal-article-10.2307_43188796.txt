<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ingres' s Shadows Sarah Betzer In 1855, the year that Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres en- joyed a retrospective exhibition in a private gallery at the Paris Exposition Universelle, a disconcerting aspect to "sculp- tural painting" was eminently on view. That year, the photog- rapher, artist, and commentator Nadar described Ingres as "a painter whose chilliness hatches polar bears."1 Giving visual form to his own judgment (and those of countless other critics) , later that same year Nadar depicted the hilarious - if literally mortifying - viewer response to Ingres' s art. The car- icature featured a man being carried, rigid, out of Ingres' s gallery at the Exposition Universelle under the watchful eye of the Grand Odalisque , the caption reading: "My God, what's that? - It seems to be a gentleman who found himself frozen in the Ingres room. . . . [Ah! mon Dieu , qu'est-ce que c'est que ça! - Il paraît que c ' est un monsieur qui s ' est trouvé gelé dans la salle réservée de M. Ingres. . . .]" (Fig. 1). Nadar's understanding of Ingres 's painting as gelid and uncannily mortifying relied on a more broadly held judgment: that art so bound to antiquity and remote ideality was, for all purposes, dead. Nadar suc- ceeded in at once conjuring the familiar alliance between Ingres and sculpture (the man has become something like a statue) and pushing the connection further to entertain its viral potential. If Ingres's oeuvre bore the unmistakable trace of the artist's antiquated allegiances, this might be transmis- sible from painting to viewer. Nadar's lampoon thus turns on the imagined viewing experience. As Nadar portrays it, the unsuspecting visitor has been ensnared in a kind of Medusa relay: in the frozen thrall of Ingres's canvases, themselves in the frozen thrall of the past. The reverse-Pygmalion sculp- tural metaphor wielded by Nadar was by no means a novelty. Théophile Thoré had already observed in 1846 that Ingres, so entranced by his love of line and antiquity, seemed "per- haps a sculptor," since it was "surely the procedures of sculp- tors that preoccup [ied] him in painting."2 By the 1850s, the morbid associations of Ingres's sculptural formal language were given seductive voice by supporters and detractors alike. The consistency of these associations should perhaps not be surprising, as they map fairly neatly within a nineteenth- century discursive topography of the relations between paint- ing and sculpture and between the "antique" and the "mod- ern." In her probing examination of the paragone in the long modern period, Jacqueline Lichtenstein has tracked the art critical and theoretical apotheosis of painting and the death of sculpture in the nineteenth century. Rhetorically wedded in the seventeenth century to touch, line, philosophy, and, perhaps most powerfully, the antique, sculpture's fate was sealed when set against the competing characteristics identi- fied with painting: sight, color, and, of course, the "modern." According to this reading, sculpture's demise was ensured at the time of the founding of the French Royal Academy, when its affiliation with the antique was consolidated.3 Nadar and Thoré' s criticism of sculptural painting thereby tapped into what were by the 1850s well-established rhetorical patterns attendant to the paragone ; their objection to painting that invoked the priorities of sculpture followed in the footsteps of earlier critics. For Denis Diderot, writing in 1765, the art of sculpture was "severe, grave, and chaste," its distance from the contemporary world of the living elegiacally signified by the fact that there was "no laughter in marble."4 Within Diderot's art theory, in which artistic value turned on the ability to conjure up and fully animate nature, sculpture's ponderous immobility and its connections with abstract phil- osophical reflection established its secondary position vis-à-vis painting. François Guizot's later intervention in this terrain extended Diderot's consideration of the distinctive proper- ties of painting and sculpture, though with quite different emphasis. In his Salon of 1810, Guizot praised Jacques-Louis David's role in reorienting artistic training such that "paint- ing takes its lead from [ancient] sculpture."5 Nevertheless, Guizot fundamentally objected to painting so indebted to the study of antique statues that it failed to deploy the coloristic power special to its medium. In Guizot's assessment, David and his school offered prime examples of such deplorable sculptural painting.6 In these pivotal texts, Diderot and Guizot helped to consolidate what would become the domi- nant narrative of painting's privileged status - guaranteed by its ostensible links to ephemeral modernity - in the second half of the nineteenth century. The provocative and seductive account provided by this examination of the discursive realm brackets a series of ur- gent - and decidedly messier - questions about how art crit- ical and art philosophical writing intersected with the world of art making in the modern period. How do we reconcile the "death of sculpture" with modern "classical" sculptural inno- vations around 1800 and with the enduring, indeed, often (artistically) generative, allure of the antique over the long nineteenth century?7 Furthermore, what are we to make of the dynamic interactions between painting and sculpture in the same period, evident whether we are looking at the work of Jean-Léon Gérôme or Édouard Manet? A study of one such instance in which theory encountered practice and in which painting took up and took on sculpture demonstrates that there is much to be gained by reconsidering the dichotomous narrative of one medium's eclipse by the other and by stress- ing the dialectic logic in the eighteenth-century origins of the sculptural metaphor so familiar by midcentury. If mortifica- tion was one possible response, by taking the long view on the matter we discover that the modern sculptural encounter likewise entailed an opposing set of aesthetic imperatives that turned on bodily experience and vivification. Turning to an early period of Ingres's career, and to his largely overlooked participation in the luxury publication the Musée français, yields an especially productive case for revisit- ing the terms of the artist's relationship with ancient figurai</page><page sequence="2">INGRES'S SHADOWS 79 sculpture. If an intimate connection between an ingriste sculp- tural metaphor and the specter of a deadening classical past was strongly forged by the mid-nineteenth century, in In- gres^ own lifetime, ancient sculpture occupied the center of vital debates and enthusiasms - philosophical, aesthetic, an- tiquarian, archaeological, touristic, museological, and art his- torical in nature. Far from frozen morphological templates of ideality, these antiquities were literally volatile (as they were shuttled from Italy to France and back again) even as they were conceived theoretically as the site of artistic and aes- thetic transformation. By taking up this eighteenth-century vantage point and by probing an emergent understanding of sculpture's unique aesthetic imperatives, we will be uniquely poised to arrive at a quite different understanding of what possibilities sculpture held out for Ingres, and finally to ap- preciate the distinctly modern terms of its allure. Ingres and the Musée français: Antiquity, Engraving, and Experience in about 1800 In 1801, having won the coveted Prix de Rome, Ingres left the atelier of his master, David, only to find himself not in the Eternal City, but instead in a holding pattern in Paris. "Pen- sioner without a pension/' thanks to the government's bud- get troubles, Ingres was forced to await the moment when he could begin his years of state-supported study at the French Academy in Rome.8 In the interim, the administration of- fered him a studio at a modest rent in the old convent of the Capuchins. The nuns who had previously occupied the con- vent, initially founded in 1688 by Louis XIV, had been ex- pelled in 1790. Located on the right bank, adjacent to the Place Vendôme, the Couvent des Capucines was by the turn of the nineteenth century given an altogether new identity as the base of operations for a number of artists and sculptors. There, Ingres took up residence in a community of consid- erable artistic talent: among his illustrious company were Antoine-Jean Gros and Anne-Louis Girodet, together with Ingres' s Davidian studio mates Lorenzo Bartolini (who in 1802 won the Grand Prix in sculpture) and Jean-Pierre Granger (who usurped Ingres's bid for the Grand Prix in 1800 but nevertheless remained a long-term friend).9 During these five years as "pensionnaire aspirant," Ingres occupied a liminal zone: between his education in the master's studio proper and his arrival in a new site of training in Italy. It was in this setting that Ingres undertook work for Le Musée français , recueil complet des tableaux, statues et bas-reliefs, qui composent la collection nationale. This luxury publication, over- seen by editors Louis-Nicolas-Joseph Robillard-Péronville and Pierre Laurent, documented the treasures then housed in the French national collection. It appeared in eighty fasci- cules, or installments, of engravings, explanatory texts, and four lengthy scholarly discourses, released between 1803 and 181 2. 10 The impressively scaled folios have been described as an "unrivalled achievement of the art of reproductive engrav- ing," measuring just over two feet high by a foot and a half wide, with plates measuring roughly 14 by 10 inches.11 The four volumes were divided by medium, with the first three volumes devoted to painting and the last to antique sculp- ture. Twelve engravings based on designs by Ingres took their place in volume four, among the 343 engravings contained in the series as a whole. The first of these engravings, Cupid and 1 Nadar [Félix Tournachon], "My God, what's that? - It seems to be a gentleman who found himself frozen in the Ingres room . . . from Le fournal pour Rire, October 13, 1855 (artwork in the public domain) Psyche (Fig. 2), appeared in the second installment of Novem- ber 1803, and they continued regularly through 1806, culmi- nating in what seems likely to have been the last of the engravings based on Ingres's designs, the Apollo Lykeios , cir- culated in 1810 (Fig. 3). 12 The allure of these images and the remarkable quality of the publication notwithstanding, Ingres's contributions to the Musée français remains one of art history's overlooked episodes. This is due perhaps to what Charles Blanc empha- sized just three years after Ingres's death, that the artist's work on the volume could easily be written off as simply an attempt to make ends meet: "Pensioner without a pension, Ingres had to stay in Paris for five years, living the best he could, working for the editors of illustrated books and draw- ing antiques for the Musée Napoléon."13 But perhaps art history's silence is more straightforward, flowing from the fact that while we have the engravings, Ingres's drawings have yet to be located. However, Ingres ensured that his participa- tion in the Musée français would not be forgotten, carefully inscribing a record of these "twelve antique figures" in his ninth notebook (Cahier IX).14 A second passage in his tenth notebook seems also to refer to this work: he recorded his "many drawings for Collections" not long after he inscribed</page><page sequence="3">30 ART bulletin march 2010 VOLUME xcv number 1 2 Auguste Desnoyers [called Boucher-Desnoyers] , after Jean- Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Cupid and Psyche , ca. 1803, engraving, from Louis-Nicolas-Joseph Robillard-Péronville and Pierre Laurent, Le Musée français , recueil complet des tableaux , statues et bas-reliefs , qui composent la collection nationale , Paris: L.

(35.2 X 24.7 cm) (artwork in the public domain; photograph provided by the Bibliothèque Nationale de France) the date of his arrival in Paris in the fall of 1797. 15 In fact, Ingres' s arrival in the city was closely followed by an event that made possible his Musée français participation. Less than a year later, Paris was the stage for the Fête de la Liberté, the Revolutionary festival celebrated on July 27 and 28, 1798, and commemorated for posterity in an engraving by Pierre-Ga- briel Berthault (after Abraham Girardet) (Fig. 4) . An eyewitness account tells us that the event, in the after- math of Napoléon's Italian campaign of 1796-97, was de- signed as a suggestive re-creation of a page from ancient history.16 At least one commentator in 1798 discerned a specific historical precedent in the guise of the Roman Re- publican triumphal procession of Aemilius Paulus. Celebrat- ing Aemilius's victory over the Macedonians in 167 BCE, the three-day triumph featured prisoners, among them the cap- tured King Perseus of Macedonia, Aemilius's troops, identi- fying placards, and, at the head of the triumph, plundered art objects.17 Aemilius Paulus's triumph found its eighteenth- century echo in the two days of the festival, as onlookers bore witness to the unfolding scene identified by banners as the "triumphal entry of objects of arts and sciences gathered in Italy."18 Marking the end to a long voyage that began in Rome, continued by sea to Marseilles, then went on by wagon or canal boat to Paris, the procession, composed of specially designed wagons and cages, rolled through the city, along the Seine, to its final victory lap before the crowd assembled on the Champ de Mars.19 The first division of the parade was devoted to the spoils of "natural history" and numbered among its curiosities "living foreign vegetables: coconut tree, banana tree, palm tree, etc.," together with an African lion, a bear from Bern, Swit- zerland, two camels, and two dromedaries.20 These last ap- pear in the foreground of Berthaulťs engraving, where the artist seems to have particularly relished the opportunity to juxtapose depictions of real horses, bronze horses seized from S. Marco in Venice (antique statues themselves earlier taken from Constantinople), and, finally, pairs of camels and dromedaries. A second convoy followed, that of "books, man- uscripts, medals, [and] music."21 The third and final section of the cortege was devoted to the fine arts; these wagons carried the most famous spoils of all: prized antique sculp- tures and Renaissance paintings from Italian collections. A banner at the start of the division proclaimed "fine arts," and was followed on foot by prize-winning artists, museum administrators, professors of painting, sculpture, and archi- tecture and their students. And perhaps it was these students who carried the didactic banner that read (as it turns out, a bit overconfidently) , "Monuments of Antique Sculpture. Greece gave them up; Rome lost them; their fate has twice changed; it will not change again."22 No fewer than twenty- five wagons filled with sculpture trundled along behind this declaration. An Etruscan-style Sèvres vase manufactured in 1813 imagines how the procession might have appeared had the astounding contents of the crates been revealed to view (Fig. 5) . Safely enshrined inside them was an array of artifacts that included, among others, the Capitoline Venus, Cupid and Psyche , the Discobolus , the Dying Gladiator , the Apollo Belvedere, and the Laocoön (Fig. 6) . Having assembled a team of scholars and specialists poised to identify spoils once his troops had prevailed, Napoléon left nothing to chance, guar- anteeing that the most coveted artifacts would ultimately be legally transferred or, to use the rhetoric of the French government, "repatriated" to France, their "natural" home, with the Treaty of Tolentino of February 1797.23 Plans to relocate these sculptures and paintings sparked heated resis- tance in France, but the Directory government's vision pre- vailed over those of dissenters, and Napoléon assiduously realized the goal of efficiently identifying and removing the most precious works of art from conquered territories. Un- derlying Napoléon' s wish to acquire "all that is beautiful in Italy" was the idea that the art object - procured, crated, paraded - would at last touch down in the Musée Central des Arts, where it would participate in a new logic, in which the aesthetic fragment told a different story of imperial and cultural power: one repositioned from Rome to Paris.24 While we cannot be certain that Ingres, recently arrived in Paris to study in David's studio, was in the crowd that day, he would soon become well acquainted with these sculptural spoils. Although these famed objects, remarkably, remained crated in the Louvre for almost eighteen months, Ingres enjoyed exceptional access to the collection once it was un-</page><page sequence="4">INGRES S SHADOWS gļ 3 Félix Massard, after Ingres, Apollo LykeioSy ca. 1803, from Robillard- Péronville and Laurent, Le Musée français , vol. 4, pl. 10, engraving, 13% X 93á in.

Hubert Robert's painting depicts the main axis of the museum, stretching (from the viewer's perspective here) from north to south: from the Hall of the Seasons, through the Hall of Illustrious Men and the Hall of the Romans, culminating in the Hall of the Laocoön (Fig. 7) .26 Executed between April 1802 and August 1803, the canvas evokes the elegance of the installation in which antiquities were illumi- nated by natural light furnished by the ten windows that pierced the east wall at regular intervals. Housed in the Louvre, where, as it happened, David had obtained special studio space for work on his Intervention of the Sabine Women , the museum would surely have been a site of great interest for members of David's atelier.27 Thanks to this commission and to the museum director Dominique Vivant Denon 's hearty endorsement of the Musée français project (which he praised as a "vast enterprise"), Ingres enjoyed special access to this space and these works.28 The project likewise provided Ingres the opportunity to see his drawings transformed by the burins of engravers, includ- ing Félix Massard and Auguste Desnoyers (called Boucher- Desnoyers) , among others.29 Ingres thereby took his place in an esteemed genealogy of print reproductions after ancient sculpture, a lineage that may be traced forward from impor- tant sixteenth-century exemplars through to Ingres.

Like the other plates in their respective volumes, Por- ro' s Farnese Hercules (1576) and Thomassin's Laocoön (1755) are represented individually, the sculptures' form stretching to fill the rectangular format. The artists have taken care to invoke the sculptures' existence as three-dimensional objects by means of interior modeling, though they lack any indica- tion of the spatial setting in which they would have been viewed.30 That conventions for representing antique sculpture re- mained essentially unchanged by the time of Ingres's work is attested to by the comparative case of Johann Joachim Winck- elmann's Histoire de Vart chez les anciens , published in Paris in 1801 (Figs. 10, 11). Almost exactly contemporary with the Musée français volumes, the plates illustrating Winckelmann's text likewise conform to the earlier models: here, the Farnese Hercules and Laocoön are captured from the privileged frontal view, their representation stripped of possible distrac- tions of any kind. In the Musée français commission, Ingres participated in what was by the second half of the eighteenth century an exponentially expanding European network of printmaking, print selling, and print consuming. And to mention just one effect germane to our concerns here: this efflorescence of prints and printed volumes (in which antiq- uities held pride of place) guaranteed that ponderous marble objects would travel, with or without Napoléon. In an important sense, Ingres's work on the Musée français may be seen as the artist's maiden voyage navigating the boundary between original and its reproduction: a relation that he would explore throughout his career. In this case, though Ingres worked in the interval between ancient sculp- tor and living engraver, his position was nevertheless en- dowed with fundamental theoretical importance.

The goal pursued by both the artist who furnished the drawing and the engraver was nei- ther that of copying nor of translation, but rather, in nine- teenth-century commentator François-Etienne Jouberťs for- mulation, to "imitate their conceptions by a very different, very original art."31 The power of this idea of the engraving process is evidenced by the fact that instances of inaccuracy were defended in engravings such as those found in the Musée français on the basis that likeness was a less significant goal than that of "inspiring] and transmit [ting] the impact of the originals themselves ."32 The engraving's imperative was thus solidly located in the realm of simulated experience with the original.

Rome that certified his accomplishment as a painter, Ingres ultimately exhibited four of the Musée français engravings at the Salons of 1804 and 1806. Also exhibited at the Salon of 1804 was the print of the celebrated Gonzaga cameo, the third-century BCE Alexandrian cameo depicting the profile portraits of the rulers of Egypt, King Ptolemy II Philadel- phus and his wife Arsinoé. Then in Josephine's collection at Malmaison, the cameo was drawn by Ingres, engraved by Boucher-Desnoyers, and eventually published by Ennio Quirino Visconti.33 I stress this circumvention of copying, transcription, or simple replication in thinking about engraving because it strikes me as crucial for what develops over the course of Ingres's career as a curious, certainly distinctive relation to questions of reproduction and seriality throughout his oeu- vre and across media of painting, drawing, and printmaking. As Stephen Bann has shown, the story of Ingres' s use of print media is complex and often reads against the usual grain. Not only did he tend to put prints to private use by distributing them to friends rather than aiming for public or commercial success, but even more remarkably, the artist also ap- proached the process of creating a print from his paintings as 9 Simon Thomassin, Laocoön , from Thomassin, Delineatio statuarum et imaginum, Augsburg, 1755, pl. 54, engraving, 5Vè X 3Vè in. (14.1 X 8.8 cm) (artwork in the public domain; photograph provided by the National Gallery of Art Library, Washington, D.C.) an opportunity to revisit compositional choices in the "orig- inal."34 Thus, work with the engraver became one more stop on the potentially infinite loop of repetition and alteration, with results that challenged the engravers with whom he worked. Exploring the question of seriality in Ingres's paintings, Rosalind Krauss struck a powerful blow to the idealist expla- nation so often favored in the historiography according to which Ingres worked "in pursuit of perfection." Krauss in- stead stresses the iterative nature of Ingres's work in which "each repetition ... is always a recontextualization of the model."35 Certainly, it is the case that accounting for Ingres's "repetition" in instances like his extended work on the sub- ject of Raphael and the Fornarina (which included five paint- ings, one signed drawing, and four prints supervised by the artist) requires a more muscular interpretative framework than that of the protophotographic transcription of an orig- inal.36 In this sense, in his relation to painting and drawing, as in printmaking, Ingres returned again and again to the problem of origin and "copy," in which neither term could be considered static. What Bann and Krauss have described as</page><page sequence="8">INGRES S SHADOWS g5 10 Farnese Hercules, from Johann Joachim Winckelmann, Histoire de Vart chez les anciens, Paris: Étienne Gide, 1801, vol. 2, pl. XI, engraving (artwork in the public domain; photograph provided by the Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles, 87- B5430 V.2) the reproductive or iterative logic of Ingres' s practice has some fundamental distinctions from the artist's experience with the Musée français project. The commission at once strictly established subject matter and involved an explicitly expository imperative: that is, the designs would take specific antique sculptures as their subjects, and their representation would be bound by well-codified habits of representation. Nevertheless, as in the cases of Ingres's painting and use of reproductive media, his work for the Musée français speaks to the organizing principles that would continue to shape his oeuvre. In one regard Ingres' s later work subscribed to the underlying premise of the earlier luxury volume: for Ingres, the determination to produce prints after his paintings was a signal of supreme accomplishment. And more than that: in his view this process was nothing less than a kind of litmus test for judging the merits of a work of art.37 The impact of the originals themselves was, it would seem, finally put to the test specifically via re-presentation. Krauss's analysis is of particular use for our consideration of Ingres' s early work with ancient sculpture insofar as she posits that the artist's career-long habit of returning to famil- iar compositions and subjects was to some extent given de- ll Laoco'&amp;n , from Winckelmann, Histoire de Vart chez les anciens , vol. 1, pl. XXIII, engraving (artwork in the public domain; photograph provided by the Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles, 87-B5430 v.l) termining form in his early career, in relation to "the very atmosphere that artists like Ingres breathed in the late eigh- teenth- and early nineteenth centuries ... [in which] the antique existed in and through its copies."38 This is a crucial observation, one that brings together for the first time the condition of the antique at the turn of the nineteenth cen- tury and Ingres' s seriali ty. However, we need to push the question of the coextensivity of the antique and Ingres's central artistic preoccupations further to take up how - aside from (or in addition to) the problem of repetition and reiteration - we can observe an eighteenth-century ontology of antique sculpture permeating the artist's work. The Musée français project helps us toward this goal. Toward an Eighteenth-Century Ontology of Ancient Sculpture: Aesthetics after Archaeology By the time of Ingres's work in the Gallery of Antiquities, ancient sculpture had for decades occupied center stage in a series of interlocking discourses: on the nature of art and its history, on judgments of beauty and the cultivation of taste, and, indeed, on the nature and limits of human perception. While masterworks of ancient sculpture had long been the focus of connoisseurial and artistic admiration, in the second half of the eighteenth century, expanding circuits of Euro- pean tourism, burgeoning archaeological activity, and the emergence of public art museums made possible new access</page><page sequence="9">30 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2010 VOLUME XCV NUMBER 1 12 Jean-Jacques Avril the Younger, after Pierre Bouillon, Apollo Belvedere , ca. 1803, from Robillard-Péronville and Laurent, Le Musée français , vol. 4, pl. 9, engraving, 13% X 93á in. (35.2 X 24.7 cm) (artwork in the public domain; photograph provided by the Bibliothèque Nationale de France) to these treasures for a growing art public. Encounters with antique sculpture were enshrined by the grand tour's cultural pilgrimage route, which included stops in Florence, Rome, and Naples in its typical itinerary and was anchored by new kinds of bodily fragments, now marble and bronze rather than flesh and bone. These visits live on in the volumes of letters and memoirs left by grand tourists. Through these, we have become famil- iar with travelers' impressions of antique sculpture, their descriptions certifying their sensitivity to beauty and, thus, their unimpeachable taste. Charles Dupaty's Lettres sur lltalie (1788) stands as a classic in the genre, with Dupaty effusing about the Apollino (a sculpture that eluded Napoléon and Denon's net thanks to its flight to Palermo): "What beautiful features! This line that forms the complete design, how justly drawn! how it glides! how it parts and returns! How invisibly it connects the limbs one with another!"39 But lurking just offstage from the oft-performed admiration of such works was the specter of aesthetic encounters gone awry. One such story is reported by English tourist Charlotte Eaton, who explained that while she had "gone mad about the Apollo [Belvedere] ," she was not the first. The narrative unfolds: a far more unfortunate damsel, a native of France ... at the sight of this matchless statue, lost at once her heart and her reason. Day after day, and hour after hour, the fair enthusiast gazed and wept, and sighed her soul away, till she became, like the marble, pale, but not like the marble, cold. . . . death at last closed the ill-fated passion, and the life of "the maid of France." Luckily, Eaton hastened to add, "English maids don't die of love - neither for men nor statues - therefore I hope to live to admire the Apollo."40 Chloe Chard, who has illuminated these and other documents by considering what they have to say about the pleasures and perils of the grand tour, charac- teristically cuts to the heart of the matter. She explains, The expression of pleasure in an ancient statue establishes that the traveller is speaking as a full participant in the Grand Tour, able to appropriate this topography for his or her own enjoyment, and this power of approbation is proclaimed all the more strongly by the lack of any need to express reservations about the delight which the sculpture arouses.41 Such writing, then, testifies to how thoroughly an expectation of a certain kind of firsthand experience of sculpture had permeated the period, and certainly not only in the realm of tourism. This is familiar art historical terrain. The well-established account of the allure of the antique for modern artists and art viewers is firmly rooted in the eighteenth century, and, in- deed, in art history's own history. Beginning with Reflections on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture (1755) and more fully elaborated in The History of the Art of Antiquity (1764), Winckelmann established the modern parameters of a history of art. And, no less crucially, he posited ancient sculpture as the pulsing heart animating art historians' and artists' enthusiasms. We may deduce something of the role Winckelmann mapped out for sculpture in what is perhaps the most repro- duced passage from The History of the Art of Antiquity and which takes as its subject the Apollo Belvedere (Fig. 12): In gazing upon this masterpiece of art, I forget all else, and I myself adopt an elevated stance, in order to be worthy of gazing upon it. My chest seems to expand with veneration and to heave like those I have seen swollen as if by the spirit of prophecy, and I feel myself transported to Delos and to the Lycian groves, places Apollo honored with his presence - for my figure seems to take on life and move- ment, like Pygmalion's beauty.42 Here, Winckelmann at once celebrates the morphological ideality of the Apollo Belvedere and insists on the sculpture's transformative effects on its rapt spectator. Notably, it is the spectator, rather than the statue, who is animated in this fundamental reordering of the Pygmalion myth. The logic of this passage is best understood in relation to Winckelmann 's intersubjective theory of imitation, according to which copy- ing antique sculptures involved much more than the arid repetition of ideal form. In Winckelmann 's formulation, the encounter with the antique turned on the (contemporary) artist's identification with - and, by extension, transforma- tion by - an ancient emulative circuitry that lay behind the sculpture as a sort of primal scene, itself motored by the</page><page sequence="10">INGRES S SHADOWS g7 intersubjective relationship between artist and beautiful model, the product of which lived on in the sculptural artifact that held out a sort of access to this lost Utopian past.43 As the Apollo Belvedere passage begins to suggest, Winck- elmann's project cannot be solely understood through the lens of antiquarian and archaeological preoccupations, for it bears the traces of eighteenth-century sensualist and empiri- cist philosophers writing after John Locke. For many of these authors - among them Voltaire, Diderot, and Etienne Bon- not de Condillac - sculpture functioned as a veritable planet around which a series of theoretical proposals orbited. Lich- tenstein has trenchantly observed that all of this philosophiz- ing on sculpture had dubious effects on sculpture itself - that is, in the realm of the creation and reception of sculpture in the period.44 But she and others have rightly emphasized something vital: that talking about sculpture was by the 1760s well established as a means for exploring the fundamental operations of the human senses.45 Positioning himself in the sensualist and empiricist tradi- tion, Johann Gottfried Herder, a student of Immanuel Kant and admirer of Winckelmann, in 1778 added his voice to this esteemed philosophical lineage with Sculpture : Some Observa- tions on Farm and Shape from Pygmalion's Creative Dream. In Sculpture , based on his formative experiences in the antique sculpture galleries at Versailles and Mannheim, Herder brought together current philosophical analyses of the senses with an evaluation of the distinctive experiences that were the product of encounters with painting and sculpture. Working in this volume to dislodge what he considered vision's (and therefore painting's) effective colonization of the aesthetic experience, Herder aimed to restore touch - and sculpture with it - to the foreground of concerns. Herder's text offered a new contribution to the paragone , or competition between the arts of sculpture and painting - in which, as we may discern from his title alone, sculpture trumps painting. The heart of the matter for Herder was that quite unlike two- dimensional media like painting, sculpture called on Gefühl , "corporeal feeling,"46 to draw the spectator into an utterly different three-dimensional interaction. Herder argued that with sculpture, the viewer is interpellated in a spatial and social interaction in which she becomes aware of the recip- rocal nature of her contact with the sculptural body. He explained that "because [sculpture] presents a human being , a fully animated body , it speaks to us as an act, it seizes hold of us and penetrates our very being, awakening the full range of responsive human feeling."47 Sculpture's special appeal to the body had important im- plications for viewing experience. If paintings could be grasped immediately through eyesight alone (and therein lies their shortcoming, according to Herder's logic), sculp- ture required more: "The living, embodied truth of the three- dimensional space of angles, of form and volume, is not something we can learn through sight."48 However, sculp- ture's physicality, its requirement of prolonged physical ex- amination, was far from straightforward. Indeed, the passage in which Herder most carefully considered the mechanics of sculptural encounter reads as an ode to gratification deferred in which the question of eventual knowledge is altogether more tenuous than we might expect: Consider the lover of art sunk deep in contemplation who circles restlessly around a sculpture. What would he not do to transform his sight into touch, to make his seeing into a form of touching that feels in the dark? He moves from one spot to another, seeking rest but finding none. He cannot locate a single viewpoint from which to view the work, such as a painting provides, for a thousand points of view are not sufficient. As soon as a single rooted viewpoint takes precedence, the living work becomes a mere canvas and the beautiful rounded form is dismembered into a pitiful polygon. For this reason, he shifts from place to place: his eye becomes his hand and the ray of light his finger, or rather, his soul has a finger that is yet finer than his hand or the ray of light. With his soul he seeks to grasp the image that arose from the arm and the soul of the artist. Now he has it! The illusion has worked; the sculp- ture lives and his soul feels that it lives. His soul speaks to it, not as if his soul sees, but as if it touches, as if it feels.49 In the flight from "mere canvas," the spectator's restless movement around the periphery of the sculptural body threatens to yield no information at all, to fall away into a series of sequential views that add up to nothing. And yet, once the threat of dismemberment is overcome, the sculp- ture provides an aesthetic experience whose movement is not entirely unlike that of the Kantian sublime. The Kantian sublime is triggered by a "formless object" that precisely resists or defies being thought and thus overwhelms the subject with a sort of immersive excess that short-circuits reason and is consequently experienced as a threat of anni- hilation.50 But, of course, the movement of the sublime in Kantian aesthetics is destined for the apotheosis of thought insofar as the formless or fragmented impression is ultimately rendered as subject to comprehension ( Zusammenfassung ), to "getting it."51 Kant's formulation at once imposes a distance from the world of objects and firmly subjects the senses to reason, the experience of the sublime ending as it does with the subject's awareness of her/his supersensible faculty. Nev- ertheless, the movement of the sublime offers a productive comparison with Herder's formulation, in which the sculp- tural body ultimately allows the viewer to recognize a formal homology with his own consciousness. Once we "have it," the sculpture is a three-dimensional manifestation of the inner life of the mind. It is my hope that these brief encounters with Winckel- mann and Herder will help to animate an essential aspect of the status of sculpture in the eighteenth century. As Alex Potts has demonstrated, the century saw the consolidation of ideas about sculpture in which new emphasis was placed on the question of the viewer's experience. In what Potts has termed the "modern sculptural imaginary," considerable in- terest was directed to an embodied, affective encounter, with the result that "a shift occurs, . . . whereby the structuring of a work is partly defined through the viewer's encounter with it, and can no longer be located entirely in its form."52 Of course, there are important implications to such a sea change. Turning our attention back to the 1790s, we discover that the specter of affective experience was conjured by de- tractors and supporters of the plan to remove art objects to Paris.

(35.2 X 24.7 cm) (artwork in the public domain; photograph provided by the Bibliothèque Nationale de France) once for the need for artistic models for French artists and asserted that those students were specially equipped with an "exquisite sensitivity" to sculpture.53 On the other end of the sculptures' odyssey, in the wake of the watershed Vienna agreement of September 1815, after which objects were quickly reclaimed and removed from Paris, English reporters took particular glee in describing French viewers moved to a fever pitch of emotion at the prospect of the sculptures' departure. One such report commented on a group of French women who demonstrated "extravagant fits of rage and lamentation" as they gathered around the Apollo Belve- dere "to take their last farewell, with a most romantic enthu- siasm."54 And it was not just women who were subject to such apparently profound connections to these objects; dis- patched from Italy to oversee the return of sculpture and painting, Canova himself was said to have dissolved into tears (presumably of relief) over the crating of the Medici Venus.55 Ingres's Musée français work took shape, then, in a historical moment in which the artistic deck was stacked on the side of experience. On the one hand, Ingres faced the imperative that his drawing after sculpture (toward engraving) conjure something like a direct experience of viewing - that is, of presence. On the other, there was a shift of sculptural meaning more broadly, in which an altogether new value was placed on the viewer's physical, sensual, aesthetic encounter. After years of drawing after engravings of just such ancient sculp- tures, Ingres now faced the daunting task of rendering new drawings that would indelibly register his experience - in the flesh - of these objects. It follows, then, that our challenge is to discern the artist's physical encounter in the visual record. At work in the museum space, Ingres seized on the shadow as a powerful representational tool that would be suggestive both of the three-dimensional presence of the sculpture and of his own physical navigation of it in space (Fig. 13). Indeed,</page><page sequence="12">INGRES'S SHADOWS 39 14 Attributed to Ingres, Apollo Belvedere , ca. 1791-93, charcoal with stumping under black chalk on tan laid paper, 23 X I8V4 in. (58.4 X 46.4 cm). Private collection (artwork in the public domain) all but one of Ingres' s engravings feature often remarkably elaborate projected shadows. In order to take the measure of Ingres's shadows and begin to consider how they resonate within an eighteenth-century field of representation and spectatorship, we turn to two eighteenth-century shadow in- terludes: one we might call positivist, the other ghost story. Drawing the Antique: Academic Training and Shadow Projection Like legions of other artists educated in the French academic system, Ingres had been drawing after the antique since the earliest stages of his training. The sheet inscribed by the artist as "my first drawing, 1789" depicted a sculptural image: Head of a Niobid. It has been deduced that this work is a drawing after an engraving,56 but Ingres soon moved on to the next stage of academic training, the dessin en bosse , or drawing in the round. The striking charcoal and black chalk drawing of the bust of the Apollo Belvedere, found among Ingres's belongings at the time of his death, is an exceptional exam- ple of artistic achievements in this arena, which, in the con- text of the academy, tended to refer specifically to drawing after plaster casts (Fig. 14).57 Ingres himself was evidently quite skilled in the exercise, having been awarded three first and three second prizes in the dessin en bosse competition as a student at the Toulouse Academy.58 As the dramatic rendi- tion of the famed head of Apollo attests, this academic exer- 15 Ingres, Académie , 1800, oil on canvas, 31 V2 X 22 in.

Shadows, as seen in this drawing, were of the utmost importance in this intermediary stage of training, where they were intimately linked to copying after the antique and to creating an illu- sionistic two-dimensional rendering of a sculpture seen in the round. Having successfully completed this hurdle, Ingres would have advanced to the final stage of academic training: draw- ing from life (Fig. 15). Ingres's 1800 Académie is a virtuoso exemplar of the genre and bespeaks his fluency with what was by then a long-familiar exercise.59 As much as the canvas centers on the portrayal of the male nude, a subject of instrumental importance and fundamental significance in the Davidian studio, it is likewise a serious and scrupulous study in shadows. With Michael Baxandall as a guide, we can discern at least two kinds of shadow in the canvas. Passages like the deep V of the neck and the model's upper left thigh are defined by attached shadow , shadows on the body cast by the body. These shadows help to certify the figure's three- dimensionality and clarify its varied topography from toes to curly hair. A second category of shadow, projected shadow , is evident on the surface of the elegantly draped white sheet,</page><page sequence="13">90 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2010 VOLUME XCV NUMBER 1 16 Gérard de Lairesse, illustrations of shadows, from Le grand livre des peintres. . . . , Paris: À l'hôtel de Thou, 1787, vol. 1, 392, pl. 15, engraving, 8Vé X 6V4 in. (21.5 X 15.8 cm) (artwork in the public domain; photograph provided by the National Gallery of Art Library, Washington, D.C.) where the shadow's undulating form reveals the body's rela- tion to light sources and vividly evokes the spatial envelope of the studio.60 In the eighteenth century shadows were a source of fasci- nation; recognized as critical to perception, they thus played a pivotal role in philosophical writing.61 Understood, more- over, to be essential for painting, they served as the subject of numerous technical publications. As Baxandall has shown in a watershed study, the accurate depiction of projected shadow was the focus of exhaustive technical analysis. First published in Dutch in 1712 and in French in 1787, Gérard de Lairesse's Le grand livre des peintres was a particularly impor- tant resource in this regard.62 In chapter after chapter ac- companied by illustrations, the book took up varieties of shadows cast under many different light conditions (Fig. 16) . Plate 15 of Lairesse's text, for instance, demonstrates differ- ent qualities of projected shadow and attached shadow values in varying conditions of reflected light: from the brightly reflective side of a house (plate 15, fig. 1) to the relatively less reflective copse of trees (plate 15, fig. 2). Of the seventy-three chapters in Lairesse's two volumes, twenty-five were devoted to the study of shadows and light effects. Texts like Le grand livre des peintres and, later, Louis-Nicolas 17 Masquelier, after Louis-Nicolas de Lespinasse, "Perspective with Shadows; Finding Shadows by Torchlight," from Traité de perspective linéaire, à l'usage des artistes. . . . , Paris: Chez Magimel [et al.], Year IX [1801], pl. 25, engraving, IV2 X 9% in. (19.2 X 24.7 cm) (artwork in the public domain; photograph provided by the National Gallery of Art Library, Washington, D.C.) de Lespinasse 's Traité de perspective linéaire , à l'usage des artistes (1801) exemplify the vast apparatus available for learning to render the geometric projection of cast shadow, or sciogra- phy (Fig. 17). Its own discipline, sciography was a subbranch of linear perspective that centered on the two-dimensional representation of the mathematically determined depiction of projected shadows.63 Illustrating Lespinasse's discussion of the perspective of shadows, plate 25 of the Traité de perspective linéaire provides a sciographic study of shadows cast by torch- light. As the plate suggests, artists studying such texts and images would learn how to project the mathematically cor- rect form of a cast shadow, working from the givens of identified object and light source. Ingres, however, showed more interest in another kind of shadow work, what Baxandall calls "Rococo-Empiricist shadow" and which bypasses questions of mathematical pre- cision.64 Quite in defiance of the perspectivai logic of sciog- raphy, Ingres' s projected shadows seem to take on a life of their own, concerned less with telling us about the body to which they ostensibly belong than with insisting that we be- come alert to the surface on which they are cast.65 We see this in the 1800 Académie (Fig. 15), where the irregular fall of drapery allows for a wonderful exploitation of anthropomor- phic shadow form, an aspect we see again and again in Ingres's Musée français designs (Figs. 3, 13). As the details from the shadow zones of the Cupid and Apollo Lykeios attest, these purported reflections at once draw attention to their identities as shadows putatively related to the sculptures' form even as they simultaneously operate independently as sinuous deconstructions - and, indeed, deformations - of the marble figures. Poised on the brink of becoming com- pletely independent terms, they function as a kind of ghosdy surtitle to the sculptural language of the foreground. The apotheosis of this impulse for Ingres was ultimately realized</page><page sequence="14">INGRES'S SHADOWS gļ 18 Ingres, The Dream of Ossian , 1813, oil on canvas, 11 ft. 7 in. X 9 ft.

Musée Ingres, Montauban (artwork in the public domain; photograph by Erich Lessing, provided by Art Resource, NY) in Rome, where in 1813 the artist completed The Dream of Ossian (Fig. 18). Engaging both the memory of Girodeťs 1801 Ossian and his own experiences with the Musée français commission, Ingres's monumental painting imagined the phantom legions of the dreaming Ossian's family who, bathed in the light of the moon, suggest nothing so much as marble statues. Framed on the left by Ossian' s wife Evirallina and on the right by his son Oscar, the composition turns on the juxta- position of the sculptural figures of Ossian' s dreamscape and the slumbering protagonist of the foreground. Here, Eviral- lina and Oscar take up equivocal positions in the interval between these spatial and imaginative poles, a fact empha- sized by Evirallina's hand, which extends forward to break the division between the spectral and the living, and by the shadows cast by the two sculptural figures onto their discon- certingly solid cloud banks. A chilling phantasmagoria of lunar illumination, Ingres's Ossian brings the lessons of the Musée français into the orbit of his serious painting (which in this case was destined for the ceiling of Napoléon's bedcham- ber at the Palazzo del Quirinale), to decidedly uncanny ef- fect. The Couvent des Capucines and Preternatural Shadows If we are on the trail of unruly shadows, we would be hard- pressed to arrive at a more apt location than the site of Ingres' s studio during his Musée français work: the Couvent des Capucines. An anonymous oil sketch from Ingres's col- lection pictures it as a cavernous, less than welcoming space.66 Another vision of the convent is provided in the literary description penned by Marceline Desbordes-Val- more, whose 1833 novel L'atelier d'un peintre : Scènes de la vie privée was chronologically situated between roughly 1800 and 1810. Set in the convent, the book was inspired by the au- thor's uncle, one of Girodeťs colleagues there. In a chapter entitled "Le Couvent des Capucines," the author evocatively</page><page sequence="15">92 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2010 VOLUME XCV NUMBER 1 19 Lejeune, after Étienne-Gaspard Robertson, Robertson's Phantasmagoria, from Robertson, Mémoires récréatifs, scientifiques , et anecdotiques du physicien- aéronaute E.-G. Robertson, Paris, 1831-33, frontispiece, engraving (artwork in the public domain; photograph provided by the United States Library of Congress) summons up the locale as one dominated by still-crumbling stones and dark, unnavigable passageways. There, we are told, both visitors and artists were likely to become lost with- out the help of shouted calls penetrating the space.67 The recent history of the convent's use surely helped to consolidate its image as a site of mystery and barely contained menace. In 1799 and 1800, the Belgian entrepreneur Étienne-Gaspard Robertson staged his wildly popular theat- rical illusions of ghosts and specters there. Capitalizing on the illusionism of the magic lantern and its projected images, Robertson's phantasmagoria - which turned on the uncanny reanimation of the dead, from Diogenes to Jean-Jacques Rousseau - found its perfect setting in the convent. Having broached the high wall surrounding the enclosure of the Capuchins and having picked their way through the con- vent's graveyard, visitors at last arrived at Robertson's main attraction installed in the hall of the convent, in the same cloisters structure where Ingres had his studio in a former nun's cell (Fig. 19). 68 There, visitors believed themselves "transported into another world and into other centuries," persuaded by the terrifying specters conjured by Robertson's use of two magic lanterns.69 In the case of the particularly appropriate subject "the Bleeding Nun," one lantern re- mained static, projecting the backdrop of a cloister, while a second, movable lantern projected the evidently terrifying "nun covered with blood."70 Lejeune's print after Robert- son's drawing depicts one of the performances at the Cou- vent des Capucines in which projections of demons, threat- eningly animated optical illusions, float above the riveted crowd. Here, the shadows have truly been unleashed. Before a series of lawsuits ended Robertson's extremely lucrative run, the spectacle in the Couvent des Capucines harnessed the mystery of illusionism and the delight of immersive spec- tacle to the science of optics. The confluence of shadows, illusionism, and mystery at the Couvent des Capucines goes even further in accounts of Girodet's work there. The spectral effects of Robertson's phantasmagoria have been compellingly linked to the picto- rial logic of Girodet's 1801 Ossian, even as the artist was himself imagined as a sort of solitary conjurer (most vividly affirmed by a caricature by Louis-Léopold Boilly in which Girodet appears as phantasmagoria incarnate).71 It was in this setting that Girodet refined his preference of working through the night, surmounting the challenge of fading sun- light first by soliciting students to hold candles aloft to illu- minate his canvases and later by utilizing an Argand light system.72 The setting of the Couvent des Capucines could hardly have been more evocative for an artist preoccupied with shadows. Of course, neither sciography nor phantasmagoria can alone be marshaled as an ultimate solution to the remarkable shadows with which Ingres endowed his sculptures. Rather, to some extent both of these shadow interludes illuminate the field of Ingres's curious projections. Indeed, if we are tempted to regard these two interludes as something like the alpha and omega of shadows, together they underscore the affective, phenomenological valence of eighteenth-century shadow representation and point the way to what may have been at stake for Ingres in his determination to include them. Turning once again to the model available in Winckelmann (Figs. 10, 11), we can see more clearly than ever what a difference such shadows make. Like those earlier examples, the large majority of the engravings not by Ingres in the volume of the Musée français devoted to antique sculpture are devoid of such shadows; JeanJacques Avril the Younger's engraving after Pierre Bouillon of the Apollo Belvedere (Fig. 12) is representative of the internal modeling much more common among the sixty-odd other plates. And yet, in his work with eight different engravers, and in all but one of his designs, Ingres took pains to include striking projected shad- ows.73 When seen from a distance, the velvety gradations of these shadows - which range from gauzy to deep - call to mind the mezzotint process. That such an effect could be achieved by Ingres's exclusively burin-wielding interlocutors is noteworthy, at once attesting to the remarkable labor in- volved in the rendition of such shadows and showcasing the engravers' extraordinary control and finesse.74 We might assume that the role played by Ingres's cast shadows would be</page><page sequence="16">INGRES S SHADOWS 93 20 Benjamin Zix, Emperor Napoléon and Empress Marie-Louise Visiting the Salle du Laocoön at Night , April 1810, pen, gray ink, graphite, and washed sepia on paper, 10V4 X 11% in. (26 X 29 cm). Musée du Louvre, Paris (artwork in the public domain; photograph by Gérard Blot, provided by the Réunion des Musées Nationaux/ Art Resource, NY) homologous to the analytic account of the sculptures them- selves, in which essentially accurate depiction reigned.75 However, Ingres' s shadows instead assume a contradictory function: they secure their sculptural objects' status in the three-dimensional realm of the "real" even as they enact curious deformations and distortions of the classical form, a relation very evidently at odds with the fundamentally de- scriptive goals of the Musée français enterprise. While Ingres' s shadows do not behave geometrically, they nevertheless fulfill an important function of shadows insofar as they insist on the fact of a ground: in these cases, a wall against which sculpture is displayed and shadow is encoun- tered by the artist/viewer. Can we read these as a sign of Ingres' s actual experience in the Musée Napoléon? This is difficult to say with certainty. What seems fairly clear is that the shadows emphatically claim the primacy of encounter with a sculptural body, in space. And perhaps in a particular space. Indeed, the Musée Napoléon hosted its own shadow plays. Benjamin Zix commemorates one of the more famous of such spectacles: after their wedding in the Louvre in 1810, Napoléon and Marie-Louise reportedly visited the Gallery of Antiquities by torchlight (Fig. 20). 76 Set in the Laocoön Gallery, Zix's scene capitalizes on the dramatic effects pro- duced as a pair of hand-held torches brought the famed marble bodies to apparent life, shadows dancing, or writhing, behind them. Lit by the bright glow of the torches, the shadows captured by Zix offer a remarkably suggestive sce- nario for imagining how Ingres came to render such strik- ingly anthropomorphic, curiously sinuous, and suspiciously mobile shadow projections in his Musée français designs. As Zix's image attests, while charged with similarly ghostly asso- ciations as those of the phantasmagoria, the Musée Napoléon shadow plays were nonetheless distinctive for their unequiv- ocal materiality. The thrilling spectacle depended less in this case on the mystery of illusionism than it did on the trans- mutation of ostensibly immobile marble bodies by the flick- ering illuminations of the torch's movement through space. This event was only the latest instance of a relatively new set of viewing practices that emerged roughly simultaneously with the burgeoning interest in the particular operations of sculptural aesthetics: the enthusiasm for nighttime viewings of sculpture by torchlight or lamp.77 Although the candle or torchlight view had a long history in academic training throughout Europe, this practice apparently was an innova- tion of eighteenth-century sculpture collections.78 There was at least one documented mid-sixteenth-century case, but it appears that it was only after the founding in Rome of the Pio dementino (1771-84) that such illuminations became fash- ionable, taking hold wherever there were collections of an- tique sculpture: Charles Towneley's collection in London, and so, too, the Musée Napoléon in Paris.79 At the Gallery of Antiquities the question of how to suitably light sculptures, and not just at nighttime, so as to best reveal their three- dimensionality was one of some delicacy. During the exten- sive Louvre renovations required to install the sculptural spoils from Italy, great attention was given to the question of how to light the Apollo Belvedere and Laocoön to show them to advantage.80 The shadows with which Ingres endowed his Musée français sculptures cast a visual lure, their amorphous umbras and penumbras insisting on what we know: that Ingres saw these antiquities as they were installed in the Musée Napoléon. In this sense, scholars could imagine undertaking work that aims to make sense of their geometry-defying outlines by putting the images to the test of the real exhibition condi- tions as they were experienced in the Louvre at the turn of the eighteenth century. Perhaps it is due to the nature of shadows that these depictions seem to seductively suggest that a solution to their strangeness could be found - that, as in sciographic diagrams, an equation might be achieved that would explain these forms according to the placement of light sources and the situation of statues within the museum walls. But my sense of the fascination of Ingres's shadows hinges on their irreducibility either to the sciographic dia-</page><page sequence="17">94 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2010 VOLUME XCV NUMBER 1 gram or to the phantasmagoria. Instead, both possible modes seem here to be in play in the rendering of shadows that are simultaneously descriptive and antidescriptive. In this re- spect, these special forms might strike us as quintessentially shadowlike in that they are at once absolute testament to a "real material fact" even as they function - like their eigh- teenth-century "shadow" synonyms - as uncanny chimeras, as ghosts.81 Animation cuts both ways, then, in Ingres's vision of the antique around 1800: the shadow zones tapping into the Pygmalion promise of sculpture as body-casting-shadow, even as they insist on the artist/ viewer whose pulse likewise quick- ens before the sculptural spectacle. Ingres, the Paragone , and Sculpture in the Round A group of extant drawings speaks unequivocally to the art- ist's work on-site and allows us to say more about Ingres's work at the Musée Napoléon. Among them are occasional .drawings that recapitulate the habitual views of antique sculp- tures. Ingres's drawing of Phocion (Fig. 21), for example, comes fairly close to repeating the perspective of its engraved rendering by Pierre-Louis-Henri Laurent in the Musée fran- çais. This particular drawing by Ingres has gone down in history thanks to its famous resurfacing in the painting that set the artist on his way.82 Newly familiar with the spolia from Rome, Ingres was able to put the sculpture to timely use, turning Phocion into Ulysses in his Prix de Rome-winning canvas of 1801, Ambassadors of Agamemnon at the Tent of Achilles (Fig. 22). Lesser known by far are Ingres's other remarkable studies after the Phocion sculpture in which he considers the figure from the rear and from the side and zeros in on the head from a vertiginously low angle (Fig. 23) . These drawings tell the tale of Ingres circling the sculpture, all the while recording vantage points that depart from the familiar fron- tal view. Ingres was not alone in this preoccupation. Arts adminis- trators and politicians of the time shared his concern for viewing in the round. Even while cash-strapped, they insisted on cutting-edge installation practices in the sculpture galler- ies and splurged on a lavish new base for the Medici Venus (presumably seen in the left foreground in Fig. 20). If a number of the sculptures in the Musée Napoléon were in- stalled fairly close to the wall, records indicate that when at last the Medici Venus arrived, an event celebrated by Na- poléon' s inauguration of the newly expanded and renovated galleries, it was unveiled "on its brand new rotating stand, designed by the architect Raymond."83 In his studies after Phocion and Cupid and Psyche (Fig. 24), Ingres circled the sculptures, moving them in turn as if on a circular dais. In the striking case of Ingres's studies of Cupid and Psyche (Figs. 25, 26) the perspectives seized are extraordinary, particularly when we remember that Ingres executed the drawing for the Musée français engraving of the figures, a depiction that offers a thoroughly iconic view of the sculpture (Fig. 2). In these additional studies, Ingres is remarkably uninterested in fixing expected or even recognizable views. Instead, he has ren- dered the sculpture strange through its rotation in space, thus capturing an alien embrace less evocative of romance than of violent absorption.84 Out of alignment and seen anew, Cupid and Psychés typically saccharine aspect is here utterly transformed. 21 Ingres, Phocion , graphite on paper, 11 X 434 in.

What to make of the uncanny aspect of these views from above, below, and beside that make the familiar strange and that do so through the distortion of bodies and bodily relations? We might begin to think through these impulses by turning back to the relatively recent history of the mid-eighteenth century, when the dis- coveries of Herculaneum and Pompeii triggered a series of reflections on the status of the antique and of the art object. Such reflections - whether visual or textual - were informed by a complex admixture of desire (for the past, for the antique, for a vision of its integrity) and unrequited longing. As the archaeological process continued, the "antique" was inextricably linked at once to desire and death, grounded as it was in this most vivid incarnation in the Bay of Naples by the catastrophic events of 79 CE. By the time of Ingres' s Musée français work, the problem of antique sculpture's link to the living - and particularly via the guise of artistic training - was hotly contested.

Musei Capitolini, Rome (artwork in the public domain; photograph by the Universal Images Group, provided by Art Resource, NY) already seen, the paragone debates of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century were fundamentally concerned with, on the one hand, sculpture's remove from the living and the natural, and on the other, the potentially deleterious effects of painters' exclusive reliance on antique sculpture as model. These issues were further sharpened by early nine- teenth-century debates on the nature of the ideal. By 1805, two poles had solidified, pitting Antoine Quatremère de Quincy and his formulation of the ideal as forged through the powers of the mind against Toussaint-Bernard Émeric- David and his more empirical model of truth to nature.85 It is impossible to imagine that Ingres, in Paris and absorbed in the project of depicting antique sculpture, was ignorant of the battle lines then being drawn between the beau idéal and the beau visible or beau réel.86 And it is therefore tempting to 25 Ingres, study after Cupid and Psyche , graphite on paper, 7Vs X 2% in.

Of course, Ingres has never been held up as a painter of shadows. On the contrary, he has long been recognized as an adherent of line, wedded to the seductive power of contour, and thus a harbinger of modernist abstraction. The lineage of ingriste flatness has often been traced, from John Flaxman's recognition of Ingres's 1801 Ambassadors of Agamemnon as the best work to have been produced in France for years, to the artist's 1851 publication of a veritable Musée Ingres: Albert Magimel's Oeuvres de J. A. Ingres , illustrated by Achille Réveil. Réveil's 102 line engravings on steel of Ingres's canvases were striking for the elegant simplification of their outline depic- tion, and in this sense functioned as a sort of ode to Flax- man's famed illustrations for the Iliad and Odyssey .87 The broad analysis given here of Ingres' s Musée français images, revealing their distinctive form and the conditions in which they came into being and took on meaning, has offered an expanded topography in which to set them: a network of spaces, meanings, and practices that differently illuminate Ingres' s art. Scrutiny of Ingres' s Musée français works uncovers a Parisian nexus that unexpectedly draws together the world of the most highbrow artistic inclinations with the most wildly popular aspects of spectacular contemporary visual culture. Far from only breathing the rarified air of the austere mod- ern museum, Ingres' s Musée français work tapped into a much wider Parisian network of shadow enthusiasms that spanned the realms of the academic, museological, and mass specta- cle: from sciography and the torchlight view to the phantas- magoria. Ingres' s curious projections took shape in a mo- ment in which Paris, like Ingres, was in the thrall of shadows. Moreover, and above all, these interludes begin to piece together a picture of the affective, phenomenological valence of eighteenth-century shadow representation and thus point the way to what may have been at stake for Ingres in his determination to include them. In 1778, Herder issued a judgment that would have struck a grave note for Ingres: "engravings, drawings, and paintings can never succeed in representing [sculpture] or standing in for [sculpture] ."88 In his studies in the Musée Napoléon and in his Musée français designs, it seems that Ingres was grap- pling with a similar sense of doubt, or restlessness, or com- pensation. These drawings pose the question: How can one fix an object defined by an experience in the round? How, to put it in Herder's terms, can one give visual form to the artist's corporeal feeling? And this points the way to the final question: How should we conceive of the afterlife of Ingres's Musée français project? By way of answer, I want to summon the image of Ingres as an artist at work, an artist constantly hounded by the impulse of corporeal feeling. This is an artist whose process, handed down to us in hundreds of prelimi- nary drawings, bespeaks his desire to secure the total view, and a desire to think, to see, around the body.89 This is also an artist who formed the habit of thinking through the body: repeatedly imagining and himself inhabiting the poses of figures in his compositions.90 Seen through the lens of a distinctly modern understanding of sculpture's unique aes- thetic imperatives formulated in the eighteenth century, In- gres's early encounter with antique sculpture in the context of the Musée français project helps us to refine our thinking 26 Ingres, study after Cupid and Psyche, , graphite on paper, llA X 3Vè in.

In this sense, far from an emblem of mortification, ancient sculpture was, in Ingres's hands, decidedly modern insofar as it was always embodied: not just "of' the body but also around the body and, finally, also in the body.</page><page sequence="21">98 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2010 VOLUME XCV NUMBER 1 Sarah Betzer is assistant professor in the Mclntire Department of Art, University of Virginia. She recently published Ingres and the Stu- dio: Women, Painting, History (2012).

While I have had to bracket the work of modern sculptors from consid- eration here, there is no doubt that the dynamics in play in Ingres' s engagement with sculptural objects resonate productively with the cre- ation and exhibition practices of Ingres' s contemporaries and col- leagues Antonio Canova, Lorenzo Bartolini, and Bertel Thorwaldsen. 8.

Recent scholarship has begun to track the crucial position of the Couvent des Capucines in the first de- cade of the nineteenth century specifically in terms of its opening up new sets of relations, affiliations, and practices forged in the unraveling of the Davidian studio model.

The texts, which range in length from 60 to 140 pages, were authored by Simon-Célestin Croze-Magnan and, later, by archaeologist and theo- rist Toussaint-Bernard Émeric-David and Ennio Quirino Visconti, who became curator of antiquities in the Musée Napoléon in May 1806. Émeric-David ' s texts, which included the final portion of the history of ancient sculpture and the history of printed imagery, were reprinted in the Moniteur, the Magasin Encyclopédique, and as freestanding publica- tions. See George D. McKee, "The Musée Français and the Musée Royale: A History of the Publication of an Album of Fine Engravings, with a Catalogue of Plates and a Discussion of Similar Ventures" (MA thesis, University of Chicago, 1981), 72, 69. McKee's painstaking ac- count of the Musée français project has been instrumental to my discus- sion here. 11. Ibid., iii, 83. 12. Together with the numerous drawings authored by Bartolini and Granger, Ingres and his cohort were involved in over half (44) of the 83 engravings that appeared in the fourth volume of the Musée français. Ingres's designs included those for Cupid and Psyche, Nero, Terpsichore, Calliope, Urania, Euterpe, Mercury, a Bacchant, Antinous as an Egyptian Idol, Posidippus, Cupid, and Apollo Lykeois. McKee, ibid., 133-39, provides an invaluable table of the publication of the Musée français, complete with plates contained in each fascicule. Ingres's drawings may have been completed prior to October 1802, when the editor of the Musée français announced that his team had already assembled two hundred draw- ings, enough for the next five years of publication (ibid., 62-63). 13. Blanc, Ingres, sa vie et ses ouvrages, 8: "Pensionnaire sans pension, Ingres dut rester cinq ans à Paris, vivant comme il pouvait, travaillant pour les éditeurs de livres à figures et dessinant des antiques pour le Musée Na- poléon." 14. Ingres noted these "12 figs antiques" in Cahier IX, p. 123, reproduced and transcribed in Georges Vigne, Ingres (Paris: Citadelles, 1995), 325. Ingres also mentioned the "dessin d'après le Guide (drawing after Guido [Reni] ) which refers to the composition entitled "le dessin et la couleur," drawn by Ingres after a painting by Guido Reni and repro- duced in the Musée français, vol. 2. 15.

I am grateful to Mary Beard for her conver- sation about Aemilius Paulus's triumph, in which she emphasized the point that for Aemilius Paulus, the triumph marked the acme of his career. In this sense, the two respective triumphs commemorate quite different moments in the cycle of fame for their two respective gener- als, Aemilius Paulus and Napoléon. 18.

Of the voluminous literature on Napoleonic seizures of art, I have found particularly useful Charles Saunier, Les conquêtes artistiques de la Révolution et de l'Empire (Paris: H.

Ibid., fol. 993: "Monumens de la sculpture antique, la Grece les ceda: Rome les a perdus: leur sort changea deux fois, il ne changera plus." 23. In his indispensable analysis of these events - which sparked extraordi- narily heated debates in the capital - Pommier (L'art de la liberté, 397- 466) demonstrates that the argument that Paris was the clear home to artistic treasures was ideologically shored up under the sign of "liber- té." This rhetoric of "repatriation" predated Napoléon's confiscations but became doctrine after 1796. Gould has pointed out that the found- ing of the Musée Central des Arts played an absolutely vital role in the subsequent history of French art confiscations. Gould, Trophy of Con- quest, 40. Napoléon, who proved to be an especially canny strategist in</page><page sequence="22">INGRES'S SHADOWS 99 this domain, has been closely identified with these practices. However, as Michael Marrinan has emphasized, Napoléon received explicit in- structions about the importance of artistic seizures from the Directory government, whose vision he ultimately realized.

In a letter to the Directory dated February 19, 1797, Napoléon wrote, "We now have all that is beautiful in Italy, except a few objects that re- main at Turin and Naples"; quoted and translated in Sabine Baring- Gould, The Life of Napoleon Bonaparte (London: Methuen, [1908?]), 143.

There is some irony in the delayed exhibition of the spoils, since, as André Thouin (member of the commission of four ap- pointed by the Directory to oversee the transfer of monuments of arts and sciences from Italy) worried in 1797, any delay in their exhibition to the French public would undermine the rhetorical means by which the works had been seized in the first place.

In September 1803, Vivant Denon offered his official congratulations to the Musée français project: "on ne saurait trop louer, trop encourager cette vaste enterprise." Denon, in Le Moniteur, 21 Fructidor, Year XI [August 21, 1803], 1547-58, quoted and discussed in McKee, "The Mu- sée Français," 64. This letter includes Denon's commitment to provid- ing his full support to the project in his guise as director of the Musée Napoléon. The Gallery of Antiquities of the Musée Central des Arts opened on November 9, 1800, after which access was limited to the three final days of each Revolutionary décade, or ten-day cycle. More generous access was offered artists beginning in Year XI. Gallo, "Les antiques au Louvre," 182 n. 6. 29.

In this sense, Porro and Thomassin's plates depart from the significant model offered by François Perrier, who in 1638 published a series of one hundred engravings of antique sculptures (together with Michelan- gelo's Moses). Reissued in many editions through to Ingres's time, Per- rier's prints, unlike the bulk of future depictions, represented selected sculptures stripped of their pedestals in natural settings and included multiple views of the most prized sculptures (including the Apollo Bel- vedere, Medici Venus, Dying Gladiator, and the Farnese Hercules) .

As is apparent here, one of Herder's operative assumptions is that sculpture is de facto figurative. 48. "A creature that is nothing but an eye, indeed, an Argus with a hun- dred eyes, may look upon a statue for a hundred years and examine it from every side; but if it is without a hand with which to touch, or at least able to sense its own touching, if it possesses only the eye of a bird and is all beak, gaze, pinion, and claw, it will never have anything more than a bird's eye view.

Ingres's dating of the drawing to 1789 (when the artist was nine years old) seems likely to have been a retrospective - and perhaps ques- tionable - inscription (Hattis, 12-13). Hattis's sensitive and probing analysis of these drawings after the antique has been instrumental to the discussion that follows. Georges Vigne has recently expressed his skepticism about the drawing's inscription and date, noting that they appear to have been added much later and should be best understood as hypothetical. Vigne, "D'Ingres à Reverdin: Les secrets de l'Album Bonnal," in Gravures néoclassiques d'après François-Gédéon Reverdin: Quant la copie devient modèle, ed. Christophe Cherix and Mayte Garcia Julliard (Geneva: Cabinet des Estampes, Musée d'Art et d'Histoire, 2007), 110. 57. In a letter of 1887 to the director of the Musée Ingres, Léon Bonnal, Ingres's widow (née Delphine Ramel) dated this drawing (along with nine others) to the years of Ingres's early training. This attribution and dating have been contested by Vigne, "D'Ingres à Reverdin," 105-17, who proposes instead that the group of drawings, in all likelihood, was authored by Ingres's students. The letter by Ingres's widow is repro- duced and the suite of drawings thoroughly examined in Hattis, Ingres' Sculptural Style. The question of its attribution aside, the Apollo sheet itself testifies to the object's use: the upper and lower corners show signs of numerous tack marks. I am indebted to Margaret Grasselli for her discussion of these drawings with me, and to T. Barton Thurber, Kristin O'Rourke, and Phyllis Hattis for having made possible my ex- tended examination of the Apollo sheet. 58. Ibid., 14, 34 n. 22, and 11-14 for Hattis's discussion of the dessin en bosse, including comparative examples of student work on the subject from the Toulouse Academy. One such drawing by Ingres, exhibited in Montauban in 1862 and dated by Armand Cambon to 1795, was quite close to the Apollo Belvedere study in subject, technique, and dimen- sions: his Dessin d'après l'Appoline antique measured 24% by 15% in. (62 by 40 cm) . Georges Vigne, "Les premières oeuvres d'Ingres," Bulletin du Mttsée Ingres 76 (March 2004) : 23. 59. In his scrupulous analysis of the series of academic figure studies painted by Ingres, Vigne, "Les premières oeuvres d'Ingres," 33-35, has dated this work to 1800, identifying it as the canvas Ingres completed for the second of two trial tests (or épreuves d'essai ) that preceded par- ticipation in the Prix de Rome that year. 60. Michael Baxandall, Shadows and Enlightenment (New Haven: Yale Univer- sity Press, 1995), 4. Baxandall's observation (60) that "the main specific of projected shadow, as against shading and self-shadow, is that it is not self-supporting. It is on some surface distinct from that which is causing the privation of light. The morphology of this alien surface interferes with its form," is a particularly suggestive way to consider the depiction of the projected shadow in Ingres's Académie. My thinking about shad- ows has been immeasurably enriched by Baxandall's remarkable book. 61. Ibid., 17-31. Equally germane here is Victor Stoichita's important anal- ysis of shadows, in which he posits that it is in shadows that the history of artistic representation and a philosophy of representation converge. Stoichita, A Short History of the Shadow (London: Reaktion, 1997). Given the perceived centrality of shadows to fundamental questions of human perception, we should not be surprised by the fact that there was a tre- mendous overlap among eighteenth-century authors concerned with shadows and those concerned with sculpture. 62.

Here I propose that Ingres belongs among the ranks to whom Baxan- dall (ibid., 80) referred when he wrote that "much of the richest En- lightenment shadow-watching is quite pre-mathematical." 65. This genre of shadow is termed "Waltzian shadows" by Baxandall, ibid., 60, 132. 66. This sketch (Musée Ingres, inv. no. 867.60) was bequeathed by Ingres to his hometown of Montauban in 1851. It is reproduced in Daniel Ternois, Peintures: Ingres et son temps ( artistes nés entre 1740 et 1830), Mon- tauban, Musée Ingres, Inventaire des collections publiques françaises, 1 1 (Paris: Éditions des Musées Nationaux, 1965), no. 255. This unattrib- uted work seems to have been executed by the same artist responsible for another study bequeathed by Ingres to Montauban and fascinating for our purposes: Vue de la Galerie du Musée des Antiques au Louvres. It is reproduced in ibid., no. 254. 67. "L'atelier, jusqu'à nouvel ordre, était dans un long corridor de l'ancien couvent des Capucines, labyrinthe où ceux qui l'habitaient encore finissaient par se perdre quelquefois, comme les étrangers qui venaient les y chercher. On ne se retrouvait souvent qu'en s'appelant à voix haute, parmi les murs écroulés ou pendants de ce vieux monastère." Marceline Desbordes-Valmore, L'atelier d'un peintre: Scènes de la vie privée (Paris: Miroirs Éditions, 1992), 27-28. I am indebted to Stephen Bann's probing discussion of Desbordes-Valmore' s text, "The Studio as a Scene of Emulation." 68.

Richard Crangle (Exeter: University of Exeter Press, 2000), 157-71. The fact that the church of the Capuchins (de- stroyed in 1806) was, as Mannoni notes, the site of the tombs of Louise de Lorraine, queen of France, and the marquise de la Pompadour would no doubt have lent a further ghostly frisson to the performances held at the convent. 69.

François-Louis Dejuinne's Girodet Painting Pygmalion (1821) depicts this practice. Weston ("David's Alexander, Apelles, and Campaspe ," 151 n. 28) has recently emphasized that the Argand lamp, first invented in about 1784, was put to use in Robertson's phantasmagoria performances be- ginning in 1798. 73.

Whiteley, "Light and Shade in French Neo-Classicism," Burlington Maga- zine 117, no. 873 (December 1975): 772 n. 29. 77. See the foundational article by Oskar Bãtschmann in which he analyzes the pivotal role charted for the spectator (whose viewing presence was deemed essential for the ultimate meaning of the work of art) in rela- tion to the torchlight view in the eighteenth century: Bãtschmann, "Pygmalion als Betrachter: Die Rezeption von Plastik und Malerei in der zweiten Hälfte des 18. Jahrhunderts," in Der Betrachter ist im Bild : Kunstwissenschaft und RezeptionsāsthetiĶ ed. Wolfgang Kemp (Berlin: Dietrich Reimer Verlag, 1992), 183-224. 78. It is depicted, for instance, in Johan Zoffany's Antique Room at the Royal Academy at New Somerset. Ingres's contemporary Canova took this prac- tice to new ends; he reputedly achieved the exceptional finishing of his sculptures (evocatively described by Satish Padiyar as the "licked, or obsessively caressed, Canovian envelope") by working their surfaces by the light of a single candle. See Padiyar, Chains: David, Canova, and the Fall of the Public Hero in Postrevolutionary France (University Park: Pennsyl- vania State University Press, 2007), 125-31, at 125; and see Hugh Hon- our, "Canova's Studio Practice," pt. 2, "1792-1822," Burlington Magazine 114 (1972): 214-29. 79.

I am indebted to my colleague Bernard Frischer at the University of Virginia, whose ex- traordinary digital re-creation of a torchlight view on a 3-D model of the Laocoön was a revelation for my thinking about such experiences; see http://vimeo.com/46222628. 80. Gallo, "Les antiques au Louvre," 183 n. 16. Preoccupations with light- ing run throughout discussions about the sculpture galleries, where "Those consulted insisted that conditions of display must at least equal those at the Vatican, especially with respect to lighting"; Archives Na- tionales, Paris [Arch. Nat.], F21 569 (5), fol. 10, quoted in McClellan, Inventing the Louvre, 149 n. 99. The degree of attention paid by the gov- ernment to questions of installation is suggested by the fact that "The Directory gave its approval [on the suite of rooms beneath the Galerie d'Apollon being given over to the antique sculpture galleries] on con- dition that the Laocoön be placed prominently in good light and that the Apollo Belvedere in 'its own temple.' " Ibid., 149-50.

Baxandall, Shadows and Enlightenment, 144. 82. The antique sculpture, seized from the Vatican, was on view in Paris beginning in 1800. At that time, the sculpture was identified in the in- ventory simply as a "Greek hero," though it was identified as Ulysses by Louis-François Petit-Radel in 1804 ( Les monumens antiques du Musée Napoléon dessinés et gravés par Thomas Piroli [Paris: Piranesi Frères, 1804], pl. 65).

One month later, on his birthday, Napoléon inaugurated the newly expanded and renovated Gallery of Antiquities. A bronze medal was struck to commemorate the occasion. Emblazoned with the Medici Venus on one side and Napoléon's pro- file on the other, the accompanying text pronounced that "our victory is dedicated to the arts [Aux Arts La Victoire].

This aspect of Ingres's practice merits consideration in relation to ana- logues in the making and viewing of eighteenth- and early nineteenth- century sculpture. Édme Bouchardon's remarkable sanguine studies for his L'Amour se faisant un arc de la massue d'Hercule (1750) - in which the artist circled the studio model, capturing nine different perspectives on the subject - evolved into a sculpture whose equivocal reception was shaped, Katie Scott has forcefully argued, by the challenge of its shift- ing vantage points. Scott, "Under the Sign of Venus: The Making and Meaning of Bouchardon's L'Amour in the Age of the French Rococo," in Manifestations of Venus: Art and Sexuality , ed. Caroline Arscott and Scott (Manchester, U.K.: Manchester University Press, 2000), 69-89. Canova's practice demonstrates a similar attention to issues of percep- tion, in terms of both making and reception: from his labor-intensive treatment of the sculptures' "skin" to his careful orchestration of their viewing conditions, which in some instances included rotating bases. For valuable discussions of the artist's distinctive focus on surface effect and the resulting frustrations for viewers, see Padiyar, Chains, 120-41; and Potts, The Sculptural Imagination, 38-59. 85. The key texts for this debate were Toussaint-Bernard Émeric-David, Recherches sur l'art statuaire considéré chez les anciens et chez les modernes (Paris: Veuve Nyon Aîné, 1805); and Antoine Quatremère de Quincy, "Sur l'idéal dans les arts du dessin," Archives Littéraires de l'Europe 2, no. 6 (1805): 385-404. For analysis of this debate in relation to the work of David, see Dorothy Johnson, Jacques-Louis David: Art in Metamorphosis (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993), 153-62; and Bordes, Jacques-Louis David, 185. See also Régis Michel, Le beau idéal, ou L'art du concept (Paris: Éditions de la Réunion des Musées Nationaux, 1989). 86. See further discussion of Ingres's relation to these debates in Sarah Betzer, Ingres and the Studio: Women, Painting History (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2012), 74-75. 87. John Flaxman's designs for illustrations for Homer's Iliad and Odyssey were engraved by Tommaso Piroli in 1793. Réveil was exceptionally familiar with this legacy, having executed line engravings on steel after Flaxman's oeuvre, including L'Iliade d'Homère: Recueil de ses compositions gravées au trait par Réveil (Paris: Audot, 1835). Flaxman's admiration of Ingres is discussed by Henri Delaborde, Ingres: Sa vie, ses travaux, ses doctrines (Paris: Pion, 1870), 213. 88. Herder, Sculpture , 91. 89. It is evident, for instance, in Ingres's spectacular efforts to see, and to imagine, around the portrait sitter, surely an important function of the mirrors included in major portraits like the Comtesse d'HaussonviUe (1845) and Madame Moitessier (1856). Studies for both of these paint- ings reiterate Ingres's preoccupation with seizing, fixing, and imagin- ing views around the sitters in three dimensions. Likewise germane here is the tantalizing account left to us by a model who posed for In- gres's Turkish Bath. In this instance, she reported, Ingres installed oc- tagonal mirrors in the studio, presumably to exponentially multiply the number of views of the studio model available to the artist. This aspect of Ingres's work is discussed in Betzer, Ingres and the Studio, 17-67. The model's account is cited in Van Liere, "Ingres' 'Raphael and the For- narina,'" 115 n. 19. 90.
