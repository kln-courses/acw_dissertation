Cambridge, Ma : Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology , Harvard University. Foreword by C.C. Lamberg-Karlowsky and preface by V.l. Sarianidi. By R. BISCIONE. In Middle and Late Bronze Age, a peculiar culture with specific types of settlement pattern and social structure that continued well into historic times, developed in the oases of southern Central Asia, from the Murghab to northeastern Afghanistan. The culture of Bactria and Margiana, that has wide-range connections with Elam, eastern and northern Iran, Baluchistan, the Indus valley, even with northern Syria and Anatolia, is crucial for the formation of ethnos and culture of Ancient Iran and Vedic India. In fact the occurrence of Andronovo pottery testifies the presence in southern Central Asia of nomads from the northern steppe (Indo-Iranians ?). The acme of this culture is identified by Hiebert with the presence of the Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) "... a specific small finds assemblage... including stylistically distinctive carved stone objects, metal objects and seals with zoomorphic, anthropomorphic and geometrical des- igns that co-occur with ceramics from Central Asian type" (p. 1). The culture was mainly known from grave goods and architectural monuments exposed in wide excavations of sin- gle-period, short lived sites, and from objects of the antiquity market. Periodization and chronology were therefore based on a sequence of shifting micro-oases or sites, not on the results of stratigraphie excavations in multi-period settle- ments. This volume which concerns mainly Margiana, the ancient delta of the Murgab river, focused on the Russian- American researches at Gonur depe; it gives at last a welcome sequence and reexamines the old information in the light of the new, important evidence. The book, based on Hiebert's doctoral dissertation, presents after two chapters dealing with the environments of Central Asia (chap. 1) and the oases and sites of Margiana (chap. 2), the stratigraphie excavation at Gonur (chap. 3), the ceramic sequence, the relative and absolute chronology of Margiana (chap. 4-5), the architecture of Gonur (chap. 6-7), the eco- nomy of Gonur (chap. 8), the origin and development of the BMAC (chap. 9), the trends and tradition of the Central Asian cultural history (chap. 10). Parts of chapters 8-9 were already published in Antiquity 68, 259. The stratigraphie sounding at Gonur, described in great details "... provided a rich assemblage of ceramics and char- coal for dating, and deposits of seeds and bones". In the finely stratified midden seven layers, divided into two periods, have been recognized. For the first time numeric data are given on rim, base and body sherds by locus and period; percentages of occurrence of types of rims in periods 1 and 2 are also given. The two periods recognized in the deep sounding show clearly different ceramic assemblages which have been used to periodize the pottery from the large scale excavations. A third period, identified by old excavations at Takhirbaj, is not represented in the stratigraphie sounding. A general typology has been made that has been based on more than one criterion. Groups are defined either on vessel size or thickness of body or shape. Types and subtypes are based on their morphology but sometimes vessels that are different are put under the same type, e. g. type 2A.2, a sharply grooved rim bowl, is illustrated by a conical bowl without foot and a hemispherical footed bowl (pp. 46, 48-49); type 3.B2, short necked storage pots, includes globular squatted and ovoid elongated jars (pp. 54-55). The result is a sound, useful grouping of ceramics, where most of the shapes have a chronological significance, even if the methodology is dis- concerting for a non pragmatist, theoretical-minded reader. The figures do not have scale or indication of size, so the reader has to look in the description of types and to use scanty information. Colour is indicated only with an impres- sionistic system, e.g. buff-reddish, not with an objective sys- tem like the Munsell colour code. The general typology has led to periodization of the Mar- giana sequence, to which Bactria was correlated. Period 1 is contemporary and culturally strictly connected to late Namaz- ga V of the piedmont Turkmenistan, from where came the settlers; Period 2, contemporary to period Namazga VI of piedmont but with lesser cultural connections, witnessed the interactions with northeastern nomads, the flowering of BMAC, the expansion of settlements to Bactria and the presence of BMAC in very large area; in period 3 BMAC dies out, connections with Namazga VI are stronger and connections with the nomadic world continue. This periodi- zation differs significantly from those previously suggested, that were based on the theory of retraction of the delta (and therefore shifting of the settled micro-oases) southwards. It is now clear that all the micro-oases of Margiana were settled in all the periods. One just would wish that in the distribution map (fig. 4. 41), not only periods 1 and 2, but also period 3 were included. The important, convincing sequence here pre- sented offers a new vision of the origin, development and Paléorient, vol. 21/1, p. 135-136 © CNRS Éditions 1995</page><page sequence="2">136 character of the Central Asian Bronze Age culture. Absolute chronology is based on 14C dates; there are old ones to which a welcome new set is added. However why are Periods 1 and 2 dated 2200-2000 and 2000-1750 in the text (pp. 174- 175) whereas in figures 10. 1 and 10. 6-8, periods 1, 2 and 3 are respectively dated 2200-1900, 1900-1750, 1750-1500 ? Archaeologists of former Soviet Union prefer instead data- tions about 500 years lower. Central to Hiebert's reexamina- tion of the evidence is the definition he gives of the BMAC, its chronological limits and the determination of the nature of its connections with eastern Iran, Baluchistan, Indus Valley and Elam. Although many elements of the BMAC can be found scattered over a very large geographical and chrono- logical span, from mid 3rd millennium Sistan and Southern Central Asia to Akkad-Ur III and Susa, Hiebert rather convin- cingly proves that the association of these elements is typical of BMAC, which therefore is defined not by presence of characters, but rather by their co-occurrence. Less convincing is the explanation presented for the oc- currence of BMAC objects in large areas of Eastern Iran, Baluchistan and Indus Valley in the early second millennium that should be due to the "... movements of Central Asian people, probably for resource acquisition through conquest or trade" (p. 164). BMAC objects are mainly luxury, elite objects that have been found in graves extraneous of the local culture, with Central Asian pottery ; or in local graves associated with local luxury items; or in hoards (Hissar UIC, cenotaphs according to Hiebert) with local luxury materials. The mea- nings of these three types of occurrence are very different Recensions et colloques and cannot be unified. The graveyard of Shahdad has a very rich set of BMAC luxury objects and it is probably the key site for the understanding of the interactions of Bactria-Mar- giana and the southern lands, but it is practically unpublished. There the BMAC seems to be associated only with the local culture and the objects should range from mid-late 3rd mil- lennium to early 2nd, but this is definitely not enough to draw conclusions. Very interesting is Hiebert's interpretation of the peculiar architecture and settlement pattern of Bactria and Margiana; open small sites scattered in micro-oases, each of them with a large fortress. It is compared to the settlement system of the historical Central Asian oases, with scattered open small sites, centred on a fortress ( qaVeh ), a feudal agricultural manor. This was the residence of the dehqan who controlled the fields along the main branch of the canal and paid tribute to the khan , the ruler of the oasis. According to Hiebert, the beginning of this type of settlement pattern that continued well into mediaeval times, can be found in period 1 and were dictated by the strong limitations imposed by the oasis envi- ronment. The interpretation is very convincing and ties the origin of the model to the first settlement of the large deltaic oases of southern Central Asia. Hiebert's volume contains a large amount of data, a rich and very up-to-date bibliography, some important stratigra- phie evidence, new data interpretation and like many impor- tant books some controversial parts. In short, it is a book that must have a place in every archaeological library.</page></plain_text>
