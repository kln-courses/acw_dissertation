THIS book is-described as ' being a continuation of the experiment which toolk shape first in " The World as Imagination,"' and as being ' no. 2 of the - World as Imagination" series'-. It gives a shorter, clearer, and more brightly written account of the general view set forth in the previous work; and the author hopes to fol- low it up later with a book on the problem of Individuality. The</page><page sequence="2">456 CRITICAL NOTICES: doctrine here expounded with considerable skill' and great wealth of illustration is one at which Mr. Fawcett has been gradually arriving His earlier writings might be broadly characterised as pluralistic, with -a distinct affinity to Pragmatism and Humanism. Many traces of this earlier attitude are still to be found in his present work; but he is now more nearly related to the dominant school of British idealism,especially perhaps as represented by Mr. McTaggart. To Hegel, however, and to Mr. Bradley he is still marked-ly opposed. Probably his general position will be best understood by noticing the grounds for this opposition. Hegel is of course commonly accused of rationalism. His system is often described as one of ' panlogism'. It is very easy to bring forward difficulties in the way of his system thus in- terpreted. . The most obvious difficulty is that with regard to the transition'from Logic to the philosophy of Nature. Schelling's re- ference to the ',ugly black ditch' has been often repeated. In par- ticular the objection has been driven home in our own country by Mr.' Pringle-Pattison and Mr. Ward. The old reference of Mr. Bradley to the ' unearthly ballet of bloodless categories' is also still remembered, and his later quotation of the line ascribed to Shake- speare-' Love has teason, Reason none'. Even Mr. McTaggart, though professing in the main to interpret Hegel, has given to emotion and to individuality a place that is not easily to be found in the words of the master. At any rate, most people admit that the philosophy of nature is the weakest part of the Hegelian system. Now Mr. Fawcett, adopting independently a suggestion previously put forward (as he has himself noted) by Frohschammer, urges that the missing link is to be found in Imagination, whose- claims he supports with much vigour and considerable subtlety, and in a style of imaginative daring that corresponds very well to the principle that he has chosen. So far as -Hegelianism is concerned-, it would of course be out of place here to att'empt its defence, even if I felt myself competent for such a task. It must suffice to say that there has probably been a good deal of misinterpretation of it. Hegel's last word, it should be remembered, it not Logic but Spirit. Logic itself, as he conceives -it, is in the main a process of dialectic by which we are led to see the inadequacy of the more purely 'intellectual' or ab- stract conceptions, as contrasted with those that are more concrete and spiritual: Mr. Bradley's saying-'the more that anything is spiritual, so much the more is it veritably real'-may be a better expression of 'the essential message of Hegel' than 'the actual is rational'. It seems to be true, however, that he failed to show in a manner that, carried conviction how a spiritual interpretation is to be given to the processes of nature. Hence even Hegelians may allow that there is room for reconstruction within this province; and the contention that such a principle of reconstruction can best be supplied by an appeal to Imagination is one that calls at least for careful consideration.</page><page sequence="3">DOUGLAS FAWCETT, Divine Imagining. 457 In support of his thesis, Mr. Fawcett claims that there are no less than sixteen respects in which Imagination supplies a more satisfactory interpretation than most of the other principles that have been appealed to-such as reason, feeling, or intuition. It would take too long to consider these claims in detail; but perhaps the main contentions may be conveniently summed up under a smaller number of general headings. 1. Mr. Fawcett claims that the conception of a creative imagina- tion enables us to have a philosophy which is essentially monistic without being singularistic, and which leads to a view of ultimate reality that is anthropocentric without being anthropomorphic (if such a distinction may be allowed-the expressions are not Mr. Faweett's). For the imaginative attitude (in its constructive, not in its purely reproductive aspect) is emphatically human, and yet leads to the transcendence of any particular individuality. It implies plurality, and yet seeks to combine the separate elements in a comprehensive unity. The exact relations that Mr. Fawcett believes to subsist between finite centres and the larger unity that underl;es them will no doubt be more fully discussed in the work that he has promised on Individuality; but in a general way they are indicated in the present book, and the claims that he enumerates as 1, 2, 7, 9 and 16 all appear to relate to the advanta'ges that his theory possesses from this point of view. 2. He thinks, further, that his theory, more adequately than any other, provides a place both for a perfect cosmic order-a 'divine event to which the whole creation moves'-and also for the apparent contingency in our finite experience; thus enabling us, among other things, to deal effectively with the problem of evil, without, on the one hand, denying its existence or ignoring its importance, or, on the other hand, throwing the responsibility for its existence directly upon the principle that underlies and supports the cosmic order. For imagination is constructive, and implies a process towards a certain completeness that is not at present realised. It implies a universe, but by no means a 'block universe'. The claims that he enumerates as 3, 6 and 10 seem all to be connected with this contention. 3. He urges also (what indeed follows pretty directly from what has just been stated) that his view enables us to believe that we can have a genuine apprehension of ultimate reality, and not merely of appearance; and that we can assign a definite place within that reality to activity, causation, things, relations, evolution, and the time proCess in general. His claims with reference to these points are enumerate I as 4, 5, 6, 11, 12 and 14. 4. He claims, moreover, that from his point of view a new inter- pretation can be given to the Platonic doctrine of Ideas and to certain types of Oriental mysticism. For, though it is wrong to make any sharp antithesis between Appearance and Reality, or to describe the world of our present experience as Maya or Illusion, yet it has to be recognised that we find ourselves in the midst of</page><page sequence="4">458 CRITICAL NOTICES: a process whose b-eginning and end are concealed from our appre- hension; and we can only very pattially conjecture the principles. by which its course is guided. The references to these points are contained in numbers 8, 9 and 15 of Mr. Fawcett's claims. With some -reservations, I am -disposed to allow that in the course of his expositiou he -makes good most of the claims that he has put forward. The reservations relate chiefly to the time pro- cess, the problem of evil, and the place of contingency,, to which reference will have to be made later. If the difficulties connected, with these wcould be satisfactorily removed-a pretty large 'if ' the principle of creative Imagination would not have much to fear. I think it must be conceded that modern psychology (at least in this country) has done but scant justice to -the creative aspect of Imagination. When Ribot brought out his Fyork on Creative- Imagination in 1900, he had to note that the study of it had been almost.entirely neglected by psychologists. Indeed, Mr. Fawcett's own work is somewhat disappointing in this respect. He does not bring out as definitely as one could wish the way in which the creative aspect of Imagination is related to its more receptive an&amp;- reproductive sides. Perhaps the projected work on Individuality will supply what is wanted. But at least he has emphasised a principle which comprehends within itself many different aspects, and which is well adapted to conciliate many old antagonisms. Such oppositions as that between Realism and Idealism, or that between the types of Idealism represented by Plato, Berkeley, Hegel, and Schopenhauer respectively, certainly have their edges considerably blunted by a doctrine that enables us to recognise that all that we are and know may be characterised as being ' such stuff as dreams are made of,' and yet that it does not on that account cease to have gLenuine objectivity, reality' and significance; and this is what I take to be -the gist of Mr. Fawcett's argument. Nor -is the reconciliation between these apparently antagonistic Schools brought about-by the way of compromise or accommodation, but rather by the eknphasis that is laid upon a more comprehensive way of thinking. -What seems to be most fundamental in the theory that is here maintained is that no form of existence is to be regarded as atomic. All things,' as Mr. Fawcett is fond of quoting, 'in one another's being mingle.' Imagination supplies the ' spiritual bond' by which separate existences are combined in a single Cosmos. No doubt,' as Mr. Fawcett is .aware, -the necessity for such a bond has, in some form, or other, been recognised by most, if not all, the writers whho can,, in any really intelligible sense, be described as idealistic. Indeed it has been contepded (by, Mr. J. W. Scott, for instance, in his recent work on Syndicalismn and Philosophical Realism) that it is the presence or absence of such a recognition that cdnstitutes the essential-difference between idealism and realism. Certainly, in most other respects the distinction appears to be somewhat evanescent. However that may be, Mr. Fawcett at least lays</page><page sequence="5">DOUGLAS FAWCETT, Divine Imagining. 459 great stress on this point. In order to give emphasis to it, he has even ventured to 'coin some new words. He refers to the mode of apprehension in which distinguishable features are comprehended as ' consciring'; and, in order to mark the contrast between this and less synoptic modes of apprehension, he uses the terms ' scious ' and 'sciring'. There is certainly some logical justification for these innovations. The English use of the terms, 'science,' conscience"' 'consciousness,' etc., would undoubtedly seem awkward and con- f using to any one who had not become familiar with it; but it is probably too late to try to make the English language logical or scientific (perhaps Mr. Fawcett would prefer to say ' conscientific '). 'Consciring' would perhaps be a convenient word to adopt; but it may be doubted whether ' scious ' and ' sciring' could ever come into general use. Might not the terms ' apprehend' and 'comprehend' serve sufficiently well to mark the distinction that he has in view? -I mean as they are used, for instance, by Shakespeare when he says of ' strong imagination' that ' if it would but apprehend some joy, it comprehends some bringer of that joy'. Or again Kant's term 'synoptic' might serve to indicate what Mr. Fawcett means; only unfortunately it has no corresponding verb. Mr. Sorley (in his book on Moral Values and the Idea of God) has recently used it a good deal in connexion with the work of imagination (pp. 252, 262, 463, etc.). 'Synthetic' of course is misleading. It seems to imply the pre-existence of disconnected elements. Mr. Ward brought out long ago its unsatisfactoriness in psychology on this account. But, at any rate, whatever we may think of the language, Mr. Fawcett's exposition of what he understands by ',consciring' is certainly one of the most interesting and instructive parts of his work. The general doctrine of Imagination, however, is perhaps not quite as new as Mr. Fawcett seems to believe. Though he refers to Frohschammer, he does not appear to be acquainted with the interesting work on Die Phantasie als Grundpriincip des TWeltpro- cesses, in which the general significance of Imagination as a creative power is discussed. It is true that Frohschammer professed to eschew metaphysics, and set forth his doctrine in a more tentative and much less fascinating form than Mr. Fawcett. But the general conception appears to be similar. Many metaphysical 'idealists' also have, more or less explicitly, recognised the creative function of imagination. Hegel himself is never more in his element than when (as in the -,Jsthetic) he is dealing with imaginative creations. Edward Caird, one of the most faithful of Hegel's disciples, once remarked that any one who understood Shakespeare would have gone a long way towards the understanding of God-which seems to be a way of saying that the world is to be regarded as a product of creative imagination. Mr. Pringle-Pattison also, who, though somewhat critical of Hegel's work, is to a large extent associated with the same idealistic tradition, has declared (The Idea of God, p. 127) that 'the truth of the poetic imagination is perhaps the</page><page sequence="6">460 CRITICAL NOTICES: profoundest doctrine of a true philosophy'; and- has even quoted with approval the saying of Mr. Yeats, that 'whatever of philosophy has been made Foetry is alone permanent'. Mr. Sorley's recent work has already been referred to. lEte says in one passage (p. 262) 'The philosophical synopsis is a process in which imaqination is called in to construct a new. intuition, based on the facts and con- nexions' laid bare -by analysis, but imitating the togetherness or wholeness of perception'. Is not this 'consciring'? - Such anticipations or parallels, however, do not either impair,the value of Mr. Fawcett's work or detract from its originality. They only serve to show that the theory which he seeks to' maintain is one that many people have been feeling after and partly recognising. No one, so far as I am aware, ihas definitely worked if out as a bold metaphysical construction; and certainly no one has brought it so im- pressively into relation to the speculative thought of our time. And we may say of him, as Aristotle said of Plato,-that his discourses 4are never comvmonplace; they always exhibit grace and originality and thought'. But it may be well to- continue the quotation: ' Perfection in everything can hardly be expected '. There are at least some parts of Mr. Fawcett's work that I find it difficult to follow. He certainly ventures on somewhat daring, speculations with regard to the way in which the creative Imagination may be supposed to have worked in the -evolution of our world. He admits that what -he says about this is only to be 'regarded as a tentative hypothesis-for 'dogmatism on issues of cosmic range is out of place' (p. 41). But in some respects at least one may qu&amp;tion the plausibility of the hypothesis. The idea of a 'metaphysical fall' (pp. 186 and 225) is not altogether novel, and it is no doubt a con- venient way of evading a difficulty; but it, is "surely not easy to reconcile it with the idea of a synoptic creative principle. One seems almost to miss the 'infernal serpent'. And, if the signi- ficance of the imaginative construction isto be taken seriously, one would suppose that it must have been due to a rise rather than a fall. It is somewhat difficult, indeed, to see at all definitely how the creative principle is to be understood. Mr. Fawcett states emphatically that the divine Imagination is not to be regarded as 'personal' (pp. 73, 2-17, 219); yet it would seem at least that it satisfies Mr. Balfour's criterion of personality-it 'takes sides'. It has to be noted, however, that Mr. Fawcett postulates (especially in chap. x.) a limited God, or perhaps limited gods and even demons, in addition to thQ Cosmic Imagination. But the relations' between these do not seem to be made altogether clear. Again, the prqblem of time is touched upon much too lightly by Mr. Fawcett. 'There is no time,' he says, 'apart from time content' (p. 110). Agreed. But the time process, it,iwould seem, has to make a beginning. It is, one gathers, a creation of the Divine Imagining. Such' a beginning is surely even more difficult to picture than to conceive. Mr. Fawcett, like some other speculative philosophers, favours the hypothesis of recurring cycles; but he thinks of the cycles as</page><page sequence="7">DOUGLAS FAWCETT, Divine Imagining. 461 succeeding one another with modifications, like the successive editions of a book (p.. 149). This is, in some ways, an attractive supposition*; but at least it seems to imply something of the nature of ' trial and error' and a certain lack of foresight., 'Deliberation,' he says (p. 190), ' is a secondary phenomenon within a world, and one necessary to ignorance and weakness alone'. But I should have thought that 'trial and error' was even more obviously- a sign of ignorance. He suggests that Imagining 'creates as a lark sings'; but it seems to be rather more like Browning's 'wise thrush' that repeats its notes twice over; and apparently it makes some false notes. In order to account for the presence of evil in the world, Mr. Fawcett is4forced to recognise (pp. 143-144) an element of chance. But this seems to imply the existence of conditions external to the Divine Imagining. We seem to be involved in a dualism here, as Frohschammer perhaps even more obviously was. If we were to regard imagination as being, in Kant's phrase, a I blind faculty,' it would be more easy to admit that itmight sometimes lose its way; but its gift of ' consciring' ought surely to save it from such aber- rations. Obviously Mr. Fawcett combines an intense -realisation of the evils that exist in our world with an equally intense conviction that they will all ultimately jbe removed. It is a pity, I think, that he has not taken more account of the conception of a 'creation of creators' suggested by Howison ana emphasised by Ward. This at-least does furnish some explanation of the imperfection of finite individualities and of the conditions with which they, have to deal. If evil means opportunity for creative activity, it is at least not as bad as it seems; and if as Mr. Fawcett appears to, believe, creative imagination is the supremest bliss (p. 100), we have not much reason to complain that some of the creating has to be done by us. There is, indeed-, one striking passage (p. 189) in which this solution is pretty definitely hinted at. 'The Duchess d'Abrantes said of Napoleon's minions, after the return from Elba, "Ces hommes n'6taient pas les siens, ils 6taient eux-m6mes ". With the birth of the sentients Divine Imagining surrenders in part Its control.. The sentients are not wholly Its, but also " eux-m6mes " !' But, if this is allowed, it hardly seems necessary to appeal to chance or to postulate a revised edition of the universe more nearly in accordance with the heart's, desire. As Mr. Fawcett himself remarks (p. 102), 'there are symphonies that transform discords'. If once chance is admitted (though perhaps Mr. Ward's ' contingency' is not open to this objection), we seem to allow something that is quite beyond the control of the Divine Imagining; and, if this is allowed/how are we to justify the complete confidence that Mr. Fawcett evidently has in a ' far-off divine event'? The objection is no doubt partly removed by the recognition of subordinate gods. ' In the end,' Mr. Fawcett says (p. 234), 'all will be well; but the young sub-system . . . can- not escape the trials and misadventures incidental to its youth'. To one who is not acquainted with any of the gods or demons that are presupposed in Mr. Fawcett's account, it is hardly possible to</page><page sequence="8">462 CRITICAL NOTCCES: pass judgment on their wild oats or oh their prospects of maturity; but it would seem at least that the Divine Imagining must be -to some extent- responsible for their ,upbringing. It almost' looks as if they might- profit by -a -mission from some of our newer educa- tionalists. Of course, as Mr., Fawcett says in a different connexion (p. 223), 'our private imagining . . is not 'adequate to cosmic imagining; and modesty enjroirs reticence'. Still, if we put for- ward any hypotheses, we must try to make them as intelligible and coherent as possible. There is a great deal of interesting material (some of it rather elaborate anti highly speculative) in Mr. Fawcett's book with which it would not be possible to deal satisfactorily in such a review as this. It is very probable that some-it may be all- of the criticisms that I have made are due to an imperfect grasp of the author's meaning. It takes some time for his ideas to soak in-. It is to be hoped that he will- not fail to bring out before long the book on In- dividuality, which ought to clear up much that still remains a little dark. In general, it appears to me that he has made out a good case for assigning to imagination a larger place than it has hitherto held in the interpretation of the Cosmos ;_ but I am not wholly con- vinced that it can stand so completely alone as he appears to sup- pose. I think he treata the logical understanding too slightingly and the conception of value too slightly. The former defect is per- haps a legacy from his more pragmatic and pluralistic period. But, with all the -qualifications that may ha,ve to be made, it must be allowed -that he has produced an attractive book that should be read by every one who cares for the more speculative aspects of philosophy. Even if his theories are not entirely novel, and not entirely clear and convincing, his independent method of developing them and the suggestiveness of his exposition may well make his book serve as a landmark in metaphysical speculation. I have only to add that the book is furnished with an admirable Table of Contents, but is unfortunately without an Index-a serious deficiency in a book of this kind. J. S. MACKENZIE.</page></plain_text>
