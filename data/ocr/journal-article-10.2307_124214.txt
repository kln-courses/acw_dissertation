<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cultural associations and mechanisms of change in anthropomorphic figurines during the Neolithic in the eastern Mediterranean basin Brad Bartel This paper represents the first in a series of research projects concerning anthropomorphic figurines of the Neolithic period in the Mediterranean basin. Since there has been a great revival in figurine analysis during this decade, both in New World and Old World archaeology, it is hoped that this new research will be more explicit and objective than previous attempts. Much of figurine research is fraught with subjective fascination with the artifact per se, and many interpretations concerning function are purely intuitive (e.g. Gimbutas 1974a). This specific study deals with problems of chronology, methods of cross-cultural analysis, and potential mechanisms pro- moting culture change. Further projects are associated with the development of a calculus or 'transformational grammar' of figurine manufacture and the spatial functioning of this class of artifact in specific regions of Europe and south-west Asia. History of figurine research Let me present a brief history of European figurine research and of how the logic of interpreta- tion has been associated with oscillation in the disciplines' paradigmatic structure. It was during the last two decades of the nineteenth century that Upper Palaeolithic and Neolithic figurines were initially recognized. This has stimulated the interpretations concerned with a long tradition of figurine manufacture associated with 'mother goddess' worship. These assumptions of functional continuity, never explicitly tested, still cloud today's interpretations of figurines. Many of the famous nineteenth-century archaeologists dealt with the figurine problem. For example, Sir Flinders Petrie rejected the idea of Egyptian Early Dynastic figurines associated with a fertility cult. Sir Arthur Evans extended Petrie's rejection to the total inventory of Aegean figurines but later believed them to be prototypes of the south-west Asian mother goddess (Ucko 1968). What developed was a belief in a long tradition of mother goddess worship dating back to the Upper Paleolithic and continuing in the south-west Asian Bronze and Iron Ages. Such interpretations were based upon simple analogies, whereby ethnohistoric documentation concerning mother goddess worship and use of figurines from the Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages was extended to all figurines of all time periods in both Europe and south-west Asia. The archaeologists assumed that Palaeolithic figurines represented a mother goddess and therefore the Neolithic function and style of figurines were directly inherited.

Pre-Dynastic Egyptian figurines were variously described as concubines for the dead, servant figures, offering bearers, or as fertility symbols acting as protective figures (Ucko 1968:415). Material from other areas of south-west Asia has been viewed as children's dolls or as devices for sympathetic magic. During the early twentieth century the material from south-west Asia, Greece, and Crete continued to be discussed in terms of fertility and the related mother goddess concept. Hutchinson basically followed Evans' interpretation of the Cretan material, but added that the figurines were not actual representations of the mother goddess, but amulets. He also suggested the figurines' association with childbirth ritual (Ucko 1968:416). With the excavation this century of many important Neolithic sites in eastern Europe, such as Vinca, Starcevo, and Karanovo, attempts were made to compare figurine styles in Europe and south-west Asia. This was done for the purpose of validating chronology inter-regionally. Weinberg's (1951) research is a significant departure during this period. It is a brief examination into the use of attribute analysis for figurine comparison. Seven figurines from Greece, the Cyclades, and Crete were found to share what Weinberg considered essential discriminatory features of a seated posture, folded legs, above average size, and relatively careful modelling. From the waist up, the figurines shared features with many other Aegean types. Weinberg argued that the exaggeration of the lower body parts denoted steatopygia. Looking for simi- larities outside the Aegean, Weinberg correlated this seated type with a possible origin in Anatolia or north Mesopotamia. The research was purely qualitative, without measures of association or any objective standard of what constituted a significant attribute. In the 1960s Peter Ucko (1968) analysed Egyptian and Cretan figurines with comparative material from mainland Greece and south-west Asia. His research is significant for a number of reasons. It was figurine analysis on a large geographical scale containing both qualitative and quantitative aspects; the quantification comprised frequency distributions of figurine attributes. Ucko used the figurines to determine cross-cultural similarity, direction of influences, and culture-group typology. His conclusions are important as basic 'rules' of figurine research: 1 Archaeologists have concentrated on functional interpretations, usually without consider- ing figurines as valuable cross-cultural indicators. 2 Research that has been done on inter-group relationships has approached data through an isolation and comparison of individual figurines as an artifact-type, or through attributes. 3 Great care must be taken in any inter-cultural comparison to ensure proper spatial and temporal controls of working with groups of known culture contact. 4 It is invalid to assume functional continuity between Palaeolithic and Neolithic figurines. 5 South-west Asia is the only geographic area in which there is early historical evidence supporting worship of a mother goddess connected with fertility, and therefore an investigation of figurines assuming this function is only valid in this region. 6 No single functional interpretation covers all figurines. 7 Ethnographic information suggests diverse functions for figurines. 8 Provenance of figurines may aid in distinguishing function. In the study Ucko points to the danger of making cross-cultural stylistic comparisons. A purely qualitative comparative approach may become very subjective if figurine or terms such as 'naturalistic' are not clearly defined. Consideration of unprovenanced material and failure to take into account processional mechanisms promoting culture change may skew results signifi- cantly.</page><page sequence="3">Anthropomorphic figurines in the eastern Mediterranean basin 75 Research strategy If we accept certain of Ucko's conclusions, it is apparent that more objective criteria are needed for making cross-cultural comparisons of human figurines. Both Ucko's research and that of Boissevain (1971) tend to confirm the hypothesis that attributes of figurines, either individually or as a cluster of body parts, are the units which are rejected or incorporated into a local figurine type. This hypothesis is also supported by my microscopic analysis of figurine sculpturing. Many eastern European figurines have breakage points that are naturally associated with specific anatomical areas. Modelling of these figurines may have been done by a build-up of body parts. Therefore, the important question is how can the archaeologist determine and isolate the significant attributes for cross-cultural comparison? As Ucko has stated: 'To isolate a specific figurine feature, such as posture or arm-position, is clearly both necessary and yet potentially dangerous. Thus, to take an absurd example, it would be profitless to link together all figurines from anywhere in the world, and from quite diverse time periods, simply because they were represented with a navel. On the other hand it would be equally profitless not to consider the possibility of a connection between a culture which only produced figurines with stump arms and crossed legs, and a culture with one figurine only, shown with stump arms and crossed legs, and made of imported material' (Ucko 1968:390). It follows that a multivariate approach correlating the strength of relationships among all possible combinations of figurine attributes may be the appropriate technique for comparative study. Such analysis will not produce figurine types or modal tendencies, but rather statistically signifi- cant clusters of production attributes used in manufacture. The data set To test interrelationships through a multivariate approach, it was decided to select figurines from excavated sites representative of culture-groups with known overlap in chronology and there- fore probable culture contact. The artifactual material comes from the following areas: TABLE 1 Assemblages used in the factor and discriminant analyses Site or time period Number of figurines Crete: Knossos Early Neolithic 1 7 Crete: Knossos Early Neolithic 2 13 Hacilar Levels VI-IV 60 Hacilar Levels III-II 39 Hacilar Levels Ia-d 8 (atal Hiiyiik Level II 10 Yugoslavian Starcevo Early Neolithic 37 Yugoslavian Vinca-Tordos Middle Neolithic 88 Early Neolithic Greece 47 Middle Neolithic Greece 41 Late Neolithic Greece 38 Final Neolithic Greece 16 TOTAL 404</page><page sequence="4">76 Brad Bartel Crete Material excavated by J. D. Evans (1964) at the Palace of Knossos was the only sample selected for analysis. Knossos material excavated by Sir Arthur Evans was not used because of the uncertainty in the provenance of the figurines. The figurines from the Early Neolithic I and II strata (c. 6100-5800 b.c.) were the only artifacts considered. Stratigraphically questionable figurines were not included for analysis. The figurines from the two strata were separated as distinct figurine assemblages. Anatolia The sites of Hacilar (Mellaart 1970) and Qatal Hiuyuik (Mellaart 1967) give the analysis the best temporal controls, since the stratigraphic record and radiocarbon tests are so internally co- herent. The two sites are also important for the amount of figurine material recovered, and in any discussion of directionality of culture change. According to Mellaart, Levels IX-II at Hacilar exhibit continuity of life style, while levels la-d may have been a 'squatter settlement' of a different culture group. To check these hypotheses, the figurines were analysed as separate assemblages from levels VI-IV, III-II, and Ia-d. The uppermost level of Catal Hiiytik is included for comparison because it is probable that it overlaps in time with lower levels at Hacilar. Acceptable radiocarbon dates for Catal Hiiyiik VI-IV range from 7817?100 yr: 5867 b.c. (P-770) to 7499?93 yr: 5549 b.c. (P-1361). For levels III-II, we have only two determinations of 7531?94 yr: 5581 b.c. (P-774) and 7521?77 yr: 5571 b.c. (P-796). Hacilar Levels VII-VI range from 7770?180 yr: 5820 b.c. (BM-25) to 7349?79 yr: 5399 b.c. (P-313A). There are no radiocarbon determinations from Hacilar levels III-II. Mainland Greece Material from sites was divided into the accepted chronological periods (Early, Middle, Late, and Final Neolithic). This spans a time period between 6500-3500 b.c. Such excavated sites as Sesklo (Tsountas 1908; Wace and Thompson 1912), Nea Nikomedia (Rodden 1962), Argissa (Milojcic, Boessneck and Hopf 1962), Lerna (Caskey and Elliot 1956), Corinth (Weinberg 1951), Franchthi Cave (e.g. Jacobsen 1973) and Achilleion (Gimbutas 1974b) were included. The strata for each site were separated into appropriate time periods. Yugoslavia Only figurines from excavated sites in Serbia and Vojvodina were included in the analysis. Both the Early Neolithic Starcevo and Middle Neolithic Vinca-Tordos periods spanning 6000-4000 b.c. were used, and coded as separate assemblages (M. Garasanin 1973; Tasi6 1973; Tringham 1971). Variants of Starcevo, such as K6ors, Crib, and Karanovo I were not included. Figurines from such excavated sites as Vinca (Vasic 1932-36), Starcevo (D. Garasanin 1954), Gomolava (Bruckner, Jovanovi6 and Tasi6 1974) and Divostin (McPherron and Srejovi6 1971) were included. It was decided to take all the known figurines from each archaeological assemblage (e.g. all the figurines classified as coming from Middle Neolithic Greek sites) as a representative sample of that group's total figurine assemblage. With the exception of the Greek and Cretan material, all figurines were analysed in person by the author. Each of these assemblages would be coded</page><page sequence="5">Anthropomorphic figurines in the eastern Mediterranean basin 77 nominally (presence-absence basis), in relation to the attributes found throughout all the chosen archaeological assemblages. This matrix of assemblages related to attributes was decided upon instead of an analysis involving each separate figurine correlated with all known attributes, or any variation of that matrix which would involve coding of individual figurines. Most figurines are fragmentary, and the missing attribute data cannot be coded in this type of analysis to pro- duce any meaningful results, since one cannot often distinguish whether fragmentation of figurines was intentional or due to random causes. Factor analysis (Dixon 1973) was the primary multivariate procedure used in this study (Program BMD 07M). In the course of coding for the analyses, if an attribute was present at, or absent from all, or all but one of the archaeological assemblages, it was rejected as inappro- priate for inclusion. For example, an attribute such as 'female figurine' was not included in the analysis since every assemblage contained female figurines. However, the attribute 'male figurine' was included since it was absent from two archaeological groupings. If these require- ments were not used, the previously unacceptable attributes would reduce the amount of variation explained in the data. The listing of archaeological assemblages, with numbers of figurines analysed, is found in table 1. The attribute list is found in table 2. The factor analytic techniques utilized by archaeologists have a controversial history (e.g. Doran and Hodson 1975). To reduce some of the potential criticism, in this study factor analy- sis will then be supplemented by discriminant analysis (Dixon 1973) to validate results. Factor analysis distinguishes independent sources of data variation. Attributes were used to group figu- rine assemblages from each archaeological region on the basis of patterns of occurrence, and to provide a value indicating the assemblage's degree of association with the factor underlying each group of variables. An eigenvalue cut-off point of 1.0 and the scree test plot of eigenvalues against the propor- tion of variance each extracts indicated that four factors, accounting for 83 per cent of the total variation, would be the best model of data reduction. The first factor was not interpreted since, when factor analysing over time, a number of attributes and assemblages manifesting an artifactual trend may emerge, indexing the statistical interdependence of changes in a number of phenomena (Rummel 1970:244-245). In other words, this first factor represents a temporal anomaly which cannot be discussed in terms of the types of interrelationships explaining independent variation. The three factors (tables 3-5) determined as significant are quite interesting, in that they exhibit a tight clustering in time span and region. The first significant factor includes figu- rines from Hacilar levels la-d, Late and Final Neolithic mainland Greece. The second factor groups Hacilar levels VI-IV, III-II, Catal Hiiyiik II, and Early Neolithic mainland Greece. All the Yugoslavian assemblages were grouped in the third factor. The Cretan and Middle Neo- lithic mainland figurines did not load significantly in relation to these factors. Included in tables 3-5 are the attributes which were significant for each grouping of assemblages and represent modal tendencies in manufacture. To verify these results, the figurine groupings and the entire listing of attributes were then subjected to stepwise discriminant analysis (Dixon 1973-Program BMD 08M). Used extensively in physical anthropology to determine degrees of inter-populational differences spatially and temporally, it can be used with material culture in a similar manner, or to classify single unknown cases into 'correct' known populations (e.g. Bartel 1974). This latter instance would be comparable to classification of unprovenanced material. The resultant scatter plot (fig. 1) is a</page><page sequence="6">78 Brad Bartel TABLE 2 Figurine attributes used in factor and discriminant analyses 1. Pink Clay 68. Small Breasts 2. Grey Clay 69.

Enclosed circles represent group centroids two-dimensional model of cultural affinity in figurine manufacture, showing a patterning almost identical in relationships to that expressed in the factor analysis and significant at the .05 level. The interpretation of these results includes some important chronological considerations. The interrelationships between Anatolian sites are strengthened. Mellaart's hypothesis that Hacilar levels Ia-d represented a 'squatter settlement' seems reasonable. The Serbian Neolithic is highly correlated internally, and therefore the analyses do not confirm the relationship expressed by Nandris (1970) that 'rod headed figurines', with a probable distribution through Greece and Yugoslavia during the Early and Middle Neolithic, point to strong Greek-Balkan connections. The factor and discriminant analyses give just the opposite impression. More important than the confirmation of much of the chronology set forth by principal Aegean archaeologists, this study points towards a mechanism promoting subtle change over space and time in figurine manufacture. The figurine tradition of the eastern Mediterranean basin exhibits a great degree of stylistic variation during the Neolithic and subsequent Eneolithic periods. A similar degree of variation exists in Neolithic and Chalcolithic south-west Asia I - -111 I' I- I--?I</page><page sequence="11">Anthropomorphic figurines in the eastern Mediterranean basin 83 (Oates 1978). Much of this variation may be due to functional differences. However, it is quite probable that not all the variation observed can be accounted for by function, and a residual effect of diffusion processes may be working to foster temporal change. For example, being small and rather solid, repeated manufacture and internal evolution of figurine style would not be as rapid as, let us say, for ceramic vessels. Those figurines potentially classified as non-utilitarian may have been the product of greater experimentation in innovation of style or re-combination of body parts (Boissevain 1971). Of all the diffusion processes which may have influenced variation spatio-temporally, it is suggested here that D. L. Clarke's (1968) stimulus/bow-wave diffusion model may be the most applicable (fig. 2a-b). This subtle variant of stimulus diffusion comes about if the idea of, in this instance, a figurine style precedes the actual arrival of a new element in a given area. Therefore, garbled versions of the incorporated attribute cluster may precede the intended artifact. The chronology of such occurrence would be as follows: Phase one-the appearance of a cluster of figurine attributes in a local garbled form (state 2). Phase two-the arrival of the new figurine type itself (state 1). If this type of diffusion is not recognized by the archaeologist, one might assume that state 2 is a local development that continues into state 1, therefore state 2 being earlier than state 1. But from these past considerations of the process, it is apparent that state 1 developed earlier in another geographic region and was the source of both states 1 and 2 in the hypothetical region under discussion. Clarke associates such a process with situations of strong societal acceptance, such as religious innovation, and gives an example of changes in mortuary practice in Bronze Age western Europe. If these figurines were associated with religion, then such a diffusionary process may have been at work. Factor and discriminant analyses, when combined with our understanding of Aegean chron- ology and a visual inspection of the figurine material, suggest the possibility of bow-wave diffusion acting between Catal Hiiyiik and Hacilar; and then extending the wave 'front' to include sites in Early Neolithic mainland Greece. Figure 2a-b presents such a possible model. The factor analysis delineated those attributes of importance associated with the clustering of Hacilar VI-IV, III-II, Catal Hiiyik II, and Early Neolithic Greece. There appears to be an oscillation in the position of seated posture and arm position through time in each of these areas. This is suggestive of the initial appearance of a garbled version with correct positioning of legs and torso, and then changes in posture along a wave front. Other attributes associated with oscillation in presence of clothing, or type of clothing, may have changed in a similar manner. Study errors There are some difficulties with this study that can only be resolved with a greater sample of figurines which come from systematic excavation. The number of figurines from each archae- ological assemblage differs markedly. It is quite possible that, by taking the assemblage as a whole, we are mixing figurines with entirely different functions that may change at different rates. Most important, a similar type of study is needed on a regional basis; cross-correlating</page><page sequence="12">Phase 1 o a 0 Figure 2a-b A model of stimulus/bow-wave diffusion related to figurine manufacture in Neolithic Anatolia. Factor and discriminant analyses determined a strong relationship between Catal Hiiyiik (1) level II, Hacilar (2) levels VI-II, and Early Neolithic Greece. In phase 1 (fig. 2a), figurine manufacture originating at Catal Hiiyiik level II (state 1) is copied at Hacilar level IV through stimulus diffusion with a resulting 'incorrect' garbled version modelled with different leg and torso positioning (state 2).

Summary and conclusions In conclusion, let me emphasize that this represents a preliminary analysis. The purpose was to validate chronology, determine appropriate units of analysis (figurine body parts), techniques for comparison, and probable mechanisms accounting for spatio-temporal variation. The archaeologist working on problems associated with figurines for the Neolithic of the eastern Mediterranean basin has to contend with a long tradition of analogic argument denoting all these objects as having similar functions in all societies regardless of time and space. It is suggested here that a definite break with this historical tradition and the use of more explicit and objective methods would be beneficial. 17.ix.1980 Department of Anthropology San Diego State University References Bartel, B. 1974.

Abstract Bartel, Brad Cultural associations and mechanisms of change in anthropomorphic figurines during the Neolithic in the eastern Mediterranean basin This paper describes a series of multivariate analyses involving figurines of the Neolithic period in the eastern Mediterranean basin. It is felt that previous discussions concerning this class of artifact were too impressionistic and based upon an inappropriate use of analogy. The present research confirms many of the chronological relationships between Anatolia, Greece, and Yugoslavia. It also suggests that body parts as attributes may be a useful unit of analysis. Finally, a model is presented which may account for stylistic changes in figurine manufacture through time.</page></plain_text>
