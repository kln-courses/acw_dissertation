<plain_text><page sequence="1">DRINK DEEP, OR TASTE NOT: THOUGHTS ON THE USE OF EARLY EUROPEAN RECORDS IN THE STUDY OF AFRICAN MATERIAL CULTURE* Adam Jones Universitait Leipzig In African studies the potential for collaboration between students of history and those of material culture or art has long been recognized. On the one hand, items of material culture, both ancient and modern, can shed light on aspects of the past which remain obscure in written and oral sources; on the other, in order to see a material culture (or parts of it) in perspective, we need to study the historical background of the area concerned. The contribution of material culture to historical knowledge of sub-Saharan Africa has received considerable attention; but the same can hardly be said of the use of historical sources in understanding material culture.' This does not mean that such sources have been neglected. Most of them certainly were in the colonial and immediate post-colonial periods, but things have improved. In many recent books, articles, and exhibitions devoted to Africa's material culture, considerable use has been made of the writings and engravings of early European visitors. Scholars are delighted if they can discover old records of anything resembling the objects that are today found either in museums or still in use in Africa. Indeed, it has become almost obligatory to search old books for textual and visual material. No historian can object to this interest in early sources. Yet looking at what has been published recently, one wonders whether we have nearly reached the end of the road. The same classic travelers' accounts are cited again and again (even the same passages!), and it is beginning to look as if this source of information will soon run dry. What, if anything, remains to be done'? All too often those who use such sources implicitly assume that history, unlike other disciplines, requires no special skills: all one needs to do is dig for treasure. Frequently the motivation leading to the search for old sources is not historical at all: what counts most in the selection of seventeenth- or eighteenth-century material is the esthetic appeal of the quaint language and the crude artistry of most engravings, for these can stimulate the imagination and convey the comfortable feeling that the object described belongs or belonged to a timeless, 'traditional' society. If our aim is an interdisciplinary approach to Africa's material culture, art historians and anthropologists must recognize that history too is a discipline. Instead of simply plundering any attractive source that will serve as an illustration, we must approach the written records as scientific evidence. As Hair (1974:82) once wrote of the culture of Sierra Leone, Histori in Africa 21 (1994), 349-70.</page><page sequence="2">350 ADAM JONES The comprehensive and rigorous examination of sources in a systematic way, without consideration of whether the results add up to a thesis or produce seminal conclusions, is the only sound way of proceeding in African as in other history. The study of material culture itself is not so much a discipline as a meeting ground for several different disciplines, whose number has increased in recent years.2 To refer to those involved, I have coined the term "material culturists," although many would prefer to be called art historians, archeologists, ethnologists, or cultural anthropologists. In this paper I propose to examine the ways in which material culturists have made use of early written sources. Although what I have to say applies to material culture studies anywhere in Africa (particularly, perhaps, those concerning Benin and Yoruba art), I shall draw most of my examples from the Gold Coast (southern Ghana). This region is, admittedly, not typical in every respect. Drawn into the transatlantic trade as early as the fifteenth century, it has over the past five centuries been subject to more external influences than most parts of Africa. On the other hand, it has the advantage of being relatively well documented. Whereas at least half of sub-Saharan Africa possesses virtually no written documentation from before the mid-nineteenth century, we have written records for the Gold Coast from the late fifteenth century onwards.3 For the immediate interior (including Asante) there are several eighteenth-century and many nineteenth-century sources. Furthermore although no one has published a comprehensive study of the material culture of any part of this region, a certain amount of archeological research has been undertaken, and various aspects of the region's art have been examined by anthropologists and art historians. II How Useful? It is easy to see why many scholars of material culture have paid scant attention to pre-twentieth-century written sources. Firstly, 99 percent of the available documentation has nothing whatever to do with material culture: it concentrates rather on political and economic information, on descriptions of flora and fauna, on general remarks about the character and physical features of Africans, or on religious beliefs. It is rare to find detailed information from the precolonial period on actual objects that are today in museums or still being used in Africa.4 Such information as exists seldom says much about an object's 'life history.' Even the geographical origins given in museum catalogs are often manifestly inaccurate: of the West African items registered in Denmark in the seventeenth century, some were described as being Japanese, others as "Indian" (i.e., South American), or "East Indian" (i.e., Southeast Asian).5</page><page sequence="3">EARLY RECORDS AND MATERIAL CULTURE 351 Secondly, hardly any of the few Africans before 1900 whose writings have survived chose to write much about material culture. For this subject, virtually all authors were non-Africans. Many had no knowledge of African languages; most were men, and all experienced certain difficulties in understanding African cultures.6 Thirdly, the written sources are limited in their geographical and chronological scope. Even for the West African coast, where Europeans traded from the fifteenth century onwards, there are large areas (e.g., most of Liberia and COte d'Ivoire) about whose material culture we learn little before the mid- nineteenth century. Although the documentation for the Gold Coast is better, it is much weaker for the sixteenth and late eighteenth centuries than for the seventeenth and nineteenth.7 A more fundamental objection to reliance on written sources is that even if they say something about material culture, they seldom tell us precisely what we want to know. Descriptions of carved figures, for example, are usually so vague as to be virtually meaningless. Often, one feels, Europeans were incapable of perceiving what such figures-especially anthropomorphic ones-looked like, let alone putting this perception into words. Similar problems occur with the perception of people's clothing: early sources describe the large quantity of ornaments worn by Africans, yet in the same breath refer to them as "naked" (cf. McLeod 1981:72). Furthermore, the authors tell us little about the artists and craftsmen who produced the works now held in museums-it hardly occurred to them to regard them as artists in their own right. Little wonder, then, that many material culturists regard written doc- umentation as at best a minor appendage to their work. In order to understand the symbolism of Dahomean court art, Savary (1976) has pointed out, we need to study oral tradition, rather than the large corpus of written material emanating from Europeans. In a recent discussion on the art of southwestern Nigeria, a leading art historian expressed the view that we ought to combat "the tyranny of written sources" by lending greater credence to oral traditions, because, as he put it, "[w]ritten sources too can lie." Other scholars stress the value of photographs or the urgency of salvage ethnography. As far as works on the material culture of the former Gold Coast are concerned, quite a few cite no historical sources at all.8 Others limit themselves to one or two token references, while lamenting the alleged fact that "written documents are lacking in Africa" (Segy 1963: 866). Nevertheless, written sources require urgent attention and can, if handled carefully, be invaluable. Let us take as an example the seventeenth-century 'curiosities' in the Ulm Museum. They are listed in a catalog published in 1659, referring to "an Acanish bow, with a string made of the bark of palm trees and with several barbed arrows," "a throwing spear made in Acania, covered with ray skin and called hassagai [assegai] in Ethiopian [=African]," and a sword presented to a German trader J. A. Haintzel by "Johan Claes of Fietu," who had worn it himself. We possess detailed contemporary descriptions of Gold Coast weapons, notably in the book of Miiller (1673:</page><page sequence="4">352 ADAM JONES 128-32), who resided near Cape Coast in the 1660s. It is possible to identify Johan Claes: he was the Day of Fetu (the polity to which Cape Coast belonged) and died in 1662. The sources tell us something about his political status, his character, and his relationship with Europeans, thereby enhancing our appreciation of the sword, which still exists. Moreover, they help us to pin down the geographical origin of other objects in the catalog. Finally, Swedish and Dutch records indicate when Haintzel was in West Africa-from 1652 to ca.1656 and from 1658 to 1659-thereby disproving Bravmann's hypothesis that the sword "might easily have been obtained at Fetu [...] ca.1630."' A thorough study of written records would probably throw further light on other seventeenth-century objects in European museums. Written documents may facilitate a more precise identification in terms both of chronology and of geography. Sometimes they enable us to establish the name(s) by which an object was known in African languages, the way in which it was used, and the sort of person to whom it belonged. They may inform us about its ideological or ritual significance-for instance, if they describe the sort of dances performed when a particular musical instrument was played or the occasions on which a certain garment was worn. They can provide 'background' information on the sociopolitical setting or the material base of the society concerned at a particular time, and they may even yield hints about what kind of 'salvage ethnography' is most needed.'I One of the main assets of the early documentation for regions such as the Gold Coast is that its scope is far wider than that of any museum collection. It has been pointed out (Bassani and McLeod 1985:246) that the artefacts taken to Europe before the nineteenth century fell roughly into three categories- things made for local use, which Europeans found interesting (a rather narrow category, given the interests of most Europeans in the early modern period: see Impey and MacGregor 1985); those made for local use and valued primarily for their material (such as gold castings); and those produced after a European model (such as Afro-Portuguese ivories). They were also restricted to easily portable objects: in the case of the Gold Coast, this generally meant weapons, textiles, goldweights, musical instruments, ornaments, and stools. Besides enhancing our understanding of items in these categories, early records cover much that was never brought to Europe. This applies, for instance, to objects that were not portable, such as canoes," houses, shrines, latrines; to those that were heavy or fragile, such as pottery; and to many kinds of "fetishes," which few Europeans collected before the late nineteenth century. Early written sources are also important in a more general sense. Where they do not exist or have been neglected, the historical study of material culture is forced to rely either on archeology (which can only answer a limited range of questions) or on stylistic evaluation and comparative ethnography- methods which, while not without epistemological value, have often encouraged ahistorical diffusionist speculation.12 Written sources do at least help to focus discussion on hypotheses that contain a diachronic element and can be tested. Moreover, by their very nature they pose a challenge to the "one</page><page sequence="5">EARLY RECORDS AND MATERIAL CULTURE 353 tribe, one style" pagadigm, which has played an excessively dominant role in twentieth-century studies of African material culture (cf. Kasfir 1984). It is only through a study of the written records (combined, where possible, with that of oral traditions) that we can hope to understand atti- tudes-those of the Africans who produced artefacts and those of the Europeans who collected them. The study of the 'cognitive history' of precolonial Africa is still in its infancy, but it promises to yield insights into the ways in which Africans perceived certain artefacts.'3 Equally, we need written records in order to explain why early European collections concentrated so heavily on certain aspects of Africa's material culture. Many authors showed no interest in material culture. Those who did tended to express a mixture of reactions: contempt (for instance, with regard to the houses in which most Africans lived and the lack of furniture or utensils displayed there); awe (the pomp displayed by important chiefs and dignitaries made the same sort of impression on the Portuguese in the fifteenth century as it did on Englishmen in the nineteenth); and an almost childlike fascination, expressed in descriptions of musical instruments, hats, weapons, and metalwork. It was this last group which, together with ivory carvings, animals, and plants, dominated European collections in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.14 By reading contemporary travelers' accounts we can seek to recapture the feelings of those who brought such objects back to Europe. I do not entirely agree with Bassani's generalization (1986:73-74) that "the Europeans did not consider them as art at all, but rather as curious objects, if not as illustrations of the barbarism of the peoples among whom they were collected" (my translation). The esthetic value of some objects (generally, of course, those that came close to European styles) is certainly recognized in some travelers' accounts. III Which Sources? The approach of many material culturists to written sources may be caricatured as follows. They begin by drawing everything possible from 'the' twentieth-century ethnographer of the culture concerned-Rattray in the case of the Akan, Herskovits for the Fon, and so on; with luck they may even find a pre-digested version of the essential ethnographic 'facts' in one of the International African Institute's monographs. The next step is to pick up a few dates from an easily accessible historical work. Then comes the chance to come to grips with real source material. This is not hard to find, thanks largely to the reprints that appeared at the turn of the century and in the 1960s. Scholars interested in the Gold Coast, for instance, will have little difficulty in locating modern editions of Purchas (1625), Miiller (1673), the 1686 French translation of Dapper, the 1705 English translation of Bosman, Astley (1745), Bowdich (1819), Dupuis (1824), T. Freeman (1844), Ellis (1887), and</page><page sequence="6">354 ADAM JONES modern English versions of some of the earliest English and Portuguese sources (Pereira 1937, Crone 1937, Blake 1942). Without much extra effort they will gain access to Barbot (1732) and several books published after the Anglo-Asante war of 1873-74. That is about it, as far as the majority of material culturists go. Depending on the topic, these sources may together yield up to a dozen references. Twenty years ago any scholar who managed to consult these works would rightly have been congratulated. But times have changed. Three aspects of the above list call for comment: its narrowness, the secondary (or even tertiary) nature of much of the material, and the reliance on unreliable translations. The most striking aspect of the list (and of its equivalents for material culture studies on other parts of Africa) is its limited range, given the wealth of literature now known to exist. Several scholars have been somewhat more enterprising; yet even they have barely scratched the surface of what is available. Many early works remain virtually untouched.15 More surprising is the neglect of some major nineteenth-century sources-partly, one suspects, because most are in French, Dutch, or Danish.16 Nor have the valuable nineteenth-century dictionaries of Zimmermann (1858) and Christaller (1881) been fully exploited, let alone the many wordlists that preceded them. As for journals, few apart from the Illustrated London News have been used at all. Ideally, the search for early records should not be limited to printed works. A few material culturists have made effective use of archival sources. Garrard (1980, 1983) has drawn on the seventeenth-century Dutch and Danish records transcribed, translated or summarized in the Furley Collection at the University of Ghana-not, strictly speaking, a primary source (except where the documents which Furley used have been lost), but at least a useful guide to some archival sources.17 Johnson (1979) utilized material on Shai pottery from the Basel Mission archive'8 and on Asante state shields from a highly unusual source-a report in the Public Record Office on an intended slave rising in Antigua. However, with a few honorable exceptions,"9 material culturists interested in Africa have paid little attention to archival sources. Indeed, many seem to have only a hazy notion of what an archive is or what research possibilities it can offer. Certainly it is rare for archives to contain much information specifically on material culture, except on those elements involved in overseas trade, and it would be unreasonable to expect material culturists to wade through all the records on a particular region in the faint hope of stumbling across something of relevance. But they should at least be aware of exactly what is available and make allowance for what may eventually be discovered. Just as disturbing as the narrow range of sources used, from the histo- rian's point of view, is the uncritical citation of works such as those of Dapper (1668), Barbot (1732), and Astley (1745) as if they constituted straightforward primary sources.20 It is depressing to note the lack of interest shown by most material culturists in the work done recently to disentangle the major historical sources.21 Perhaps they find source criticism distasteful, because instead of yielding new data it tends to put existing data into question.</page><page sequence="7">EARLY RECORDS AND MATERIAL CULTURE 355 There is no justification for citing Astley as a source on material cul- ture.22 As for Dapper, material culturists tend to quote him for information which derives from sources written half a century earlier. Smith, for instance, reproduces a long description of canoes from the (very poor) French translation of Dapper, translated into English, without realizing that nearly all of it was lifted from De Marees.23 Others (e.g., Lamp 1985), having wisely chosen to consult the German translation (far superior to the French), unwisely rely on the heavily abridged edition of 1964, perhaps because the original (though available in facsimile) is in Gothic script. Perhaps the most complicated challenge presented by an early source is the work of Barbot. Several material culturists are dimly aware of this, but none has dealt with him in a satisfactory manner.24 Admittedly, prior to the publication of a critical edition in 1992 of Barbot's 1688 manuscript it was not a simple task to winnow out the chaff in his book of 1732. This is largely because, instead of just copying passages, Barbot reworded them and jumbled them up, and where he noticed discrepancies between them, he often tried to 'harmonize' them by substituting a compromise interpretation of his own (see Law 1982, 1987). It is therefore a misrepresentation of the evidence to cite Barbot's de- scriptions of hair-plaiting and funerary terracottas, for example, without indicating in each case how much is plagiarized from Bosman and how much can be located in Barbot's manuscript of 1688.25 Nor does it suffice to state that De Marees' reference to a shell or an animal's head attached to the sheath of a sword was "reiterated by Muiller, Bosman and Barbot," without explaining whether the statements of these authors are to be regarded as pure plagiarism, independent observation of identical phenomena, or a mixture of both.26 The problem of 'primariness' arises equally with regard to more recent sources. As I have shown elsewhere, if we compare a single paragraph in the published version of Ramseyer and Kiihne's Vier Jahre in Asante (1875) with Ramseyer's original manuscript, we discover half a dozen major discrepancies relating to material culture (stools, chairs, state umbrellas, and clothing).27 As readers of this journal will appreciate by now, translations are a form of secondary source. Their use may be unavoidable in some circumstances, but it requires the utmost caution. The problem is not just that many translations are inaccurate: more often, especially in the case of old translations, the main problem is their ambiguity, which makes them practically useless in pinning down the precise meaning of a particular phrase. Material culturists have paid little heed to historians' discussion of translations. Indeed, many do not appear to grasp what it is about, since they have no compunction about citing an original edition when they have evidently seen only a translation.28 Of the translations most commonly used, the majority are highly inaccurate and/or heavily abridged-for instance, the English translation of Pacheco Pereira,29 the English and German translations of De Marees, the French translation of Dapper, and the "accurate" English translation of Bosman.30</page><page sequence="8">356 ADAM JONES A few examples will illustrate this point. McLeod (1981:89) cites the English translation of Bosman's description of swords (1705:185): "They have a wooden Guard adorned on one side, and sometimes on both, with small globular Knobs." This obscures the meaning of the original, which can better be rendered thus: "The hilt is made of wood; on the rear end, but sometimes also on the front end, sit small round wooden globes."31 Pilipczuk (1985: 33- 34) draws equally imprecise information from the German translation (1708) of the same work: certain men, he states, celebrated their wealth by having music played on horns made from "eight of the largest" (rather than "seven of the smaller kind of') elephant tusks; and such horns might be decorated with "the image of a person or a beast" (rather than "several images of persons and beasts").32 In using the English translation of De Marees (1625), Cole and Ross (1977:13, 26, 30) overlook several details in the original (almost twice as long, incidentally): women, wrote De Marees, hung linen from underneath their breasts "to below their knees" (the English translation omits "below"); to cure a swelling, people made "three or four" cuts in the skin (not "two or three"); and whereas the translation states that people painted their faces, it obscures the fact that they used earth for this purpose, as mentioned in the original. Similarly Lamb (1975:88), following the "provisional" translation of a Dutch map made in 1629 (Daaku and Van Dantzig 1966), states that cloths woven like carpets were "worn among the Acanists" (whom she identifies with the Asante), but what the text in fact says is that they were "highly valued" among the Acanists.33 Were a material culturist to study West African latrines, he or she would probably begin with a sentence from De Marees, given in the translation of 1625 as follows: "They make houses which are borne up above the ground, wherein they ease themselves, and every time they do it, they wipe."34 In this single sentence three potentially significant points are omitted-the fact that the houses were small (old translations almost invariably overlook Dutch diminutives), that they were built "branch-wise" and that people took with them "a stick with which they wipe their arse." Such details may seem trivial; but they are representative for the more general dangers of placing faith in translations. The problems summarized here are by no means unique to seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century sources for the Gold Coast. An obvious parallel to Barbot is the book of Cavazzi (1687), virtually the standard source for the seventeenth-century material culture of West Central Africa. Not only is the frequently cited modern Portuguese translation in many cases untrustworthy (see Heintze 1984); equally important, the book, like Barbot's, contains much material that hardly qualifies as primary at all, since two of Cavazzi's original drafts, written more than twenty years earlier, still exist. A careful study of them makes it possible, among other things, to reconstruct how Cavazzi incorporated information from additional sources in the 1660s and 1670s."3 Almost the same applies to Labat's account of 1730, a major source for</page><page sequence="9">EARLY RECORDS AND MATERIAL CULTURE 357 Dahomey: certain passages are plagiarized from Bosman, and much of the remainder represents an embroidered version of a hitherto unpublished journal. Here, as in countless other cases, much of the historical work that has been done on Africa's material culture will eventually need to be repeated, simply because the documentary foundations on which it stood have crumbled away. The same applies to the use of early engravings.36 IV Problems of Interpretation To use the word 'interpretation' is a little misleading in this context: what most material culturists do with written records is to string together a series of extracts, either as quotations or in pr6cis, linking them with a few words of commentary. This procedure is difficult to avoid, but entails several dangers. Firstly, it is usual to select the more 'juicy' passages from an account, ignoring the less attractive but for historical purposes equally significant passing references that are to be found in the middle of a passage on some different topic. Secondly, the selected passages can be evaluated only in the context of the whole document (or indeed the corpus of writings by the author concerned). And thirdly, their full meaning as evidence does not become apparent until they are examined alongside other near-contemporary references to the same topic. Nevertheless, to some extent any presentation of historical material constitutes an interpretation, and in their commentaries material culturists generally seek to demonstrate change or continuity over time. In this section I propose to look at how they do this. It is fair enough to try tentatively to push present-day categories of material objects back into the past, provided that the evidence is not stretched too far. It has been plausibly suggested, for instance, that the "copper ointment boxes" mentioned by Bosman in 1704/05 represented an early form of kuduo.37 He did not give the African name by which they were known (and early wordlists do not help), but it does seem conceivable that what he saw may have been related to the kuduo of today. The real danger comes when the material culturist shifts from artefacts to their sociocultural context. The chances of a seventeenth-century artefact being more or less interchangeable (at least in terms of physical composition) with its modern equivalent are considerably higher than in the case of a festival, a label of ethnic identity, a religious practice, or a political institution. Yet it is claimed that De Marees in 1602 described "palm wine bars" and the ornaments of "Fanti" women.38 Dapper's description of "the making of a gentleman," derived almost entirely from De Marees, is interpreted as referring to the installation of an asafohene; and Mtiller's book (1673) is cited to the effect that "when an omnanhene died, the Asafo council favoured [...] elderly or infirm successors.""9 Yet we have few grounds for supposing that asafo companies existed by this time.40 Nor is there much reason to suppose that if they did,</page><page sequence="10">358 ADAM JONES the ritual of installing their officers would be recognizable in terms of its present-day equivalent.41 My objection to the use of such terms is not that they are totally im- plausible, but that by adopting them scholars implicitly exclude other, equally plausible interpretations without explaining on what grounds they have done so. Unless such an explanation is offered, the terms must be considered anachronisms. Most material culturists are as aware as anyone else that African society has not remained unchanged over the past 500 years. Roughly speaking, there seem to be three ways in which information dating from different periods is put together and interpreted. [1] If, say, a seventeenth-century source does not explicitly contradict a nineteenth-century description of the same kind of object or practice, the material culturist tends to take the two as com- plementary and adopt the 'ethnographic past' tense. We are offered a picture of 'traditional' cultural traits which remained virtually constant until some were undermined by colonial rule or missionary education .42 [2] If nineteenth-century records indicate that the phenomenon differed from the one described in a seventeenth-century source, the usual explanation is European influence. Less frequently a stimulus coming from the north (generally connected with Islam) is suggested. Occasionally, material culturists allow for indigenous 'development': the round stools mentioned in two early sources, presumed to have been the original type, are held to have given way to the rectangular- based ones we know today, apparently in the course of the eighteenth century.43 [3] The commonest situation, however, is that a phenomenon mentioned in later sources does not feature at all in earlier ones. This raises the question so often faced by historians, particularly by those whose material is as fragmentary as is commonly the case for sub- Saharan Africa: under what circumstances is it legitimate to employ the argument from silence ('negative evidence')? Here too the favorite approach is to suggest that there has been cultural change and attribute it to European influence or (more fashionably today) to an African response to a European or 'Islamic' stimulus. Spokesmen's canes, it is argued, must initially have been copied from the canes which Europeans used to give their messengers in the seventeenth century44 and asafo flags likewise had European prototypes.45 Innovation is also sometimes attributed to influence from the north, as for instance the use of masks in the Sakrabundi cult, recorded in the Bron country in the 1880s (Bravmann 1974). Alternatively, it is argued that something was indigenously developed, as in the case of representational brass goldweights (a "logical extension" of the</page><page sequence="11">EARLY RECORDS AND MATERIAL CULTURE 359 elaborate goldwork recorded in seventeenth-century sources),46 or sim- ply that a certain type of object "cannot be more than about 100 years old," for instance with reference to the so-called 'fertility dolls' (akua'ba, pl. akua'mma).47 I do not question the usefulness of the argument from silence: although it is never conclusive and "stands always at the risk of being subverted," it can at least serve as a form of devil's advocacy, challenging scholars to refute it if they can (Henige 1987:66, 68). Few material culturists, however, have invested in it the assiduous care which it demands. To state that an author provides the earliest or latest reference to a particular cultural phenomenon is certainly worthwhile, but is meaningless unless one has systematically scrutinized all the relevant sources (published and unpublished) for the period before or after. Moreover, the argument requires not only that one locate sources which are silent on a given topic, but also that they be of the kind where one has the right to expect them to provide information. For example, Van Dantzig's (1970) argument that the state sword was introduced to the coast between ca.1600 and ca. 1620 rests on the fact that neither Paludanus (1595-96) nor De Marees (1602:46a) mentioned the type of "large, curved knife [...] very broad and heavy in front [i.e., at the end] and very narrow at the back" described by Brun (1624:82). Paludanus, writes Van Dantzig, "does not give any description of what might be described as a state sword, which he probably would have done if he had seen one." Yet Paludanus devotes less than a page to the Gold Coast, dealing almost exclusively with its flora and fauna.48 As for De Marees, it is true that he does not mention the swords of important men being wider at the end than near the hilt, but in other respects his description fits the state sword quite well, and he also mentions a weapon used by poorer men, which had the shape described by Brun: "[c]leavers in the form of a Ham, broad at the end and narrow near the top." The main objection to using the argument from silence in this way, however, is that, whereas we have fairly good ethnographic documentation for the seventeenth century, we possess only one sixteenth-century source referring to swords at all. The argument is equally dangerous when employed to combine written and archeological data. Garrard (1983:46) suggests that the use of terracotta figures must have spread inland from the coast in the early seventeenth century: By 1601 these figurines were observed in the coastal town of Moree (de Marees 1602: 93b), but they did not appear further inland until around the 1630s. Excavations at Twifo-Hemang, for instance, have yielded terracottas of early style on sites dating from about 1640 onwards. In reality it is unknown whether it was at Moree that De Marees received information on burials. Moreover, only twenty or so serious excavations have been conducted in the whole of southern Ghana. Much more archeological</page><page sequence="12">360 ADAM JONES research is needed before it makes sense to speculate about whether terracotta figurines existed in parts of the interior by the time De Marees visited the coast.49 Similar objections apply to the chronology proposed for many items of material culture, where scholars have relied on one or two sources, instead of adopting a systematic approach. It has been stated, for instance, that until the eighteenth century "the local practice of authorizing a messenger or ambassador was to have him carry a gold-hilted sword," and that only Europeans used a silver-headed cane instead (Cole and Ross 1977:160-61, citing Phillips 1732 and Bosman 1705). Yet already in MUiller's account (1673:154) it was reported that canes were "used as a token of truthfulness, if they [= Africans] send someone a message." And another source from the same period (Justel 1674: 20-21) mentioned a royal envoy wearing on his right thumb (presumably as a sign of authorization) a gold ring representing a bird. Nor was Miiller the only seventeenth-century writer to refer to canes as a symbol of status, as has been claimed.5? Likewise it is incorrect to suggest (Cole and Ross 1977: 53) that Barbot was the first author to mention gold "tooth-pickers."'1 In other words, statements about cultural change must be based on a comprehensive review of the evidence, rather than on "inspirational dipping into the sources" (Hair 1974). Even if we do not attempt to identify the earliest reference to an item of material culture, it is essential to conduct a thorough search for other references, in order to discover as much as possible about the spatial and temporal distribution of the item concerned. We also need to be more honest in assessing the fragmentariness of the documentation we cite. The confident assertions made in so many articles on the history of African artefacts are seldom justified by the ambiguous evidence on which they are based. It is interesting to note how often material culturists use the words "for instance" or "for example" with reference to a piece of historical documentation. Generally the document concerned is the sole piece of evidence in favor of the proposed argument, yet by a sleight of hand it is implied that somewhere in the author's card index lies a much larger body of documentation. The basic problem, perhaps, is that while Africanist historians and art historians normally work with different kinds of data, the existence of a documentary reference to an item of material culture brings them into the same arena. For the art historian, the fact that umbrella finials were described in ancient Mali in the fourteenth century and in Asante 500 years later seems significant (Cole and Ross 1977: 164). To the historian such random diachronic documentation hardly constitutes an argument at all, given the dearth of information about what happened in the interim.52 Finally, a comment on selective reporting. In the late nineteenth century there was a tendency to dwell on what were considered the more gruesome aspects of African culture-blood, skulls, jawbones, and so on. An equally one-sided approach may be discerned in many writings of the 1970s, when material culturists sang the glories of the African past l la Basil Davidson. No doubt they had good reasons for doing so, but now that Bowdich's (1819: 31-</page><page sequence="13">EARLY RECORDS AND MATERIAL CULTURE 361 41) account of his splendid reception in Kumase has been quoted at length in at least a dozen recent publications, it seems time to look at less exotic aspects that are mentioned in early records but have been neglected because of their lack of sensational appeal. V Having devoted most of this paper to the task of picking holes in the way material culturists have used early sources, I ought perhaps to qualify my rather sweeping criticisms. Firstly, I do not intend to suggest that historians are necessarily better qualified to deal with early sources than other material culturists.53 For one thing, the overwhelming majority of Africanist historians have shown remarkably little interest in material culture, except as a form of illustrative material. Moreover, even among these historians the problems of source criticism were scarcely appreciated until recently, and several scholars of other disciplines have done a better job in this field than many historians. Besides, the situation in African studies is not much worse than in research dealing with other parts of the world: many of my criticisms apply equally to the study of material culture elsewhere. Finally, it must be conceded that practical constraints, especially for scholars working in Africa, often make it difficult to do early written sources justice. From experience in Ghana and Sierra Leone I am well aware of the enormous handicaps posed by poor or non-existent libraries, isolation from international scholarly communication, inadequate photocopying facilities, lack of money, as well as by political turmoils. As for museum curators in Europe and North America, they are often expected to put on an exhibition for which they are not given the time to do the necessary homework. Let me close, therefore, by attempting to offer some constructive suggestions. As material culture studies mature, it is to be hoped that they will transcend the initial obsession with the more exotic aspects of African cul- tures. At the same time there should develop a deeper appreciation of material culture as part of the historical process, rather than as something which can be explained in terms either of a simple 'traditional vs. acculturated' dichotomy or of crude evolutionism. It is time to stop talking vaguely about "traditional society" and recognize that chronology matters. Students of African material cultures must recognize that where early sources exist, they are not just a pleasant luxury: they can play a vital role in enhancing our understanding of these cultures. That role should not be limited to art objects (however one defines 'art'), nor to those objects of which examples have survived. Everything that an early source can tell us about material culture is potentially of value. Although we must constantly be on our guard against anachronistic interpretations, our understanding of the allusive references in early sources can certainly be enhanced by following them up 'in the field.' I found it difficult, for example, to visualize a seventeenth-century reference to women wearing "a raised cap or hood made of black hair" (Muiller in Jones 1983: 207)</page><page sequence="14">362 ADAM JONES until I had seen this sort of attire in Ghana. Similarly a knowledge of modem proverbs may shed light on the symbolism of objects whose meaning was lost on nineteenth-century travelers who described them (cf. Cole and Ross 1977: 152-53). If the importance of early sources is grasped, it should lead scholars to adopt a more enterprising approach to them, and yet also to be more critical and cautious. This means three things. First, the full range of sources for a given area must be hunted down systematically-not just those that happen to have been published, those available in a modem reprint, those written in English, those dealing solely with 'unadulterated' cultures, or those containing long ethnographic descriptions. Second, the relevance to material culture studies of current methodological debates among historians ought to be recognized. We must ascertain as far as possible whether the information contained in these sources is 'primary,' i.e., currently considered to be closer to the original observation described than any other extant source. If it is a translation, we must check the original; if it is plagiarized, we must compare it with the original and judge whether the decision to plagiarise was significant (see Jones 1986: 225); if it is an engraving, we must ask whether the engraver is likely to have been guided by anything other than the accompanying text or an earlier engraving. (Even rigorous source criticism, of course, is no guarantee that the source concerned represents a reliable description of African reality.) Third, it is necessary to strive to understand who the authors were, what preconceptions they had and what they were trying to express: merely to say that their writings were "eurocentric" does not help very much. All of this is hard work, especially if one is dealing with a region of Africa for which there exists a large corpus of material, written in half a dozen European languages. Material culturists may legitimately ask whether, having done this conscientiously, they will have any time left to make use of the data assembled. One answer is that in their own interests they should support those campaigning for the publication of high-quality critical editions and translations of early sources, because these will do some of the necessary work for them (see Heintze and Jones 1987: 15-16, 29-51, 95-106). They must encourage historians to do for other parts of Africa what Hair has done for Sierra Leone, Law for the Slave Coast and various scholars (Thilmans, de Moraes, Becker, Martin) for Senegambia. Also, there is an obvious need for better indexes to standard works, listing (among other things) references to material culture.54 Much wasted effort could be avoided if the systematic collection and publication of early information on material culture were accepted as con- stituting an end in itself. The situation we have at present can hardly be called efficient. Rather like Akan stool disputants fifty years ago, each scholar interested in an item of material culture combs through the sources to which he or she has easy access, noting here and there passages that seem worth quoting or pieces of information that might be made to fit a particular argument. Some, anxious to demonstrate the fruits of their labors, tag</page><page sequence="15">EARLY RECORDS AND MATERIAL CULTURE 363 together lengthy extracts from one author after another."5 Others confine themselves to picking out key points, merely citing their sources in footnotes. Should two scholars write independently on the same topic, the second must duplicate the research work of the first, and if one of them later decides to study another aspect of the same culture, he will once again have to go through all the same sources. It is hardly surprising, then, that so few material culturists manage to do justice to the historical materials at their disposal. A more sensible long-term solution would be a project designed to assemble, arrange, and publish all the information (however trivial in ap- pearance) in early records on the material culture of a given region, noting in each case the context (date, location, etc.) in which the information appears was collected.56 Many material culturists already have their own card indexes containing such information, but it is doubtful whether any have really set about the task systematically. The reason, presumably, is that members of the academic community (publishers, journal editors, tenure boards, conference organizers and individual readers) tend to accord higher prestige to pieces of dazzling, if illusory, synthesis than to the necessary groundwork that ought to precede them. I have myself attempted to draw up a provisional catalog of this kind for the Gold Coast up to 1800. It raised a number of difficulties. For example, should quotations be in the original language, in translation, or in both? Should one include statements which were mainly plagiarized, but might conceivably contain a grain of original information? Where does one draw the boundary between material and non-material or between African and non- African culture? Is it legitimate to impose twentieth-century categories on seventeenth-century material? It is also often unclear precisely which area or group was being referred to. I have yet to resolve these problems; but already the catalog has yielded some unexpected insights. It has made me realize, for instance, that far more items are mentioned (albeit briefly) than I had imagined-implements for taking kenkey out of boiling water, for smoothing walls, for extracting lime juice, for sieving beer, or for measuring a quantity of fish-as well as an enormous variety in the forms which particular items (e.g., hats and helmets) could take. At the same time, listing material effectively demonstrates the large gaps (thematic, spatial, and temporal) in the documentation, revealing just how many questions we will never be able to answer. This project would not allow material culturists to dispense with original sources altogether. Crucial passages must always be examined in context; and since any such catalog would to some extent be the product of a subjective interpretation, it could never serve as a substitute for the originals. Nonetheless, such an instrumentumt studiorumn might help to ensure that the early records for Africa's cultural heritage be handled less cavalierly than has often been the case.</page><page sequence="16">364 ADAM JONES Notes I dedicate this article to the memory of Marion Johnson (1914-88), who died while I was writing the paper on which it is based. She was a pioneer in the field of study discussed here, and like many others, I benefited from stimulating conversations with her. I am grateful to Eugenia Herbert and Timothy Garrard for criticism of the original version and to the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Bonn) for supporting this research. 1. For the West African coast see, for example, Vansina 1969, 1984; Bradbury 1973: 251-70; Jones 1984; Bassani 1983; Anquandah 1982; Ben-Amos 1983. 2. See Schlereth 1985. 3 For European-language sources see Jones 1987; cf. Fage 1987: 188-92. 4. Cf. Vansina 1984: 34. The absence of such information is particularly disappointing when the collector concerned wrote a great deal about an African society's material culture in general, as in the case of T. E. Bowdich, much of whose Asante collection is in the Museum of Mankind: see McLeod 1977. Often we simply cannot be sure whether the objects mentioned in written sources are the same as those now found in museums: an Asante gold sword now in the Museum of Mankind, for example, may be the one mentioned by Thomas Freeman (1844: 53, 122), but this will probably never be proved (see Cole and Ross 1977: 152). 5. Dam-Mikkelsen and Lundbaek 1980: 42-56. One of the items (ibid., 50) was re- ferred to as "a Brazilian hat, or rather an African basket." 6. In the case of the Gold Coast the only significant exception was Mrs R. Lee, widow of T. E. Bowdich. 7. In this sense, the geographical and chronological biases of the written material tend to run parallel to those of early European collections of African objects: see Bassani 1986: 70. 8. This applies particularly to Ghanaian authors: see, for example, Antubam 1963; Antiri 1974; Kyerematen 1964; Nunoo 1974. 9. Bravmann 1968: 2. For further information on the sword see Jones, forthcoming. 10. In 1987, for example, my work on early records led me to collect information in Ghana on the a-tufu, a bustle-like garment which few museums have every tried to acquire, although it can be traced back as far as the seventeenth century. 11. One exception is a canoe in the National Museum of Denmark, obtained on the Gold Coast in the early nineteenth century: Smith 1970: 516. 12. For the Gold Coast see Bowdich 1821; Segy 1963. 13.

I use the term "primary sources" here in the sense proposed by Henige (1987: 54): "those pieces of information which stand in the most intimate relationship to an event in the present state of our knowledge" (emphasis in original). 21.

Those who have done so for the Gold Coast include McLeod 1979, 1981, Cole and Ross 1977, Kea 1982: 223, and Patton 1984. Menzel 1968, Himmelheber 1972, and Pilipczuk 1985 rely mainly on the German translation of Astley published in 1749--one step further removed from the original sources. 23. Smith 1970: 519. Even if he had himself consulted Purchas' 1625 translation of De Marees, rather than quoting it from an anthology, he would not have noticed this, as Purchas</page><page sequence="17">EARLY RECORDS AND MATERIAL CULTURE 365 omitted De Marees' two chapters on canoes. For other instances where material written in the early seventeenth century is wrongly ascribed to Dapper see Lahaderne 1981: 168; Cole and Ross 1977: 168; Anquandah 1982: 92. For a study of Dapper's sources see Jones 1990b. 24. Cole and Ross (1977: 149, 168-69) note that he "borrowed heavily from de Marees' account" and plagiarized Bosman. Barbot's manuscripts have been used for the study of material culture by Johnson (1979) and Garrard (1980, 1983, 1989). 25. Cole and Ross 1977: 48, 119. Garrard (1980: 80, 130, 142-43) attributes to Barbot information which in reality derived mainly from Villault and Bosman. 26. Ibid., 149. In fact there is no evidence that Bosman was influenced by De Marees' book at all. 27. Jones 1991: 183-85. The English translation (1875) adds to the distortions introduced by the editor, Hermann Gundert. 28. See Heintze and Jones 1987: 5, and references cited there; cf. Winsnes 1987. 29. See Fage 1980.

Garrard 1983: 40, 50. At this time "Fantyn" (or "Infantin") was the name of a tiny polity situated near Kormantin, rather than an ethnonym for the inhabitants of the central Gold Coast. 39. Cole and Ross 1977: 191; Preston 1975: 70. 40. The slender evidence is discussed in Datta and Porter 1971: 289-92 and Kea 1982: 130-37. 41. For the danger of using recent ethnographic sources to illuminate earlier ones see Hilton 1987: 308-10. 42. This "ancient vs. modern" dichotomy is apparent in many works of the 1960s (e.g., Menzel 1968), where a footnote often throws together half a dozen references drawn fromni a period spanning several centuries, in order to describe what "was" practized. Less excusably, the same approach can be detected in several more recent studies on art history; for criticisni cf. Kasfir 1984. 43. Cole and Ross 1977: 134; McLeod 1981: 112. 44.

The passage on weapons, cited by Van Dantzig, refers not to the Gold Coast but to what is now Gabon. For another contemporary reference to swords see Ulsheimer in Jones 1983: 34. 49. Although in my view Garrard's chronological argument (further developed in Garrard 1984: 167, 170-71) stands on rather shaky ground, it marks a major step forward. Bellis</page><page sequence="18">366 ADAM JONES (1982: 1, 35) and Coronel (1979) curiously ignore the references to funerary terracottas in De Marees and Muiller, implying that they were not recorded until about 1700. 50. McLeod 1979: 13; Cole and Ross 1977: 160. Hemmersam, who lived on the coast two decades earlier, wrote that men who had been "ennobled" carried "a stick covered with elephant leather in their hands" (my translation), and by the 1680s it was probably fairly common for Europeans to give Africans canes with their names inscribed. See Jones 1983: 113 and 1985: 128. 51. For early references see Rigsarkivet (Copenhagen), V-gK 187, "Inventarium," 23.1.1674; Zur Eich in Jones 1983: 267. 52. Unfortunately some historians adopt a similar approach, as Hair (1974: 79) has noted: "Rodney argues that the Mane must have been Mandingo, because Portuguese sources record that the Mane in Sierra Leone and the Mandingo on the Gambia each used the same weapon, a short bow. The argument is a weak one, unless it can be shown that other implicated parties (Temne, Vai, Susu, Kru, etc.) did not use the weapon, or better still, that throughout West Africa only the Mandingo used it [...] Rodney argues that the war-fence was a Mane innovation in Sierra Leone because it was mentioned in connection with the invaders, and was not mentioned in pre-invasion accounts. This argument would begin to carry conviction only if it could be shown that the war-fence in Guinea has never been documented except among the Manding and among peoples with whom they have been in contact." 53. O'Hear (1991) has argued with reference to the original (unpublished) version of this article (1988) that it was "instrumental in widening the divide" between art history and history, adding that my criticisms were "not applicable to all art historians" and that some of them "could be levelled against some historians as well." While readily conceding the last point, I feel no remorse with regard to the first two. 54. The preparation of a detailed index to a source that is already in print can help others to find what they are looking for: see Johnson 1988, which ought to set a precedent. 55. e.g. Lahaderne 1981, passim. Garrard (1980: 107-11) deals with references to goldwork in a similar manner, albeit with somewhat more justification, his aim being to amass sufficient documentation to refute current theories. 56. Proposals on similar lines, made by Hair (1974), have not been followed up, except to some extent in Hair's own footnotes. For comparison see Quinn's (1981) book on North American ethnographic material and two bibliographies on Africa-one (Terray 1978) for the Akan and limited to gold, the other (Beach 1987: 143-45) for Zimbabwe-which concisely list the topics dealt with in each source. As an interim measure such lists are useful, but the more ambitious sort of project that I have outlined has more to be said for it.
