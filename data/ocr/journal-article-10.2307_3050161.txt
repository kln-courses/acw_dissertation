In this article the implications of this paradoxical interpretation are explored, and a new group of marine scenes, which are here designated "fish ponds," are seen as images of "living water." THREE DRAWINGS IN AN ANGLO-SAXON PONTIFICAL: ANTHROPOMORPHIC TRINITY OR THREEFOLD CHRIST? JANE ROSENTHAL 547 Three full-page drawings of the deity in the English tenth- century pontifical from Sherborne (Paris, Bibl. Nat. lat. 943, fols. 5v-6v) have hitherto been identified as one of the earliest representations of the Trinity in anthropomor- phic form. Detailed examination of the pictorial evidence and the textual context of the works suggests, however, that the drawings actually portray an even more unusual subject, one apparently without precedent in earlier Western art, to wit, Christ appearing in his threefold character as king, god, and man. THE "MASTER OF THE REBEL ANGELS" RECONSIDERED Two small trecento paintings representing the Fall of the Rebel Angels and Saint Martin dividing his cloak with the Beggar, originally covering opposite sides of the same panel, have been attributed to a Sienese painter named the Master of the Rebel Angels and dated into the forties. Examination of them reveals that they are by different painters. Giovanni da Milano painted the REMBRANDT AS MEDITATIONAL PRINTMAKER The essay examines parallels between state changes in two prints by Rembrandt and meditational sequences in con- temporary devotional poetry, exemplified by a sonnet by Rembrandt's patron, Constantine Huygens. As in a meditational poem, Rembrandt's prints proceed from descriptive exposition of the narrative, to a revision JOSEPH POLZER 563 Saint Martin and Naddo Ceccarelli most probably the Rebel Angels. Accordingly, the essay observes an excep- tional collaboration of a Sienese with a Florence-trained painter. The closer examination of these paintings con- tributes to understanding of Sienese painting preceding the Black Death and of the artistic formation of Giovanni da Milano. MARGARET DEUTSCH CARROLL 585 prompting deliberation over its meaning, to a final stage of more intense and intimate confrontation with Christ. Traces of correction and revision in these prints are com- pared to confessional themes in devotional poetry, indicat- ing that both prints and poems serve additionally as records of the artist's spiritual and creative travail. A DATE FOR SALVATOR ROSA'S SATIRE ON PAINTING AND THE BAMBOCCIANTI IN ROME WENDY WASSYNG ROWORTH 611 Salvator Rosa's Satire on Painting, which castigates the cor- rupt state of the art, especially those low-life painters, the Bamboccianti, has never been firmly dated. Scholars have assumed he wrote it in Florence in the mid-1640's, but this article shows through documentary evidence, as well as an analysis of stylistic changes in his paintings, that Rosa com- posed it in the second half of 1650, after his return to Rome. This date coincides with a renewed interest in the Bam- boccianti by Roman patrons and the consequent resentment by serious painters such as Rosa, who considered himself a painter-philosopher and desired acceptance by the academic establishment, whose views on painting his Satire parallels. Neoclassic Painting and Its Ties THE TWO MANNERS OF LOUIS-LEOPOLD BOILLY AND FRENCH GENRE PAINTING IN TRANSITION JOHN STEPHEN HALLAM 618 Louis Boilly's son noted that his father had worked in two distinct manners; the first during the 1790's and the second from the Consulate era onward. This article ex- amines a selection from Boilly's genre oeuvre with a view toward defining the essential formal and iconographic characteristics of each. It is suggested that Boilly is a transitional figure. Works in the first manner are typical of the later eighteenth century, with their interest in moral, sentimental, even mildly erotic themes. By contrast, Boilly's second manner anticipates developments in later nineteenth-century naturalism by evincing a strong desire to record daily life with a degree of objectivity.</page><page sequence="7">UNDER THE SIGN OF LEONIDAS: THE POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL FORTUNE NINA ATHANASSOGLOU 633 OF DAVID'S LEONIDAS AT THERMOPYLAE UNDER THE RESTORATION In France during the 1820's, David's Leonidas at Thermopylae appeared in the limelight of political events. With memories of the Revolution and of the Empire attached to it, the painting became a visual allusion to the essence of Liberal thought, to republicanism and Bonapartism. Its emblematic role was "actualized" and further de- fined through its association with the literary and visual imagery of the Greek Revolution which at the time absorbed both French politics and the French public mind.
