<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Sanctifier MICHAEL BAILY "I believe in the Holy Ghost, Lord, and Giver of Life; Who proceeds from the Father and the Son, Who together with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified; Who spoke by the prophets". ?from the Nicene Creed, said at Mass. AN American journal recently carried an article entitled : "The Cinderella of Theology: the doctrine of the Holy Spirit". The writer expressed the hope that as the first half of the twentieth century was a period of Christology, so the second half of the century would witness a great flowering of Pneumatology. Time will tell. But it is safe to say that such a development will spring not primarily from the researches of theologians, but from the faith and fervour of the Church as a whole. For the truths that concern the Holy Spirit, more than other truths of our religion, are reached by means of pure refined faith. He pertains to the first and darkest mystery of faith, the Trinity. And within the mysterious life of three Persons in one God, the Person least accessible to us, as it were, is the Holy Spirit. Our faith in God "the Father Almighty, Creator of Heaven and earth" is in some way aided by our sense of dependence and creature consciousness; and our best human instincts support our faith in "Jesus Christ his Only Son . . . who for us men and our salvation became man". But our faith in the Holy Spirit has no such supports. Natural religion offers nothing to correspond to it. Human reason can hardly find analogies for a distinct person proceeding from Father and Son, and its speculations can go but a little beyond the formulae of faith. Indeed it is a measure of the helplessness of our minds before this mystery that we fail even to find a personal name for the third Person of the Trinity. To call him the Holy Spirit is to give him a functional name, to describe his activity. In this con nection it is important to note that Spirit should not be understood in antithesis to matter as denoting an immaterial substance (after the terminology of scholastic philosophy). In accordance with its biblical derivation it connotes, rather, life in an active dynamic sense. This sense is now best evoked for us not by the word "spirit", but by its derivative "inspiration". It is not surprising, then, that the formulae of faith are content to represent the Holy Spirit dynamically, whether in his activity within the Trinity, or in the</page><page sequence="2">334 THE furrow activities ad extra appropriated to him. And it is by contact with him acting in the Church and in the soul through grace that we increase in the knowledge by Faith of the Holy Spirit. This dynamic revelation of the Sanctifier can be perceived also in the history of salvation as we read it in the Bible. I QUI LOCUTUS EST PER PROPHETAS The word used for the Spirit of God by the Hebrews, Ruach, has an instructive derivation and history in the Old Testament. It has two meanings which to us are distinct enough: the breath of a living being, and the wind. They form the basis for two biblical themes of the Holy Spirit, but the primitive Hebrews hardly distinguished one meaning from the other. They, by a cosmic anthropomorphism, regarded the wind as the breath of God. Not until the New Testa ment was the Ruach of God revealed as a distinct Person. For the Hebrews the wind was a phenomenon of this world that very well represented the mystery of God. It is invisible, is free, is subtle and all-pervading, and comes from the heavens. But above all it is irresistible and thus manifests, better than anything else, the power of God. In the climatic forces of the natural order, the winds from the desert that destroyed their crops or the sudden storms that damaged property, the Hebrews recognised the power of God. But as their primitive minds did not distinguish the natural order from the supernatural, they ascribed to the same Spirit of God the special saving interventions of God in the interest of his people Israel. Of the first great act of deliverance, the Exodus, Isaias (63:14) would say: "The Spirit of the Lord was their leader; so didst thou lead thy people to make thyself a glorious name". It was through the Spirit of God that the warrior saviours of Israel received irresistible power. This was true especially of the period of the Judges and of the founding of the monarchy, when the Holy Land of Promise was being secured for the People of God.1 Nor was this protective activity of the Spirit exercised mechanically : it was closely related to the religious and moral fidelity of Israel to her Covenant with Jahveh. To this theme of the Spirit as com municating the power of God belongs the charism of working "signs and wonders" which belonged to the prophets on occasion. 1. Cf. Judges 3:10; 6:34; 11:29; I Kings 11:6; 16:3.</page><page sequence="3">THE SANCTIFIER 335 But a more fundamental and doctrinally richer theme is that of the Spirit as the giver of life. Ruach means breath, the surest sign of life. The life that quickens all created things is the Spirit of God himself. Its opposite is Flesh, which stands for what is weak and perishable, what is inevitably destined for death. Hence the rhythm of life and death on earth was splendidly represented by the Psalmist as the respiration of Jahveh: But if thou turnest away thy face they shall be troubled: thou shaft take away their breath, and they shall fail, and shall return to dust. Thou shall send forth thy spirit, and they shall be created: and thou shalt renew the face of the earth. ?Ps 103:29-30 In the striking anthropomorphism of Genesis 2:7 God moulds man from the earth and into the nostrils of this inert statue he breathes the breath of life.2 So that there is a sense in which the Hebrew defined God, in opposition to created things which are mortal, as living and life-giving through his Spirit. The life-giving Spirit of God is sometimes linked with the word of God, to provide us with what may be a faint echo of the Trinity. The spoken word is borne by the breath and hence the word of God is, in some sense, carried by the Spirit to its objective. In the account of creation it is probable that the Spirit of God which moved over the barren and formless earth carried the creative word of God throughout the universe (Genesis 1:2-3 ff). So also the Psalmist: By the word of the Lord the heavens were established; and all the power of them by the spirit of his mouth. ?P^32:6 All of this had its counterpart in the supernatural sphere of salvation. When God chose Israel, he became the Father of a people to whom he planned to give fellowship in his own life. This would consist in deliverance from the death of sin and growth in a life of holiness. The all-Holy God lived this life to the full. He would communicate to his own by means of his holy Spirit. This sanctifying activity of the Spirit was exercised especially through 2. G. K. Chesterton paraphrased: 44From one raw red clay awakened By the nostrils of the Lord!"</page><page sequence="4">336 THE FURROW the prophets he "inspired". From the Spirit they received the word of God revealing Himself, his holiness, his love for his people, and his zeal for their growth in this new life. The religious and moral response of Israel was not what it might have been: "And thou didst forbear with them for many years and didst testify against them by thy Spirit, by the hands of thy prophets (Nehemias 9:30), and they made their heart as the adamant stone, lest they should hear the law and the words which the Lord of hosts sent in his Spirit by the hand of the former prophets (Zachary 7:12)". And the Isaias of c. 63 pleads, "Where is he that put in the midst of them the Spirit of his Holy One?" Yet there were some, like the prophets themselves, who responded to this Spirit, and the beautiful prayer of the Miserere gives expression to their yearnings: Turn away thy face from my sins: and blot out all my iniquities. Create a clean heart in me, O God: and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from thy face: and take not thy holy Spirit from me. ?Ps 50:11-13 Furthermore the inward spiritual logic of Old Testament revela tion, with its faith in a holy all-powerful God who was intensely concerned about the world carried the prophets to a vision of better things to come. In the Messianic age the influence of the holy Spirit of God would pervade all and establish the reign of God with power. The Spirit of God will be with its founder and king: no longer in a transient way, nor measured, but it shall "rest upon him" and empower every feature of his rule (Isaias 11:1-5). This sway of the Spirit will not be confined to the Messias, or to a chosen few, but "I will pour my Spirit upon all flesh . . ." (Joel 2:28, cf. Isaias 32:15-20; Ezechiel 36:26-27). It will be noticed that in these texts the metaphor of the Spirit as a breath or wind is changed, or rather mixed with the metaphor of water. The figure is that of life-giving waters?so much appreciated in Palestine? channelled on to, or raining down upon, arid desert land and causing it to flower with life. This figure of the life-giving properties of the Spirit later becomes very dear to Saint John. II CREDO ET IN SPIRITUM SANCTUM, DOMINUM ET VIVIFICANTEM, QUI EX PATRE FILIOQUE PRO?EDIT The New Testament carries forward these themes and notes their development, first in the life and Redemptive work of Christ</page><page sequence="5">THE SANCTIFIER 337 and secondly in the New Israel, the Church. Finally it reveals the Holy Spirit as a distinct Person involved in the intimate life of the Trinity. The Synoptic Gospels, indeed, often describe the activity of the Spirit of God in the style of Old Testament texts.3 But in the case of Christ there is a great difference. He entered the world, assuming a sinless human nature, by the prodigy of virginal conception worked by the power of the holy Spirit. And in the carrying out of his mission of salvation he is assisted in a remarkable way by the Spirit of God. This is set in relief on two different occasions when Christ becomes possessed, as it were, by the Spirit. Each of these inaugurates a distinct phase of his work. The first, his Baptism, inaugurates the Public Ministry which ended with his death. All four evangelists refer to this coming of the Spirit upon him to empower his humanity with a permanence and fullness unknown to the prophets. In this connection Saint Peter described the Baptism with a very meaningful expression. In his address to Cornelius he proclaimed "Jesus Christ, how God anointed him with the holy Spirit and with power" {Acts 10:38). This evokes the penetrating power of oil which thoroughly appro priates to itself, as it were, the object anointed. It is of interest to remark here that the patristic and theological tradition of the anointing of Christ's humanity at the Incarnation (i.e. by his divine Person) does not appear in the New Testament. The only anointing it knows is anointing by the Holy Spirit, principally at the Baptism of Christ.4 This anointing enabled him to perform his saving acts of mercy: Peter's instruction continues, "who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him". It was in virtue of this Spirit of life and of holiness that he was master of the powers of disease and death, and of the powers of sin and hell. Hence when in conflict with the Pharisees about the source of his power, he makes the incontrovertible point: "But if I by the Spirit of God cast out devils, then is the Kingdom of God come upon you" {Matthew 12:28). His teaching, no less than his works, was that of one "having power" ; and he could say to his followers, "the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life" {John 6:64). Finally his supreme redeeming service to mankind, which was by perfect obedience to his Father "unto the death of 3. Luke 1:41, 67; 2:25-27. And John the Baptist is clearly impelled by the Spirit as were the prophets. 4. Luke 4:18; Acts 10:38; 4:27. Hebrews 1:9 finds the anointing o? Ps 44:8 verified in the Resurrection?itself the work par excellence of the Spirit.</page><page sequence="6">338 THE FURROW the Cross", he carried out in his mortal body by the grace of the Spirit. "For of a truth there assembled together in this city against thy holy servant, whom thou hast anointed, Herod . . . and the peoples of Israel, to do what thy hand and thy counsel decreed to be done" (Acts 4:27). In Jesus, therefore, the Spirit found a nature in which the divine life of holiness could flourish without hindrance, in which the Kingdom of God came on earth. Starting from his own humanity, but within the limitations imposed by his mortal life "according to the flesh", Christ pushed out the frontiers of the Kingdom of God. But the establishing of this Kingdom throughout the universe of place and time, and?more important than its spatial extension? its penetration into the human citadel, body and soul, could be achieved only by the glorified Christ, This second phase of Christ's Messianic work was inaugurated by the Resurrection. Then Christ was given a new life, "constituted Son of God in power according to the Spirit of Holiness" (Romans 1:4). This new investiture with the Spirit, therefore, is a second Baptism, or rather the complement of the first. For Saint Paul abounds in the teaching that the agent of Christ's Resurrection and the vivifying principle of his glorified body is the Spirit of God. (Cf. Romans 8:11; Ephesians 1:18-20; II Corinthians 13:4.) But no sooner has the Apostle marvelled at this supreme triumph of the Spirit of power, than he sees in it the inauguration of the age of holiness for the redeemed. The triumph of the Spirit in Christ's humanity is the exemplar and the cause of his sanctifying activity in mankind. Christ is the Second Adam, he is the pilot member, as it were, who leads this Exodus of mankind to find a new "life in the Spirit". He passed through death to life himself and thus quickened becomes the channel of the life-giving Spirit for all who adhere to him. We understand now why it was not until after his Resurrection that Christ "breathed (note the life giving Ruach) upon them, and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit; whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain they are retained' " (John 20:22-23). All of this was taught by Our Lord in a dramatic scene which took place at the feast of Tabernacles. The figure used by Christ becomes clearer if we remember that the ceremonies of the feast drew attention to the rock of the desert from which flowed the waters that saved the lives of the Israelites. Now on the last, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying,</page><page sequence="7">THE SANCTIFIER 339 If anyone thirst let him come to me ; And let him drink, whosoever believes in me ; as the Scripture says, "From within him (i.e. the Messias) there shall flow rivers of living waters".5 John interprets, "He said this, however, of the Spirit whom they who believed in him were to receive; for the Spirit had not yet been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified." ?John 7:37-9 It is from the Christ who is risen, as from the rock, that the floods of the life-giving Spirit will flow. That this enlivening principle does not merely guarantee bodily life in some glorified way but involves the sanctification and divinisation of the whole man is forcefully expounded in Romans cc. 5-8. For in virtue of the mystery of Christ's vicarious expiation of sin, his Resurrection was essentially a triumph over spiritual death, over sin, which opposes the holy life of God. "For the law of the Spirit of the life in Christ Jesus has delivered me from the law of sin and of death" {Romans 8:2). In this way the Spirit becomes the source which enlightens and animates Christian holiness. The Old Law commanded holiness and prescribed rules of conduct, many of which were of exterior observance. Even with great human effort it was difficult to attain to this holiness. Here now in the New Dispensation all is changed. For we have within us a well-spring of holiness which Paul calls the Law of the Spirit and which an oracle of Jerem?as had already deeply appreciated : "I will give my law within them and I will write it in their hearts" {Jerem?as 31:33). This is the Holy Spirit and his sanctifying activity within us. From him we receive not only the ideal of holiness, which surpasses that of the Law, but also the power of attaining to it that was absent from the Law. Or simply the Holy Spirit it is who works out for us our sanctification. "For what was impossible to the Law, in that it was weak because of the flesh, God has made good. By sending his Son in the likeness of sinful flesh as a sin-offering, he has condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the 5. This punctuation of w. 37-8 gives a different sense to that of the familiar Vulgate reading where "whosoever believes in me" goes with what follows, and the source of the water is the believer. Our rendering is that of Justin and Irenaeus and is preferred by many recent standard works, e.g. Lagrange's Commentary, Braun in La Sainte Bible (Pirot), and Mollat in La Sainte Bible (Jerusalem).</page><page sequence="8">340 THE FJRROW requirements of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit" (Romans 8:3-4). This sanctifying Spirit becomes active in the Church, the New Israel, and in the individual soul. After the Resurrection of Christ a great expectancy fell on the little group of disciples. Christ briefed them on the work of the Church, and added, "I send forth upon you the promise of my Father. But wait here in the city until you are clothed with power from on high" (Luke 24:44-49). It is made clear, besides, in what "the promise of the Father" consists?"you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days hence" (Acts 1:4-5). After several days of prayer this Baptism of the infant Church took place at Pentecost. "There came a sound from Heaven, as of a violent wind blowing (this was indeed the Breath of God) . . . and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit". All is now transformed. The Last Days foretold by Joel have come when "I (the Lord) will pour forth of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams" (Acts 2:17). In a new sense God had sent forth his creative Spirit to renew the face of the earth. The early Christians were conscious with something of a spring-time thrill that they were living in this renewed world. Indeed the Acts of the Apostles is not so much the story of the Church as consolidated by Peter and Stephen and Paul, as the epic of its irresistible growth, inwardly and outwardly, by the power of the Spirit. Typical of it is the decree of the Council of Jerusalem: "For the Holy Spirit and we have decided to lay no further burden upon you but this indispensable one . . ." (15:28). Not only did the Spirit teach the Church, he fortified her leaders, directed her missionary efforts and confirmed her work by miracles and charisms. But his greatest miracle of all was the fervour of love that united her members: "the multitude of the believers were of one heart and one soul and not one of them said that anything he possessed was his own, but they had all things in common" (4:32). Charity is in truth the greatest gift of the Spirit and the root of moral holiness, "the fulfilment of the law" (Romans 13:10). In a meaningful passage in the Epistle to the Galatians Paul enunciates this primacy of charity before going on to list the works of the flesh opposed to it and the fruits of the Spirit that flow from it (Galatians 5:13-26). And he cautions the Corinthians not to pride themselves on other gifts of the Spirit to the neglect of charity "the more excellent way", that he hymns in I Corinthians c. 13.</page><page sequence="9">THE SANCTIFIER 341 For charity above all else brings the life of God into the Church, means, in fact, that God dwells in it. That is the point of Paul's striking figure of the Church as the temple of God: "Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you (plural, i.e. the community). If anyone destroys the temple of God, him will God destroy; for holy is the temple of God, and this temple you are" (I Corinthians 3:16-17). In this temple dwells more than the power of God simply, or more than the living breath of God; in it dwells the Spirit of his vital love in Person. (Cf. John 14:23-26.) Just as the Church has her Pentecost, so also has the individual Christian, when the sanctifying Spirit comes at Baptism: that Baptism in the Holy Spirit which would surpass the baptism with water administered by John the Baptist (Mark 1:8). The spiritual achievement of Baptism is brought out by a great variety of illus trations and types from creation, from the religious history of the Old Testament and from the life of Christ. But there are two under lying ideas of Baptism, one or other of which these illustrations serve to express: one relates its saving efficacy to the Death and Resurrection of Christ, the other is the idea of new life received in the Spirit. Saint Paul frequently expounds the first idea. By means of Baptism we follow Christ on to the Cross and through the tomb of sin to life in the Spirit. (Cf. Romans 8:3-11 ; I Corinthians 1:13; Colossians 2:12.) But by considering Baptism from the other point of view we can trace the sacrament to its Trinitarian source, without neglecting its cause in the Death and Resurrection of Christ. This Saint John does with typical simplicity and depth in his account of the meeting between Christ and Nicodemus. This man who acknowledges that "God is with" Christ comes "in the night" to get spiritual guidance. Jesus answered and said to him, "Amen, Amen, I say to thee, unless a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God". Nicodemus said to him, "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born again?" The new birth is contrasted with birth "according to the flesh". Jesus answered, "Amen, Amen, I say to thee, unless a man be born again of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh;</page><page sequence="10">342 THE FURROW and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not wonder that I said to thee, 'You must be born again'. The wind blows where it will, and thou hearest its sound but dost not know where it comes from or where it goes. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit". The Spirit is therefore the point of divine contact with the believer, through the water that effects what it signifies. Here the water is not so much the Dead Sea or the Deluge or the tomb, but water from the well-spring of life. Nicodemus pressed for an explanation. Christ, referring to what he had said as "earthly things" i.e. the Spirit in the life-bearing sign, wonders how Nicodemus can under stand "heavenly things". But he nevertheless proceeds to explain the function of the Son as mediator between Heaven and Earth: And no one has ascended into heaven except him who has descended from heaven: the Son of Man who is in heaven. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that those who believe in him may not perish, but may have life everlasting. Here we are given life, not so much by becoming members of Christ, as by receiving from his pierced side the waters ?f life (cf. John 19:34-35). Finally the discourse reaches up to the Father whose gratuitous love initiates the work of salvation: For God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son, that those who believe in him may not perish but may have life everlasting. That as much as says that the movement for our sanctification begins with the Father but reaches us through the Spirit in Christ. The third Person in whom the movement of love within the Trinity has its term, commences in us the work of making us "members of God's household" {Ephesians 2:19). By him we are brought into the circle of Trinitarian life. For whoever are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. Now you have not received a spirit of bondage so as to be again in fear, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons, by virtue of which we cry, "Abba", "Father", The</page><page sequence="11">Praise and blame The desk of every editor is a repository for letters from readers? letters which belaud and letters which belabour. Such epistolary trophies are no positive indication of success or failure, but they are at least a witness to the vitality of the press and its capacity for eliciting the strong response. Catholic journalism need only be anxious when there is either no response or uniform response. A uniform response of praise is as much a sign of failure as a uniform response of blame. Catholic journalism, like all things Catholic, must reveal the Gospel impact. The Gospel comforts, but it sometimes disconcerts. ?the catholic messenger, Davenport, Iowa</page></plain_text>
