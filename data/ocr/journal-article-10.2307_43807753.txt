<plain_text><page sequence="1">MARIO VARGAS LLOSA: THE PROFANE OPTIMIST by Bobs M. Tusa Loyola University of New Orleans Part I F. S. C. Northrop in The Meeting of East and West 1 distinguishes between the Oriental perception of reality which is common to Buddhism, Hinduism, Confucianism, and Taoism and the Western concept of reality shared by North American and European cultures with the exceptions of Spain and Russia. It is this Oriental perception of reality, rather than the Western, that is central to the work of Mario Vargas Llosa (1936- ), and the efforts of many critics to comprehend his novels according to their supposed place within the Western cognitive tradition have led them to use words like pessimism and negativism in trying to identify the author's attitude toward reality. The analysis of his novels in the light of Oriental beliefs as they are manifested in Eastern works, in Arabic Spain, and in Spanish America leads to the conclusion that Mario Vargas Llosa is a profound optimist, but that the reasons for his optimism arise from his Oriental apprehension of reality€ In order to interpret accurately La ciudad y los perros (1963), La Casa Verde (1966), and Conversación en La Catedral (1969) it is necessary to comprehend the distinctions and implications of the Oriental and Western attitudes. 1 F.

Tusa I The fact that the Oriental explanations of reality take the form of religions because their precepts are validated intuitively or emotionally and the Occidental the form of philosophies because they are confirmed log- ically, Northrop judges to be the clue to their basic differences. The philosophies at the base of the various national cultures in the West presuppose a common definition of reality regardless of whether they are predominantly Platonic or Aristotelian, and that is: "The immediately apprehended aesthetic factors [of reality] were conceived ... to be related to the theoretically known factors ... by a three-termed relation of ap- pearance in which the material object in the 'true, real and mathematical' space and time of the theoretic component is one term, the observer is a second term, and the apparent sensed qualities in the apparent relative sensed space and time of the aesthetic component are a third term" (Northrop, p. 440). Because the theoretically true component of reality is perceived according to Western philosophy by means of logic whereas the apparent concrete component is sensed directly, both Platonists and Aristotelians (the latter to a lesser degree) have elevated Logos to a posi- tion of primacy in interpreting reality and have disparaged as mere appearance, base, partial, or evil the Eros principle - the direct, intuitive, aesthetic, and emotional apprehension of concrete reality. Therefore, ac- cording to Northrop, Western theistic religions (Judaism, Mohammedanism to a certain extent, Catholicism with the exception of the cult of the Virgin, and Protestantism) have identified the divine and the good primarily with the theoretic component of reality, and pre-Impressionist Western art was primarily representational or symbolic. For various reasons considered below Spain is an exception to the general Western manner of perceiving reality and conforms more closely to the Oriental. Unlike the Occidental three-termed relation of appearance between the mental self, the concrete appearances of reality, and the logically inferred true reality, the Oriental perception of reality considers that both the self and natural objects are composed of matter and, for lack of a better word, spirit - both of which are immediately, directly, aesthetically perceived. According to Northrop, "between the aesthetically given self and the aesthetically given natural object there is a one-ness or identity, as well as difference, due to the fact that the immediately apprehended aesthetic self and the immediately apprehended aesthetic object are not merely different from each other, but also differentiations of the one, all-embracing, immediately apprehended aesthetic continuum" (Ibid., p. 331). The Oriental religions view man as an integral being, body and soul forming a unity, one with himself and with all natural objects because of the union of both</page><page sequence="3">Mario Vargas Llosa : The Profane Optimist 77 in the all-embracing aesthetic continuum, or what is referred to by Oriental sages as the "female principle." Northrop summarizes the role of the female principle within the general Oriental interpretation of reality thusly: The self is composed of two components, one a determinate, dif- ferentiated, unique element, distinguishing one person from any other person ; the other the all-embracing, aesthetically immediate, and emotionally moving compassionate indeterminate, and hence indescribable, field component. The former is temporary, transi- tory, and not immortal; furthermore, the cherishing of it, the desire for its immortality, is a source of suffering, selfishness and evil. The part of the self which is not transitory and immortal is the aesthetic field component of the self. Because it is identical not merely in all persons, but in all aesthetic objects throughout the entire cosmos, the cherishing of it, instead of making men selfish, gives them a compassionate fellow-feeling for all creatures. (Ibid., p. 353) Indispensable to the correct interpretation of Vargas Llosa's novels is the comprehension of the basic tenets of Confucianism, which specifies the ethical relations of persons implicit in the compassionate nature of the female principle, and the nature metaphors of Taoism, which symbolize the components of the Oriental dual reality. The basic text of Taoism, Lao Tzu's Tao Tê Ching or "The Book of the Way and Its Virtue/' calls the undifferentiated and immortal field component of reality yin and the differentiated and transitory elements yang. In the Introduction to his English translation of the Tao Tê Ching, R. B. Blakney specifies the symbolic references of yin and yang: "Generally speaking, Yin stands for a constellation of such qualities as shade . . . , darkness, cold, negativeness, weakness, femaleness, etc. ; while Yang . . . denotes light, heat, strength, positiveness, maleness, etc."2 Whereas yin and yang - female passivity and male assertiveness - are both considered to be the two interacting factors of reality, the wise man, say the Taoists, is he who chooses the female as his criterion of the good. "The Wise Man is generally described as having characteristics normally associated with women. The Way itself is described ... as a mother" (Ibid., p. 25). "In order to obtain the Virtue of the Way, man must surrender to it : it will not come to him automatically. Though masculine, he must learn the passivity of a female and, denying himself, let the Way be his way" (Ibid., p. 44). In addition to shade, dark- ness, nightime, and cold, another Tao nature symbol for the female principle that is especially significant to Vargas Llosa's novels is water: 2 R. B. Blakney trans., "Introduction," The Way of Life, by Lao Tzu (New York: New American Library, 1955), p. 24.</page><page sequence="4">78 Bobs M. Tusa The highest goodness, water-like, Does good to everything and goes Unmurmuring to places men despise; But so, is close in nature to the Way. (Lao Tzu, p. 60) The Taoists thus characterize the good man as one who, having accepted the life-giving compassionate female principle as his ethical guide, possesses the flexibility, supple strength, and vitality of water, whose gentle pressure conquers the hardest stone. Confucianism considers that the individual's acceptance of the female principle involves three factors or stages. The first is ch'eng, or the individual's determination for himself of the real, i.e., of the dual nature of perceived reality as comprising the determinate transitory component and the eternal continuum. The second stage is jen, or his choice of the eternal continuum rather than the transitory component as his criterion of the good. In addition to perception and understanding, the individual requires the third factor yung, or the courage to implement the female principle in his conduct by consistently behaving toward others with compassion. Closely allied to yung is the sense of shame which accompanies wrong behavior (behavior based on the opposite, male assertive principle of selfish striving); but, unlike the inhibitive or restrictive Western concept, Confucian shame is stimulative and positive: "This shame is nearer to chagrin, the chagrin at failing to remember the most elementary truth . . . that all determinate things are transitory" (Northrop, p. 386). II A brief examination of the implications of the Western and the Oriental perceptions of reality to four areas pertinent to the novels of Mario Vargas Llosa - the nature of reality, human freedom, ethics, and art - reveals that these same concepts are actually quite distinct because they are founded on very different basic assumptions about the nature of reality. For various reasons considered below, Aristotle rather than Plato is a more likely source for Vargas Llosa of the Western concept of reality even though Aristotelian science has some aspects in common with the Oriental. Although Aristotle, in rejecting Plato's atomic theory of the nature of reality, accepts as true a dual reality comprising a directly perceived con- crete component and an equally real, universal, and eternal component, he postulates that this abstract component is not perceived directly (as the Buddhist does Nirvana) but indirectly by means of logic. Thus Aristotle, like the Orientals, locates the basis of human freedom and ethical choice</page><page sequence="5">Mario Vargas Llosa : The Profane Optimist 79 in the non-deterministic nature of the abstract component, but he specifies a hierarchy of perfectability in his doctrine of the four causes, according to which the abstract component realizes itself in man and natural objects in a potentializing manner, the first cause containing implicitly within itself the final cause. Aristotelian man is thus theoretically one of many parts of a dual reality, but actually he is superior to the rest of creation because only he possesses the rational capacity to perceive this true nature of reality upon which to base his actions. Therefore, the Western, Aristo- telian definition of reality implicitly derogates the direct, intuitive, emo- tional, and aesthetic perception that the Oriental holds to be true by elevating rationality to a position of primacy; and it identifies the good with self-assertion and dominance of a hierarchical reality rather than with passive acquiescence and sharing with co-equal members of nature as the Oriental religions do. The Oriental interpretation of reality also includes concepts of human freedom and ethics but ones based on quite different assumptions. The Oriental basis of human freedom, like the Aristotelian, lies in the indeter- minate component of reality; but the Oriental characterizes this inde- terminate female principle as essentially unstructured and ambiguous rather than hierarchical. Therefore, the Oriental is free to choose commitment to a determinate course of action, in which case he makes himself respon- sible for the consequences of that choice, but equally free - indeed so required by his notion of the real - to cease that commitment at the appropriate time without any loss of honor. The Oriental sense of morality likewise originates in the all-embracing female principle - because only the continuum meets the ethical criterion of holding good for all persons at all times - but finds expression in the continuum's characteristic com- passion and not in moral codes which by their very definition are deter- minate and therefore transitory. "This is what the . . . Buddhist meant when he advised us 'to giv[e] up the distinction between [determinate] virtue and vice,' and 'to consider with perfect equanimity and detachment the conflicting opinions and the various [differentiated] manifestations of the activity of [determinate] things' " (Northrop, p. 387. Additions his.). To the Oriental the nature of reality and human life is obviously tragic because partially transitory, and the potential for human perfectability lies in the individual's acquiescence in the eternal, ambiguous, compassionate female principle and not in his striving to fulfill inflexible, determinate, hierarchical codes of any kind. The application to the area of art of the Occidental and the Oriental interpretations of reality results in differing attitudes toward the natural objects portrayed, methods of portrayal, and the finished artistic object. As Northrop points out, Western art, "by the use of theoretically con-</page><page sequence="6">80 Bobs M. Tusa trolled and defined techniques such as perspective, uses the aesthetic materials and the aesthetic continuum not merely in and for themselves for their own sake, but also analogically and symbolically to convey the theoretic component of the nature of things of which they are the mere correlate or sign" whereas Oriental art (with the exception of Greek- influenced Buddhist and Hindu art) "uses the immediately apprehended aesthetic materials of the differentiated aesthetic continuum to convey those materials and that continuum in and for themselves for their own sake" (Ibid., p. 306). As an example of the Oriental artistic object (although achieved with Western structural techniques) as found in Western liter- ature, Northrop chooses the novels of Gustave Flaubert for their "objec- tivity," or the apparent disappearance of the author behind his works, and for Flaubert's opposition to " 'the exposition of personal doctrine' " (Ibid., p. 488) in literary creations. Ill It is possible to establish theoretically the Orientalness of Mario Vargas Llosa by examining his statements regarding the same four concepts of the nature of reality, human freedom, ethics, and art. In 1959, when he was twenty-three, Vargas Llosa published a short study of Rubén Darío's Azul . . . , 3 which probably reflects ideas in his 1958 thesis "Bases para una interpretación de Rubén Darío." In this study Vargas Llosa places himself in opposition to a theory of art that would consider art, beauty, or the artist to be divine, to be other than part of concrete reality, by stating that idealization, rather than being the most appropriate representation of true (i.e., abstract) reality, is simply unreal: "La divinización de la belleza justifica, automáticamente, la evasión" (Ibid.). By "reality" Vargas Llosa clearly means that which is directly, aesthetically perceived: "La realidad que Darío rechaza es el mundo exterior inmediato" (Ibid.). He goes on to specify his own idea of the nature of reality: "En la realidad el futuro es siempre imprevisible y son mis actos los que determinan mi destino. El autentico realismo literario da por eso una impresión de espontaneidad, de cosa que se va haciendo" (Ibid.). An additional statement further confirms that the freedom and spontaneity which Vargas Llosa considers to be essential characteristics of reality originate not in the hierarchical order of Aristotelian reality but in the ambiguousness and chaos of Oriental reality: "El mundo romántico es perfecto: ciertas personas encarnan la bondad, otras el mal; el amor es siempre limpio, la pasión depravada y 3 Mario Vargas Llosa, "Táctica de la evasión en Azul . . . , de Rubén Darío," El Comercio y Suplemento Dominical (Lima), 12 April 1959, p. 2.</page><page sequence="7">Mario Vargas Llosa: The Profane Optimist 81 soez. Las novelas románticas tienen por eso una atmósfera de irrealidad que advertimos de inmediato: el mundo que nosotros conocemos es dife- rente. Los sentimientos más contradictorios pueden agruparse en un solo hombre en un tiempo brevísimo, determinados por situaciones también contradictorias" (Ibid.). Vargas Llosa's directly experienced reality is the dual one of the Orientals in which both matter and spirit are truly equal components of reality, as he makes clear in the following statement, which summarizes his detailed analysis in "Carta de batalla por Tirant lo Blanc " of the many levels or aspects he identifies in reality: "La realidad [es] objetividad y subjetividad, acto y sueño, razón y maravilla ¿Es menos real lo que los hombres hacen que lo que creen y sueñan? ¿Las visiones, pesadillas y mitos existen menos que los actos?" 4 Like the Orientals, Vargas Llosa considers the determinate elements of reality to constitute a oneness, resulting in "esa perfecta unidad de la diversidad, esa diversidad de la unidad que caracteriza lo real" {Ibid., I, 34). The place of man within this reality is not as a superior being who dominates the rest of creation by means of logic but as one of many elements of reality. Therefore, Vargas Llosa's theory of human personality gives emphasis to the common qualities of all men rather than to the uniqueness of each: "Es que yo no creo que existan individualidades absolutamente soberanas. Lo que creo es que existe en casi todos los hombres una gama de posibilidades más o menos idénticas y que se manifiestan de acuerdo con las situaciones diferentes en que viven esos hombres Yo creo que la excepcionalidad de un in- dividuo no proviene jamás de algo inmanente en él, sino de la alianza de una serie de condiciones y elementos exteriores y también interiores, pero que son comunes a la especie."5 Vargas Llosa's identification of the individual as comprising his sub- jectivity plus his situation in a historical place and time is obviously within the philosophical tradition of José Ortega y Gasset ("Yo soy yo y mi circunstancia") and more particularly of Jean-Paul Sartre. "El sartrecillo valiente," as Vargas Llosa refers to himself in the dedication to his third novel, approaches the areas of human freedom and ethics with an Exis- tentialist attitude : man is what he makes himself to be through his actions - "son mis actos los que determinan mi destino" (Vargas Llosa, "Táctica de la evasión en Azul . . .") - and the demands of the given situation rather than moral dogma determine one's ethical response. This latter idea is of 4 Mario Vargas Llosa, "Carta de batalla por Tirant lo Blanc," in Tirant lo Blanc, by Joanot Martorell and Martí loan de Galba, trans. J. F.

He merely decides for the moment what is the right thing to do" (Northrop, p. 383). Although this Existentialist and Oriental attitude toward freedom and ethical choice limits the individual's freedom of choice to a given set of circumstances and emphasizes the similarities of all men, it would be incorrect to consider this view deterministic, as Vargas Llosa insists: "No he querido mostrar a mis personajes como simples resultantes de fuerzas ajenas sino señalar cómo consiguen sobrevivir dentro de las coordenadas donde se encuentran insertos. Ellos eligen siempre entre alternativas y son responsables de su destino." 7 Mario Vargas Llosa perceives an Oriental dual reality and considers that reality to be the most appropriate subject for art, but he nonetheless approaches literature as a Westerner, although in the manner of Flaubert He re-creates reality in his novels not by making them literal copies in the manner of Alain Robbe-Grillet but by bringing to bear complex, highly structured, and rationally derived techniques in order that the result may appear to be real. In order that the novel may appear to be real, the reader must be made to read it as he experiences reality, which is, according to Vargas Llosa, directly, emotionally, without the interference of logical structures: "Todas las técnicas deben proponerse anular la distancia entre el lector y lo narrado, no permitir que el lector, en el momento de la lectura, pueda ser juez o testigo, lograr que la narración lo absorba de tal manera que la vida del lector sea la vida de la narración y que, entonces, el lector viva la narración como una experiencia más."8 Also peculiarly Western is the revolutionary function he assigns to the novel. Paraphrasing Sartre {Situations II, Paris, 1948), whose socialist beliefs he shares, Vargas Llosa says: "Yo creo que ésa es la función del novelista: mostrar de una 6 Elena Poniatonska, "Al fin, un escritor que le apasiona escribir, no lo que se diga de sus libros," La Cultura en México , ¡Siempre!

IV The objectivity and impartiality which Vargas Llosa considers essential to the craft of the realistic novelist explain his well-known admiration for Flaubert and also for Joanot Martorell's novel of chivalry Tirant lo Blanc (1490). An examination of Tirant lo Blanc indicates that the nature of the reality portrayed is precisely the same as that of the Peruvian author, that both are essentially Oriental, and that Hispanic medieval culture provides the link between the Oriental cognitive tradition and the Latin American. The reality that Martorell re-creates in Tirant lo Blanc is perceived by his characters directly, emotionally, and aesthetically, as Vargas Llosa points out in his "Carta de batalla": "Un temperamento sentimental y sanguíneo es el más común" (I, 25); "Se vive para gozar" (I, 26); and "También la religión importa por razones estéticas y hedo- nistas" (I, 27). That reality is composed, like the Taoists', of two equal factors - the male assertive principle (yang) and the female compassionate principle (yin) - however, the wise man, even though a warrior, accepts the female principle as the guide for his conduct: "En la novela el amor es tan importante como la guerra, e incluso el elemento heroico se halla subordinado al erótico" (I, 16); "Antes de conocer a Carmesina, Tirant desdeña a las mujeres ... ; luego, las diviniza y antepone el amor a todas las cosas" (I, 18); and "el amor ... está llamado a inscribirse ... en el mundo eterno del mito y la leyenda, a perdurar fuera del tiempo, a con- vertirse ... en símbolo" (I, 34). In Tirant lo Blanc the male assertive principle is identified with the strict code of chivalric honor, which theoretically promotes justice while protecting the Christian faith from the threat of Islam but which actually exists only as a verbal excuse that covers a hierarchical system of injustice based on institutionalized battles to the death for the sake of vengeance. Nor are virtue and justice exclusive of the Christians, who adhere to the 9 Mario Vargas Llosa, "Conferencia de Mario Vargas Llosa ofrecida en el Teatro Ateneo el 27 de mayo de 1965," in Primer Encuentro de Narradores Perua- nos, Arequipa , 1965 (Lima: Casa de la Cultura del Perú, 1969), p. 162.</page><page sequence="10">84 Bobs M. Tusa code, as evidenced by the presence of several wise and honorable Moham- medans and virtuous Jews. Vargas Llosa comments: "La descripción de los juegos amorosos [por Plaerdemavida] enjuicia, mostrando su infecti- vidad, su carácter artificial e inhumano, uno de esos valores que en el plano retórico aparecen con más frecuencia y que, si uno tomara al pie de la letra los discursos de los personajes, sería el fundamento moral más sólido de su mundo, [el honor] La existencia meramente retórica de ese valor, su encanallamiento y burla cuando pasa ... a los actos o a los sentimientos, queda así subrayada" (I, 40). In fact, the knight who is the most successful in defending the Faith, he who eventually becomes the new Caesar of Christendom, is Tirant lo Blanc, who is the most virtuous knight - "Por encima de los nobles deberías llevar corona y cetro real y ser señor del romano Imperio, pues por tus virtudes, obras y singulares actos de caballería a ti pertenece y no a otro" (Martorell, I, 260) - precisely because he accepts love as his guide - "Cierto es que nunca se hizo en el mundo ningún buen hecho de armas que no se hiciera por amor" (Mar- torell, I, 342). Tirant acquiesces in the female principle (jen) and im- plements it in his behavior in spite of opposition (yung) because, as the reader learns repeatedly, he is a man wise in the ways of the real world (ch'eng). Indeed, the Emperor of Constantinople considers the question of whether the better knight is the one possessed of self-assertive bravery (ardimiento) or the one with practical wisdom (juicio, sabiduría) to be important enough to be decided in full council; and he presents their decision with solemn ceremony: although a virtuous knight must neces- sarily have ardimiento, the better knight is he who possesses sabiduría . It is pertinent to note that Martorell felt that the medieval world of Tirant lo Blanc, with its balance of love and war and its rule by com- passion, was coming to an end at the time the novel was written. Toward the conclusion of the first volume one of the few magical or legendary scenes in this realistic novel appears as Morgana, after much searching, discovers her brother King Arthur - the paragon of knightly virtues - locked in a cage with a companion named, significantly, Fe-sin-piedad. King Arthur pronounces judgment on the decadent epoch: "Veo ir rodan- do este miserable mundo de mal en peor, pues veo que los hombres malos que aman la falsedad y el fraude viven prósperos y veo que se rebaja la virtud y la lealtad No hay nadie que virtuosamente ame" (Martorell, I, 532). And he responds to the question What is honor? by saying that "nadie puede conocer el pensamiento de la persona, pero se le conoce por las señales que fuera se manifiestan" (Martorell, I, 534). In other words, honor receives the Spanish definition of obrar bien, which is analogous to the Existentialist and the Confucian ethics of right actions.</page><page sequence="11">Mario Vargas Llosa : The Profane Optimist 85 V Not only is this definition of honor Hispanic, but the world threatened with destruction that Joanot Martorell preserves in Tirant lo Blanc is, within Europe, peculiar to the medieval Arabic Spain described by Americo Castro in La realidad histórica de España that ceased to exist at the begin- ning of the sixteenth century with the expulsion of Arabs and Jews and the rejection of their influence by the remaining populace. Castro suggests that lo español nonetheless comprises Oriental values brought into Hispania by the Arabs and other values originating in emulation of and opposition to the Islamic way of life. Americo Castro's study of Arabic culture in Spain demonstrates that reality as perceived by the Arabs was Oriental in the sense that it was the dual reality of determinate, transitory elements and an all-pervasive, eternal component that was present in both man and nature and whose essential characteristic was compassion or man-to-man-ness. Unlike the other theistic religions of the West, Islam does not feature an unseen anthropomorphic God toward whose perfectability man strives but rather a sense of the divine that is present in all creation and union with which is a directly sensed, emotionally felt experience which is achieved through passive acquiescence. Castro points out the Orientalness of the Arabic attitude : Junto con la actitud de "huida del mundo" en quienes todo lo aguardan de Dios y no de las cosas perecederas que nos rodean, el Islam estima altamente cuanto existe, empezando por el hombre, por ser obra de Dios Por este camino se llegaba a valorar el hombre por lo que en él ya puso Dios, lo cual es muy diferente del valor que los racionalistas confirieron al hombre como ser capaz de penetrar mediante el esfuerzo de su mente en la esencia del universo Esos rasgos tan españoles, yo no digo que tengan una motivación exclusivamente oriental, pero sí creo que hallaron en aquellos contactos seculares un medio muy propicio para ha- cerse predominantes. 10 The Arabs' sensuousness and delight in open structures, as reflected in their architecture, and the fact that, of the Greek scientific explanations of reality, they chose Aristotelian duality rather than Platonic atomism, are further evidence of the Oriental attitude they introduced into medieval 10 Américo Castro, La realidad histórica de España , 3rd ed. rev.

Tusa Europe : "The science and philosophy of Aristotle . . . specified the concep- tion of nature and man generally accepted by scientists . . . throughout the whole medieval world following the coming of the Arabs to Spain" (Northrop, p. 261). Castro's comparison of certain specific concepts common to the West but which in Spain take a different meaning apparently because of Arabic influence is particularly enlightening for the works of Mario Vargas Llosa when considered against the background of Confucian and Taoist beliefs. For example, the Old Spanish word for "secret" (poridad) was of Latin origin but influenced by Arabic in its meaning to the extent that it differed considerably from its Western counterparts: "En el ambiente latino- románico era el secreto una realidad objetivada ... ; era lo separado ( secre - tum); para el árabe el secreto iba relacionado con obrar sincera, íntima, lealmente con alguien; era lo vital, una cuestión personal dependiente de la amistad" (Castro, p. 216). Such a combination of meanings which the Westerner would not consider to be obviously related do indeed join to- gether in the Confucian jen, which is "an immediately felt factor in the nature of the individual man himself. This factor is . . . the quality of 'compassion' or 'man-to-man-ness' " and is also "the indeterminate aesthetic continuum named 'Void/ Brahman, tao, Nirvana, or jen" (Northrop, pp. 329, 382). Also, the Spanish meaning of "shame," as characterized by Castro, is identical to the Confucian shame that incites a person to the courage (yung) to act with compassion: "El sentido de vergüenza es aquí 'honor, lealtad/ una virtud activa, eficiente y no un sentimiento refre- nante Tal matiz no cabe en el concepto de 'vergüenza' en otras lenguas románicas" (Castro, p. 217). Especially pertinent to the novels of Vargas Llosa is the mystical sym- bolism of "night" and "day" of the Arabic sect of the Sadili, which orig- inated in Persia and whose influence in the formation of the Spanish mystics is recognized. For the Sadili as for San Juan de la Cruz, night or darkness is the way to union with the divine, as Pedro Salinas describes in his study of the Spanish mystic's poems: the soul "is led by obscurity itself and in this way arrives at the loved one, God, and rests in him." 11 This spiritual union cannot be achieved by self-assertion but rather by ac- quiescence of the (determinate) self in the divine: "supreme plenitude will be obtained only by dint of this labor of renouncing and of emptying oneself. Thus, the constant immersion in obscurity, in darkness" {Ibid., p. 126). It will be recalled that the Taoist sages use the same symbols of 11 Pedro Salinas, "The Escape from Reality: Fray Luis de León, San Juan de la Cruz," in Reality and the Poet in Spanish Poetry (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1940), p. 123.</page><page sequence="13">Mario Vargas Llosa : The Profane Optimist 87 day for the masculine assertive principle yang and night or darkness for the female principle yin , the latter being the way to union with the all- pervading, eternal, and compassionate continuum. Even though it be true that, as Américo Castro suggests, the Spaniards' rejection of the Islamic way of life was implied in their choice of the male assertive principle as embodied in Santiago, their Oriental perception of reality nonetheless endured; for although "España fue atacada desde el siglo xvi en toda posible forma . . . siempre sostuvo su derecho a vivir al margen de la Europa científica e industrializada, con la misma tenacidad que Don Quijote protegía su quijotismo frente a todos los curas, barberos, bachilleres y canónigos de la racionalidad" (Castro, p. 249). The result was that "el español fue el único ejemplo, en la historia occidental, de un propósito de vida fundado en la idea de que el único digno oficio para un hombre era ser hombre, y nada más" (Ibid., p. 267). Therefore, F. S. C. Northrop's suggestion that Latin America, the product originally of medieval Spanish and Indian and African animistic cultures with later influences from European and North American rational- istic civilizations, is a meeting place of East and West, seems to be quite accurate, as students of Latin American culture indicate. Jorge Luis Borges in his essay on "Nuestro pobre individualismo" recognizes that the Latin American lacks the European and North American notion of a hierarchical reality and instead conceives of reality as ambiguous, chaotic, and non- structured: "el mundo, para el europeo, es un cosmos, en el que cada cual íntimamente corresponde a la función que ejerce; para el argentino, es un caos." 12 That this reality is precisely the dual one of the Orientals is evident in Alejo Carpentieri description of lo real maravilloso of Latin America: "Lo maravilloso comienza a serlo . . . cuando surge de una inespe- rada alteración de la realidad (el milagro), de una revelación privilegiada de la realidad, de una iluminación inhabitual o singularmente favorecedora de las inadvertidas riquezas de la realidad, de una ampliación de las escalas y categorías de la realidad, percibidas con particular intensidad en virtud de una exaltación del espíritu que lo conduce a un modo de 'estado límite/ " 13 Carpentier considers this magical reality to be peculiar to Latin America because of its lack of structuralization - "Esa presencia y vigen- cia de lo real maravilloso . . . era . . . patrimonio de la America entera, donde todavía no se ha terminado de establecer ... un recuento de cosmo- gonías" (Ibid., p. 14) - and he proposes literary realism as the method most appropriate to its expression, "dejándose que lo maravilloso fluye 12 lorge Luis Borges, "Nuestro pobre individualismo," in Obras completas: Otras inquisiciones (1952; rpt.

Ernesto Sabato goes further and suggests that the new Latin American novel - la novela totalizadora which portrays, in addition to the external reality of nineteenth-century Realism, the internal and my- thical reality of the individual and his civilization - offers contemporary man a means of salvation by restoring to him his integral self. Sabato considers Latin America, or barbarie , to be the repository of the irrational, aesthetic, emotional female principle that was rejected by post-medieval Europe, or civilización, and whose resumption is required for the reintegra- tion of contemporary rational man with his emotional and spiritual self and with all creation : "La realidad está escindida en dos sectores por esta civilización racionalista Los demonios fueron espectacularmente echa- dos por la puerta, ya con la Ilustración y con el Iluminismo. (La palabra iluminismo, es bastante significativa.) Esos demonios, naturalmente, fueron recogidos por los países bárbaros y ahora entran por la ventana." 14 (Italics mine.) 14 Ernesto Sàbato, "Por una novela novelesca y metafísica," Mundo Nuevo (Paris), No. 5 (Nov. 1966), p. 20.</page></plain_text>
