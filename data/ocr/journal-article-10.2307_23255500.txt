The Theology of Reconstructionism There can be little doubt that wide sections of modern Jewry are engulfed by a deep spiritual crisis which is due to the conflict between traditional Judaism and the secular civilization of the age. On the American Jewish scene Reconstructionism represents the school of thought whose chief preoccupation has been the interpretation of the meaning of this conflict and that has devoted its intellectual ener gies almost exclusively to its resolution. The movement, led vigorously by its founder, Mordecai M. Kaplan,* has now achieved sufficient self-assurance to claim to offer "the only alternative to Orthodoxy and Secularism."' Is this claim justified? Does Reconstructionism indeed offer a " Dr. Mordecai M.

This study has been undertaken for the sole purpose of finding the answer to this question. We shall have to consider the main teachings of Reconstructionist religious philosophy and then inquire into their objective validity. Rejection of Supernaturalism — Transruituralism Reconstructionism links the cause of the spiritual crisis of our time to the supernatural element in traditional religion. The mod ern mind is unable to accept supernaturalism. As long as religion is associated with the supernatural, modern civilization will remain secular. According to Reconstructionist thought, supernaturalism is "gone with the wind" never to return again. If religion is to be saved at all, it will have to be "wedded to naturalism."2 Therein lies the solution to the problem. Reconstructionism undertakes the task of purifying Judaism from its admixture of supernaturalism. Occasionally the attempt is made to use the term "supernatural ism" in a specific way: as the belief that God may at will suspend the laws of nature in order to reward those whom He loves and punish those who have earned His wrath.3 However, it is obvious that the inherent logic of Reconstructionism does not allow it to stop at the negation of the supernatural in this limited sense only. The stumbling block is not just the concept of "God as miracle worker" or "as a reservoir of magic power to be tapped whenever they (the believers) are aware of their physical limitations."4 The idea of the supernatural as such is objectionable. According to Dr. Kaplan, modern science has invalidated "the distinction between natural and supernatural."5 For the Reconstructionist the idea of God as a transcendental, omnipotent, all-kind and all-wise Supreme Being that confronts the world and man as their Creator has no meaning. Modern man, so he maintains, is able to conceive the godhead only as immanent in the world; modern man is incapable of entering into relationship with the supernatural.6 His concern 2.

His goal is self-fulfillment, which may also be called, salvation — not, of course, in its traditional other-worldly meaning, but as this-world ly self-transcendence through the realization of man's inherent po tentialities. Religion must help man "to live and to get the most out of life." This it can do only if it teaches him "to identify as divine and holy whatever in human life or in the world about him enhances human life."7 The forces in us and around us which make "for health, happiness and progress"8 are the manifestations of the divine. The God idea may be seen as the sum total of the process which in man and in nature contribute to human salvation. Recon structionism asserts that this new concept may rightly be considered a re-interpretation of the traditional one, for it "can function in our day exactly as the belief in God has always functioned; it can function as an affirmation that life has value."9 At this point, however, the question might be asked: since the supernatural is rejected, what need is there for religion at all? In view of the fact that man's purpose in life is this-worldly self fulfillment, could he not strive for it without having to identify as divine those forces which assist him in his endeavor? Why should we not be satisfied with a purely secular form of self-realization? In answer to such and similar questions the concept of man's striv ing for salvation is elaborated. Man is inspired to transcend the inheritance of his evolutionary origin from the brute by certain ideals and values which are of the spirit. Even though they are not part of the world of objective facts, they are no less real than the world of the senses. However, naturalistic science cannot ac count for values and meanings. It is for this reason that "secularism is not enough."'0 Human salvation depends on the realization of man's ethical aspirations. As man yearns to transcend his "sub human tendencies," he is really raising himself above the dominion of the natural laws of the scientist. On account of that he is in need of "a transnatural religion." Transnaturalism is then the "al ternative" that Reconstructionism submits as the union between religion and scientific naturalism. 7. Ib. 8. Ib., p. 294. 9. Ib., p. 29. 10. J.W. Sn„ pp. 10, 111. 22</page><page sequence="4">Reconstructionist Theology Transnaturalism is denned as "that extension of naturalism which takes into account much that mechanistic or positivistic science is incapable of dealing with. Transnaturalism reaches out into the dominion where mind, personality, purpose, ideals, values and meanings dwell. It treats of the good and the true."11 The dis tinction between fact and value is, of course, a very old and valid one. Our question, however, has still not been answered. If one so pleases, one may call the reaching out into the realm of meanings and values by the term "transnaturalism." But why transnaturalist religion? What is gained by it? May this recognition of a realm of ends and purposes as an aspect of reality not be adequately ex pressed within the scope of some secular humanism or ethical cul ture movement? However, Reconstructionism avers that 'a godless humanism"12 is an inadequate interpretation of life, because "it fails to express and to foster the feeling that man's ethical aspira tions are part of a cosmic urge, by obeying which man makes him self at home in the universe."13 Man needs the awareness that something in the very nature of the universe answers to his desire for self-fulfillment. This applies not only to man's individual happi ness, but also to his endeavor for "maximum social cooperation," which is inseparable from salvation. It is maintained that "a reli gionless humanism fails to provide. ... a motive for 'dedication to mankind.' That motive can come only from seeing in mankind potentialities which are in rapport with the creative principle in the cosmos —with God."14 Without being able to see that his ef forts at self-realization are indeed in keeping with the inherent nature of reality, man could not maintain himself in defiance of the endless temptations, failures, and disappointments which for ever beset his path. Godhood as a Cosmic Process Reconstructionism does not find it difficult to show how "the inner drives of man" are a manifestation of cosmic reality. As is well known, man is not a self-sufficient being, independent of the 11. Ib., p. 10. 12. M. of G., p. 325. 13. Ib., p. 244-5. 14. J.W.

"Human nature is part of the larger world of nature."15 Whatever constitutes his being reflects powers outside him in the universe, the source whence he derives his existence. His very will for self-fulfillment is part of the cosmic will to live and is characteristic of all living things. Ethical inclinations and purposeful aspirations reveal aspects of reality because human na ture itself has its place in the universal scheme. We have to learn to view the drives and urges of man for self-transcendence "as no less an integral part of the cosmic structure of reality than the life-drive and the sex-drive.. ."'6 In the very choice of goals, as we strive for salvation, we are impelled by the cosmic powers that have formed us and that sustain us. These powers we identify as divine, because they alone make life meaningful and valuable. The divine reveals itself in us in our own urge for self-realization. The very purpose of speaking of God as "the Power that makes for salvation" is "to identify the particular human experiences which enable us to feel the impact of that process in the environment and in ourselves which impels us to grow physically, mentally, morally and spiritually. That process is godhood. It reveals itself in those particular experiences."17 Needless to say that if godhood is the cosmic process that impels man to grow, the "cosmic urges that are manifest in him also repre sent the will and the law of God for him. A deity that is immanent in nature and in man cannot communicate his will or law in a specific act of personal revelation." The law of God is revealed to man in man's "own best vision of his capacity for rendering service to the cause of humanity."18 It follows from the Reconstructionist premise that "we cannot see the will of God in any one specific code of laws. Only in the spiritual life of man as a whole, only in the complex of forces which impel man to think in terms of ideals and seek to implement their ideals through laws as well as through social institutions can we discover the will of God."19 This is a new interpretation of the old adage, vox papuli vox dei. From the Reconstructionist point of view one might say that while the Torah 15. Ib., p. 119. 16. Ib., p. 101-2. 17. Ib., p. 110. 18. M. of G., p. 118. 19. Ib., p. 160-1. 24</page><page sequence="6">Reconstructionist Theology is of course not min ha-shamayim, as tradition understands the term, all law that aims at cooperation represents a form of divine self-revelation, brought about through the instrumentality of man's "best vision." By relating man's higher aspirations to cosmic nature and bestowing the name of God on "the totality of all those forces in life that render human life worthwhile" religion becomes the source of values and meanings, whereas science "describes objective reality."20 It would of course matter little by what name we called the cosmic forces whose self-revelation we discern in man's idealistic impulses. Name-calling is often a mere game of semantics. The religious significance of identifying those forces as the process of godhood lies in the fact that by doing so we affirm our confidence in the validity of the meanings and purposes for which they are responsible. By recognizing godhood in everything that impels man "to grow," we express our confidence that indeed he will grow. The "process of godhood" assures the Reconstructionist of the pos sibility of the realization of man's yearning for salvation. He calls this process "God" because he defines the term as the Power, in herent in the universe, that — by the very fact of its activity in the human soul — "endorses what we believe ought to be and that endorses that it will be."21 The word "God" is for Reconstruction ism a symbol that expresses "the highest ideals for which men strive and, at the same time, points to the objective fact that the world is so constituted as to make for the realization of those ideals."22 This may be called the faith of Reconstructionism. To argue from man's position as part of nature for the recognition of the cosmic roots of his strivings is one thing; to conclude that, because of their being rooted in cosmic forces, they are bound to find fulfillment is quite another. It implies an act of faith in the cosmos. The Faith of Reconstructionism 20. J.W. Sn., pp. 48, 52. 21. M. o/ G., p. 323. 22. Ib., p. 295. Let us see what must be assumed in such an act of faith. Not only does the Reconstructionist believer reason from man, placed 25</page><page sequence="7">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought in the context of "a larger nature," to his relatedness to universal life, but he assumes — on account of this relatedness — a kind of "pre-established harmony" between his impulses and the cosmic urge. He must further assume some form of built-in harmony be tween the order of nature, as described by science, and the powers that are responsible for the human drives that manifest values and purposes. Unless the realm of nature and that of the spirit are coordinated, there can be little hope that the material condi tions in the universe will ever allow the realization of man's aspira tions. Reconstructionism is aware of what is implied in its belief in the possibilities of human salvation. It interprets faith in the sovereignty of God as "faith that in mankind there is manifest a power which, in full harmony with the nature of the physical universe, operates for the regeneration of human society."23 Under lying this assumption is the concept of unity among all the cosmic forces. Unless they are purposefully interrelated, no purpose can prosper in the universe. The cosmic drives, active in man and society, in nature as well as in the realm of the spirit, must be related to each other in an all-embracing universal harmony; other wise the fulfillment of man's striving for self-realization is left to mere chance. Only on the basis of a concept of universal oneness does it make sense to affirm that the world is so constituted that what the human mind recognizes as valuable will indeed come to be for the sole reason that it ought to be. Reconstructionism per ceives God "as the apotheosis of the interrelated unity of all reality; for it is only such unity that is compatible with life's worthwhile ness."24 Only by virtue of its purposefulness can life have meaning. No doubt, man does have some experience of life's unity. Per sonality itself may be looked upon as the result of a unifying process in the world. Man's own creative urge as well as his appreciation of value are manifestations of life's general trend towards unity. Meaning achieved in an act of creativity is always a deed of unifi cation. However, such experiences testify mainly to a tendency toward unity, to an effort in life "to achieve and express unity, harmony and integrity."25 There is, however, a long way from such tendencies to the affirmation of actual harmony between man 23. Ib., p. 110. 24. Ib., p. 226. 25. Ib., p. 167. 26</page><page sequence="8">Reconstructionist Theology and the universe, and among all the cosmic powers themselves. How is such affirmation justified? The father of Reconstructionism assures us repeatedly that the concept of "the interrelated unity of all reality," which alone "spells God" for him, is based on an intuition — on the intuition "that human life is supremely worth while and significant."26 The belief in God, accordingly, means to subscribe to "the certain assumption" that the nature of cosmic reality endorses and guarantees "the realization in man of that which is of greatest value to him." "It is an assumption that is not susceptible to proof," says Dr. Kaplan, but if we believe in it, we believe in God.27 Thus, the basic Reconstructionist concept of life's worthwhileness, which to affirm is "the function" of the idea of God, becomes a matter of intuitive assumption. This implies also that it cannot be "demonstrated" that self-fulfillment, the goal of Reconstructionist religion, will ever be attained. What alone may be said concerning it is that "faith must assume it as the objective of human behavior, if we are not to succumb to the cynical accept ance of evil, which is the only other alternative."28 One should, however, not be misled by this quotation into believing that the faith that is meant here is only the result of a tragic choice between itself and the despair of cynicism. Such a faith would indeed be nothing but a mere opiate. In one of the finest passages of Recon structionist literature, part of which has already been quoted in connection with Dr. Kaplan's rejection of secular humanism, one reads: "Without the emotional intuition of an inner harmony be tween human nature and universal nature, without the conviction, born of the heart rather than of the mind, that the world contains all that is necessary for human salvation, the assumptions necessary for ethical living remain cold hypothesis lacking all dynamic pow er It is only this emotional reaction to life that can make humanity itself mean more to us than 'the disease of the aggluti nated dust.' "29 Notwithstanding the recurring echo of the alterna tive of despair, there is no doubt that the intuition of Reconstruclion ist faith is presented as an actual experience of deep emotional intensity. 26.

Since the emergence of values and purposes in man and society are at tributed to the interrelated complex of helping cosmic powers which we identify as divine, shall we be justified in identifying evil in the world as the self-revelation of some diabolical cosmic forces that "unmake" man's striving for salvation and unity? In view of human experience with nature as well as in history, it would not seem to be an unwarranted conclusion. Shall we then assume a Manichean "universe" in which the two principles of good and evil are locked in struggle with each other? Reconstructionist thinking does not countenance such a solution. It does not agree to the spelling of the word evil as Evil. According to it, evil must not be granted status side by side with "the goodness of life which is its godliness." Evil does not exist in a positive way, so Reconstructionism avers. Evil is a mere negation, a chance, an accident. It is "inevitable only in the logical and passive sense that darkness is the inevitable concomitant of light." Evil is mere unshaped and unformed Tohu va-Vohu, that phase of the universe which has not yet been invaded by the creative energy, not yet conquered by will and intelligence, not yet completely penetrated by godhood. The creative energy, which is the element of godhood in the universe, is all the time at work, in man and in nature, forming cosmos out of chaos.30 Such an interpretation of evil must be paralleled by an appropri ate interpretation of life's worthwhileness. Life is worthwhile in spite of all that mars it. It is worthwhile not so much because of the actually realized good in it, but mainly owing "to the infinite potentialities that are still latent and that will in time come to fruition."31 Latent potentialities can, of course, never be demon strated. It is again a matter of intuitive faith, a knowledge of the heart rather than of the mind. Whatever the value of this interpretation of evil may be, it is obvious that the Reconstructionist credo has been badly jolted. Even if one is not prepared to grant evil positive status, the mere 30. Ib., pp. 64, 73, 76. 31. Ib., p. 272. 28</page><page sequence="10">Reconstructionist Theology existence of chaos beside the process of godhood necessitates a new definition of the concept of the deity. A god that, "like an artist" struggling with the passive resistance of a block of marble, step by step forms cosmos out of the meaninglessness of chaos is obviouly lacking the attributes of infinity or perfection. As long as there is evil, there is chaos; and chaos exists because godhood has "not yet penetrated it." But a deity that needs time to do his job is of necessity limited in his capacity. This, indeed, is recognized to be one of the consequences of the Reconstructionist position. The Reconstructionist interpretation of evil involves "a radical change in the traditional concept of God. It conflicts with that con ception of God as infinite and perfect in His omniscience and omnip otence."32 However, we are assured that there is really no need for such an idea of the godhead. A concept which symbolizes "the sum of the animating, organizing forces and relationships which are forever making a cosmos out of chaos" is quite sufficient. It is such a concept that the Reconstructionist has in mind when he speaks of "God as the creative life of the universe."33 This, of course, gives us an entirely new idea of the deity. As our awareness of the divine aspect of reality is derived from the meaningful and purposeful contents of the universe, divinity must manifest itself in the cosmos. The cosmos, however, is continually growing. As the cosmos expands so does develop with it its divine quality. We ought, therefore, to conclude: the more cosmos, the richer the potency of the creative life of the universe that is identi fied as God. We have actually netted a god that is neither perfect nor infinite; one that, though finite in his effectiveness, is infinite in possibilities of further development; one that grows more and more perfect as it forces cosmos upon the face of chaos. Enthusiasm For Living 32. lh„ p. 76. 33. lb. The extremely original idea of the Reconstructionist godhead illustrates dramatically how much the Reconstructionist intuition must accomplish in order to establish the worthwhileness of life. We see now that the belief in the unity of all reality, which alone could guarantee the realization of man's nobler aspirations, in 29</page><page sequence="11">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought volves belief in cosmic powers that are finite in potency as well as in wisdom. No one is,, of course, in a position to evaluate the vast ness of universal chaos as compared with the finite amount of cre ative life which at any moment may be immanent in the cosmos. Whether the potency of a finite godhead may not be after all ex hausted in its struggle with the passive resistance of the "Tohu and Bohu"; or whether the process of cosmic godhead may not occasion ally lead to a blunder of universal magnitude and thus allow chaos to regain its lost terrain — such questions receive no adequate at tention. Apparently, it is felt that the emotional reaction of faith in life is convincing enough to silence such problems. One of the strongest statements of Reconstructionist faith seems to be directed against such and similar carpings of the intellect. Toward the end of one of Dr. Kaplan's major works on Reconstructionist theology once again the question is asked: "Whence do we derive this faith in a Power that endorses what ought to be?" And the answer is given in the following words: "Not from that aspect of the mind which has to do only with mathematically and logically demon strated knowledge. Such faith stems from that aspect of the mind which finds expression in the enthusiasm for living, in the passion to surmount limitation The fact that many lack this enthusi asm does not invalidate the truth (of the faith), any more than the fact that it took the genius of an Einstein to discover the principle of relativity should lead us to cast a doubt upon its truth. This enthusiasm is man's will to live the maximum life. Just as the will to live testifies — in an intuitive not, a logical sense — to the reality of life, the will to live the maximum life testifies to the realizable character of such life."34 We must confess that we are not quite able to see how "the enthusiasm for living" may be considered an "expression" of an "aspect of the mind," since this enthusiasm is also equated with "man's will to live the maximum life." Be that as it may, the passage quoted indicates that "the enthusiasm for living" is the cornerstone of the Reconstructionist philosophy of religion. Without it there can be no faith in the power that endorses what ought to be and guarantees that it is also realizable. This enthusiasm must therefore be the source of the conviction, "born of the heart and not of the mind," of the harmony between individ ual strivings and cosmic urges, and finally, the origin of the intuition 34. Ib., p. 327. 30</page><page sequence="12">Reconstructionist Theology of the unity of all reality. As one realizes that the entire scheme of Reconstructionist salvation depends on "the enthusiasm for living," one can hardly suppress the thought that the far-reaching cosmic conclusions of the Reconstructionist heart represent no less a bold "leap of faith" than the boldest ever performed by Karl Barth and his disciples. At this point, one is induced to recall the way the founder and leader of Reconstructionism pokes fun at an author who has stated that a sense of sureness, "a sense of overmastering certainty which grips the spirit," is the characteristic mark of supernatural revela tion. After the summary dismissal of the illogicality of such notions, one was entitled to look forward to something more tangible than "emotional reaction," "intuitive affirmation," and "enthusiasm for living" to form the foundation of Reconstructionist religious faith. Should one, perhaps, use Dr. Kaplan's own words with which he contemptuously rejects the sense of sureness and overmastering certainty of supernatural revelation and say regarding the intuitive convictions of Reconstructionism that "one takes exception, as a modernist must, to the folly of making sureness a criterion of truth, since stupidity is almost invariably sure of its own wisdom?"35 We shall not follow Dr. Kaplan's example. We believe that a sense of sureness need not always be wrong, only because at times even fools seem to possess it; just as we hold quite confidently that the value of the most enthusiastic enthusiasm will not be proved by the argument that it took the genius of an Einstein to conceive the theory of relativity. Suffice it unto us to have traced the place of intuition and enthusiasm in the structure of Reconstructionist thought. In bringing to a conclusion this presentation of Reconstructionist theology, we may point out that its characteristic feature is a mood of optimism, of "trust in life and in man." The optimism is intuitively derived from "the quality of universal being," which is called divine and is identified with godhood. One may say that Recon structionist thought is a variation on the religious theme of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; it is a form of Natural Reli gion. The very title of Dr. Kaplan's latest work, Judaism Without Supernaturalism, reminds one of that classic of eighteenth century 35. Ib., pp. 12-13. 31</page><page sequence="13">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought deism, Christiantiy Not Mysterious, authored by John Toland and published in 1696. The "natural light" by which the deists were guided was, of course, reason, which possessed the dignity of logical necessity and universal validity. Reconstructionism, however, is familiar with the intellectual climate of the twentieth century. Its "natural light" is provided by the insights of experimental science and psychology. Reconstructionism is, therefore, guided by human experience, by aspirations, urges, yearnings, drives. Universality is acquired by granting these manifestations of human nature cosmic status as the expressions of a cosmic vitality. In such an atmosphere reliance on intuition and on an enthusiasm for living is, perhaps, understandable. At the same time, one is also reminded of certain specific forms of Natural Religion which were in the vogue in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In particular, one is induced to recall the English philosopher, Shaftesbury, who in his writings, published in 1711, placed at the center of his thought the principle of enthusiasm for life and living. He too derived the meaning and worthwhileness of life from a universal harmony. Not unlike Re constructionism, Shaftesbury too saw the meaning of religion in the enhancement of personality, which may be achieved because man knows himself at one with the interrelated unity of all reality. For Shaftesbury too the interrelated unity of reality is the divine aspect of reality. It follows logically from such a position that, like Dr. Kaplan, the Englishman too is compelled to deny the reality of evil. If evil existed positively and actively, and on the world-wide scale in which it does seem to exist from the point of view of common sense observation, what would become of the enthusiasm for living?! It should also be noted that in Reconstructionism we are con fronted with a form of pantheism. By identifying certain processes in man and the world as divine, we identify the divinity with the world and, indeed, with man. In a striking passage it is stated: " we must not identify the sovereignty of God with the expres sion of the will of a superhuman, immortal and infallible individual personality, but with that Power on which we rely for regeneration of society and which operates through individual human beings and social institutions."36 In untold other passages we are assured that God is a cosmic vitality, the creative urge in the universe; that 36. lh„ p. 110. 32</page><page sequence="14">Reconstructionist Theology man is in God and God is in man. Godhead is immanent in nature and in humanity; its sovereignty is exercised through man and society.37 We should then say that Transnaturalism, the religion of Recon structionism, is a pantheistic faith of optimism, conceived in a twentieth-century setting, in the traditions of eighteenth century Natural Religion. According to its own testimony, its reasoning is not conclusive; but it feels very strongly that its tenets are securely anchored in convictions "born of the heart rather than of the mind," in a number of intuitions, and — ultimately — in an enthusiasm for living. II. Criticism One should, perhaps, not attempt to reason with intuitions and enthusiasms. In themselves they are matters of purely personal con cern and those who say that they have them may well be trusted to speak the truth. However, transnaturalism is presented to us as a re-interpretation of Judaism and we are asked to accept it as "the only alternative to Orthodoxy and Secularism." For one who is not a Reconstructionist the way to take the Reconstructionist solution of our spiritual dilemma seriously is to investigate its philo sophical and theological validity. In this attempt we shall at first turn our attention to the self-consistency of Reconstructionist reli gious philosophy. We shall do this under three headings: the prob lem of evil, the problem of freedom, and the problem of unity. The Problem Of Evil The interpretation of evil as chaos and of good as the purposive urge that forms cosmos from chaos is a thought for which one is not prepared by the premises of Reconstructionism. Among these premises we find the idea that modern science, in revising our picture of the universe, has abolished the distinction between the natural and supernatural as well as the dichotomy between the phy sical and the metaphysical.' This would seem to be one of the main reasons why Reconstructionism is so impatient with the super 37. Cf. Ib., pp. 26, 113, 120, 161, 245, etc. etc. 1. M. of G., pp. 26, 88. 33</page><page sequence="15">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought natural in religion, which is —usually —so strongly supported by metaphysical speculations. Having thrown out the supernatural, Reconstructionism is forced to establish a new distinction, that be tween cosmos and chaos or, as one might also say, between nature and sub-nature. The relationship between the two is not altogether unlike that which — according to Reconstructionist interpretation — existed in traditional religions between the natural and super natural: cosmos forces its will and its intentions on chaos. There is, of course, a difference. Chaos is mere resistance, absence of mean ing. Its only weapon of self-defense against being penetrated by the cosmic urge is its inertia. Chaos can be overcome and con quered, but not so nature. Nature has laws and order; it has positive existence. But why should it not be mastered by a more powerful supernature? The answer is, of course, that supernature does not exist. No one has ever seen it. We know for a certainty that science has "invalidated the distinction between natural and supernatural." But does science approve of the distinction between natural and sub-natural? Has anyone ever encountered the "Tohu and Bohu" of Dr. Kaplan, the neutral, negative inertia of the unformed "re sistant?" What people know from actual experience, the only wit ness admitted in the Reconstructionist court, is evil and wicked ness, sorrow and suffering, failure and sin, prevalent in history and nature on a far more impressive scale than the goodness of life that, according to Reconstructionism, is godliness. It is possible to interpret evil as mere chaos, the mere absence of goodness; but to do so is good, old-fashioned metaphysics. The Reconstructionist distinction between chaos and cosmos, or — as we may say — be tween sub-nature and nature, is no less a metaphysical supposition than that between natural and supernatural. He who rejects the one cannot cling to the other. The idea itself that evil is a mere absence oi goodness "as dark ness is the inevitable concommitant of light" has, of course, a long and glorious history. It originated in neo-Platonism in the third century and ever since it has been made use of in numberless philosophical systems. (In the history of Jewish philosophy Saadia Gaon, in the tenth century, was its most distinguished spokesman.) But neo-Platonism is purest metaphysics. It denies the very existence of nature, in the sense in which Reconstructionism uses the term. According to Plotinus, there is only the One and everything else 34</page><page sequence="16">Reconstructionist Theology is emanation of its substance. In this context evil represents a log ical inconsistency. How can it exist, if everything is an emanation of the divine substance of the Infinite? And so its existence is denied. It is only in this way that the idea of evil as the mere absence of the good may be used and has been used. It is always the logical requirement of an originally purely metaphysical interpretation of reality. Only the power of metaphysical thought has ever dared to deny the reality of evil in defiance of overwhelming human ex perience. Such defiance, however, makes little sense, if one starts out with naturalism, as Reconstructionism does, and acknowledges experience, within the framework of nature, as the only arbiter of truth. In actual life we find some goodness and a great deal of disgustingly positive and sickeningly real evil. This is the material the Reconstructionist has with which to work and with it he has to justify his intuitive affirmation of the worthwhileness of life and his enthusiasm for living. He dare not deny experience, since his entire raison d'être is derived from experience. When ideas are made to serve in contexts tor which they were originally not intended, they often take revenge on their despoil ers by involving them in the most absurd illogicalities. The conse quences of the denial of the positive nature of evil are an interesting example in case. It is not easy to define exactly the area of the Reconstructionist "chaos." Fortunately, there are a few passages in the classical Reconstructionist writings which are quite explicit. We read, for instance, that earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, dev astating storms and floods, famines and plagues, noxious plants and animals "are simply that phase of the universe which has not yet been completely penetrated by godhood."2 In another context again we are told that the divine quality of life is not to be seen in tem pests, conflagrations and earthquakes, but "in 'the still small voice' in which the patiently creative and constructive forces of life find expression."3 These statements make it quite clear that if evil was denied positive status, it meant that the destructive powers in the universe were neutral towards concepts of value; they were mere resistance to, and not active opponents of, meaning. However, the intention was not to deny its status as nature. No doubt, Recon structionism cannot be blind to the fact that tempests and earth 2. Ib., p 76. 3. Ib., p. 137. 35</page><page sequence="17">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought quakes, obnoxious plants and animals, belong to the dominion of nature and are subject to its laws and orderliness no less than its more pleasing and constructive manifestations. From the scien tific point of view, the existence of toadstools, cobras, and man eating tigers is no less natural than that of strawberries, kittens, and babies. We now realize that the distinction between chaos and cosmos is not between sub-nature and nature, but between two manifestations of nature itself: nature that makes for human sur vival and salvation — we call it cosmos because it is penetrated by the purpose of the constructive life forces; and nature, as exem plified in tornadoes, cobras, and man-eating tigers, not so condu cive to human survival and salvation — we call it "Tohu and Bohu" because it has not yet been "conquered by will and intelligence." This is meant to be taken seriously. Not only do the two forms of nature follow logically from the Reconstructionist concepts of chaos and cosmos; we find the idea so stated explicitly. Recon structionism identifies "as divine the forces in the physical environ ment that make for physical survival and well being."4 This is clear enough. Forces in the physical environment that do not make for man's survival and well-being are not divine; they are not yet invaded by purpose; they are not of the cosmos, but of chaos. It is also emphasized that "the creative powers in the physical world" alone are the manifestations of godhood. Needless to say there are others too which are not creative and, therefore, not divine. But that which is not divine is not purposive, not directed toward a goal which is worthwhile — it is chaotic. Chaos too is nature, no less than cosmos. Chaos is the merciless order of casual connec tions, utterly indifferent to the outcome of its own processes; where as cosmos is the condition of the natural order, after having been compelled to admit purpose and meaning. The one is blind, the other, guided nature. It is, of course, unlikely that naturalism could consider such a distinction anything but mere foolishness. To us it would seem to be the most bizarre product of an extremely fertile metaphysical imagination or — shall we perhaps say? — intuition. The Problem Of Freedom 4. Ib., p. 269. The most serious objection to the distinction between chaos and 36</page><page sequence="18">Reconstructionist Theology cosmos, between the blind order of natural law and the one guided by purpose and plan, comes from another quarter. One of the premises of Reconstructionist thinking is that one "cannot believe that God performs miracles and at the same time believe in the uniformities of natural law demanded by scientific theory."5 The uniformities of natural law cannot be suspended or disturbed. However, one cannot help wondering what happens to these uniformities when "the creative urge" of the universe breaks into their domain with purpose and plan. What an infinite, omni potent God could not be believed to be capable of accomplishing is now assumed to be successfully performed by a creative impulse in the cosmos that, as we have seen, must be thought as finite and imperfect. It is true that the creative urge is conceived as being immanent in the world, whereas the omnipotent and omniscient Supreme Being is transcendental to it. In both cases, however, the problem is the same: How can the lawful orderliness of nature be made to obey a purposeful will without interfering with the "uniformities" of natural law? It makes no difference whether the purpose emanates from an immanent cosmic urge or a transcendental divine will; its origin in each case is seen in something that is external to the dominion of "the immutable laws of cause and effect." In each case we are confronted with the conflict between the order of nature, held together by the unbreakable bonds of its laws, and the order of the spirit guided by the chosen goals of an intelligent will. The order of nature is the realm of necessity; that of the spirit the realm of freedom. No matter how one imagines the power of the spirit, immanent or transcendent, the problem is unchanged: How can purpose, conceived and pursued in freedom, penetrate the unconquerable fortress of necessity? Reconstructionism fully appreciates the tact that the conquest of chaos by purposeful intelligence is an act of freedom. It is, however, doubtful that it realizes the magnitude of the problem of the possibility of freedom as it arises on the basis of its own naturalistic premises. We are assured that there is a principle of creativity in the universe. This principle is responsible for "the con tinuous emergence of aspects of life not prepared for or deter mined by the past." Needless to say that a principle that is active independently of what is prepared for or determined by the past 5. Ib., p. 20. 37</page><page sequence="19">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought is free from the iron yoke of the law of causality that dominates nature. It is a principle of cosmic freedom that is said "to constitute the most divine phase of reality."6 The same creative urge that is forming cosmos from chaos in the universe is also at work within man as he is struggling with the "Tohu and Bohu" within himself. The ethical life of man is itself a manifestation of creativity.7 In fact, in accordance with the Reconstructionist deduction of the divine from human experience, it is foremostly man's awareness of alternative courses of possible action, and his power to choose between them, that grant us the knowledge of a creative principle which is free from what has been "prepared for or determined by the past." It is because of this creative impulse, experienced by us, that we are entitled to speak of its cosmic correlate — sihce man himself is "part of a larger nature" — as the divine power that makes for freedom. The creative urge within man, which reflects cor responding cosmic powers, is the freedom that is "at the root of man's spiritual life, and is the prime condition of his self-fulfill ment, or salvation."8 This is nobly said. Undoubtedly, freedom is to the life of the spirit what air is to our bodily existence. The question, however, is, how is freedom possible in the context of a reality that is dominated by the determinism of irrepressible laws. Reconstructionism does make a number of bold affirmations in favor of freedom. The attitude of naturalistic determinism that "looks upon everything as the effect of everything else" is derided as an obsession.9 The idea that the realm of natural law is not amenable to the influence of freedom and responsibility is likened to "a resurgence" of the old belief in fate of Greek antiquity. Ac cording to such an idea the realm of nature is the modern concept of fate. This is said in the best tradition of A. N. Whitehead's Science in the Modern World. But how does Reconstructionism meet the power of the sinister empire of nature-fate? The most significant passage on this issue that we are able to discern runs as follows: "But no more fatal error can be committed than that of overlooking the element of personality. There is in every human being some thing irreducible which renders him a monad, a world in himself, 6. Ib., p. 62. 7. Ib., p. 282. 8. Ib., p. 270-1 9. Ib., p. 273. 38</page><page sequence="20">Reconstructionist Theology a microcosmos the individual is a center or reference, an end in himself and fully responsible for what he does with his life."10 This is indeed edifying. Unfortunately, one cannot solve the decisive problems of human existence by homiletics. Having started out with the premise of "the immutable laws of cause and effect," the Reconstructionist road points clearly to determinism and the denial of freedom. If Reconstructionism nevertheless wishes to affirm freedom, it must show how freedom and necessity may be accommodated in the same system. When Whitehead drew our attention to the idea that in modern thought the concept of the natural law has taken the place of the old Greek concept of fate, he also showed us how to cope with the resulting problem by giving us one of the imposing metaphysical systems in the history of philosophy. But he who, because of "the uniformities of natural law," rejects the belief that God may perform miracles, cannot logically assert the creative principle of freedom merely by affirm ing its existence very firmly. It is fine to hear that the human per sonality is a monad, a world in itself, a center of reference. How ever, we should like to know how this monad may be responsible for its life in the context of "the uniformities of natural law." Re constructionism overlooks the point that in relationship to the uni formities of nature every ethical deed is a deed of freedom, indeed, a miracle; and perhaps an even greater "miracle" than the suspen sion of a natural law by the intervention of the will of a Supreme Being. As already Kant has shown, freedom is transcendental to the order of nature." It is essentially supernatural. We may say then, that the Reconstructionist distinction between chaos and cos mos is not, as we first thought, a distinction between sub-nature and nature, nor one between two types of nature, as it appeared to us on second consideration; but the good old "dichotomy" be tween natural and supernatural, the rejection of which is one of the premises of Reconstructionism. We are led to the same conclusion about the implied super naturalism of Reconstructionist thought, if we consider that cosmos forming creative urge which is "the element of godhood in the 10.

It introduces mean ing and plan into the world. It is the divine process" which brings into being "personalities, men and women, with souls," lib erating them "from Tohu and Bohu, the void of meaninglessness and purposelessness."'3 As we have noted already, the Reconstruc tionist theologian prefers to talk of "the divine process," "the cre ative urge" which is godhood, of God as the power in the universe that makes for one thing or another, in order to emphasize that what he understands by the deity is not transcendentally apart from the world but immanent in reality as its "constructive" and meaningful aspect. It would seem to us that all this terminology is mere semantic juggling with words which have become empty because the ideas which they are supposed to convey are not prop erly understood. The founder of Reconstructionism does not realize that intelligence and will, purpose and plan, meaning and value, are not the manifestations of urges and processes, nor of impulsions or powers, however universal and cosmic they may be imagined to be. Intelligence and will are not conceivable without intellect and soul; purposes and plans are conceived by minds; and meaning and value are meaningless and valueless unless they are related to some individual being. Therefore, to speak of cosmic powers as being responsible for cosmic intelligence, will, and purpose im plies a cosmic intellect, a universal mind. Since such cosmic intel lect, according to the theory, faces chaos with the intention of pene trating it by the imposition of a purpose of its own, the cosmic intellect must be transcendental and prior to both chaos and cos mos. It is supernatural; and as a mind, associated with a will and purpose, it must be imagined in some terms of personal existence. Of "freedom and responsibility of which human nature is cap able" Reconstructionism maintains that they are the natural mani festation, on a self-conscious level, of the cosmic principle of polar ity; freedom standing for selfhood and responsibility, for coopera tion. However, neither selfhood nor cooperation have any meaning without selves.14 If freedom and responsibility should indeed be the manifestation of a cosmic principle, then it must be the prin 12. M. of G., p. 13. Ib., 281-2. 14. J.W. Sn„ p. 40</page><page sequence="22">Reconstructionist Theology ciple of cosmic selfhood cooperating with other selves; or —para phrasing what we heard Reconstructionism call the human per sonality — a cosmic monad or, perhaps, even Leibniz' "monad of monads." No doubt this would still not be the God of traditional religion. Reconstructionism's "divine aspect of reality," which we have now unmasked as a cosmic personality is, as we recall, neither infinite nor perfect. We may, therefore, say that implied in the Reconstructionist concept of godhood is a finite, Platonic demiurge, which is apart from the cosmos it forms. We have landed again in supernaturalism, so much despised by the Reconstructionist. In order to avoid a possible misunderstanding, we shall take another glance at the statement that freedom and responsibility "are the natural manifestation, on a self-conscious level," of a cos mic principle. The phrase, "natural manifestation on a self-con scious level" suggests ideas borrowed from the evolutionary theory of ethics. Evolutionists speak of levels of evolution, among which self-consciousness is the latest and highest; They would see in free dom and responsibility the manifestation of evolutionary progress on the level of self-consciousness. However, no evolutionist of rank will today look for correlates to human freedom and responsibility in the cosmos. He knows that in order to do so he would have to assume one of two alternatives. Either the cosmic correlate pro duces all the levels of evolutionary development, including con sciousness, freedom, responsibility, and purpose, by consciously di rected activity, or else by some unselfconscious, pruposeful drive. In either case one would have to conclude that all ethical values are latently present in the evolving cosmic powers just as all the qualities of a plant are dormant in the seed. If ethical values are evolved by some conscious cosmic power, they must be forever present in a transcendental cosmic mind. If, on the other hand, they are brought into being by some unselfconscious cosmic drive from a condition of immanent possibility into a state of actuality, one would still have to posit the potentiality of the ethical life in the cosmos as "pre-formed" by a transcendental cosmic conscious ness. This was indeed the meaning of evolution in the pre-Darwin ian days. Evolution was seen as the unfolding of latent possibilities, which were originally planted in the cosmos by the Creator. This position has been abandoned by the post-Darwinian evolu tionary theory, especially by its latest representatives. From the 41</page><page sequence="23">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought scientific point of view, the evolution of latent possibilities which are inherently present in the universe is mere metaphysical specu lation with suspiciously theological implications. Modern evolu tionary theory, even though it recognizes the evolutionary validity of ethical concepts, will not acknowledge any cosmic correlates to ethical values, no "powers that make for freedom and human sal vation." The evolutionary principle is able to explain the rise of ethics by means of adaptive functions which work automatically within the context of causation. As one of its ablest present-day representatives writes: ".... We have the glorious paradox that this purposeless mechanism (of evolution), after a thousand million years of its blind and automatic operations, has finally generated purpose — as one of the attributes of our own species."15 All the Reconstruction^ affirmations of a universal urge that forms cosmos from chaos with will and intelligence are a relapse into pre-Darwinian concepts of a metaphysical evolutionary the ory. One might, however, say in defense of Reconstructionism that it does not understand the supernaturalist implications of such metaphysics In order to save its affirmation of the harmony be tween individual strivings and cosmic urges, Reconstructionism may attempt to take refuge in some mysterious élan vital or evo lution créatrice. If so, Reconstructionist teachers will be well ad vised to make peace with some metaphysical and supernaturalist philosophy, for neither of these Bergsonian principles have any status outside metaphysics and the supernatural. Freedom and Reconstructionist Pantheism As freedom and responsibility, purpose and plan, related to a cosmic canvas, lead back into entanglements with the metaphysical and the supernatural, so does Reconstructionist pantheistic imma nence, in its turn, undermine the foundations of all purposeful human endeavor undertaken in a spirit of responsibility and as an act of free commitment to a worthwhile goal. We have noted that Reconstructionism regards the powers which within man make for ethical action as the extension of cosmic reality. From this point of view, the ethical life of man is intensely impulsive. We heard it 15. Evolution and Ethics, 1893-1943, by T. H. Huxley and Julian Huxley, (London, 1947) p. 175. 42</page><page sequence="24">Reconstructionist Theology described as "no less integral a part of the cosmic structure of reality than the life-drive and sex-drive."'6 Wisdom, cooperation, and creativity are presented as the natural offsprings of universal urges. They "too are hungers" which are "irrepressible until they are satisfied." The idea of right is really "a form of might, an over powering impulse" to do the right. Man's ethical aspirations are viewed as "part of a cosmic urge." Social ethics must conform to "certain fundamental laws that are as intrinsic to human nature as the law of gravitation is to matter."17 The entire ethical life of man is thus conceived in terms of urges and drives, impulsions and compulsions, which on the level of self consciousness reflect corresponding cosmic activities. This, of course, is inherent in the logic of Reconstructionism. No Recon structionist ever encountered cosmic powers which make for life's worthwhileness. His experience is only with the worthwhileness of individual lives. The ethical aspirations of man might be sufficient material to base on them a religionless humanism; they were, how ever, turned into the foundations of transnaturalist religion by look ing on them as manifestations of cosmic powers, representing the divine aspect of universal reality. We saw how this was accom plished. It is, therefore, necessary for Reconstructionism to interpret man's ethical life as rooted in drives, urges, irresistible impulses, and hungers which give man no rest until they are satisfied. It is an almost biologically determined ethics. Unfortunately, ethical drives built into the cosmic structure are the blight to all personal ethics. The ethical deed is the fruit of freedom. Actions that are prompted by irrepressible impulses and hungers which cannot be denied are not performed in free commitment to an ideal. The teachers of the Talmud were bold enough to state that "everything is in the power of Heaven except the fear of Heaven."18 The closer the bond between man's ethical aspirations and the cosmic powers in which they originate, and which become manifest in them, the less free the human deed which results from such aspirations; and the less free the deed, the less ethical will it be adjudged. Yet, Reconstructionism cannot sever the bond and dissolve the identi fication. For unless we see the ethical strivings of man as the ac 16. See above I, Note 16. 17. J.W.

Reconstructionism is faced here with a dilemma. Either freedom is taken seriously as being at "the root of man's spiritual life,"19 in which case his ethical striv ings are not the manifestations of the activity of any cosmic powers and Reconstructionism cannot identify the divine aspect of reality; or else, the strivings are the activity of the cosmic process of god hood in man, then freedom has become an empty phrase, and ethics a nobler aspect of biology. Reconstructionism does not seem to be aware of the problem and affirms enthusiastically both freedom and the immanent ethics of a cosmic mechanism which works with the forcefulness of hungers and other natural drives for the realization of the good. It would seem that whenever man performs an ethical deed, he acts in freedom as well as under the pressure of some cosmic compulsion. He himself desires this-worldly salvation and sets his goal accord ingly, "but neither the quest for salvation nor the choice of goods is entirely man-determined."20 As we have already learned, "human nature is a part of the larger world of nature " Such ideas render the extent of personal responsibility extremely vague. Ob viously, man cannot be made responsible for what is not "man determined" within him but is the action of a cosmic urge through him. If as "moral agents we are inwardly impelled to consider the consequences from the standpoint of their destroying or enhancing the value of life," it will be difficult to censor an agent who does not act morally. The very fact that he does not consider conse quences may be an indication that he is not sufficiently impelled by the powers that make for responsible behavior. His very action proves that "the consciousness of the power and the responsibility to choose the right in the face of temptation"21 were not really "irrepressible" within him, as they were supposed to be according to the Reconstructionist affirmation. The nature of the problem may perhaps be best illustrated by the Reconstructionist re-interpretation of the concept of sin. Man's failure to live up to the best that is in him is sin because "it means 19. M. of G., p. 270-1. 20. J.W. Sn., p. 119. 21. M. of G., p. 173. 44</page><page sequence="26">Reconstructionist Theology that our souls are not attuned to the divine, that we have betrayed God." The best that is in man is the divine in him, the function of cosmic forces in the soul of man. We "identify" it as God because it is identical with "that aspect of reality which confers meaning and value on life and elicits from us those ideals that determine the course of human progress."22 If this is indeed true, one cannot help wondering how it is possible ever to know that a person has failed to live up to the best that is in him. Whenever a person does not come up to our expectations, may it not be due to the fact that what we consider the best in man has not been "elicited" in this man with sufficient forcefulness so as not to let him fail? Instead of accusing him of "betraying God," may it not be that the poor soul was let down by "the divine aspect of reality," a supposition all the more within the realm of possibility since the Reconstruc tionist process of godhood is itself finite and imperfect? In vain is it maintained that the fact that the same man often does not fail proves that he is responsible for his failures. Since "the best in man" is due to the activity of cosmic powers, the extent of their presence and effectiveness may only be gauged by the strength of the ideals that they "elicit." Occasional successes and repeated failures will allow us the one conclusion that the cosmic forces which make for salvation are indeed extremely limited and not very consistent. Such a conclusion would not be unjustified, espe cially if one recalls that the creative powers are all the time locked in struggle in every human being, no less than in the universe, with the resistance of the chaos that "invades his soul." Every failure may be due to the finitude of the creative urge that, momentarily, may be lacking in power or wisdom to overcome the "Tohu and Bohu" which is "not of man but in man." It is a mere running around in a circle to say that our task is to cultivate the sense of responsibility and "not one of calling into being something that does not exist."23 Every task is a respon sibility. The responsibility of cultivating a sense of responsibility is itself part of our sense of responsibility. Since, however, respon sibility is among those "certain fundamental laws that are as in trinsic to human nature as the law of gravitation is to matter," the fundamental law of cultivating the sense of responsibility will 22. Ib., p. 165. 23. Ib., p. 177. 45</page><page sequence="27">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought either function, as any decent law should, or it will not function. No matter what happens, it will have as much bearing on ethics as has the law of gravitation. The issue at hand may also be stated by saying that Reconstruct ionism became entangled with the implications of the pantheistic element of its teachings. Every form of pantheism is destructive of individuality. Individuality is a mere sham or shadow, as in Hin duism, or a mode of the infinite substance, as for instance in Spin ozism. In either case, it has no reality or value of its own. Pantheism is inherently deterministic. There is no "Ought", only an "Is." All reality is a manifestation of divine nature, which is what it is of intrinsic necessity and could not be anything else. From this point of view, freedom is a mere illusion as is also all personal ethics. Notwithstanding the title of his chef cL'oevre, i.e., Ethics, Spinoza had to regard human actions and desires "exactly" as if he were dealing "with lines, planes, and bodies."24 Such is the inescapable logic of pantheism. Human aspirations and actions are "part of the larger world of nature." They are manifestations of cosmic reality which cannot be affected by the illusions of the sham that we like to call personality. Since there is neither freedom nor personal existence in reality, good and evil "indicate nothing positive in things considered in themselves."25 All these implications of pan theism also apply to Reconstructionism. If God is in man and man is in God, the human personality cannot be an irreducible monad, a world in itself, an independent center of reference, as Recon structionism also teaches. If human strivings are the "revelation" in man of the activities of cosmic urges, if they reflect the cosmic structure of reality, if they are irrepressible hungers, impulses, and fundamental laws, as Reconstructionism has to assert, freedom can not be "at the root of the soul," which Reconstructionism also af firms, so that it may make room for ethics within the scope of its world view. Reconstructionism is not aware of its inconsistencies. It has no appreciation of the logical implications of its own position. The Problem of Unity 24. Spinoza, Ethics, III, Pref. 25. Ib., IV, Pref. We have discussed above the problem or the possibility or tree 46</page><page sequence="28">Reconstructionist Theology dorn in a world which is ruled, according to the premise, by the flawless "uniformities" of the causal nexus in nature. The problem is greatly aggravated by the assumption that freedom is not only possible but that its aspirations will ultimately be realized. We have heard the Ami Maamin of Reconstructionism that the world is so constituted that its "divine aspect" not only endorses what ought to be, but also guarantees that what ought to be will indeed be realized. We noted that such a belief implies a strong faith in a universal harmony between the order of physical nature and the realm of values and ideals. It is the idea of the "interrelated unity of all reality," which we had occasion to analyze earlier in our presentation. Without such universal harmony, man's striving for self-fulfillment or salvation would be a hopeless undertaking. It would seem, then, that not only does Reconstructionism affirm a faith that freedom is possible, notwithstanding the uniformities of natural law, but that freedom and necessity are in harmony with each other; that physical nature and the moral order are somehow attuned to each other; that they represent the "interrelated unity of all reality." Judged by the premises of Reconstructionism, such an affirmation — with all due respect to the "heart of which it is born" — sounds rather fantastic. From all our experience we know that the laws of nature are indifferent to the considerations of right and wrong, that the causal nexus is the deadly enemy of freedom and teleological guidance. This indeed is the Reconstructionist position on naturalism. Ideals and values are recognized to point to a phase of reality of which "natural law does not take account." How then, is it possible to con ceive of the natural and the moral order as being in harmony with each other? According to Hermann Cohen, the agreement between the causal order of nature and the teleological nature of ethics is das Urproblem, the fundamental problem of all systematic philosophy.26 Spinoza, having identified nature with God, had to eliminate the concept of freedom and purpose from his system and to reduce the distinction between good and evil to a mere subjective illusion. Fichte, on the other hand, who saw God in an active moral order, beheld the universe exclusively as the manifestation of that order. Kant was the outstanding personality in the history of philosophy who made it his major task to reconcile the order of nature with that of ethics. He was struggling with the problem in his three 26. Cf. Die Religion der Vernunft etc., p. 484. 47</page><page sequence="29">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought Critiques. His philosophy of practical reason demanded that what ought to be may be possible of realization, or else human salvation was inconceivable. It is a concept which is often used by Reconstructionism itself. As long as the order of nature and the realm of ethics remain alien to each other, such a concept will make no sense. Kant, of course, realized that the principle of their harmonization or unity could not be found in either of them but had to be sought outside them. In this manner he was led to the major "postulate of practical reason," the existence of an omni potent, omniscient, and perfect Being, who alone — as the Supreme Lord of the universe —would have the power to make the uni formities of the causal order submit to guidance by the purposeful ness of the "categorical imperative." The need for the "practical postulate" of a Supreme Being, transcendental to both the order of nature and that of ethics, is all the more significant, since Kant himself insists that "theoretical reason" is unable to prove the exist ence of God and can acknowledge the idea only as a "regulative principle" of reasoning.27 Reconstructionism, of course, need not accept either Spinoza's or Fichte's or Kant's solution of the problem. However, it must offer some solution if it desires to be taken seriously. It is not enough to affirm intuitively that the realm of causal necessity is in harmony with purposeful ethical aspirations. On the basis of the Reconstructionist premise of identifying godhood with cosmic processes, the affirmation contains a logical contradiction. In one important passage the founder ot Keconstructionism quotes Thomas H. Huxley as having said: "Ethical nature may count upon having to reckon with a tenacious and powerful enemy as long as the world lasts." The quotation is taken from Huxley's famous Romanes Lecture of 1893. One might say that in it the speaker was discussing the Kantian problem of the discrepancy between natural and moral order from the point of view of the evolutionary naturalist. Huxley's conclusions, right or wrong, de serve serious treatment. Not so, however, in the opinion of Dr. Kaplan. Having practically stumbled on the problem, he orders it 27. See the discussion of this subject by W. R. Sorley in his Gifford Lectures. Moral Values and the Idea of God, p. 387; cf. also the position of Hermann Cohen in his Ethik des reinen Willens and Der Begriff der Religion im System der Philosophie. 48</page><page sequence="30">Reconstructionist Theology out of court by one of his many edifying affirmations. After berating one of the fathers of evolutionary theory for treating cosmic nature as if it were "a new name for the old Satan," he continues: "In reality, however, it is incorrect to assume that cosmic nature is 'red in tooth and claw,' and that the ethical strivings of men lie outside nature and constitute as it were a world by themselves. If there is any metaphysical significance to the doctrine of the unity of God, it is that the ethical and spiritual strivings should be con sidered as belonging to the same cosmos as the one in which there is so much that is evil and destructive of the good."28 These are noble words which, however, Reconstructionism is not entitled to use. Reconstructionism has no right to take recourse to the doctrine of the unity of God in order to prove the unity of the cosmos. Only the supernaturalist can do that. For him, God is the Supreme Being that transcends the world, confronting it as its Creator and Sov ereign. Indeed, the significance of such a doctrine of the unity of God has always been that from it followed the unity of all created reality. The world is one as the creation of the One God. With such a faith, the supernaturalist may confront all the disharmony in the cosmos. But the Reconstructionist rejects the concept of the One God, the Creator of the universe. For him, God is an immanent aspect of reality; it is identical with the cosmic processes them selves. As we have seen, the Reconstructionist recognizes the "in terrelated unity of all reality" as "the divine aspect of reality" or, as we have also heard it put, godhood is "the sum of the animating, organizing forces and relationships which are forever making a cosmos out of chaos." The Reconstructionist cannot, therefore, argue from "the doctrine of the unity of God" in order to prove the unity of reality. He has to move in the opposite direction. He can only affirm the unity of God by establishing first the "interrelated unity of all reality." Dr. Kaplan's argument runs in a circle. First it affirms intuitively the unity of all reality. Identifying, then, such unity with the "divine aspect of reality," it concludes from the affirmation the unity of God. When, now, anyone should point to the wide areas of disharmony in reality, the answer is given rather indig nantly: "But you are wrong! Haven't we proved the unity of God? Everyone knows that the unity of God signifies the interrelated unity of all reality." Since, however, on the Reconstructionist assumption 28. M. of G., p. 75. 49</page><page sequence="31">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought the immanent godhood of the world is 'identified as the inter related unity of all reality," Dr. Kaplan has logically proved only that the intuition of the interrelated unity of all reality signifies the interrelated unity of all reality. The truth is that relying completely on naturalistic experience, as Reconstructionism does, one has no possibility of discovering the unity of all reality. In experience we encounter multiplicity, diversity, and disharmony. There are small areas in which a unify ing tendency may perhaps be discerned, as there are others of chaos and conflict. We are aware of ethical strivings in man and we also know of nature "red in tooth and claw." If they belong to the one cosmos, even though their respective orders of freedom and necessity are exclusive of each other, who dare affirm it on the basis of naturalism?! The very idea of a cosmos is a metaphysical concept. It is either the fruit of a monistic and deterministic pan theism or of a supernatural ethical monotheism. The logic of the Reconstructionist position, however, leads to a modern polytheism. The polytheist of old, too, was an empiricist. He observed and encountered the plurality of powers in nature and in himself. By personifying these powers, he came to know them as gods. Recon structionism too starts out with man's naturalistic experience of strivings, drives, impulsions, within himself and in society. In trying to understand them, it searches for their "cosmic correlates." The Reconstructionist is, of course, not a primitive polytheist; his feet are firmly planted in the world of modern science. He does not "personify" these powers; he identifies them as divine. Since, how ever, the interrelated unity of all reality is unsupported by natural istic experience, the Reconstructionist is left with a plurality of powers that, if not gods, ought to be properly referred to as processes of godhood and divine — and occasionally with greater justifica tion, chaotic — aspects of reality. "Process of godhood" and "di vine aspect of reality," in the singular, have no logical justification in the Reconstructionist context. The attempt to re-interpret Judaism comes to griet on the failure of Reconstructionism to establish meaningfully the unity of reality. Reconstructionism maintains that only by "dissociating Jewish re ligion from supernaturalism can the universal significance of its ideals and values be made apparent and the Jewish contribution to the world order take effect."29 It is exactly such dissociation 29. J.W. Sn„ p. 77. 50</page><page sequence="32">Reconstructionist Theology which cannot be brought about. Jewish universalism is essentially anchored in the supernaturalist concept of the unity of God. As has been made clear by Hermann Cohen in his Die Religion der Vernunft— "The Religion of Reason" —the world of experience is not one. The idea of the One God constitutes the world as a unity, a universe. And what is true of the world is even more so of human beings. In actual experience we find only tribes, races, and nations. The very concept of the unity of the human race, the idea of mankind, has its origin in ethical monotheism. The concept of the One God, the originator of the one universe as well as the source of the moral law, alone makes known to us the multitude of people as the brotherhood of men.30 We can do no better than to quote the observations of Max Scheler on the same subject. In his work, Vom Ewigen im Menschen, he writes: Actually as well as logically it is correct to say that the assumption ot the unity of the world is only to be derived irom the assumption of an only God its Creator The world is world (and not chaos) and only one world, when, and because, it is God's world — when, and because, the same infinite spirit and will is powerfully active in all Being. Just as the unity of human nature is ultimately not based on the proven natural characteristic of man, but on the image of God which he shows; and just as mankind as a whole is mankind when all individuals and all groups are united with each other, legally as well as morally, by means of their bond with God, so is the world one world only because of the unity of God."31 The Rabbis in the Talmud were expressing the same thoughts in the Midrashic style when they remarked: "Why was man created alone?" (Or, as we may paraphrase the question: Why does, ac cording to the Torah, only one Adam stand at the beginning of human history?) And the answer is given: "So that no man may say to his fellow: My father was greater than your father (and therefore, being of nobler descent, I am superior to you)."32 The equality of the human race is established by its issuance from the one act of creation by the One God. In vain does Reconstructionism declare that it is "one ot the main functions of religion in the modern world to curb aggressive nationalism, by insistence on the essential unity of human soci 30. H. Cohen, Die Religion der Vernunft etc., pp. 278, 471, 517. 31. P. 107-8 of the IV. ed. 32. Sanhédrin 38a. 51</page><page sequence="33">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought ety."33 Aggressive nationalism is certainly bad and Reconstruction ism is always well-meaning. However, having rejected the traditional concept of God as the transcendental Supreme Being and Creator, Reconstructionism has failed to provide a valid foundation for the essential unity of human society. Such essential unity has never been a matter of experience. On the contrary, the whole of history testifies to the actual inequality of men and the disunity of the human race. To quote a Reconstructionist text, "mankind is not all of one piece. It is divided among peoples, communities and families."34 In this respect too the implied logic of the Reconstructionist position is a modern version of the old polytheistic one. Neither the concept of one humanity nor the ideal of equality could emerge in a poly theistic world in which people and nations claimed their descent from the various gods. Mankind was as much divided as its gods were many. The gods, have, of course, departed; the division and the disunity have remained. The Reconstructionist is confronted with a multiplicity of races which he explains as having developed from an animal ancestry as a result of the activity of "cosmic pow ers." Search as one may, one will not find unity and equality on such a basis. The different races may indeed represent different evolution ary trends. The Cro-Magnards and Grimaldis, as well as their latter day children, may be the offsprings of cosmic forces acting in a pluralistic world. The actually experienced inequality of men may logically reflect the nature of a multiple cosmic reality. Any other conclusion is not justified on the basis of the Reconstructionist world view. The attempt of Reconstructionism to re-interpret Judaism by dissociating the universal significance of Jewish ideals from their source in the One God, the Creator, must be considered a complete failure. Having rejected Jewish monotheism, Reconstructionism has not provided a convincing foundation for Jewish universalism. It does not understand the age-old truth, which represents "the Jewish contribution to the world order," that before one may speak of the brotherhood of man one must acknowledge the fatherhood of God. Without it, all ethics is mere utilitarianism and politics. III. Evaluation Having analyzed the logical implications of the main concepts or 33. J.W. Sn„ p. 221. 34. Ib., p. 120. 52</page><page sequence="34">Reconstructionist Theology Reconstructionist theology and religion from the angle of their own consistency, we shall now attempt to oifer a general evaluation of both Reconstructionist transnaturalism and its starting point in what Reconstructionism considers present-day naturalism. From the Ego to the Cosmos The method of transnaturalism is, as we saw, a simple one. We know of the existence of personality, of human ideals and ethical strivings. They are no less real than the material aspects of life, yet naturalism cannot account for them. Transnaturalism is able to ex plain them by viewing them as the manifestations of cosmic powers that are responsible for their existence. These powers are identified as "the divine aspect of reality," since they tend to render human life worthwhile. It is the function of the idea of God to assure the worthwhileness of human existence. From the striving of man for self-transcendence transnaturalism concludes not only the existence of certain cosmic powers but also the nature of cosmic reality, which is seen to be such as to guarantee the ultimate fulfillment of man's aspirations. It would seem to us that, notwithstanding the fact that man is seen as "part of a larger nature," any conclusions drawn from his own aspirations for self-fulfillment or salvation to the nature of cos mic reality is not logic but a form of megalomania. A contemporary astro-physicist, in trying to convey an idea of the proportion which exists between our earth and the rest of the universe, uses the follow ing comparison. If the major railway terminal of a large metropolis represented the size of the cosmos, then one particle of dust floating around in its atmosphere would represent the earth. In relationship to the world man is the inhabitant of such a particle of cosmic dust. What conclusions may be drawn from his aspirations to the structure of reality? The founder of Reconstructionism does attempt to an swer this question in a very few words: "But does not the very abil ity to think in cosmic terms render physical measurements and pro portions irrelevant? We cannot agree that he has met the objection. Though the idea was already voiced by Saadia Gaon, and, in addition, has also a Kantian ring about it, we do not know what is meant by "the ability to think in cosmic terms." Man, we would say, is able to think only in human terms; in terms of the human 1. M. of G., p. 176. 53</page><page sequence="35">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Jexoish Thought intellect he is even able to think of cosmic extension and structure. Be that as it may, we are in hearty agreement with the insight that physical measurements and proportions are irrelevant. Value and meaning of the smallest order are superior to mere physical bigness of the largest size. Mere physical bigness is nonsensical. All this is, however, beside the point. The objection that Reconstructionism has to meet, but does not, is as follows: Is the universe empty of meaning and does its vastness, surpassing all human imagination, represent nothing but bigness? — then the little sense and purpose which are noticeable in the human inhabitant of the particle of cosmic dust, our earth, is indeed the greatest conceivable miracle. However, it would be a miracle illogically set in an ocean of cosmic meaningless ness, completely out of harmony with the structure of reality. Or else, beside its physical brilliance, the universe does incorporate sig nificance in true cosmic terms, then all conclusions from the nature of human strivings as to how reality is constituted are bound to be fallacious. It is of little use to say, as if anticipating such objection: "We do not need to pretend to any knowledge of the ultimate purpose of the universe as a whole But it is an undeniable ract that there is something in the nature of life which expresses itself in human personality, which evokes ideals, which sends men on the quest of personal and social salvation."2 As so much of Reconstructionist rea soning, this is begging the question. For the question is: what is the status of this "something in the nature of life" in the context of cosmic reality? May it not be that this something is a cosmic flaw, that from the point of view of the structure of all reality "the evoking of ideals which send men on the quest of personal and social salvation" was a regretable oversight? Personal and social salvation are of great human importance. Reconstructionism, however, has not proved that there exists a correlate to them in the nature of reality which has positive significance in terms of that reality. Reconstructionism regards life as the supreme value: for "if lite itself is worthless, no object on earth can have any value."3 This would not be illogical, if the meaning of it were that life had su preme value for most men. Unfortunately, what is meant is "the life of the universe of which our lives are but a part." The supreme value 2. Ib., p. 89. 3. Ib., p. 83. 54</page><page sequence="36">Reconstructionist Theology is supposed to be objective, cosmic value, "from which all others are derived." Since our lives "are but part of universal life," Recon structionism expects human life "to yield cosmic meaning." To speak of the life of the universe and human life as if both belong in the same category and were one and the same phenomenon is not justi fied. On the contrary, all our scientific knowledge suggests that life, as we know it on this globe, is completely out of step with the life of the universe. The Second Law of Thermodynamics is one of the concepts of science in which the human mind has revealed its ability "to think in cosmic terms." According to it, the life of the universe consists in an irreversible process of cosmic dying. Like a wound-up clock, the universe is "running down" by the inevitable increase of Entropy. Evolution, which — scientifically speaking — is respon sible for life on earth, is a process running in the opposite direction. Entropy implies, as it were, the continuous degradation of the uni verse from higher forms of organization to lower ones, until — by the equal distribution of heat — all activity is brought to a standstill and universal rigor mortis ensues. Evolution, on the other hand, works from lower forms of organization to higher ones; from death to life, as it were. We are certainly not competent to pass judgment on the significance of the relationship between global evolution and the universal law of Entropy. From the writings of scientists, how ever, one is able to gather that, in cosmic terms, life as we know it is an insignificant side-show, enacted in a tiny corner of the universe. It was rendered possible, so it would appear, by the mere accidental coincidence of a certain state of Entropy in the universe and the mechanically determined, no less accidental, conditions on that cos mic particle of dust, our earth.4 One of the great astro-physicists of this century, Sir Arthur S. Eddington, has occasion to describe the rise of human life in the following manner: "Nature seems to have been intent on a vast evolution of fiery worlds.. .As for Man — it seems unfair to be always raking up against Nature her one little inadvertence. By a trifling hitch of machinery — not of any serious consequence in the development of the universe — some lumps of matter of the wrong size have occasionally been formed. These lack the purifying protection of intense heat or the equally efficacious ab solute cold of space. Man is one of the gruesome results of this 4. Cf. the discussion of the subject by Joseph Needham in his TIME The Refreshing River; The chapter, Evolution and Thermodynamics. 55</page><page sequence="37">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought occasional failure of antiseptic precautions."5 This is how man looks when considered in cosmic terms. It is foolish to draw any conclusions from his own strivings as to the structure of cosmic reality. Notwithstanding the fact that human nature is part of a larger nature, it is preposterous to discern in human nature a manifestation of the structure of cosmic reality. Reconstructionist religion is far from being "the triumphant exorcism of Bertrand Russell's dismal credo 'Brief and powerless is man's life. On him and all his race the slow sine doom falls pitiless and dark,' " as it maintains.6 However dismal, from the scientific point of view, Russell's credo makes more sense than Reconstructionist transnatur alism. We agree that the idea of God implies "the absolute negation and antithesis of all evaluations of human life which assume that consciousness is a disease, civilization a transient sickness, and all our efforts to life ourselves above the brute only a vain pretense."7 The traditional Jewish belief in God does mean all that, but not the Reconstructionist "intuition of God." We are familiar with this intuition by now. It begins with our experience of human strivings for self-fulfillment and ends with "the assumption" of a cosmic re ality so "constituted as to endorse them and to guarantee their reali zation." The Reconstructionist intuition of God is the conclusion from man to the structure of reality which is identified as divine. The intuition has as much significance as the conclusion makes sense. Man cannot derive status from his position in the cosmos, but from his relationship to the Lord of the cosmos. The idea was poetically expressed by the Psalmist, when he exclaimed: When I behold Thy heavens, the work of Thy nngers, The morn and the stars, which Thou hast established; What is man, that Thou art mindful of him? And the son of man, that Thou thinkest of himr Yet Thou hast made him but little lower than the angels, And hast crowned him with glory and honor. This makes sense. The Psalmist recognizes the insignificance ot man when judged as "part of a larger world nature," an evaluation borne out by modern science, and sees that the only source of human 5. New Pathways in Science (Cambridge, 1935), p. 6. M. of G„ p. 27. 7. Ib. 8. Psalms 8: 4-6. 56</page><page sequence="38">Reconstructionist Theology dignity may be found in the fact that the son of man is the child of God. Reconstructionism, however, which knows only man and a larger world of which he is a part, but not a universe that "Thou hast established," has but one way to ascertain the glory and honor of man, i.e. to derive it from his place in the cosmos. As we have seen, judged by its cosmic position, human life certainly does not yield any "cosmic meaning." The question that in such a case may it not be "the course of wisdom to pursue a policy of 'eat and drink and make merry, for tomorrow we die?' "9 proves nothing to the contrary. Such a course of wisdom may indeed follow from the inherent logic of the Reconstructionist world view. Reconstructionist Pan-Anth ropoism 9. M. of G., p. 29. The Reconstructionist method of drawing conclusions from the higher aspirations of man to the structure of universal reality is tantamount to fashioning the cosmos in the image of human aspira tions and values. The cosmic "correlates" are nothing else but the projection of man's wishes and desires into the cosmos. This is the origin of the distinction between cosmos and chaos. From the point of view of nature there is no distinction between "tempests, obnox ious plants and animals" and the, for man, more agreeable manifes tations of nature. When Reconstructionism calls the constructive powers of nature "the creative urge" and identifies as chaos that aspect of reality which may doom human aspirations, it introduces purely human value concepts in the determination of the nature of reality. Outside human consciousness and strivings we find only facts and not values. The life of the universe of which we are part and which is "the supreme value because from it all other values are derived" is the projection of the Reconstructionist "enthusiasm for living" onto the cosmic canvas. By learning to view man's nobler desires as an "integral part of the cosmic structure of reality," Reconstructionism attempts to give human values universal objectivity; however, all it accomplishes is the view of a world seen through the rose-colored glasses of human ambitions. When it "identifies" the powers that make for those nobler impulses in man as the divine aspect of reality, far from discovering God, it has merely deified certain aspects of the human personality. 57</page><page sequence="39">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought Ludwig Feuerbach was not right in generalizing that the idea of God represented nothing but the deification of human nature; never theless, the Reconstructionist inflation of human aspirations into cos mic proportions, their..projection into the universe where they are discovered as divine, proves that his theory is not always wrong. When Reconstructionism speaks about God, it is really moving in a circle, starting with man and concluding with him. This is nowhere more amusingly illustrated than when it attempts to offer a "re interpretation" of the biblical idea of man's having been created in the image of God. We have already discussed the quotation in which reference is made to "the something in the nature of life" which becomes manifest in the existence of human personality, evolving in man ideals and the quest for salvation. It is maintained that by identifying that "something" with God, "we are carrying out in mod ern times the implications of the conception that man is created in God's image. For such an identification implies that there is some thing divine in human personality, in that it is the instrument through which the creative life of the world affects the evolution of the human race."10 The truth is, of course, that the aspect of reality which is responsible for the emergence of human personality is re ferred to as "the creative life of the world" only because man attaches value to personality. The "something in the nature of life" which is responsible for the "evoking" of ideals and for sending man in quest of self-fulfillment is identified as God only because man ap proves of his own ideals and of the quest. This is the deification of human values. No wonder Reconstructionism discovers something divine in the human personality. It starts out with the projection of human personality into the universe as "the something in the nature of life" which is responsible for it. In this state, human personality is deified. It is then re-discovered in man as "something divine," which it is because we called it so right from the beginning. Such semantic juggling, however, has nothing in common with the con ception of man's creation in God's image. It is its very opposite; it is God's creation in man's image. This is the essence of the Recon structionist "intuition of God." Whenever Reconstructionism speaks about God, it is in reality speaking about man. When man sins he betrays that which is "best in him." On Rosh Hashanah the Reconstructionist, standing before 10. Ib., p. 89. 58</page><page sequence="40">Reconstructionist Theology the bar of judgment, judges himself "in the light of whatever truth experience has revealed to him."" The true meaning of the accept ance of God's kingship is to attain faith in man.12 To serve God is to strive for self-fulfillment.'3 By the holiness of God religion means to convey the idea that life is the supreme value.14 The "main prob lem of Jewish religion" is defined as the task to discover "a common purpose, which makes for the enhancement of human life" and to which Jews as a people are willing to be committed so passionately "as to see in it a manifestation or revelation of God."15 This is quite logical. The divine is in man because man deifies "the best in him." When, then, he is passionately devoted to a cause which en hances life, such commitment and devotion is divine revelation for it represents the best in him. All the while man is gyrating around himself; or better still, around his best potentialities. He serves and worships his noblest aspirations. In practicing transnaturalism, he is forever engaged in an intellectually incestuous mystical communion with his deified super-ego. In our presentation of Reconstructionist theology, we pointed out that transnaturalism was a form of pantheism. In the light of our analysis and evaluation, we now have to qualify this appelation. In the history of philosophy we distinguish between acosmic and athe istic pantheism. Acosmic pantheism is, for instance, that of Spinoza. Its origin is a metaphysical vision of the Infinite God whose very infinity leaves no room for a cosmos. Identifying nature with God, Spinoza denied not God but nature. It is for this reason that he was called the God-intoxicated philosopher. (The philosophy is, of course, contrary to Judaism because it eliminates Creation and the Creator.) It is obvious that Reconstructionism has nothing in com mon with this type of pantheism. The other form of pantheism be holds, again in a metaphysical inspiration, the wholeness of nature and identifies God with it. Not such is the Reconstructionist position, which is based on the naturalistic rejection of metaphysics. The Reconstructionist starting point is not a vision of the wholeness of nature but man, his aspirations, drives, and values. Insofar as man 11. Ib., p. 148. 12. Ib., p. 135. 13. J.W.

The viewing of these aspects of reality as divine does identify God with the cosmos, but with a cosmos shaped in the image of human aspirations and interests. Reconstructionist transnatural ism should, therefore, not be called pantheism. It is the most radical manifestation of anthropomorphism. It should properly be known as pan-anthropoism. It is much too original a religious philosophy to be considered a mere "re-valuation" of traditional Jewish concepts. If one should use Dr. Kaplan's own criterion for what constitutes re-valuation, one would have to say that transnaturalism shows not the least trace of a "psychological kinship with what the ancients did articulate."'6 Christianity as well as Islam are by far closer to Judaism than Reconstructionist religion. "Wedding Religion to Science" 16. M. of G. p. 7. As indicated in the opening sentences of this study, the task of harmonizing the valid results of scientific theory with the truth of religion is indeed of vital religious importance. All the more is it to be regretted that the Reconstructionist endeavor "to wed religion to science" has to be considered such a dismal failure. It should be obvious that it has not been our intention in this paper to offer another solution to the problem of the conflict between naturalism and traditional Judaism, one — perhaps — from a supernaturalistic viewpoint. Nor did we make any attempt to defend supernaturalism against Reconstructionist criticism. We investigated Reconstruction ist theology and religion on its own philosophical and theological merits and found it very much wanting. At the same time, it is rather a pity that Dr. Kaplan should have been so impatient with, and intolerant toward, the supernaturalist element in Judaism and treated it with utter intellectual contempt. Impatience, intolerance, and contempt are, of course, the historic privileges of all prophets of new religions in their attitude to the old one that they "re-val uate." Yet, had'he possessed only a small suspicion that the believers in a supernaturalist religion need not all be intellectually incompe tent, he might have felt induced to take another good look at his own naturalism. Such a second look, we believe, might have pre 60</page><page sequence="42">Reconstructionist Theology vented him from failing so wretchedly in his transnaturalist "re interpretation" of Judaism. We shall, therefore, attempt to review those principles of "the new scientific world view" which seems to be mainly responsible for the Reconstructionist rejection of supernaturalism. These are es sentially: "the uniformities of natural law demanded by scientific theory," also referred to as the scientific thought or insight of "the assumption of the universality of natural law"; "the immutable laws of cause of effect"; and "that inner necessity which compels things to be what they are."'7 Anyone can see that these principles are completely in "gear with the thinking of the average intelligent person at the present time."'8 This is as it should be from the Re constructionist point of view. The "average intelligent person at the present time" is the supreme authority to whose thinking Professor Kaplan bows in the spirit of childlike faith. It is, however, surprising that these concepts of the uniformity of nature are also claimed as being "in keeping with the most advanced ideas of reality."'9 The facts are quite to the contrary, as any average intelligent person may easily find out for himself by doing some elementary reading in present-time scientific method and philosophy. In the light of modern scientific theory, the reference to "that inner necessity which compels things to be what they are" must be considered the vestigial remnant of some obscure mysticism. The statement could have been made meaningfully — as indeed it was, though perhaps not exactly in those words — by Spinoza. However, it is fair to say that the spectacular development of modern science began when scientists stopped explaining natural events by inner necessities that compel things to be what they are. We shall not go wrong in stating that the ghost of inner necessity as a principle of scientific explanation has not shown itself in any responsible quarter for at least the last one hundred years. As to the uniformities and the universality of natural laws, it is now realized that there is no foundation for them either in experimental or theoretic science. The quantum theory, Heisenberg's principle of indeterminacy, the incal culable "jumps" of the electrons from orbit to orbit, prove that the good old principle of natura non facit saltus was a mere illusion. 17. Ib., pp. 30, 335; J.W.Sn., pp. 110-11. 18. J.W. Sn„ pp. 110-11. 19. Ib., p. 68. 61</page><page sequence="43">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought Natural laws of today show no such uniformity. Quantum mechan ics and wave mechanics, the indeterminism of events in the atomic structure, and the statistical laws of micro-physics made an end to "the assumption" of the universality of natural laws. In the wake of all these new developments, the concept of "the immutable laws of cause and eifect" governing nature is gone. An outstanding scientist draws a number of fundamental con clusions "from the mere fact of the atomicity of radiation, coupled with those well-established facts of the undulatory theory of light." Among them we find, for example, these: "So far as the phenomena are concerned, the uniformity of nature disappears. "So far as our knowledge is concerned, causality becomes mean ingless. "If we still wish to think of the happenings in the phenomenal world as governed by a causal law, we must suppose that these hap penings are determined in some substratum of the world which lies beyond the world of phenomena and so also beyond our access."20 We fully realize that there are many who do wish to think of the happenings in the phenomenal world as governed by a causal law. However, following the discussion between eminent scientists on the subject of the principle of causality, on which uniformity and universality depend, it is safe to say that it is not really possible to disagree with the factual statement made by the late Professor Ed dington that "the law of causality does not exist in science today — in that body of systematic knowledge and hypothesis which has been experimentally confirmed." Eddington is careful to point out that this does not mean that modern science has proved that the law of causality is not true of the physical universe, but that "present day science is simply indifferent" to the law of causality. "We might believe in it today and disbelieve in it tomorrow; not a symbol in the modern textbooks of physics would be altered."21 We do not pretend to be able to settle the issue as between the scientists. However, one thing is certain: the uniformities and the universality of the laws of nature are not only not demanded by scientific theory but they are not even used in "the body of system atic knowledge which has been experimentally confirmed." The di vision between determinists and indeterminists among scientists is 20. Sir James Jeans, Physics and Philosophy (Cambridge, 1943), p. 145. 21. See the discussion in New Pathways of Science, pp. 300-2. 62</page><page sequence="44">Reconstructionist Theology not a matter of science, but one of philosophy; it is based essentially on theoretical speculation. In our days, the principle of causation itself has become a metaphysical concept. He who affirms it as an explanation of universal order can adduce no proof that may be experimentally secured. As Jeans says, he supposes that the happen ings in the phenomenal world "are determined in some substratum of the world which lies beyond the world of phenomena, and so also beyond our access." But he who deals with substrata of the world which lie beyond the world phenomena is dangerously close to the border of the supernatural. The truth is that modern science excludes as little the Will of God "of the ancients," as a possible substratum to the world of observable phenomena, as it confirms the principle of causation as such a determining metaphysical back ground. The worst one may say about the Will of God as being responsible for the world of phenomena is that science is no more indifferent toward it as it is toward Dr. Kaplan's immutable laws of cause and effect. These new insights, which were only more recently gained by the scientists, corroborated what was accepted by critical philosophy ever since the days of Hume. Independendy of any particular ad vances in actual scientific knowledge, critical philosophy since Hume has shown that experience can never serve as the foundation of the principles of causation and the universality of natural law. In his Science and the Modern World, A. N. Whitehead has maintained that Hume's criticism of these principles have never been answered by experimental science. If science nevertheless proceeded to treat causation and universality as if they were validated principles of experience, this was based "on a widespread instinctive conviction" of the existence of an order of nature. Hume was right, "but scientific faith has risen to the occasion and has tacitly removed the philosoph ic mountain."22 We shall be in a better position to evaluate the significance of the Reconstructionist ideas about the order of nature, if we recall the source of "the scientific faith" in that order. Says Professor Whitehead: "My explanation is that the faith in the pos sibility of science, generated antecedently to the development of modern scientific theory, is an unconscious derivative from medieval theology."23 This, of course, needs some elaboration. The true mean ing of Hume's criticism consisted in the rejection of the theory of 22. Ib., pp. 4-5. 23. Ib., p. 16. 63</page><page sequence="45">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought induction. Since the days of Bacon, induction had been the main tool of scientific logic. Unfortunately, the theory of induction pre supposes the existence of an order with a uniform system of organi zation. Only on the a priori assumption of such a uniform cosmos was it logical to conclude that events belonging to the cosmos would be controlled by the same laws. The task was to discover the laws. However, without the a priori assumption of a uniform cosmic order, induction would prove nothing. As Whitehead puts it, "induction presupposes metaphysics."24 Medieval theology did have a theistic metaphysics from which the concept of a uniform order of nature was derived; modern experimental science, however, rejected any a priori assumptions of a natural order and based itself on the ob servation of "brute facts." The reliance on the principle of induction, which is valueless without the corresponding metaphysical assump tions, was indeed an act of faith in the orderliness of nature which was "an unconscious derivative from medieval theology." The point worth noting is that the principles of causation and universality never had any scientific validity; they were affirmed as a matter of faith, unconsciously borrowed from the system of a supernatural theism. (When some scientists realized the intellectual implications of such a situation, scientific positivism was born.) We can do no better than quote here an illuminating passage from J.W.N. Sullivan's The Bases of Modern Science: "The general medieval outlook made the assumption that JN ature was rational a reasonable one. Since both Nature and man had the same author, and Nature was designed to forward man's destiny, it was not unreasonable to suppose that the workings of nature should proceed in a matter intelligible to the human mind. Later, when science gave up this basis for the rationality of Nature, there was nothing to replace it but a pure act of faith. Science replaced the medieval scheme by a different one, but the new scheme did not contain within itself any grounds for supposing that it must be suc cessful. Science itself provides no ground, beyond the pragmatic one of success, for supposing that Nature forms an orderly and coherent whole. Science, therefore, rests not upon a rational basis but upon an act of faith. The scientific belief in the rationality of Nature is seen to be, historically, an inheritance from a system of thought of which the other terms have been discarded."25 24. Ib., p. 56. 25.

It is the irony of the Reconstructionist declamation about the immutable laws of cause and effect and the universality of natural law that these laws are purest metaphysical principles, historically and logically derived from supernaturalist religion. At a moment when experimental science, for the first time in its history, may be intellectually true to its nature and be "indifferent" to the principles of causation and universality, Reconstructionism still blindly be lieves that they are "demanded by scientific theory." Because of its faith in their scientific rationality, Reconstructionism rejects super naturalist theism. In reality, the laws of universality and causation made sense only in the context of a supernaturalist religion, whence they were unconsciously lifted by an irrational scientific faith. Truly, the Reconstructionist insight into the modern world view is the acme of scientific-philosophic innocence. Since the Reconstructionist view of naturalism is so extremely naive and outdated, nothing but failure was to be expected from its "wedding of religion to naturalism." Any one who undertakes the task will have to attempt to harmonize a mature naturalism with a mature supernatural ism (and not the old-wives' tale of super naturalism with which Dr. Kaplan is bickering all the time). The moment is not at all inpropitious. With the brilliant progress made by scientists in describing phenomena with mathematical exactitude has come a continually deepening realization that the more exact our description, the more mystified our understanding of what is being described. Matter has been equated with energy; the notion of substance has been replaced by behavior. And energy is that something that behaves in a certain way, of whose existence we know because it so behaves. No one, of course, has the slightest notion what it is that behaves. Discussing such concepts of Newton ian physics as mass, force, weight, J. W. N. Sullivan, whom we quoted earlier, says that whereas Newton considered them "objectively existing entities," we know now "that these terms are not names of entities, but are concise descriptions of behavior. They tell us noth ing about what is behaving. This is true of all terms used in phys ics."26 Needless to say, that neither do they tell us why the 26.

' Our most advanced ideas of reality, on which Reconstructionism imagined it could build its own struc ture, are not unlike the theology of the medieval philosopher. As to reality, we know that it is, but we do not know what it is. We do not know it by its essence, but only by its actions. We know what it does, but we do not know why it does it. Furthermore, it appears that it would be even more correct to say that science does not even describe the behavior of the unknown reality, but only the pattern which results from such behavior; the relationship that exists in a field between unknown events performed by unknown actors. Modern science deals with group structure, which can be described without specifying the material used or the operations by which it was composed.27 Eddington sums up the resulting situation in the following words: "Our present conception of the physical world is hollow enough to hold almost anything... .What we are dragging to light as a basis of all phenomena is a scheme of symbols connected by mathemat ical equations. That is what physical reality boils down to when probed by the methods which a physicist can apply. A skeleton scheme of symbols proclaims its own hollowness. It can be —nay it cries out to be — filled with something that shall transform it from skeleton into substance... .from symbols into an interpretation of the symbols."28 Reconstructionism can make no contribution to the task indicated in the above words. Whereas its conception of the physical world, filled as it is to the brim with the deadwood of outdated ideas, is not hollow enough to hold anything meaningful, its conception of the spiritual world is much too hollow to provide it. Only from the fullness of the spirit will the cold skeleton of physical experience be clothed with life and saving dignity. 27. Cf. A. S. Eddington, New Pathways in Science, p. 262. 28.
