<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tom Conley Virtual Reality and the Isolano In 1485 the city of Venice witnessed the publication of Bartolomeo dalli Sonetti's Isolano, a portolan adas that depicts the major islands of the Aegean sea. Forty-nine maps are placed on the recto side of pages that are accompanied, on the verso of the preceding sheets, of sonnets that depict the pertinent traits of every island. In the history of cartography the slim volume, of which only 46 copies are extant, marks a major turning point. Until then, scholars agree, the detailed depiction of shores and islands had been common to portolan charts, that is, to hand-drawn maps of the Mediterranean that had been used by navigators and sailors. These had been practical views of the sea and coastlines, that had been located both on ships and, too, in places destined to house rare and valuable objects. The portolan chart attested to the viability of maps for the practice of commerce and travel. Sonetti's Isolano departs from the tradition on at least two grounds. First, it is the first mechanically reproduced work of its kind, a work that copies manuscript-images of the Aegean archipelago as it had first been represented by Christoforo Buondelmonte in his Liber insulanim Archipelagi, a manuscript dating to about 1520.1 Second, the book sums up a crucial part of the tradition that it establishes. It shares much with concurrent rééditions of Ptolemy's Geographia in that although it seems to be based on the experience of travel in the Aegean (and the accompanying text underscores the eye-witness account on the part of the writer), the reality it projects is not something that is represented, but that is entirely simulated. It is a book of real islands that are the product of the labors of a poet and a woodcutter. The reader of the book experiences the history and the space of the archipelago as he or she never would be able to do within the limiting and unreliable process of travel and notation of a world seen. The virtue of Sonetti's virtuality was not lost on later editors. In 1528, when 1. The history and sources of Sonetti's work are outlined in Frederick J.

The poems that had accompanied the images of the islands in the work of 1485 are jettisoned, and an ample body of prose fills the blank space that had suggested an equivalence of a poem to an island. In Sonetti's work the juxtaposition of an insular unit of writing to a fragment of land was clear. Mapped out with rhumblines and with an encompassing wind-rose depicting the placement of the island in respect to cardinal points, with a scale of leagues, and signs marking the winds that blow over the masses of land and water, Sonetti offers images and poetic legends that appear to be both "real" and of practical use for travelers. The sea, the land, and the properties of the each site in the Aegean are available to be seen in a glance. By contrast, Bordone's creation, a book that would witness increased popularity throughout much of the sixteenth century (if four later editions—1534, another about 1537, another between 1534 and 1567, and a last printing in 1547—are taken into account),2 fills the vacant space with information. Descriptive prose occupies the space that had been located between the map and the sonnets. The printed information becomes an environing sea that surrounds 104 woodcut images of not only Aegean islands but those of the world at large. A sense of the grounding of space is established in the block-like aspect of islands in rectangular frames that are aligned with a long column of prose that the images seem to interrupt. The compass-lines appear as if they were conjugated with the corners of the frame that is given a bevelled aspect, appearing thus to fall into a space deeper than the surface of the page. A greater feeling of grounding is obtained, and so too is a sense of the control of the relation between what is known about the island and its visual form. A glance at Sonetti's and Bordone's renderings of the same islands yields a wealth of pertinently minimal differences. In the two pages devoted to the Island of Psara, Sonetti contains the major island and its adjuncts within most of the ambient diagram that charts the cardinal points. North is indicated by the arrowhead that appears to point to the west, while the latin cross at the top of the map aims east. The center of the circle, at which meet eight lines that divide the circle into as many pie-like sections, is situated midway between Psara proper, "Psara piccolo," and two islands between. The woodcut places dots along two peninsulas, indicating shallows by which sailors ought to steer clear. The design of the image puts the island on a sort of wheel, a branloire, like that of fortune, that makes the figure liable to be seen from any given angle. Three tufts of schematic trees verify what the sonnet declares about the presence of rich forests. Near the upper coast, in 2. Robert W. Karrow, Jr., Mapmakers of the Sixteenth Century and Their Maps (Chicago: The Speculum Press, 1993), pp. 92-93; see also R. A. Skelton (1966), p. x.</page><page sequence="3">Virtual Reality and the Isolano 123 line with the vector aiming to the East, a sketch indicates that the remains of a castle can be seen ("Ebe già questa un Castel pelegrino dal lato de oriente e minato se vede adesso aterrato e meschino"). The smaller island has nothing inscribed in its borders, the blank space suggesting the uninhabited space that Bordone will underscore in his description ("è nominato psara piccolo, &amp; ogni cosa è deserta, senza habitatione algune, ma de cavalli, afini, lepre, &amp; cotorni ne ha habondante mente &amp; soppra ognaltra cosa ha bonissime acque"). Sonetti's poem uses its descriptive virtue to link the space produced in the adjoining woodcut to the other islands in the book, the final tercet noting that the line established by the garbino wind would lead the voyager directly to the redoubtable Chaloiero island that had been the topic of the image and text nine folio pages above ("Ma chi da questa ftissi separato miglia quaranta inver ostro e garbino serebe col chaloiero atrovato"). The poem suggests that a pliable extension of space comprises a matrix in which the islands are placed. Yet, as each is enclosed in the diagram, its relation to other islands is enhanced by use of analogy, spatial description, or even narrative itinerary in the sonnet. Bordone literally fills out what is suggested through the relation Sonetti establishes with the image and the poem. Drawing on Ptolemy and Strabo, he situates Psara and its environing island in relation to Lesbos. His burin cuts a signature (resembling in fact that of Valerio Adami) in the place-names that are inserted into the image: Psara is named below one of its forests, its central island port is named at the middle of the picture, and Psara piccolo is cut into the sea just below the vacant island of its name. Nonetheless, Sonetti's outline of the coasts offers the illusion of greater detail with a more jagged rendering. The book of 1485 seems to say more with its visual innuendo and the elliptical tone of its sonnet than does Bordone with his more careful project of nomination. Comparison ofthe two renderings ofLimonia and Carchi, two adjacent islands in the same area, leads to slightly different conclusions. In Sonetti's map nine islands are portrayed, only one of which protudes the containing circle. Two of the three islets between the major bodies of land are cut by the lines designated by the garbino and scirocco winds. The compass-line to the north follows a trajectory that is exacdy northwest on the printed page, yielding a disposition of Limonia set below its counterpart. The jagged, almost "cogwheeled" shoreline is rendered in greater detail in the 1485 depiction than that of 1528. The estuaries of the principal rivers on each island are drawn to designate a broad and extensive mouth that opens below sources taken to be situated in forests that are indicated by stylized groups of two (Limonia) or three (Carchi) trees. Schematic figures are drawn to signal the presence of a castle and a monastery on Carchi, and some evidence of habitation in the central highlands ofLimonia. Bordone, by contrast, simplifies the outline of the two islands but emphasizes their "floating" aspect by putting the rhumblines beneath the land masses that are drawn with a high degree of relief. The mountains and trees are etched with such fine</page><page sequence="4">124 Tom Conley parallel hatchings that a latent topography begins to emerge from the outline of the island, thus offering two different (but simultaneous) perspectives on the given space. Bordone's depiction of the rivers is more reminiscent on cursory glance of the style of Ptolemiac maps that offer longer lines and origins (as in the case of the Nile) in circles (designating lakes) or points where the line seems to end in the landscape. The place-names that are drawn within the containing shapes of the islands give a literal "definition," in both name and in spatial effects, to each of the masses. Most important, Bordone turns the islands to make their length become visible on a vertical axis. The textual legends seem to conform to a pattern of difference visible elsewhere. The islands, both authors note, are rugged and not very hospitable. They are known for their figs (hence the presence of the trees in the images), and the inhabitants enjoy a local custom worthy of note: the dowry that young women bring to the men they shall marry consists in hoes and shovels. The space is sanctified in both Sonetti and Bordone through the story of San Niccolo, who led the inhabitants to salvation and for whom the isolani built a church in his honor. Bordone locates the pair of islands on the greater map of the Aegean, whereas Sonetti uses the poem both to describe the site and to narrate the tale of travel about the area. The earlier text has a living and moving aspect that Bordone replaces with a quasi-touristic, quasi-objective treatment in an ample paragraph of description. The two treatments diverge most notably in the way the islands are spatialized. For Sonetti, the areas seem to turn about the navigational circle and hence are inscribed in a reiterative structure, a diagrammatic rendering of a rondeau or a ritournelle, the sign of eternal movement and return. Set in a far more scénographie frame in Bordone's picture, Limonia and Carchi nonetheless "release" themselves much more readily to the spectator's imagination than in Sonetti's time-space allegory determined by the circle and the accompanying navigational apparatus. The increased emphasis on relief turns the islands into anthropomorphic forms, into faces of bodies seemingly competing for the crumb of an islet set between them. Limonia is more likely to swallow the torso-like island than its counterpart that seems to shriek at what it sees taking place. Or else, the islands are cells that have just undergone mitosis, and are now extending their pseudopodia in the shape of peninsulas, as if they were to engulf the blank matter that surrounds them. Bordone brings out a biological latency that seems to simulate the very process that the enterprise of the isolario embodies in its intellectual and commercial vision: digestion of a world that can never be completely explored or broken down into assimilable units. In this way the work of Sonetti and Bordone can be read as harbingers of an extraordinary voyage into and about a world of infinite possibility that we obtain from the ideology that circulates in the kingdom of computer technologies. Akin modern artists who use computers in tandem with video images and mixed médias, the authors of the earliest isolani show us that the essay of space and language brings forth what advanced technology can never control, but which supports the best and</page><page sequence="5">Virtual Reality and the Isolano 125</page><page sequence="6">126 Tom Conley worst of their ideology, and that inhabits us from our very origins and that accompanies us with the continuity of a laser beam: the relation with the unknown. What technologies rediscover in their regression, and what they want to repress, seems to reside in all that remains unnamed but very concretely drawn within the detail and outside of the frame of these woodcuts that simulate the authenticity of portolan charts of the Aegean.3 The point can be adduced if we note, first, that the isolano has a very brief life span in the history of cartography. In the incunabular age it begins with Sonetti, is developed with telling changes in Bordone, and then acquires a different aspect when printed with maps drawn on copperplate in Tommaso Porcacchi's Isolano of 1574. It becomes the basis of André Thevet's great "breviary" of ethnography (the famous description belongs to Claude Lévi-Strauss) in Les Singularités de la France antarctique (Paris, 1557 and Antwerp, 1558) and La Cosmographie universelle (Paris, 1575) and his unpublished Grand pilotage et insulaire (circa 1584). The genre then disappears under the advent of the far more veracious shape of the Ortelian atlas that commands the European market as of 1570. Second, the space of time in which it lives attests to its ethnographic virtue, to its viability as a form that can move toward alterity without assimilating or allegorizing the strangeness it confronts.4 If we take as a correlative creation Alonso 3. Time and again Jean-François Lyotard remarks that computers are impoverished because they have never been children. They have never had the good fate of being stupid, recalcitrant, lazy, thoughtful, listless, passionate, in utter frustration for lack of words or, in a term that has currency in criticism: dialogic. Computers have not had to take into account "this double fact of death and birth on the one hand and sexual difference on the other" ("Oikos," in Political Writings, tr. Bill Readings and Kevin Paul Geiman. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1993, p. 102). The innocuous maps by Sonetti and Bordone put forward the relation to the unknown that is tied to childhood, and to birth, death, and difference as well. Their islands allow to be made manifest "something that has not become public, that has not become communicational, that has not become systemic" (103), in other words, something vitally ecological. 4. Frank Lestringant has repeatedly shown that a brief "ethnographic" moment exists in the odd shape of André Thevet's oeuvre, and that its way of opening itself onto to difference contrasts with later ethnographic literature, such as that of Jean de Léry or Théodore de Bry, that puts new information into pre-molded allegories. Lestringant verifies in material and compelling ways that seems to be on the part of Lévi-Strauss (in Tristes Tropiques) an allusive perception. In "Fortunes de la singularité à la Renaissance: le genre de l'Tsolario'," reprinted in Ecrire le monde à la Renaissance (Caen: Paradigme, 1993, pp. 17-48), he notes that "the island on the map appears closed upon itself; it might enclose, in the frame thus drawn by its limits, a singular object accompanied by its legend. Through a simple juxtaposition of singular units, the island engenders the archipelago, that in the sixteenth century becomes one of the forms best able to contain the infinite and repetitive constellation of objects of science" (41). The author of this paper would like to underscore that nonetheless the relation with the unknown still inheres in the fascination generating both the form and process (and not just the scientific results) of the isolario and, as a topic for future work, that the sonnet can also be a candidate for treatment of ethnography by way of the industry</page><page sequence="7">Virtual Reality and the Isolano 127 de Santa Cruz's Islario general de todas las islas del mundo, which was written in manuscript and completed before 1548, probably 1542, for Charles V of Spain, we discover a no less composite creation of texts and 112 maps.5 For the modern reader, affirms Françoise Naudé, the manuscripts have the look of a semiotic soup, a minestrone of shapes that defy easy transcription. "Un lecteur moderne a besoin d'une certaine présentation typographique pour lire le texte, alors que le manuscrit, au contraire, ne distingue ni phrases, ni paragraphes. De même le souci moderne de distinguer, classer, ordonner, se heurte au fait qu'à l'époque toutes les informations avancent de front: histoire de la conquête, connaissance des habitants et du pays, reconnaissance des lieux conquis, etc... " (46), unlike what is far more ordered in the work of Fernândez de Oviedo. Although Santa Cruz, a virtual traveler who "simulated" the findings of Oviedo by copying them in Spain, hardly saw what he depicted, he nonetheless entirely changes the style of the account of conquest that he receives, casting adrift his author's "dramatization" in favor of objectivity. "Ce qui est remarquable, c'est la sobriété des moyens qui permettent de présenter les faits dans un esprit différent, plus objectif, réaliste, impartial" (56), and above all, it can be added, despite the circumstances of the writing of the Islario, in a tone that is hardly imperial. At this point we are probably beginning to wonder what Sonetti, Bordone, or even Alonso da Santa Cruz, have to do with what the title that this paper has announced a "virtual reality". The point is disarmingly simple. It is merely that that the altered consciousness of space that we gain from increased use of "webs, " "internets," "websites," and "interactive" apparatus allows us a means of looking at what has been taken to be stable and historically complete documents—in this case the isolano—in unforeseen ways. I am not arguing that by putting Sonetti or Bordone on a CD Rom or by interfacing images from these different isolani we can be in a better position to understand the impact of the vision of the world as an infinity of islands, or that the fragmented relation of land and sea extends us, as so many advertisements wish to make us believe, into a thousand points of light in an infinity of things large and small. Nor would I like to suggest that we can travel by virtual means through the islands more quickly with new technology than in the past, with a technology that purveys the romance, that seemed to inhere in age of travel, about what at that time had been lost by Christendom to the Turks (that therefore a space eroticized and desired), or what in the New World was under the throes of colonial mismanagement, despite hues of a Golden Age in which the nations bathed. Rather, what is being advanced is close to the commonplace of a future past, of its form. 5.

For amateurs of maps and historians of space the computer brings out dimensions that in any event had been latent but always present in incunabular and early modern print culture. The correlation of advanced technology of our age with the experimental map in printed cartography in the Renaissance, shows that for the last five hundred years we are liable to be reconfiguring space in ways that can be tested by analogy, at once the worst and the best of methods of trial, error, and experiment. What was taken to be a "spatialization" of the world in the Renaissance, that is made manifest in the printed isolano before the advent of Ramist logic, is already familiar to the computer-hacker or "surfer."6 For us the island-book that Bartolomeo dalli Sonetti heralds in 1485 seems to be congruent with several components of spatial process that we are now taking to be axiomatic when "interfacing," "internetting," and so forth become a crystallized fact. First, information is made frangible, its alterity is pulverized and emulsified into readily assimilable, digestible units or "bytes" that can be seen, comprehended, memorized, vectored, and turned about in the flash of an instant. The concept of the 'island' that supersedes the 'continent' revives an archaic geography (Macrobius and Lucretius, among others) in which wholes and parts become coextensive, but endowed with an infinite possibility of difference. As a result, second, modular thinking comes with the isolano, but it comes forward in our imagination of the past no doubt because computors have fostered the conditions allowing us to think of them in that way. What Michel de Certeau called the "le pensable" is altered to a degree on superimposed maps of space and time.7 The latter require movement in and about a virtual world that simulates on computer-screens the sum of knowledge, space, language, and desire, but they also encourage regression in ways that capture an imagination that dwells with dialogical intensity on forms, such as minimal cartographic signs, that seem to be either impoverished or of limited meaning, prior to the moment they display how much they belong to a process of meaning discerned as transformation. Thus, second, huge forms that defy the imagination, such as new worlds or new universes, can be assimilated by a supple taxonomic process that coordinates 6. In the preface to the 1983 réédition of Ramus, Method, and the Decay of Dialogue (Cambridge: Harvard University Press), Father Walter J. Ong notes that Ramus's binary dichotomized charts bear strong resemblance to "digital computer programs. Like computer programs, the Ramist dichotomies were designed to be heuristic: they belong to the part of logic known as 'invention,' that is, finding" (viii), inotherwords, "retrieving" something lost or unknown that cannot be classified, that is subject to a "search" far more laborious than what a user of a Macintosh obtains by simultaneously striking the "control" and "F" keys before typing into a box the item that needs to be located. 7.

For Sonetti, the Aegean itinerary comprises the only limit, but its borders are entirely provisional and is thus liable to be extended as time, information, and energy permit. By contrast, for Bordone, a much more careful delineation of two endpoints, Venice and Mexico City, allows the infinite range of singularity—strange customs, historical quirks, miracles, effects of chronicle and legend, new information, and so on—to fall within a design depicted by inversely articulated city views. Venice, the site of the publication of the text, is the city of "1,000 islands" (hence an infinity), is opposed in the first book to Temistitan, the City that is an island surrounded by a lake and a whole new world. In between we discover an alluvial extension, an unfolding of infinite type and shapes. For the viewer of both Sonetti and Bordone virtually anything can be contained within the jagged oudine of a figment of the imagination that takes the spatial form of an island. Each unit, however, becomes something of an "island-byte," or a quantum of information, like an enzyme, that can be drawn to fit into complementary and contiguous islands or to establish contrasts and congruences over the entire globe and within the body itself. In a historical sense, the idea is close to the infinity of possibilities that were suggested by islands beyond the range of the experience of Marco Polo, but in the ideological frame in which we live (and through which we have the pleasure of being condemned to study the isolano), the idea is translated into the very virtuality of infinite combination and circulation of contained "bytes" of desire (in other words, epistemophilia, the erotic drive to contain the world in a disk, but also to get strangled in the web that also determines what one can desire to know). Most important is what, so far, has gone unmentioned but remains glaringly clear in the brief comparison of the two island-books. Sonetti tells his reader that an island is coextensive with a sonnet. The reiteration of the "form of the content" of each island and its description shows that an infinity of knowledge can be mapped out by virtue of the sonnet. "No man is an island...": but a sonnet, a production of "man, " intends to be the container or vehicle that can assimilate all human drive to know and to register the world. In both the Petrarchan tradition and the Isolano the writing of the sonnet becomes a practice that spatializes knowledge in terms of a drive to contain the world within an infinity of variation on the same form. The erotic dimension so characteristic of the geme is revealed to be a function of space: to love is to move into and about a space whose limits, that whet desire, are both island-shores and the constraints of a lyrical model. The sonnet and the island become a field of difference and variation that allows science and drive to become indistinguishable. It leads, too, to the strange process, so modern and so archaic, that inaugurates the experimental process in Montaigne's remarks about le désir de connoisance, which is based on a blending of difference and resemblance. The process engages the logic of bifurcation or "bussing," essential to computers, that is everywhere</page><page sequence="10">130 Tom Conley obvious in the "visible" and "discursive" formations of the Essais: Il n'est désir plus naturel que le désir de connoissance. Nous essayons tous les moyens qui nous y peuvent mener. Quand la raison nous faut, nous y employons l'experience, Per varios usus artem experientia fecit: Exemplo monstrante viam, qui est un moyen plus fiable et moins digne; mais la vérité est chose si grande, que nous ne devons desdaigner aucune entremise qui nous y conduise. La raison a tant de formes, que nous ne sçavons à laquelle nous prendre; l'experience n'en a pas moins. La consequence que nous voulons tirer de la resemblances des evenemens est mal seure, d'autant qu'ils sont tousjours dissemblables: il n'est aucune qualité si universelle en cette image des choses que la diversité et varieté.8 In this view, the "event" that produces knowledge "happens" to be the apprehension of a singularity (that is, an island or an insularity) that can, like variation on a given form, be sublimely superficial in its reproducibility. The "experience" offered by the proximity of the island-book to the sonnet demonstrates that what Montaigne is defining as a desire for knowledge in no way sustains the myth that surrounds him and other figures of the Renaissance about Humanistic relativism. Difference may be ordered in a register of islands or a cycle of sonnets, but it cannot be redeemed by any overriding similarity of a triumphal anthropomorphism. Difference, like the islands of Sonetti and Bordone, that were at once amebae and human faces, monsters and profiles of strange, unnameable things, can only be charted or "webbed" in a taxonomy that cannot contain them. What we are discovering in the electronic world affirms, as does the verbal and the cartographical relation that the well-named Bartolomeo da Sonetti crafts between the sonnet and a book of singularities, pertains to what the late Gilles Deleuze called philosophy as a mode of "surfing." It does not exactly mean the activity that is called "surfing the net, " but of moving over and about an "archipela go" of concepts, conceived as "absolute surfaces or volumes, inchoate [difforme] and fragmentary," while contemplation, the condition in which alterity can be welcomed, involves the simultaneous perception of infinite "singularities" or spaceless points "concentrated in one surface and disseminated into another."9 If our imagination of the drive of philosophy that Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari offer through this figure is driven by the current force of the computer, the latter is also related to the isolano.
