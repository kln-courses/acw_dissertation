Arnold Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY. U.S.A. Abstract This paper explores the relationship between food and Theravada Buddhism in four distinctive settings. First I will attempt to forge an interpretive basis among the academics and intellectuals of Theravada which, second, might act as a window into Thai village Buddhist rites. Third, I will apply this view to the Trai Pkurn in the hope of making more general statements about the nature of the world and the importance of food to the Buddhists' (distinctively the Thai Buddhist) interactive view of material existence. Finally these strands come together around the central feature of sustenance. Taken as a whole this approximates a coherent religious view which integrates ritual, myth, doctrine, and folk beliefs with reference to eating and giving food. Uses and understandings of food are central to these four disparate religious settings. In conclusion, while food is generally seen as a material necessity it is also a necessary attribute of religious cosmology. Thus, following Lévi-Strauss, religion concerns both material and ideological realities. Eating is a performative activity which complicates simple definitions of religion as ideology. As in other indigenous traditions, eating, and particularly giving food, is understood to be a life promoting activity rather than a moralistic or ideological enterprise. Thus, intellectual interpretive activity, tied to the acquisition and distribution of food, is a necessarily cultural attribute in perpetuating human life. Eating, a biological necessity, is not a discrete activity, as we tend to assume, but one which effectively integrates a wide range of phenomenal existences. By organizing relationships with reference to material and substantive realities a human society does not, however, relegate a cosmological vision to a simple- minded notion of "economics" or "politics." To the contrary a coherent vision of the material world activated by eating relationships, orients interpretation of what constitutes the distinctive human place in a wider cosmological context. This paper will focus on the Thai Buddhist understanding of how material realities are transformed into other forms. Cultivation of food, gifts of food, and eating of food not only form the basis of bodily existence but document an understanding of the transmutation of substance. In this transmutational view of materiality, in which food takes on a distinctive character, an interpretation of a human place is of critical importance. A cosmology of constantly transforming relationships requires constant analytical vigilance to adequately assess an individual or community's situation. Interpretation of one's material world, in this context, is tantamount to religious orientation. Adjustments within this cosmological system are accomplished via food gifts to different classes of beings. My organization follows four divisions. First I will attempt to forge an interpretive basis among the academics and intellectuals of Theravada which, second, might act as a window into Thai village Buddhist rites. Third, I will apply this view to the Trai Phum in the hope of making more general statements about the nature of the world and the importance of food to the Buddhists' (distinctively the Thai Buddhist) interactive view of material existence. Finally, these strands come together around the central feature of sustenance. Taken as a whole this approximates a coherent religious view which integrates ritual, myth, doctrine, and folk beliefs with reference to eating and giving food. 6</page><page sequence="2">Journal of Ritual Studies 14(1)2000 I In this section I will make a brief excursion into the wider world of Theravada Buddhism. Primarily drawing on the work of Mus, Reynolds, and Karunadasa I hope to show that ideas of food, feeding, and eating are also operative within the macro cosmos. Important for analysis is the understanding of food as a central aspect in the transmutation of the material world. The process of eating and feeding in the Theravadan view becomes an interpretation of the very processes of the physical workings of the universe. Mus understands Buddhism of Southeast Asia as a development of an ancient cult of the soil. Central to this cult was the deity of the earth who was propitiated with offerings, primarily through animal sacrifice, and whose identity was presented and re-presented in different ways in different religious situations. According to Mabbett in his introduction to Mus, "It was not so much an anthropomorphic spirit inhabiting the earth as the earth itself. As such it was amorphous and inaccessible; but by a subtle relationship of bi-presence it could be both amorphous as the earth and embodied in a sacred site or object, commonly a stone, or in a sacrifice. In this capacity it could attain a determinate being and respond to the prayers of the community." (Mus 1975: x) Mus terms this ancient religion "animism" in which a large number of spirits were seen as occupying the soil and thereby interacting with human beings. Deities were localized phenomena whose human community of devotees principally used sacrifice to feed and therefore communicate directly with the earth. The stone came to represent die earth in microcosm and actions taken with respect to the stone produced practical results for the benefit of the community. For example anointing the stone was analogous to rain falling on the earth. Its presence as an intermediary between human beings and the earth grew in significance with the passage of time. Stones were understood to grow as the human community continued to invest energies in it. Ancestors too were associated with the soil, the earth deity, and the landscape. An ongoing sacrificial rite identified the chieftain (a man responsible for the prosperity of the group as well as contact with the spirits of the land) with the deity-ancestor, who literally embodied the bond between the group and the land. To Mus a world view which correlated the human body (particularly expressed in the person of the chief with the earth (expressed in stone) naturally developed into a hierarchical conception of reality. Just as the ancestors resided in an earthly realm, sacrifice of living forms acted as an intermediary between a human existence and the earthly spirits. These revolutions developed a hierarchy of planes of being which could only be overcome by the sacrifice. "This pattern involved a radical disjunction between the plane of the divine constituted by the amorphous deity and the plane of the sacred constituted by the sacrificial action and the stone which represented it; it became operational by virtue of a 'logic of rupture"' (Reynolds 1981: 229). In order for the religions of Buddhism, Brahmanism, and the state cult of China to make inroads into these regions there had to be a connection to the "sacred cartological principals" alive in these areas. In these successive movements the image of the deity underwent change from aniconic to human form. "So to worship this simultaneously in a human shape, in which it is incarnated, and in a crude form, is simply to make perceptible the passage of the amorphous deity to its accessible manifestation; it is to authenticate this manifestation; and, finally, it is to use the manifestation as a means of gaining access to the soil as soil; a magical act of occupation more direct and therefore more profoundly 7</page><page sequence="3">Journal of Ritual Studies 14(1)2000 satisfying than a mythological personification pure and simple." (Mus 1975: 24, emphasis added) For Mus the stone came to embody a realm of reality apart from the human realm. This theme was tied to the linga which, to the Cham of Vietnam, is understood to embody the gods. "The stela [stone monument] is the deceased, just as the sacred stone is a genie. The oldest conception seems to be that the deceased is present in the form of stone...the stone is habitat [the earth] and inhabitant [the ancestor] at once" (Mus, 1975: 39). Examples of this are offered by Mus. Buried stones gradually absorb energies of a place and it then becomes a "genie." A reciprocity exists between a stone statue of Siva, who embodies the dead, and those who honor it. "Beneath this phallic allegory of the fecundating power of the deity, the linga remains faithful to its primitive origins; it is still a magic stone, the stone of the soil" (Mus 1975: 45). In this primitive cult the stone is a view of the world in microcosm. It embodies, in miniature, attributes of a material world which is interactive between different realms of beings. Ritual actions taken with respect to the linga, for example, effectively enlist other realms of being to transform one element (water or tears wiped on the stone) to another (rain). As in the sacrifice, division of a single body into pieces creates food for the earth and ancestors in this ancient cult. Rimai killing becomes the means of dividing attributes of a living being thereby integrating different realms of beings around food. The "soil cults" symbolism was based on the religious value of "the cosmic mystique of food" (Mus 1935: 284). The passage of substances from one mode of being to another was the basis of communion with the deity through consumption. Rimai life was centered on the communion of food. Doctrinally the communion of food was connected to communion of Law. Sambhogakãya comes from the sanscrit verb sambhuj, to eat together or to have a meal in common. In classical sanscrit sambhoga refereed to sexual as well as to nutritive communion (Mus 1935: 264; MacDonald 1955: 237-238). Definition of the monastic unit is largely accomplished through the language of a communal meal. Van Esterik tells us this is true also in the village monastery. Excommunication means that a monk can no longer partake of the communal meal (van Esterik 1986: 210). According to Mus sambhogakãya is connected to the technical term dhammasambhoga (communion of the Law). The hidden body of the Buddha ( dhammakãya ) is transmitted substantively by monks who eat together (Mus 1936). For Mus this is a significant reinterpretation of the ancient theme of sacrifice. Purusa, or the supreme cosmic sacrifice, embodied this understanding in the Brīnum a and the Upanis ad. Dissection and distribution of Prajâpati'sbody (the anthropomorphized purus a) orders society and the cosmos through the action of mystical food and the "communication of substances." This cosmogony suggests that through the process of eating and creating food the phenomenal world is created. Prajāpati perpetually sacrifices its body to nourish the universe. MacDonald has shown that Prajāpati is the culmination of numerous traditions of shamanistic rites where the theme of sacrifice and dispersion was intimately connect with the fecundity of the land. Connected to this is the hunt in which the partitioning of an animal's body between groups was understood to reinforce the general fertility of the land. Hunting too was the activity of men who were bound in a collectivity and ultimately the feast (MacDonald 1952: 338). Mus connects Prajāpati to the distribution and veneration of Buddha relics and images of the stupa cult. The material fabrication of the stupa in some cases bring together many themes of the ancient cult of the soil. Use of stone, as we have discussed, at specific points in the landscape was understood to connect distinct yet reciprocal planes of existence. Likewise, the use of stones in stupa construction acted as an intermediary substance between human and spiritual realms. Irwin has examined many stupas and has determined that they grew out from an older cosmic religion. Y Upa is a word used descriptively which means "sacrificial post" and was used to gain access to ancestors who were in the earth. The sacrificial post was 8</page><page sequence="4">Journal of Ritual Studies 14(1)2000 understood as the "cosmic tree mystically located at the world's axis, [with a] metaphysical link between the terrestrial and celestial spheres" (Irwin 1980: 14). For Irwin the stupa is the Axis Mundi, or the cosmic pillar which is founded in the subterranean waters and rises up through the earth finally extending to heaven. The stupa embodies, in its very construction, the means for "rapture" or communion between worlds. Just as cultic observances were centered around a stone to secure material well-being so too the stupa cult, for Mus, propitiates another reality upon which human sustenance depends. The stupa integrates an ancient understanding of stone, sacrifice, and "the logic of rapture" with a Buddhist interpretation. Particularly food offerings at stupas work to expand the influence of an individual's ritual action to include and influence other realms by creating substantive relationships between different kinds of existences. Although Buddhist, the stupa cult, following Mus, articulates an understanding of material existence which has its roots in a more ancient cult of the soil. The structure and understanding of matter is of central importance to Buddhist soteriology. According to Karunadasa rūpa (matter) has nine meanings. First is the "totality of matter"; second is "matter that enters into the composition of a living being"; third is color which is due to a relationship between the eye and matter; fourth is form or figure; fifth is the "meditation-object"; sixth is condition related to something; seventh is nature; eighth is the second of the three planes of existence; and ninth is rare but is the four stages of ecstatic experience. Many phenomena, in addition to what we classify as corporeal reality, are understood as material. In the Nikãyas the four primary elements ( mahābhvtas ) have direct effect in constituting the body. "Phathavī-dhātu, or earth, is that which is hard and rigid (e.g., hair of the head or body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, etc.). Āpo-dhātu is water or that which is watery (e.g., bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, tears, etc.). Tejo-dhātu is fire or heat or that which is fiery (e.g., the heat in the body which transmutes food and drink in digestion). Vãyo-dhãtu is air or that which is airy (e.g. 'wind discharged upwards or downwards, wind in the abdomen or belly, vapours that traverse the several members, inhalings and exhalings of breath') (Karunadasa, 1967: 17). None of these elements can exist independently of one another but together generate and perpetuate the body and phenomenal existence. The recognition of two "faculties of life" (mental and material) is a doctrinal development of Theravada. The first stabilizes and sustains consciousness and consciousness-concomitants. The second stabilizes and sustains matter that comes into being as a result of kamma. Although these two faculties form a necessary pair, food, in its solid form, is distinguished from consciousness, volition, and impression which are also said to nourish and sustain the empiric individuality. In addition to correspondences between elements of the material world and the body, there are also distinct nutritive forces. The view propagated in the Theravadan interpretation of matter is one of dynamic correlation and interaction between elements of life such as earth, water, fire, etc., via different nutritive interactions. Food arbitrates between worldly and bodily realities becoming the counterpart of food offerings at stone monuments in the stupa cult. Both Buddhist soteriology and stupa cult understand eating and giving food as the transmutation of one form of being into another. Analysis of matter involves the inter-dependence and conditionality of all dhammas (elements of existence) with reference to paccayãkãra-naya or the system of correlation. In this system, the facts of phenomenal and mental worlds are apprehended as a single integrated reality arbitrated by categories of symbolic arrangement. A Buddhist analysis of matter is central to practical doctrine and discipline; namely for the purpose of achieving nibbāna. The material world itself is not what stands in the way of liberation but the craving that arises "when eye and matter meet." Hence the monk is advised to be a rüpaññü, "knower of matter," for both the malady and remedy lie within it. Because there is no permanence associated with basic factors of existence the monk's primary task is to become an interpreter of matter. The rūpic 9</page><page sequence="5">Journal of Ritual Studies 14ťl) 2000 cosmology is one which implies responsible action which recognizes an inherently interactional material reality. The relational basis of the world, known as dependent co-origination, requires close scrutiny of material existence as a potent, yet potentially dangerous, ally in the path of liberation. By employing a system of correlation the monk displays a mastery over the transformative nature of the material world. Liberation is only achieved by adequately mapping a world in constant flux. As all matter is subsumed to the status of dependent co-originational, the monk- as a knower of matter-can influence existence toward a path of freedom. In this respect the monk resembles the individual devotee of the stupa cult who, through gifts, influences distinct yet dependent realms of reality. n Tambiah' s analysis of North-east Thailand village religious life is centered around four rituals of different origins; Buddhist, sukhwan, cult of the guardian spirits, and spirit possession. Together these different ritual activities create a coherent religious life and cosmology. His intention is to examine religion as a "single total field" where Buddhism, fertility, oriented activities, and ancestor worship, all play a significant part. The village of Baan Phraan Muan ("village of Muan the hunter") is located in a region which is entirely dependent on monsoon rains and has no water control. The vicinity is spotted by three or four swamps and ponds which are the sites of the swamp spirit cult and Bunbangfai, or the Rocket Festival. The settlement is comprised of separate categories: baan (a house, compound, or village) is separate from the wat (temple); naa (fields) surround the baan; at the edges of the naa are the byng (swamps and ponds) and beyond is the paa (forest). All of these areas are distinct yet correspond to each other to form a single living system and are understood as being in dynamic relationship to one another. Houses are constructed and have named attributes which refer to spiritual essences. For example house pillars saaw haeg and saaw khwan (first threshold and spiritual essence threshold) divide the major rooms separating spaces occupied by parents, son-in-law and daughter, and guests. According to van Esterik, there is a complex of food offered to the guardian spirits during the installation of a house. On one occasion an eye-level altar in the northeast corner of the new compound was decorated with red and white flags and flowers. The spirit was offered incense and conical offerings of folded banana leaves and water. On four miniature plates were betelnut, sour and spicy fish with rice, sweets, and water. During ritual occasions the front and right of the spirit house on the ground is a pig's head which is flanked by a whole fish on the left and a whole chicken on the right. Dishes of meat curry and red and white boiled desserts were in front of the pig's head.2 This configuration of offerings to house spirits appears to be quite stable throughout the history of Southeast Asia according to Löffler.3 He has proposed that this represents a tripartite universe: the earth symbolized by the pig's head, between the sky, symbolized by the bird; and water identified with the fish. The village cosmos, however, organizes these realms significantly by those beings who are appropriated as food.4 Categories of bun (merit), and baab (demerit) are used by villagers when dealing with the monks. Gifts, primarily of food, to the monks are said to produce a "happy state of mind and bun." "But the social unit engaging in merit making need not be the individual- it may be a family, a household or a kin grouping, or even the entire village" (Tambiah, 1970: 54). Bun and baab are sought or avoided in order to achieve the practical result of enjoying a successful and happy life in this world. The operations of bun and baab are understood to occur on the level of spiritual reality. Although they operate at a spiritual level, bun and baab are seen as important for the intimate workings of material existence. Transfer of additional merit primarily attained through feeding the monks is understood to feed the spirits of ancestors and other spiritual beings. 10</page><page sequence="6">Journal of Ritual Studies 14(1) 2000 All of these spirits are intimately associated with the human group, and some are crucial for its material well being. Winjan, from the Pali concept of virmcma (consciousness), and khwan , a Thai word meaning spirit, essence or soul, are distinct parts of a human being. "Khwan is associated with life and the vicissitudes of life; winjan is associated with death and the vicissitudes after death. Both are spiritual essences that animate life; the khwan actively and the winjan passively, or rather the former as the variable substance, and the latter as permanent. Their roles are reversed after death" (Tambiah, 1970: 59). Human life is not completely a reality of this world, but continues on other planes and in other modes through the action of spiritual beings. Human beings are in constant contact with these beings through ritual activity. The monk, while expressing a way of life opposed to the householder, is in regular reciprocal relations with the laity. First, village monks are usually of local origin and so have families near their wat. The wat is normally local and supported by lay congregations. Second, and more important for this essay, are the system of food relationships between the monks and the laity. Food knowledge and gift giving are primarily the responsibility of women. "In rural Thai society people control others by feeding them. Food transactions define social relationships among humans and between humans and other classes of beings" (van Esterik, 1986:201). Women process, prepare, and usually present food offerings. They offer monks cooked rice on their early morning rounds. On holy days they supplement the rice with the best food dish they can afford- usually a meat or fish curry, stir fried vegetables, or sweet desserts. Food is served in the best bowl and is kept by the family for this specific purpose. No one may sniff or taste the dishes before they are presented to the monks. "If lay persons smelled or tasted the dishes before presenting them to the monks, they might loose their intention to give freely and completely, experiencing a degree of reluctance in giving delicious food" (van Esterik, 1986: 204). Food offerings also act as temporal markers. In the morning monks receive cooked food; at the noon day fast food is given in raw form. Raw food and uncooked food is also given to the monks at the beginning (July) and end (October) of the rainy season retreat ( vassa ) and New Year celebration. Raw food is often presented by males. Feeding monks is the most common merit making activity and is primarily the function of women. "On the whole...merit making through gift giving is of more value than merit making through the observance of Buddhistic precepts and the pursuit of Buddhistic ethical aims" (Tambiah, 1970: 148). These acts highlight the respective positions of men and women. Men labor agriculturally yet can directly interact with the monks. Women labor to cook food yet cannot come into direct contact with the monks. In addition, types of food given during the year correspond to agricultural cycles of rice farming. Boys going into monkhood generally understand it as making merit for themselves and their family and remain monks usually only during vassa, or the retreat during the rainy season. During this time the boy becomes somewhat familiar with the Buddhist canon. Becoming a monk in itself however has a regenerative aspect. "The older generation persuades its youth temporarily to renounce its vitality and sexual potency and undergo an ascetic regimen. In a sense, it is the sacrifice of this human energy that produces ethical vitality which can counter karma and suffering" (Tambiah, 1970: 259). This dramatizes a central paradox of village Buddhism which honors the constraints of monastic life as a way to accumulate human creative energies which become a source of social and agricultural regeneration. There is a creative exchange of energies between the laity and monastic elements of the village. Food, given by women, is transformed by its consumption into the contained male ascetic energy of monastic life. Monastic energy in the wat is 11</page><page sequence="7">Journal of Ritual Studies 14Í 1) 2000 distributed by the bun/baab system to the laity and, in tum, to other forms of life including agriculture. Feeding relationships, however, are not simply relegated to those between human groups. Lay feeding activity toward monks is part of a larger conceptual field which includes ritual feeding of thêwadã (deities), phii (ghosts), and guardian spirits. One of the principle activities of villagers is transferring merit to their ancestors. During Wan Naw the dead are allowed to visit the living while monks perform ceremonies in the cemetery. In September Bun khaw saak, which means "merit with puffed rice," is staged. Each household puts packages of puffed rice on the ground near the wat compound for the ancestors. Generally puffed rice is symbolically opposed to raw rice. Puffing rice renders the grain incapable of reproducing and is therefore an appropriate food for the dead. For example puffed rice with sugar is given to paddy fields so the guardian spirit of the field and one's dead parents will guard the crop. On the other hand raw rice is used in marriage rites. Puffed rice is connected with death and rituals to the ancestors, while raw rice is associated with life, fertility, and regeneration. Different foods operate to regenerate distinct realms of existence. Rituals for ancestors regularly take place during household rituals where small trays of bananas, coconut, boiled rice, meat dishes, sweets, and occasionally whiskey are set (van Esterik, 1986: 202). Phii, or ghosts, are ancestors in one of the Buddhist hells or are free floating spirits between rebirth states. Ancestors are not worshipped but placated through feeding. The impetus for feeding deceased relatives sometimes comes in the form of a dream where the ancestor tells a villager that it is hungry and request that the monks be fed so they can obtain merit. Women then prepare additional food for the monks and through a ritual called kraut nam, in which water is poured from one vessel to another, they thereby share extra merit (bun) with their ancestors. From this example it is clear that feeding monks involves a host of beings which occupy different realms. Interpretation, in this case through dreams, necessitates appropriate feeding activity. In Central Thailand an elaborate ritual, called Sāat Thai, is held for three days in September which reunites the village members who reside elsewhere. During this time the souls of the dead return to the earth. Men and boys present to the monks large amounts of food including raw rice and fruit which has been prepared by the women. This resembles the first fruits ritual where the best harvest is offered to the temple. Two special dishes are made for this ritual. First is krayasat which is cooked new rice, peanuts, sesame seeds, dried rice, puffed rice, and coconut held together by palm sugar or sweetened condensed milk. Women make this dish communally and young people present it to elder relatives. Krayasat combines three types of rice (new, dried, and puffed) which all have distinct symbolic value with reference agriculture, monks, and ancestors. This dish nourishes a wide community of eaters from monks to phii combining appropriate foods. This dish is made at the exact time of the year when it is possible to combine all of these ingredients. The second dish, kanom chin, is a fine rice noodle with sour and spicy fish sauce. This is a favorite food of phii and is offered to guardian spirits when they are treated as phii. The fine noodles are enjoyed by those phii who have tiny holes for a mouth.5 For Tambiah there is, "...a pattern of alteration between 'ascetic' Buddhism and 'festive' Buddhism, the former prominent during the period of rains (when monks are in retreat and the elders are full of thoughts of salvation) and the latter prominent from the end of rains (when the monks emerge, the old are presenting gifts, and the young are participating in fairs and collective merit making)" (Tambiah, 1970: 160). After harvest and just before it rains, the bun phraawes, or thanksgiving rites, begin. These rites follow three phases; first, is the human communion with natural forces; second, is the invitation and propitiation of the thêwadã ("divine angels") which requires the uppakrut to act as mediator; third is the merit making by reciting and listening to the great deeds of the Buddha. A ceremonial procession complete with guns, music of bamboo flutes and drums, and flags with pictures of nang thoranee (goddess of the earth), the mermaid, 12</page><page sequence="8">Journal of Ritual Studies 14t lì 2000 and the crocodile, winds its way through the hamlet and fields until it arrives at the pond. Words of renunciation and selflessness spoken during the sermon are seen as endowing participants with merit thus ensuring a "good and healthy life" and abundant rain. Uppakrut is a naga or serpent spirit who is the enemy of mara. He is invited out of the pond to safeguard the proceedings. "What was interpreted as 'invitation' by the villagers seems to me the taming and conversion of the naga or spirit of the water to Buddhism" (Tambiah, 1970: 172). Bun phraawes rites recruit the power of uppakrut to protect Buddhism and human society by granting life giving rain for agricultural success. The naga world is called on to fulfill its part in the intimate workings of the material world. A successful harvest requires the generous activity of these beings in the realm of humans. Monastic involvement in this festival activates other forces tied to agriculture, particularly rain and water. There are primarily two guardian spirits; tapubaan (grandparent or ancestor of the village), and chao phau phraa khao (honored father monk dressed in white). Tapu is the owner of the village, the original founder, and owner of the land. Chao phau is the guardian of the wat. Tapu eats chicken, pork, liquor, and curries: he is a meat eater. Chao phau is offered only pawan (rice mixed with sugar): he is vegetarian. These spirits are the guardians of communal property and have crucial power to ensure agricultural abundance. Twice a year, before plowing and again after harvest, villagers assemble to propitiate these spirits (Tambiah, 1970: 269). The distinction between a meat eating, and therefore unclean, guardian spirit of the village and the vegetarian guardian spirit of the wat is appreciated by residents of the village. Before so simple a dichotomy is drawn between wat and village however it is also true that food gifts, which gain more merit, are the more costly dishes of meat. These are often given to monks and occasionally to the Buddha image. Meat however, while being more costly and therefore, as a gift to the monks, accumulates more merit, is also considered an unclean food because it comes from the violence of killing an animal In some parts of Thailand monks are not given meat dishes. Van Esterik has argued that guardian spirits do not fit neatly into a single category (van Esterik, 1982). At times they are seen as phii peta who are humans reborn as suffering ghosts in the realms of animals and asuras (demons). They cannot hear the Buddha's preaching and so rely on the merit transferred from humans through food. Peta are terrifying beings described in sermons and illustrated in the preaching hall. One does not need to feed them but they only need a small amount of merit to be reborn in a higher realm. According to the description of subhells in the Trai Phum, phii are guardian spirits whose powers are not specified. Whether they are good or bad depends on the amount of merit accumulated at the time of death. "Guardian spirits addressed as phii are described as immoral and untrustworthy, emotional, unreasonable, and, just like humans, a little stupid" (van Esterik, 1982: 6). White tells us that peta are understood to be those who suffer in death after an unmeritorious life. As human beings peta did not participate in responsible food exchange and therefore exist in death as large-bellied spirits with needle sized mouths. Their existence is entirely dependent on the gifts of food given by human beings. At other times guardian spirits are referred to as thêwadã, or those spirits who live in heaven because of merit accumulated in their past lives. They reside below Indra's heaven on Mt. Meru and are servants of the suffering world. Nine thêwadã also have jurisdiction over different parts of a house. Doors and ladders, domestic animals, food and stored rice, marriage, garden plots, and bodies of water are their realms in the village in addition to being guardians of the baan and wat.6 Not only do they oversee the means of sustenance but, according to one abbot, guardian spirits also are worthy of respect because they have finished the eighth perfection and are stream winners.7 Although guardian spirits dominate the ritual scene their requirements are determined by the nature of their death (whether natural or sudden) and what is wanted. Although classification of guardian spirits is both experientially and textually bound, analysis of correct action toward them is ambiguous. Van Esterik 13</page><page sequence="9">Journal of Ritual Studies 14Í1) 2000 argues that this ambiguity necessitates individual interpretation.8 Of critical importance is the interpretive activity of each villager to ascertain the nature of a changing sphere of relationships. Gifts of food are not taken lightly and correct interjection of gifts to the correct being at particular times necessitates constant attention to signals which come in the form of dreams, festival and human life cycles, monastic rounds, etc. Great attention is paid to the processes of an interaction of lives through food. The Bunbangfai or Rocket Festival is concerned with rain and occurs just before the paddy agricultural cycle. It is based on a myth of the origin of swamps and rivers, on the relationship of humans to animals, and society to nature. Although considered non-Buddhist there is a strong correlation between ordination and rainmaking rituals. Moreover the rockets are constructed and stored at the wat and are blessed by the monks. The first part of the ritual is ordination (bun buad ) in which water is poured on the heads of the young men through a naga vessel. Just as the naga releases water onto the monk during ordination to increase his sacredness so may rain fall on the fields to increase their fertility,9 Second there is a rocket procession (hae bangfai) through the village to the edge of the swamp much like the thanksgiving ceremony of Bun phraawes. Third is the firing of rockets, which is auspicious. The straighter and higher it flies means the more prosperous the harvest will be. After the firing ritual license takes place with mud throwing. Monks are included in this activity which is likened to European Carnival (Faure in Berval, 1959). Mud appears here as symbolic of the fertile union of water and earth required in agricultural life. Agricultural practices as the mixing of elements for sustenance, shed light on the analogous understanding of different beings intimately involved in a total living process. Although earth and water occupy separate realms of reality their joining (as in mud, swamp, and the rice paddy) have a direct and material outcome. Moreover, interpretive activity is central to the Rocket Festival. The path of the rocket which has been manufactured and blessed by the monks directly indicates the success or failure of the economic basis of the community. Monks, laity, naga, and guardian spirits participate in intimate relationships. Likewise food results from the mixing of different elements. Food is the fruit of an interactive cosmos. Eating transforms food into a human body and therefore a gift of food between distinct realms of beings, as between human and guardian spirits, perpetuates a total living system. The ritual moment (beginning of the planting season) correlates with its ritual location (near the swamp, or at the boundary between earth and water) to create a meaningful occasion with respect to beings which populate these regions. The world of the naga is a watery one upon which human life is predicated. The actions of phii, thêwadã, and guardian spirits must be interpreted and appropriately reacted to for continued prosperity. These beings, and their interaction, are necessary for complete material success. In addition there are other spirits of mountains, rivers, trees, etc. which can act malevolently. There are spirits of rice fields, sometimes thought of as the original cultivator of that plot of land, which can attack villagers. Food, as demonstrated, is the result and means of a perpetually interacting cosmos. It is not so much an essence of the universe as a process which necessarily transmutes to other forms of being. Food naturally embodies within its existence the properties operative in a relational universe. Tambiah, in discussing a central myth of the creation of rice (which we will discuss latter), says, "...I do not want to argue that religion is a metaphysical projection of the rumblings of the stomach. On the contrary, I use rice as a point of reference in order to suggest that the primary and basic interest of the villagers- the production, consumption and distribution of food- is so impregnated with moral and ethical conceptions that this myth and rite provide a miniature view of the universe in which nature, society and the deities combine and play their parts" (Tambiah, 1970: 351). This passage expresses how a cosmological interactions that go into the formation of food highlight 14</page><page sequence="10">Journal of Ritual Studies 14Í 1 ) 2000 responsible human conduct with reference to a wide array of beings. m The Trai Phum Phra Ruang, or the Three Worlds According to King Ruang, was produced by Phya Lithai, heir apparent to the throne of the central Thai kingdom of Sukhothai-Srisachanalai, in about 1345 AD. Lithai's purpose was to use a cosmological format to more directly sermonize to his future subjects.10 It seems that his effort has paid off because this text is widely known throughout rural Thailand. According to Reynolds and Reynolds, in the introduction to the Trai Phum , the textual cosmological tradition had its origin in Thailand with this text. "At the level of spiritual activity the cosmological orientation continues to inform many aspects of contemporary practice... 77ie Trai Phum Phra Ruang is a sermon that culminates a long history of visionary and cosmological orientation within the Theravada Buddhist tradition" (Reynolds and Reynolds, 1982: 25 &amp; 27). The text begins with a description of the four modes of birth and rebirth into the three worlds.11 The first is being egg-bom as snakes, chickens, birds, and fish. Second is to be womb-bom in which one comes forth in a bubble that arises from a murky liquid and is wrapped in a placenta as with elephants, horses, oxen, and buffalo. Third is to be moisture-bom which is from leaves, pollen of a lotus, from decaying grass and meat, from body sweat and slough, as do worms, insects, caterpillars, gnats, mosquitoes, and fish. These first three grow up gradually but the fourth, instantaneous birth, is when one is bom complete and in need of nothing for growth. Examples of this are the brahma and devatā bom into hell. Hell is where birth and rebirth occurs. All beings bom into hell are bom with all twenty-eight material factors which appear together at one moment.12 Descriptions of modes of birth effectively typologize beings of phenomenal existence so as to facilitate an understanding of their appropriate mode of interaction. The text also highlights how distinct modes are interactive spheres of reality. Of the primary factors there are several correspondences between material and bodily realities. The earth factor constitutes the skin and bones; the water factor constitutes the liquid that flows back and forth in the body; the fire factor is the hot fire that constitutes the blood in the body; and the wind factor is the wind that maintains the shape of the body and gives it movement. In addition sensual factors constitute sense aspects of the body. Other factors of direct interest are the vitality factor which is the life which inheres within the material factors and intimation of the body factor which is known via the body (Reynolds and Reynolds, 1982: 62). Humans are not bom instantaneously and require sustenance for growth. This is similar to the doctrinal Theravadan view, discussed earlier, which conceives of the lives of all beings as a process of interactions involving their situation, material properties, and action of past lives. At the beginning of human life the kalala (embryo) is very small, clear, and beautiful, like sesame oil. The eight material factors (earth, water, fire, air, body, sex, mind-basis, vitality) are bom of food with nutritive essence from the mother. The sex is determined from the day of kalala formation. After seven days the kalala becomes like water in which meat is washed and is called abbuda. After seven more days abbuda is like molten lead in a pot and is called pesi. After seven more days it has hardened into a lump like the egg of a chicken and is called ghana. After seven more days it has grown five protuberances like warts and is called the warted pacasakha. After 42 days the fetus is complete and has all the physical requirements for being human. The food that the mother has eaten previously lay underneath the baby and the food she has eaten more recently is above it. The fetus finds itself encapsulated in putrefying food and the womb is a disgusting and revolting place; "...it is damp and is full of bad smells caused by the eighty broods of worms and 15</page><page sequence="11">Journal of Ritual Studies 14(1)2000 parasites that live there. This evil-smelling place is where they breed, get old, die, and are left after they die...[they (parasites)] cover the fetus like a skin disease-it is like the worms that live in rotten fish or those that live in filthy feces" (Reynolds and Reynolds, 1982: 1 18). The umbilical cord is attached to the mother's abdomen and nutrients flow in blood and lymph which runs down the baby's body. Digestion of food requires that the mother's stomach (the site of the womb) be hot. The baby is also very hot but is not consumed because of the action of merit. A human's first experiences of life are miserable foretelling it of the suffering world into which it will enter. Food, at once necessary for fetal life, is also the cause of human suffering. Unlike devota and brahmo, human existence requires vigilance with respect to material properties of life. The Trai Phum concludes with an account of cosmic destruction. Animate beings in the thirty-one realms are impermanent and perish. The utter destruction of the kappa (cosmic age) is accomplished by fire, water, and wind.13 The fire consumes the people who have done evil deeds with their bodies; mouths; minds; those who do not know any merit or Dhamma at all; those who do not respect their fathers and mothers; those who do not respect monks, brahmins, and others who follow the Dhamma; those who treat their brothers, sisters, relatives, and friends in a proper way; and those who treat one another like deer or horses, and chase, hurt, and kill one another. Evil deeds done by these people have disastrous effects upon the world. Rice will grow only high enough for oxen to eat it, and there will be no rain; there will only be the sound of thunder. Rice, all vegetation and water sources will dry as if they were scorched by fire. People who have accumulated merit will be reborn in another hell where the consuming fire does not reach. Then there will appear two rising suns that resemble the faces of phii phrai, or evil spirits, who capture those people who have not yet died and crush them in their mouths. More suns appear until there are seven in all and the heat is such that it even bums up the mountains. Destraction of the world is perpetuated by actions of people who failed to appreciate the interconnected nature of the cosmos. People who lack proper conduct with reference to others have the effect of destroying rice, vegetation, and water which signals the end. After a long time it begins to rain. The drops are small at first but then become a continuous stream. The waters cover everything up to the world of the great brahma and remains steady. The winds begin to blow back and forth making ripples on the surface which changes into a frothy scum. After it is no longer scum it becomes kalała (embryo) like the water in which rice has been boiled. Then it changes into abbuda, which is like rice that has been boiled until it becomes like paste. Next it becomes pesi and then into ghana in which it forms lumps. Then it becomes a golden surface very beautiful. Not only does this passage describe a regenerative cosmological process in terms of cooking rice but it is also directly analogous to stages of fetal development. Just as the world is "cooked" back into existence so human life is "cooked" in the viscera of die mother.14 Cooking, along with eating, is a transformative activity of material necessity. Cooking transforms the elements of existence into something beautiful; that is something inherently reciprocal. So beautiful is this realm that the devatS descend as they did before. When the water dries and the soil becomes good, powdery, has good color, odor, and taste; "the nutritive essence it contains has a delicious taste like rice boiled in milk (Reynolds and Reynolds, 1982: 318). Brahma, who live in the highest realms but have exhausted their merit, descend to be born as humans in the instantaneous mode. They never eat any kind of food. They then become male and female and begin to test out the taste of the earth and because of this the rays which emit from their bodies disappear. When all is dark the sun and moon are created to light the earth. Then the stars appear for more light. Then seasons and divisions of the land appear. People born of this land eat the "nutritive essence of the earth." They become negligent and do not make merit as they should. The "nutritive essence of the earth" sinks down under the earth and then sprouts up in extensions of the earth that appear like young mushrooms. A creeper called badālatā, appears and is 16</page><page sequence="12">Journal of Ritual Studies 14C1) 2000 eaten in place of rice. After more negligence, a rice appears which grows by itself without husk or chaff and doesn'tneed to be pounded dried, or winnowed. When placed in a pot on three cooking stones called radiant stones the fire in them will flare up of its own accord. Other foods, if desired, will appear with the rice. At this point dirty feces appear and do evil to hands and feet, and their bodies become defiled. Then appear men and women, houses, rice storage facilities and rice itself becomes harder and harder to grow. People become more and more greedy and there are further divisions of the land. As devolution continues, a king is elected. Wise people know the world is impermanent and see that the more evil deeds that are done the more deplorable the conditions of life become. In other words they understand the connection between maintaining responsible relations and material success. They meditate, gather food from the forest, gather alms and cut off their greed to make merit. These are called brahmins. If at any time people do good and make merit the devota keep watch and take care that the sun, moon, and planets move as they should and that the wind, rain, and sunshine are appropriate for the season and that trees and herbs are still good medicine and that people's life spans increase. Eating the nutritive essence of a particular level of reality effectively identifies the eater with the place. The devolution of creation is inevitable in a world of sustenance. The action of beings other than humans assure a continued process of appropriate interaction (i.e. celestial and climatological activity are continued through the action of devota). Eating is shown to be the creative impetus for the creation of culture and giving food the basis for responsible interaction of meritorious activity. Tambiah closes his study of Boon Phraon Muan with a story of Nang Phrakosob, or rice, which is very close to the concluding chapter of the Trai Phum except that it is told from the point of view of the rice. First rice grew by itself in the garden of Phraya Wirupakha, the protector of heaven and earth. Each grain was five times the size of a fist and humans came and cut it and used it as their food. Next an old barren widow decided to build a bam, and while it was being built her merit caused rice to grow by itself under her bam. She was annoyed with the growth and beat the rice with a stick so the pieces broke and fell in many directions. Some pieces fell into the water and grew and were called Nang Phrakosob and she lived in the company of fish. Rice was angry and let people starve for 1,000 years. A rich young man was lost in the forest and heard of rice from a fish. He went to her intending to take a few grains to grow at home "to feed life and religion." Nang Phrakosob flew at him and he caught her leg "...and her fragrance spread in all directions" (Tambiah, 1970: 353). Thêwadã in the form of a golden deer and parrot, along with the fish, persuaded rice to accompany the young man back to humans to "sustain life and religion." One thousand years later a man of high rank who was filled with jealousy and only committed demerit, ordered that rice be put into a bam to be stored and sold. Nang Phrakosob fled to the mountain to live with Chao Rathi. An old couple (grandparents) tried in vain to clear the land and find rice. Again thêwadã cams and brought the old couple before Chao Rathi. They used gatha (sacred verses) to make rice feel as if she wanted to go with them. Chao Rathi broke rice into dark, white, ordinary, glutinous, annual, and monthly rice. Nang Phrakosob then breathed her last and died, and her flesh and skin turned into stones. "When religion is about to end Phraa Ariya Mettai ( Maitreya ) will be reborn in this world, and rice will also be reborn as khaw sali (wheat) to feed life and religion" (Tambiah, 1970: 354-355). The old couple had great success and enlisted the help of phii to assist in sprinkling sacred lustral water. They distributed the rice and taught people how to grow it. From that time rice has been well known but one must be careful to ask permission of rice to beat it or have buffaloes trample it. Offerings, and sacred verses are made to the rice. "Rice is both excellent and costly. Lord Buddha and rice were bom at the same time. Rice came along with religion...When one eats rice its results spread out...one can wish to be Indra, Brahma, rich man, ruler...one can wish to enter nirvana , to possess an excellent winjan (soul), to be reborn as Phraa Pachek Pothiyan (Pacceka Buddha)" (Tambiah, 1970: 356). 17</page><page sequence="13">Journal of Ritual Studies 14(1) 2000 Eating rice involves the consumer in a host of relationships with ancestors (the grandparents), thāvadā, phii, fish and other beings of the water, Chao Rathi, animals, etc. Physical growth and the human constitution are predicated on those actions of those who created the preceding world. Not only is eating a physical act of replenishing the human body but a mode of meaningfully orienting oneself within a total world view. The story sums it up best by saying that food came into being "to sustain life and religion;" both are part of a single fact of Thai village life. Food holds a central position in the creation of the world and in the process of devolution. Knowing the mechanisms of how the world came to be as it is allows one to act responsibly within a nexus of dynamic relationships which concretely represent and uphold phenomenal existence. It is eating which at base creates the corruption of existence yet it is also eating, and sharing food, which become the gift to extend an understanding of oneself to include the realities of beings which inhabit other levels of the cosmos. Although the world of the Thai village Buddhist is much more complex and vexing than that realm of pure being from which it devolved it is a more interconnected space which offers its inhabitant coherent opportunities to extend themselves by sharing the "nutritive essence of the earth." IV Scholarly discussions of materiality, food, and landscape have traditionally been the domain of natural sciences. More recently in fields such as Religion, with methodologies in the History of Religions (i.e., phenomenology and hermeneutics) there are attempts to deal with material factors of existence as conceptual realities. For all its flaws the now passe methodology of structuralism, tended to discuss food and feeding relationships, stressing the linguistic aspects of food as a system of codes,15 or as a an assemblage of binary oppositions more useful to think with than to consume.16 But structuralism holds a rather tight conceptual grid. Materiality seems to be an assumed reality for Lévi-Strauss who suggests that the social sciences can reduce other cultures to ours through science which stands outside culture as a "superior-sensibility" (Lévi- Strauss, 1982). Alternatively Theravadan Buddhists seem to organize life around what I will call a conceptual economy of reciprocal food giving. While being materially based, these food relationships involve a host of hidden factors which require constant scrutinization at village and doctrinal levels. As van Esterik has emphasized, it is the ambiguous nature of guardian spirits which requires that each of the members of the community interpret its place with reference to a host of factors. Ancestors, monks, spirits, animals, etc. all require the attention of participants much the same and for similar reasons as does an agricultural plot. Sustenance is the material basis of life "and religion." Attention to its interactive character requires an active interpretive life. Within the merit system it is the monk, in rural Thailand, who acts as the medium for accumulation. Monastic asceticism is seen as the willing avowal to sacrifice human energy for the purpose of regenerating a larger frame of life. The wat is the repository for merit accumulation which the villager may extend to other relationships such as ancestors, guardian spirits, and Naga. Paradoxically a renouncing life style is understood as having a regenerative influence on the material world. A central mechanism in the economy of the reciprocity of food gifts is the transmutation of substances. For example agricultural activity renders earth, water, sun, etc. into products for consumption. Included in this process are the actions of Naga, the spirits of fields, mountains, etc. and ancestors, to mention but a few. It is clear that human action, along with the actions of other beings constitute the basis of material life. Indeed without the action of spiritual beings communication between material realities 18</page><page sequence="14">Journal of Ritual Studies 14(1) 2000 would be physically impossible. In Thai Buddhism a view of human life as a closed system of interactions is meaningless. Human existence, like other existences, is made possible through the tangible interaction and transmutation of substances. Exactly the same dynamic has been suggested by Mus in his articulation of the cult of the soil and cosmic sacrifice. Total being is relegated to the stone upon which human energies transform the phenomenal world. Rain, food, social structure; Life itself, is encapsulated in devotion to the stone. The cosmic sacrifice and distribution of nutritive essence perpetuates the world. Participation in the essential features of being are required in the act of eating. Prajāpati and the stupa articulate a coherent system of life predicated on the reciprocity of food giving and receiving. It falls to the responsible interaction of humans to perpetuate this cycle. In doctrinal Buddhism material facts of existence have direct ethical implications. Most important is the system of correlation (paccayãkãra-naya) that empower the monk as a knower of matter (rüpaaññu). Complex connections between elements and the body, in fetal development, for example, situate human existence in a web of material factors. Much like the villager, the monk is intimately involved in a process of interpretation as a way of orienting ethically valid action in world of form. The monk knows his being is constituted by, and therefore intimately associated with, his physical location. Van Esterik points out that the scholastic preoccupation with constructing definitions of guardian spirits has missed one essential fact: they are not definable in any absolute sense. Interpretive activity is the day to day activity of the villager. Relationships to all manner of beings requires constant attention. Moreover interpretation of life constitutes meaningful orientation. This is analogous to monastic interpretive activity of a material world for purposes of achieving nibbšna. White discusses the importance of the transformative nature of relationships among peta. The food of humans, when these spirits attempt to consume it, is transformed into disagreeable substances such as blood, pus, worms, excrement, etc. (White, 1986: 199). Although eating is an activity common to different realms of beings, each level has its own form of sustenance. Human life is predicated both on the knowledge of transmutation of substance, as dramatized as in rice paddy agriculture and eating, and on the interpretation of the material world of reciprocal food exchanges. It appears that the central place afforded to the interpretation of matter for sustenance concerns is in substantial ways analogous to the labors of the scholar. Rather than the activity of an elite scholasticism, Buddhism of rural Thailand demonstrates the importance of the human interpretive activity as a significant aspect of human religious orientation within a constantly transforming material world. Endnotes 1 1 want to thank Frank Reynolds for introducing me to the work of Paul Mus during my time at the University of Chicago and for encouraging me to publish this piece, which is far outside my field of Mesoamerican Religions. The comparative issues of how religion is related to material life (i.e., land and food) have been well worth pursuing over these many years. See Arnold (1999) as a starting point to adjudicate the similarities and differences between the Thai and Aztec cases. 2This was a rite witnessed by van Esterik (1982) on the occasion of a house initiation. 3For example Löffler (1968, 21) records an image of a scene from the death ritual in Shangtung which has the exact configuration that van Esterik describes in rural Thailand. 19</page><page sequence="15">Journal of Ritual Studies 14(1)2000 4These appear to be sacrifices to those beings which inhabit both of these realms. The fish for those hovering near birth and the chicken for those in death. 5van Esterik, 1986, 203. Also see van Esterik (1980) for a discussion of the paradoxical role of sweetened condensed milk in Thai religion. 6Jayamangala over houses; nagararĘa over doors, forts, and ladders; Devathera over domestic animals; Jayasabana over food and stored rice; Gandharva over marriage; Dharmahorā over garden plots; and Dasadhāra over bodies of water (Van Esterik, 1982,7). 7This is to say guardian spirits has special status among other spirits, according to this abbot's interpretation, and are more potently able to intercede on the behalf of human beings. 8"In our [scholastic] concern with classifying and defining p/w and thêwadã perhaps we have missed the most significant point about guardian spirits. By their ambiguous position, guardian spirits are capable of interpretation in more than one way." (Van Esterik, 1982,4) *This is reminiscent of Mus' analysis of water being poured on the stone to propitiate the spirits of the earth for rain. In this way there is a correspondence between a monk's body and the stone of the earth cult. Both are microcosmic expressions of a cosmos of interactions. 10Reynolds and Reynolds explain in their introduction that Lithai had a direct interest in developing a cosmological structure which instigated the king in the central religious position, as Mahadhammaraja (Great Dhamma King) he associated himself directly with the Bodclisatta ideal. It appears that when Lithai achieved the thrown he undertook a major revival of his power base through religious charisma. "These are the world of sensual desire, the world with a remnant of material factors, and the world without material factors. 12These are earth, water, fire, and wind; eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body; the objects of sight, sound, odor, taste, and tangibility; femininity and masculinity; the mind-basis, vitality, and bodily nutriment; definiteness, the intimation of body, the intimation of language; lightness, pliancy, and adaptability; and growth, continuity, aging, and impermanence. 13These events correspond to types of destruction (fire, wind, and water) and jhāna levels of reality. Even the worst destruction is only capable of reaching the fourth jhmic level. When fire destroys eleven levels of the world of sensual desire and the world with only a remnant of material factors which are the three levels of the brahma world are destroyed, all of which are the first jhāna. When water destroys it includes the realms of the second jhāna. When wind destroys it includes the realms of the third jhāna. 14This correlation is the insight of the translators. Reynolds and Reynolds say, "[i]t is interesting to compare the process described in this segment of the text with the discussion of the development of the human embryo described in Chapter 5. In both cases the same series of technical terms beginning with kalala are used, though the comparisons that serve to clarify the meaning differ slightly." (1982, 314, footnote 12) 15Douglas (1972) applies the categorical significance of food to disparate cultural settings which to her mind illuminate structures of culture. 16Levi-Strauss (1970) has often been criticized for leaving out historical depth in his studies of myth. My contention is however that in his discussion of the mythic nature of food categories he does not take seriously enough the facts and situations in which foods grow and are propagated as well as how they are understood by indigenous communities. 20</page><page sequence="16">Journal of Ritual Studies 14C1Ì 2000 References Arnold, P.P. 1999 Eating Landsccape: Aztec and European Occupation ofTlalocan.
