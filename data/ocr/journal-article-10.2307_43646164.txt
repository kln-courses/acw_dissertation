DR V. KARAGEORGHIS Mycenaean and Near-Eastern Aspects of Late Bronze Age Religion at Kition In 1974 and 1975 the Department of Antiquities of the Cyprus Republic excavated two more temples in the sacred area (Site II), at the northernmost part of Kition. These temples, 4 and 5, were originally constructed at the very end of the 1 3th century B.C. They are of a Near Eastern architectural plan, with a holy of holies and a courtyard. In the middle of the courtyard of temple 4 there is an altar and a table of offerings. The table of offerings of temple 5 was built against the parapet wall separating the courtyard from the holy of holies. Temple 4 was built of ashlar blocks of stone, whereas temple 5 was built of rubble. In the holy of holies a hoard of ivory objects was found. They include a plaque in the form of a lion in a flying gallop, a plaque in the ajourée technique with a Bes on both sides, and a pipe for smoking. The plaque with the Bes figure was originally intended to form part of a piece of furniture. It has several engrav- ed signs of the Cypro-minoan script on both sides of its base. The pipe is also inscribed with signs of the same script. It is suggested that this was a pipe for smoking opium, a custom known in antiquity and appropriate for a temple of the goddess of fertility who was worshipped here, as terracotta figurines may demonstrate. There are indications that opium was exported from Cyprus to Egypt during the Late Bronze Age. In temple 5 various skulls of oxen were found in the courtyard. Other objects include a clay-ball with signs of the Cypro-minoan script engraved on it before firing, a bone stilus, clay wall brackets or incense- burners and a cylindrical vase with two opposed perforations at its lowest part. There are two large signs of the Cypro-minoan script on both sides. It is suggested that this vase, ļike similar vases from Crete, was used by the worshippers for inhaling the smokes of opium. The divinity who was worshipped in temple 5 was a god of fertility. Thus we have in the same area twin temples of two divinities, a male and a female, separated by a street. An eleventh century deposit was found in the holy of holies of temple 5. It included numerous miniature vases and three fragmentary anthropomorphic masks in clay, decorated with paint or engravings. Both temples were re-used during the Phoenician period (mid-9th century B.C.), their plan having been modified.</page></plain_text>
