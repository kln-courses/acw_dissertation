<plain_text><page sequence="1">Arnobius of Sicca, The Case against the Pagans. 2 vols. Translated by GEORGE E. MCCRACKEN. ("Ancient Christian Writers," Nos. 7 and 8.) West- minster, Md.: The Newman Press, 1949. Pp. 659. $6.75. Professor McCracken's translation of Arnobius in two volumes represents numbers seven and eight in the new series of translations called "Ancient Christian Writers: The Works of the Fathers in Translation." Volume I of the present work contains, in addition to St. Jerome's testimonies on Arnobius and the author's Introduction, three books of Arnobius: Book I, on various pagan charges against Christianity; Book II, on the method and results of the ancient philosophies; Book III, on the anthropomorphic conception of the pagan gods. Volume II contains the remaining four books of Arnobius: Book IV, on pagan myths and various features of the pagan cults; Book V, on the two famous myths of Jupiter Elicius and of Attis and on the Greek mysteries; Book VI, on the special features of pagan worship, the temples and images; Book VII, on sacrifices and ceremonials. The Introduction in VTolume I contains valuable information on such topics as the name of Arnobius, his birthplace, the title of his work, the date of its composition, Arnobius' conversion, and the relations between Lactantius and Arnobius. Arnobius' work, which is both an apology for Chris- tianity and a polemical attack on heathenism and its practices, is difficult to translate. His doctrine concern- ing God, the world, and the human soul is not always correctly expressed, and there are errors in his Chris- tology. Hence serious problems face the translator when he tries to convey the ideas contained in such important technical words as nunmen, deus, divus, divinus, daenotnes, sacrazinenta, religio, imnpius, and virtus. The indiscriminate use of "God" for numeit, deus, divus, and dizinus, and the constant translation of daenzones by "demons" are convenient procedures, but in my opinion these translations do not always convey the intended meaning of the original. In translating and interpreting Arnobius, the translator must also keep in mind that this early apologist was a professor of rhetoric, and that his declamatory pathos and affected and involved</page><page sequence="2">10 THE CLASSICAL WEEKLY phraseology can lead to serious misrepresentations. Professor McCracken has been careful enough to dis- tinguish rhetorical bombast from sober fact, but he does succumb at times to the contagious enticement of Arnobius' rhetorical power, with the unhappy result that the English version becomes stiff and artificial. The "modern" in McCracken's translation is repre- sented by such needless and unsuitable colloquialisms as 'cutting-off of" (I, 77), "guzzled the . . . cups" (II, 411), "hitch in the performance" (II, 508), and "small fry" (1, 185). A final observation: The two thousand footnotes and references, technical for the most part and sometimes nugatory, can easily become a source of irritation, even in a scholarly monograph, because of their bulk and the fact that they interrupt the continuity of the translation. But for the benefit of the average layman or student who will read the translation many of the oft-repeated mythological references could profitably have been omitted in favor of occasional notes on the questions which Arnobius raises when he discusses such natural phenomena as the cause of rain, the size of stars, the composition of the moon, its reflected light, and the like. In spite of these shortcomings, Professor McCracken's carefully prepared translation is an important and valu- able contribution to the series of Ancient Christian Writers. The undertaking was gigantic; the results as a whole justify the undertaking. JOHN N. HRITZU tUNlVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME</page></plain_text>
