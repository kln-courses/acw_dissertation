Though this tradition persists in the work of contemporary dualists, behaviorists, and eliminativists, the study of animal minds is very much alive and well. Indeed in recent years cognitive ethology-an approach to the study of animal minds which com- bines the representational/computational framework of cognitive science with the evolutionary concerns of classical ethology-has become something of a boom industry. In their excellent recent book, Species ofMind, Colin Allen and Marc Bekoff provide a sustained and we think largely successful defense of the aims and methods of cognitive ethology in the light of the objections and concerns that have emerged over the past thirty years or so. In what follows, we start by outlining the central features of this defense. We then consider two of the more philosophically intriguing claims that Allen and Bekoff make. The first is that there exist behavioral criteria which warrant the attribution of con- scious states to nonhuman organisms. The second is that cognitive ethology can play a major role in extending the naturalization project in the philosophy of mind. There are a number of parts to A&amp;B's defense of cognitive ethology. One central strand consists in providing a clear and systematic articulation of the main tenets of the ethological research program (Chapters 1-3 and 9). In doing so, they highlight and dissolve many of the misapprehensions which critics are guilty of when discussing cognitive ethology. So, for example, by making explicit the inferential practices of cognitive ethologists, A&amp;B are able to show that the attribution of intentional states to animals is not a mistaken form of anthropomorphism but rather a kind of inference to the best explanation. ? British Society for the Philosophy of Science 2000</page><page sequence="2">376 Review A second central strand of A&amp;B's defense of cognitive ethology involves responding to the myriad of 'in principle' objections that have been leveled against the possibility of a mature science of animal minds. Some of these objections come from scientists working within comparative psychology and the behavioral sciences (chapter 4). So, for example, A&amp;B consider and reject the familiar behaviorist argument that positing mental representations in order to explain animal behavior is both unparsimonious and unnecessary because a stimulus-response psychology is explanatorily adequate. In respond- ing to this criticism, A&amp;B successfully argue-as Chomsky did for human psychology-that one needs to posit internal representational states in order to explain 'stimulus-free' behaviors-behaviors that are not directly under the control of the stimulus conditions to which the organism is exposed. Other objections that A&amp;B consider come from philosophical discussions of animal cognition (Chapter 5). For instance, they address arguments--formulated by Dennett and Stich-which purport to show that a science of animal behavior ought not to posit internal representational states since the content of animal mental states cannot be specified with sufficient precision or determinacy. In response, A&amp;B argue convincingly that while it may be difficult to specify precisely the content of such states, there is no reason to suppose that it is impossible. In our view, A&amp;B do an excellent job of undermining these and other objections to cognitive ethology and the overall moral is clear: there are, at present, no 'in principle' grounds for denying the possibility of a science of animal minds. Of course, as A&amp;B are well aware, the mere fact that there are no satisfac- tory in principle objections to cognitive ethology doesn't mean that it will prove to be a successful research program in the long run. Nevertheless, a third strand in their defense of cognitive ethology-a fascinating discussion of research on social play and antipredatory vigilance-provides some reason for optimism (Chapters 6-7). By discussing the wide range of phenomena that cognitive ethological theories are already able to address, A&amp;B succeed in illustrating the explanatory strides that some investigators have already made as a result of adopting a cognitive approach to the study of animal behavior. Presumably this provides at least prima facie reason to think that cognitive ethologists will continue in the future to produce plausible explana- tions of various types of animal behavior. As should be clear, we are impressed by much of what A&amp;B say in defense of the methods and practices of cognitive ethology. But we find their attempt to assuage concerns about the study of consciousness in animals far less persuasive (Chapter 8). In discussing consciousness their goal is not to pro- vide a theory of what consciousness is or to define 'consciousness' -indeed they explicitly eschew these tasks-but to undermine the skeptic who would maintain that the attribution of consciousness to non-human animals is never</page><page sequence="3">The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science 377 scientifically defensible (p. 143). Their strategy for achieving this goal is to argue that a specific kind of behavioral evidence warrants the attribution of conscious experience--phenomenal states or qualia-to the organism (p. 147). Roughly put, A&amp;B's idea is that if an organism manifests a capacity to detect misinformation in its perceptual states, then we have abductive grounds for thinking that the organism in question is conscious. In developing this point A&amp;B focus primarily on perceptual illusions where subjects are able to distinguish between how things appear to them and how they actually are. So, for example, they discuss the (in)famous Muller-Lyer illusion where individuals perceive a line with inward point- ing arrowheads, &gt;-&lt;, as longer than a line with outward pointing arrow- heads, &lt;-&gt;, even though they know that the two lines are the same length. A&amp;B maintain that if one admits the existence of this kind of phenomena, then 'one is committed to the distinction between the way things appear to the organism and its beliefs about them' (p.152). Moreover, they suggest that: attributing conscious, subjective experiences may provide the best explanation of the ability of some organisms to make this distinction. Evidence for consciousness (but not its definition or analysis) lies in its ability to account for the separation of perception from judgment (p. 153). Though it is, of course, possible that attributing consciousness to some organisms will turn out to be the best explanation of the capacity to detect misinformation, we doubt that it is a particularly plausible claim to make. First, it's clear that there are other explanations of this capacity that do not require the attribution of consciousness. So, for example, one kind of explanation of Muller-Lyer-type illusions-familiar from the work of Fodor, Pylyshyn, and others-runs roughly as follows: a) The cognitive systems responsible for producing the perceptual states (what Fodor calls input systems) are encapsulated from the systems responsible for producing judgments or beliefs (the central systems) in the following sense: they do not have access to all the information that is available to the central systems. b) Moreover, the central systems have access to the perceptual states produced by the input systems so that they are able to produce judgments about the accuracy of these representational states. This proposal appears to explain, at least in outline, the capacity for detect- ing misrepresentation in perceptual states. But notice that the notion of con- sciousness does not enter into the explanation. Further, it is a familiar and empirically plausible kind of cognitivist account that need only invoke explanatory resources-such as information and information-processing mechanisms-that A&amp;B think cognitive ethologists require for other</page><page sequence="4">378 Review explanatory purposes anyway. It is, therefore, far from clear that the best explanation of the capacity to detect misinformation need invoke qualia. A second, related problem with A&amp;B's proposal is that it's far from clear how invoking consciousness is supposed to even help us explain the capacity to detect misinformation let alone furnish us with the best explanation. On the face of it, merely positing consciousness does not explain this capacity since an organism might have qualia even if it couldn't detect misinforma- tion. So, at most, qualia can only be part of the explanation. But it's not even clear how qualia can form a non-redundant part of the account of how organisms detect misinformation. As A&amp;B characterize the phenomenon, what needs to be explained is the fact that some organisms are capable of judging their own perceptual states to be inaccurate representations of distal objects. Presumably, in order to explain this phenomenon, we need to posit (at least) two sorts of representational (or intentional) states--perceptual states and judgments. After all, precisely what needs to be explained is the fact that judgments can represent perceptual states as inaccurate representa- tions. Moreover, presumably we need to posit some range of processes or mechanisms that permit judgments about the accuracy of perceptual states to occur while precluding perceptual states from being revised as a result of such judgments. But once we help ourselves to these resources, it's entirely unclear what work the notion of consciousness or qualia can do in the expla- nation of misinformation detection. Clearly, the mere claim that the percep- tual states or judgments possess phenomenal properties does no work in explaining it. But if this is so, then how can positing qualia be a non-redundant part of the explanation of misinformation detection? A&amp;B provide no indica- tion of how the explanation is supposed to go and, to be honest, we have been unable to think of any plausible way of fleshing out the proposal. Another aspect of A&amp;B's discussion that we do not find entirely satisfying concerns the claim that cognitive ethology can make important contributions to the project of naturalizing the mind. The problem is that it's far from clear that this is so. At any rate, it's far from clear that cognitive ethology can make any substantive contribution to the project that has most concerned philosophers who aim at a naturalistic account of mental phenomena. Let us explain in more detail. Though the term 'naturalism' is used in a variety of ways in the philosophy of mind, A&amp;B -following Shapiro--distinguish between what they take to be two important notions of naturalism: ontological naturalism and methodo- logical naturalism. According to the ontological naturalist, naturalism about the mind is a matter of identifying the nonmental constituents of mental phenomena. For her, the mind has been naturalized when (roughly) the nonmental 'building blocks' from which mental phenomena are composed have been identified and a recipe has been produced for how to combine</page><page sequence="5">The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science 379 these items in order to form mental entities. By contrast, according to the methodological naturalist, naturalism about mental states 'requires only that there be a productive, systematic, empirically tractable theory that includes mental-state predicates within its theoretical vocabulary' (p. 10). If we restrict ourselves to ontological naturalism, then it is far from clear that cognitive ethology has anything whatsoever to contribute to the naturali- zation project. This is simply because ethologists are not in the game of providing accounts of the nonmental constituents from which mental pheno- mena are composed. In which case, it would seem that cognitive ethology has nothing to contribute to the ontological naturalist's project. The relevance of cognitive ethology to the methodological naturalist's project is more obvious, however. Indeed, on the assumption that the observa- tional and experimental methods of cognitive ethology are of the same kind as those in other natural sciences, if ethologists succeed in producing 'scienti- fically respectable' theories that contain mental-state predicates, their research will directly contribute to the completion of the methodological naturalist's project. Though we have no problem with characterizing methodological naturalism as a form of naturalism and, moreover, as an substantive claim that many theorists have rejected, it is important to see that it is, in a sense, an extremely weak form of naturalism. Specifically, it is entirely consistent with what is typically taken to be the archetypal non-naturalist position in the philosophy of mind-substance dualism. And this is because substance dualism is entirely consistent with the existence of laws-or lawful generalizations- that invoke mentalistic predicates. It is also important to note that the form of naturalism which has been of central concern to philosophers of mind over the last thirty years is not methodological naturalism but (some form of) ontological naturalism. So, for example, Fodor characterizes his brand of naturalism as an attempt to show that there is a 'place for intentional categories in a physicalist view of the world' (Fodor [1987]). Similar sentiments abound in the philosophy of mind-e.g. in the work of Dretske, Lewis and others. This would not, of course, be a problem if one were to argue successfully that it is methodological and not ontological naturalism that should be of paramount concern to philo- sophers of mind. But A&amp;B provide no such argument. Indeed they explicitly endorse a bland pluralism according to which 'there are various ways in which mental phenomena might be assimilated to other natural phenomena, and naturalism gains support whether that assimilation is reductionistic, ontologi- cal, or methodological, or if it takes some other form that we have yet failed to consider' (pp. 10-1). For all that A&amp;B say, then, cognitive ethology can, at most, contribute to a form of naturalism that is in a sense weak and of only marginal interest to most contemporary philosophers of mind.</page><page sequence="6">380 Review In spite of these shortcomings, however, there is much in Species of Mind that should be of interest to philosophers. Any philosopher who is interested in the evolution of the mind, the application of evolutionary theory to the study of cognition or the mental capacities of different kinds of animals should read this book. Indeed anyone with an interest in the study of mental phenomena or who just wants an insight into the development of a special science, such as cognitive ethology, will find much of value in this book.</page></plain_text>
