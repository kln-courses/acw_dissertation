<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HISTORY OF NAGA CULT AND NAGA FESTIVALS IN ORISSA Biswajit Pradhan The Naga cult or serpent worship is one of the most ancient forms of worship in India. The earliest evidence of the serpent cult in India has been reported from the archaeological excavation at Chirand, a Neololithic site in Bihar. Among the host of terracotta figurines of animals and birds found at Chirand, the discovery of the terracotta figurine of a snake is very significant.1 The excavator has identified this terracotta figurine as the earliest representation of the serpent cult dating back to the early part of the 3rd millennium B.C.2 However, the prevalence and popularity of the Naga cult during the early historic period (3rd - 4th century B.C.) has been reported from Maniyar Math near Rajgir.3 The antiquities dating back to the first century A.D. and the literary references amply testify to the fact that Naga worship was prevalent and popular throughout the length and breadth of India from Mathura to Kerala.5 Orissa, the famous seat of diverse religions was also an important centre of Naga worship from very early time. The earliest representation of the snake motif in Orissan art has been reported from the painted rock-shelters of Sundargarh. In the rock shelters of Manikmoda, Lekhamoda and Tongo, there is the enigmatic depiction of snake in engravings as well as in paintings of monochrome dark red (haematite) and bichrome red and white.6 The continuity of the worship and festivities connected with Naga in Orissa can be traced as far back as 1st century A.D. With the accession of emperor Kharavela Orissa witnessed a glorious epoch in art, architecture and sculpture in unbroken continuity. The antiquities discovered so far during this period unmistakably prove the prevalence and popularity in Naga worship in Orissa. The twin hills of Khandagiri and Udayagiri which was a famous seat of Jainism during the period of emperor Kharavela contain innumerable caves, some of which have the engraving of Naga sculptures. Serpents are represented on the facade of the Anatagumpha flanking the door arches.7 In the Ranigumpha also such representations of serpents are found.8 These sculptural representation of Nagas appear naturalistic. They not only had religious sanctity but also served the purpose of decorative pattern in these caves. A serpent is seen entwined with a large tusker in a tree and ready to strike at his head in the</page><page sequence="2">1 50 IHC: Proceedings , 62nd Session , 200 J Alakanpurigumpha.9 In the caves of Khandagiri, the images of Parsvanatha, canopied by a seven-hooded snake are to be seen in several places.,()Two colossal Naga images are preserved in the Orissa State Museum. The iconographie features of these images suggest that they might have preceded Kharavela's time.11 Three more life like images of Naga and Nagin have been discovered at Sunderpada (near Bhubaneswar). These impressive Naga and Nagin images found in the vicinity of Bhubaneswar are independent cult images. This testifies to the fact that Bhubaneswar was an important centre of Naga cult. During the period following Kharavela upto the beginning of the Gupta period we do not find any Naga images or sculptures from any part of Orissa. But the inscriptions of Orissa from 4th century A.D. clearly show the continuation of the Naga cult. The Asanpat Inscription of king Satrubhanja of the Naga dynasty in the Keonjhar region (4th century A.D.) refers to the dynasty worship of Naga.12 The Kanasa Copper plate grant of the king Lokavigraha, the king of Tosali dated in the Gupta era 280 600) make reference to the worship of Maninaga.13 In the grant the king records the donation of a village on the bank of river Salia to a certain Brahmin, for the maintenance of the deity Maninagaswar. The record also mentions the name of two officials of the name Bhavanaga and Nagadutta who were probably of Naga lineage. The tradition of worshipping Maninagaswar is also found on the bank of river Langulia in southern Orissa and Subarnarekha in north-eastern Orissa, where we find Maninageswar temples.14 In Ranpur region of Puri district, it is interesting to find a small mountain in the shape of a coiled serpent which is worshiped as Maninaga.15 The prevalence of Serpent worship among the royal dynasties and the people of Orissa is further proved by the two Midnapur Copper plates of Somadatta and Subhakirtti, feudatories of Maharaja Sasanka in the 1st half of the 7th century A.D.16 It was during this period that serpent worship was more closely associated with Saivism. The cult of Naga appears to have become popular in the Mayurabhanj region with the ascendancy of the Naga dynasty just before the rise of the Bhanas in the region. The Naga dynasty of Mayurbhanj known as the Vairata Bhujanga dynasty worshipped Naga as their tutelary deity. The Patamundi hill near Puradiha is known as the original seat of the Naga Goddess.17 The image of Kinchaka Naga carved on the Patamundi hill was also worshipped by the ruling dynasty. The discovery of a Naga image at Tündara in the district of Balasore bears testimony to the popularity of Naga Cult in the region following Mayurbhanj.18 In the Khiching Museum we also notice some independent cult images of Naga.</page><page sequence="3">Ancient India 151 During the rule of the Sailodbhava and Bhauma-Kara kings, as the cult of the Mother Goddess was gaining popularity, around Bhubaneswar we do not find any specific Naga images. But some of the temples of Bhubaneswar like Parasurameswar, Nakuleswar and Vaitala belonging to this period contain some Naga sculptures as decorative motif. In the Prachi valley area in Puri district the cult image of Naga have been discovered from many places testifying to its popularity. At Kantapara, about 30 kms. from Bhubaneswar on the northern bank of Prachi, an interesting images has been found.19 It is a four-armed female deity with seven-serpenthoods over her head, the right hand holding an aksamala and the left hand is in abhayamudra. The deity appears to be an independent cult image being worshipped by the local people of the region as a village deity. The deity is locally known as Vilasini.20 There is a shrine on the northern side of Ramesvara temple of Tola in Prachi valley (54 kms from Bhubaneswar) dedicated to a seven-hooded Nagi. At present the deity is being worshipped as a village deity named Marchikeyi.21 A beautiful Naga icon discovered at Kuchipara on the bank of river Jonk in the Maraguda valley 1 8 kms away from Nawapara district bears testimony to the popularity of the cult in the region. The place was the cradle of early Somavamsi rulers. That the Somavamsi kings were closely associated with Naga worship is revealed from the Bilhari inscription of Yuvarajadeva II dated to c. A.D. 980. 22 The inscription states that the Kalachuri king defeated the king of Kosala, identified with Mahabhavagupta Bhimaratha of Somavamsi dynasty and seized from him an effigy of the serpent Kaliya wrought in jewels and gold. The image was a valuable personal possession of the royal house being worshipped by them. In Kalahandi region the ancient Naga kings traced their origin from the mythicla Naga Pundarika. They worshipped and propitiated Naga in their family rituals.23 Their tutelary deity Manikesvari appears to be a derivative of maninagesvari, a Naga deity. The ruling family of Himgir in Sundargarh district also worships Manidesvari as their tutelary deity. Apart from the several anthropomorphic sculptures of Naga, we also notice numerous independent serpent images as object of worship from different parts of Orissa.24 Serpents made of bronze or copper are frequently found in Siva temples. The custom of offering small serpent images as votive figures are also prevalent among the people of Orissa.</page><page sequence="4">1 52 ¡HC: Proceedings , 62nd Session, 200 J Live Serpent Worship The custom and tradition of live worship was very much popular in Orissa from remote past. Scholars have tried to associate a place near Chaudwar in Cuttack district as the place of serpent sacrifice performed by the king Janamejaya of Mahabharata fame to annihilate the serpents from the earth who caused the death of his father Parikshit.25 There are several instances of the live serpent worship as well as the rearing of live snakes as pet creatures found from several parts of Orissa. At Godhas in the Sunabeda plateau of Nawapara subdivision of Kalahandi district one Nag Singh, a tribal worshipped a snake at a fixed place near his house every Monday offering milk and raw rice grains to the snake.26 He was very famous in that region as a guni to cure snake bite and persons suffering from poisonous ailments. Kura Ramaya and Badhia Mohanty of Godiabandh in Padampur region of Koraput district are famous as snake worshippers. It is said that they even succeeded in bringing back to life, persons declared to have died of snake bite.27 At Bhojpurgarh, near the famous Narasinghanath temple of Sambalpur district, people worship a Boda snake dwelling somewhere inside the cave for their safety in the forest. In some places of south Orissa people used to make dwelling places for snakes around groves in their gardens and offered milk to them.28 Naga Worship in other forms It is a common practice all over India that, the Naga divinities, such as the Astakulanaga of puranic origin are worshipped during various ceremonies of high caste Hindus such as the sacred thread ceremony, marriage ceremony and Sradhha ceremony. In our ancient scriptures several hymns, with ritual offering are found for these ceremonies. Apart from these traditional form of Naga worship, the people of Orissa worship Naga in various forms such as: Water Spirit It was a belief among the early inhabitants of India that the commonest haunts of snakes are lakes, ponds, springs, pools and river. They believed that water is being controlled by the snakes. In Orissa it is a common practice to install Naga devatas on the banks of ponds and springs for worship. In many Siva temples which were built on the bank of rivers and ponds, Naga images are kept along with the Linga.</page><page sequence="5">Ancient India 153 Ancestor Spirit The Nagas are regarded as reincarnations of the dead.29 There are a number of instances to show legendary deified snake heros in India.30 Many Hindus keep deadly snakes in their houses feeding and petting them. This practice is still found in many villages in India. This practice is also prevailing in Orissa. The tribais of Orissa such as Oraons, Santals, Koli and Khonds regard the snake as their ancestor and worship it.31 High caste Hindus in Orissa also believe that the snakes are the embodiments of their ancestors. Guardian of the Hidden Treasure: Since very remote past it is believed that the snake is the son of earth.32 Kadru, the mother of the Naga race is believed to be a personification of earth in our epic literature.33 In all Indian mythology, the Nagas are portrayed as the lords of the earth and its hidden treasure in Patala. It is a common observance in Orissa that the Gunis (charm masters) trying to unearth suspected hidden treasure propitiate the Nagadevatas. A tribe known as Jhara worship Nagas as their guardian of wealth. Many store houses in Orissa are seen with the carving of Naga images. Goddess of Fertility From time immemorial, the mother earth has been worshipped as the Goddes of fertility. The serpent is considered to be endowed with the qualities of mother earth. Primitive men worshipped Naga as a divine being who could bestow fertility on their fields by controlling the rain.34 Ananta or Sesa Naga was worshipped as a God of harvest and cultivation. In Orissa the cultivators do not kill a snake in the paddy field as they have a firm belief that the presence of a snake will ensure the productivity of the land. The tribais of Orissa like the Santals, Bhumijas, Kola and Kondha worship Nagas at the beginning of the monsoon as well as during the period of cultivation to get better crops.35 The Brahmins in Orissa worship Naga at the time of marriage. Barren women also worship Naga and assume vows which they fulfil after they are blessed with children. Tutelary Deity: It was customary for the royal dynasties of Orissa to worship a tutelary deity or Istadevata. The Vairat Bhujanga dynasty of Mayurbhanj worshipped the serpent deity Khinchikeswari as their tutelary deity.36 The Chhindaka Nagas of Chakrakutamandala worshipped Manikesvari</page><page sequence="6">154 IHC : Proceedings , 62nd Session , 200 J as their tutelary deity.37 The deity is still worshipped by the royal families of Kalahandi and Himgir in the district of Sundargarh. Naga Worship associated with other religions The Naga cult which was one of the most popular forms of worship in ancient time found a prominent place in almost all religions of India. Through a process of assimilation various features of primitive cult worship found their expression in higher religious order.38 Orissa which was rich for its relics and antiquities connected with different religions of India from the earliest time clearly exhibits the association of Naga with other religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. Besides, it is found that Nagas the being worshipped along with some of the divinities of different religions. Among the different sects of Hinduism, the association of Naga is most prominent in Vaisnavism, Saivism and Saktism. It is also interesting to notice the association of Naga cult with Jainism and Buddhism. Vaisnavism In Vaisnavism the serpent always played an important role.39 The great serpent Sesa is believed to be a manifestation of Lord Visnu. Lord Visnu reclining on Sesa and contemplating the creation of the world is a common representation in Indian art and iconography.40 Such images of Lord Visnu reclining on Sesa is also found in many temples of Orissa as decorative motifs.41 In Sambalpur we notice a beautiful Visnu temple dedicated to Anantasayi installed by the Chauhan king Balaramadeva after conquering Surguja.42 Balarama or Baladèva, the eldest brother of Krishna is believed to be the incarnation of Sesa Naga.43 The Bhagavata adopted the popular worship of Nagas with the belief that the Naga images are the representation of Baladeva, the elder brother of Krishna. Saivism: The Naga Cult is closely connected with Saivism. The Naga or serpent is closely related to Siva than any other deity of Hindu pantheon. In some Siva shrines the Naga replaces Siva as an object of worship. Lord Siva is worshipped as a Naga at Nagesvar in the shrine of Varanasi palace of the king of Nagpur.44 At Maneswar in Sambalpur district there is a Siva temple where the presiding deity is a big brass idol of Naga. In almost all the Siva temples we find the Naga idol along with the Siva linga .</page><page sequence="7">Ancient India 155 Saktism: In Orissa Sakti worship was in vogue from very ancient times. Here the people worship Sakti in various forms such as Mahisamardini Durag, Parvati, Chandi, Viraja, Saptamatrika, Chamunda, Mangia, Varahi, Kali, Vimala, Charchika, Bhagavati, Stambeswari, Samaleswari and Pataneswari. From among these deities the serpent is closely associated with Mahisamardini Durga, Viraja, Chamunda and Kali. With the development of the Sakta Tantric Cult in Orissa, Naga and Nagi found expression in the cult images as well as sculptural depiction on the outer facade of the temples. Buddhism: It is believed that Gautama Buddha belonged to the serpent lineage.45 We find innumerable artistic representation of Naga in association with Buddha dating back to early Christian centuries.46 Jainism: The Jaina tirthankaras Parsvanatha is always represented with a sevenhooded serpent expanding over his head. He is also represented as sitting on the expanded hoods of a serpent with many heads.47 Such sculptures are found in the cave temples of Badami and Ellora. In modern time the followers of Jainism worship tree and serpent. The folk cult of Nagabachha in Western Orissa: In the life of some tribal and low caste Hindus of the Hilly tracts of Western Orissa the Naga occupies a special place in their religious life. These people worship snake after being initiated to a religious order (Nagabachha) like Upanayana ceremony of the Brahmins. Although there is no restriction of caste, creed or sect for selection of individuals for Nagabachha ceremony, generally the male heirs of snake charmers and snake worshippers are accepted for the initiation to the cult of Nagabachha. The cult of Nagabachha developed around Saivism and Nagapuja. The association of Naga is so intimate with Saivism that lord Siva is sometimes worshipped in the form a hooded Cobra. It is generally believed that Siva is the lord of Naga. The tribal people of Sunabeda mountain range in Kalahandi district refer to Siva as Nagadevata or Nagadeo. The initiation of an individual to the cult of Nagabachha is done by a guru through festive ceremony performed in the month of Bhadra or Dasara.48 The ceremony is repeated every year in the fixed</page><page sequence="8">1 56 IHC: Proceedings , 62nd Session , 2001 time and the members of Nagabachha party have to associate themselves at least for seven years to attain perfection. After seven years of observance of rituals of the cult of Nagabachha they are allowed to become gurus. They never kill or injure a snake during their life time. The members of Nagabachha cult enjoy a special place in the social life of their villages. They act gunis (charmer) to cure snake bites. They never receive remuneration for their service either in cash or kind. They are most devoted to their duties. They fear that if they neglect their duty they may incur the wrath of divine Nagas. Naga Festivals Several festivals associated with the Nagas are being celebrated throughout Orissa. The most note-worthy Naga festivals in Orissa are: (a) Naga Panchami: The festival of Naga Panchami is very popular among all classes in Orissa. It is celebrated on the 5th day of the bright half of the month of Sravana (July- August). The ceremony is observed in honour of the Nagas of the Mahabharata, the sons of Kadru, who are .believed to have been born on the fifth day of the bright half of Sravana. According another legend, the festival was instituted to commemorate the victory of Lord Krishna over the serpent king Kaliya.49 On this occasion the worship of Astakulanaga of the Mahabharata legend is held. Earthen images of snakes with raised hoods are made and worshipped. In some places of Orissa, the higher class Hindus observe Arandhana or abstinence from cooking on Nag Panchami day and offer worship to serpent idols in their houses. (b) Jagulei Panchami: It is also held on the 5th day of the bright fortnight of Sravana (July- August). On this occasion the image of Goddess Janguei (Buddhist serpent deity Janguli decorated with hoods of snakes on the head) is worshipped as a precautionary measure against snake bite Janguli, who is worshipped as a village deity near Laida in Sambalpur district is also worshipped on this occasion. (c) Naga Chauthi: The festival is observed on the fourth day of the bright half of Kartika (October-November) as a Osa or Vrata by the women folk of Orissa.</page><page sequence="9">Ancient India 157 On this occasion devoted women abstain from food and worship the image of Nagas offering sweets, milk, flower, various leaves and grasses. The village Brahmin priest conduct the Puja rituals. In some places the village women offer worship collectively. (d) Gumha Purnima: It is a festival celebrated particularly by the people of southern Orissa. The people worship earthen snake as Gumha (also called Baladeva) on the full moon day of Sravana (July-August). (e) Nagabachha Yatra: This festival is celebrated in different places of western Orissa. During this period popular folk entertainments connected with Naga are enacted by the local Yatra parties to celebrate initiation ceremony of Nagabachha. The worship of snake dominates the folk life of Orissa. Since there are large number of tribais, approximating 42% of the total population who live in hills and forests the acceptance of snake as an object of worship is quite natural. Some ruling dynasties used snake as the royal insignia to denote their tribal origin. In course of acculturatiori snake worship was adopted in the Brahmanical religion as a close associate of Lord Siva. By accepting snake as a sacred object the Indian mind cleverly tried to maintain an ecological balance because snake destroys rodents and other creatures who destroy corps and food grains. Thus, behind the worship of snakes several reasonable explanations can be found out in an essentially rural society, with a substantial tribal population. NOTES AND REFERENCES 1 . H.D.
