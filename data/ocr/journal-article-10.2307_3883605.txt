<plain_text><page sequence="1">Amer. Zool., 30:341-352 (1990) Mate Choice Near or Far1 William D. Hamilton Department of Zoology, South Parks Road, Oxford 0X1 BPS, U.K. Synopsis. When strong positive heritability of fitness arises due to host-parasite coevo? lution, consequent sosigonic mate preference undermines monogamy through tendencies to extra-pair copulation. "Low" females bonded to "low" males try to parasitise their partnership by obtaining fertilization, surreptitiously if possible, from "high"' males: correspondingly, in the case of birds, "low" males may parasite by encouraging egg dumping in their nests by "high" females who have allowed copulation. It follows that nests of birds of low status should sometimes show evidence at times of both types of parasitism while nests of high status should show faithful monogamy. Rather differently from the argument in Hamilton and Zuk (1982), showiness in monog? amous species is more likely to be related to such extra-pair objectives than to pair-bonding for nesting. Venereal disease makes males cautious about copulating with any female. Although prevented by true monogamy, when monogamy is partial, venereal disease may become the incentive for increasing female sexual advertisement. In extreme cases it may combine with other ecological factors to initiate sex role reversal, in which the female becomes the non-parenting sex of the species. As regards source of the heritability that backs the sosigonic selection assumed in such speculations, reasons are given for preferring a coevolutionary cycling of ancient, preserved, parasite-defense alleles to the alternatives of an abundant stream of good new defense mutations, or a process of elimination of purely deleterious mutations. Introduction Since Marlene Zuk and I first put for? ward the idea that parasites might be important in sexual selection (Hamilton and Zuk, 1982), my view of the situation has changed in several ways. This paper will discuss four. The topics might be classified as relatively sociobiological, parasitologi- cal, pragmatical, and genetical, although this is unimportant. At the end I will sum- marise what I see as the present position of the idea as a whole. Mating Outside the Pair Bond In monogamous birds courtship is often a fairly lengthy affair. For example, for temperate birds, preliminaries may begin during bursts of territoriality, pairing, and even mock nesting in late months of the previous year. Then or at other times, if health is the issue, there are opportunities for observing stamina in flight or calling contests, inciting dominance confronta- tions with conspecifics, noting daring towards predators. Altogether, it has come 1 From the Symposium on Parasites and Sexual Selec? tion presented at the Annual Meeting ofthe American Society of Zoologists, 27-30 December 1988, at San Francisco, California. to seem to me unlikely that a bird needs to rely on looking for bright, tidy plumage or listening to momentary expressions of energy and coordination made in complex melodic song, although it should certainly check those features also if available. It is hard to imagine that a greylag goose for example (a bird whose courtship has been exceptionally thoroughly and sympatheti- cally recorded (Lorenz, 1970)) makes many mistakes about health of prospective part? ners just because they happen to be all dull in colouring. Geese move and nest and even migrate in family groups, and many pro? spective mates will have been known as individuals all their lives. But if all this casts doubt on showiness for monogamous choice it leaves us with a dilemma: if not for monogamy, and yet still used for sexual display, what else is showiness for? Consider any typical bird species. Imag? ine that an individual has bonded with a mate, but imagine also that that mate is not all that might have been hoped for. If the species has an ecology that means biparen- tal brood-raising is crucial to fledging suc? cess, and if "good genes" are relatively unimportant, we would expect the pair bond to be very stable: one or other bird might sigh but it would probably get on 341</page><page sequence="2">342 William D. Hamilton with the job. An extra-pair copulation by a female with her most desired male in the local population would achieve little for her and, if it could result in her mate aban- doning or reducing care (Gladstone, 1979; Richardson and Coatzee, 1988), it would risk a great deal. If on the other hand hav? ing "good genes" is important to nestling and fledgling survival for reasons of health, a condition of selection to be referred to as sosigonic, a female, while probably hid- ing all signs of her doubt of her partner's quality most of the time, might actually take the same risks to her relationship to get the genes. It was a part of our argument in the first paper that sometimes the "good genes" imperative becomes so strong for reasons of changing parasite ecology, and that this causes infidelity to become so frequent, that monogamy breaks down altogether. The idea is that it might be a combination of parasite ecology and permissive states of "ordinary" ecology that starts to create promiscuous manakins, icterids, or birds of paradise out of their monogamous passer- iform forbears. Of course the "permis- sion" from "ordinary" ecology in such cases would mean essentially that the female is able to rear a brood by herself, though per? haps having to reduce to a smaller clutch relative to her taxonomic norm, especially if young are altricial. Thus a correlation of ecological and clutch-size variables with polygyny is to be expected and does not exclude a part played by parasites. I will take this view for granted and below will speculate further. Before leaving the pres? ent topic, however, it is worth pointing out that it is going to be difficult to assign rel? ative importance to permissive ecology and to parasites. For example, maybe birds that live by foraging in damp litter on the ground have an inevitable exposure to the parasite propagules ofthe whole local com? munity of birds, this arising through hav? ing to search for food among remnants of many kinds of fallen feces. Perhaps this creates extra chances to acquire new par? asites. The parasites, through the coevo? lution they initiate, may help to explain why so many birds feeding on the ground show high sexual selection (as in lyre birds, pittas, bustards, pheasants, etc). However, it is almost certainly also true that quickly self-supporting young, such as are more easily evolved when nesting on the ground, facilitate polygyny and consequent sexual selection more directly. Interest therefore may have to focus upon birds unusually earth-bound for their groups that seem to be "going pheasant" without abandoning sexual similarity and apparent monogamy; likewise we need to look at galliforms like Numididae and some partridges and quails where monogamy is also retained or where there may even be a bias towards male care of the young (e.g., Spano and Csermely, 1985). Usually, in birds, brood contributions by the male (or at the very least brood defense, which often continues even when polygyny is advanced) is very important. This sug? gests the possible success of strategies where females try to obtain both a nurturing mate and the best genes, the latter coming from surreptitious extra-pair copulation. There is evidence for a growing list of species that such strategies are sometimes followed (McKinney et al, 1984; Moller, 1987c; Sherman and Morton, 1988). It now seems to me that it may be much more in regard to these events than in regard to seasonal (or life time) pair bonding that bright col? oration of males plays its part. The female who is dissatisfied with the seeming genetic quality of her mate probably has had no chance to perform any detailed assessment of other males in her vicinity; but she may well be able to appreciate the relative qual- ities of advertisements that are being broadcast through brilliant plumage and song from males at their territory posts on nearby trees. If this general interpretation is correct it will turn out that as more and more species are searched for evidence, it will be those supposed monogamists where brightest males are contrasted to dull females that reveal most "infidelity" by females and variable negligence of mater? nal care by males. Already we know of pos? sible examples ofthe latter (e.g., McKinney et al, 1984; Burley, 1988; Studd and Rob? ertson, 1988) and of suggestive cases of tendencies to polygyny?for example the indigo bunting (Westneat, 1987) and the</page><page sequence="3">Extra-Pair Choice and Parasites 343 pied flycatcher (Jarvi etal, 1987)?but also know contrary cases?for example the dunnock (Davies, 1983), which must be almost Britain's dullest bird though with a good song. There are many known cases of appropriate territory intrusions and extra pair bond copulations in bright-male birds (McKinney^a/., 1984;M0ller, 1988), but only sometimes does the female seem to solicit them. The species where the female has been seen to solicit most, the fulmar (Hatch, 1987), is equally bright in both sexes. Somewhat contrary also seems the species becoming most notorious for both its extra-pair paternity and egg dump- ing, the starling (Power et al, 1981; West- neat, 1987). This species Marlene Zuk and I found it hard to make up our minds how to score, both about how dimorphic the species is and how showy. With the thoughts now added it becomes almost a prediction of the theory that as appreciated by other starlings the male starling should be showy. Perhaps it would be profitable to look at starlings using ultra-violet light. (The same search might be applied to the rather sim- ilarly dark and iridescent corvids, which like the starling, stood out in our data with anomalously high parasite loads: the black corvids, as well as the magpie, have shown signs of fertilisation strategies outside of the pair (McKinney et al, 1984). But if the male fulmar and the male star? ling are showy, their females are equally so or very nearly. There are many cases where both sexes are alike and brilliant? birds like macaws and crowned cranes. Showiness offemales gives difficulty for the view just stated, and with the abundance of this condition among the so-called monogamous birds the difficulty is grave. It would clearly be unsatisfactory to have an explanation ofthe brightness ofthe male Chaffinch or American Goldfinch and to have to give some completely different kind of explanation for the brightness of both sexes in the closely related European Gold? finch. The usual view is that a copulation is an inexpensive act for a male; therefore he should never refuse any female who offers herself to him whether she seems of high genetic quality or low: thus a female should never need to advertise. Two factors may be suggested to resolve the difficulty. The second of them leads on to the next subheading and will be dealt with there. The first probably sounds a baseless anthropomorphism at first but in view of the ever increasing parallels being found between bird behaviour and the thought-conditioned behaviour of humans, whatever the way in which these parallels are brought about, a conjecture ofthe kind given does not seem unreasonable. The conjecture is that the female might act as follows. First, she would use her brightness to gain attention of other poten- tially high quality males from afar; second, she would make sure that her signal emphasises her quality to them; and third, by other signs, probably not by approach, she would induce a distant fine male to make a first move towards her, so exon- erating herself in the eyes of her mate if the subsequent encounter, which may per? haps culminate in a simulated forced cop? ulation, is detected. Of course underlying these interpretations there is a biological interpretation of similar events and styles in human life. Why did Beau Brummell in Regency England dress up as he did? Was it to find a wife, or to find an "affair"? And, why did the women who admitted them- selves attracted to such men dress them- selves in equal finery? Many were married; but we may note a possibility that in a time when marriages were often arranged for financial advantage, their mates may have been more rich than attractive or healthy. Of course there is a very great deal of com? plexity in such a human situation that birds could never have. Particularly there is the transferable wealth, which to my mind overshadows even the role of rational thought. The cases have to be very differ? ent in detail, but even so, some accounts from long and careful observations of bird sexual and social relations suggest a degree of complexity of motivation and deceit that makes the comparison worthwhile?in both directions (Verwey, 1930; Dewar, 1936; Birkhead, 1979; Stenmark et al, 1988; Moller, 1987a). In the background of this view of bird behaviour there is of course an assumption of a rank ordering of the population from</page><page sequence="4">344 William D. Hamilton the most desirable to the most undesirable. Individuals are predicted to be pursuing different goals according to their position in the order. Searching for an island in the morass of possibilities that opens, one might at first seize on the top pair as inevitably stable: surely the female of that pair must have the male that she wants. But if "good genes" have begun to rule, even this is not so. While we easily imagine that the top male is distracted from guarding his nest by invitations from other females, what is it we expect his mate, the top female, to be doing? Is she likely to be working hard on her own to support her mate's brood? Surely not: the top female may be having plenty of invitations too. These come from the lowly males. They are sending hints to her that she is welcome to play cuckoo at their nests?with the proviso, of course, that she allows a copulation first. Their sig? nals may be imagined to convey something like this: "Look how dull I am. How can you possibly doubt?I am your true work? ing father. I and my mate (but quiet about her) will look after your eggs better than you can." In the light of this thought it becomes not even clear that a top male will want the absolutely top female to be his mate, or vice versa. The situation calls for a game theory type of analysis which can? not be attempted here. Could pair infidel- ity really exist on the scale this implies? How could this be decided? While some suggestive features could probably be made out by patient observations (crowded sea bird colonies where dozens of pairs can be under observation at once would seem promising), and thus could verify or negate the general possibility, it is the new tech? niques offered by electrophoresis and DNA fingerprinting that most obviously open up the new issues of fidelity?regarding the actions of both sexes and for all "monog? amous" animals. Egg dumping, like extra- pair copulation, is a growing theme in bird studies (e.g., Yom-Tov, 1980; Moller, 1987c) and already there are hints of sit- uations plentifully complex. Venereal Risk and Polyandry Now consider the other factor that could make females need to advertise "health at a glance," rather as males advertise it and directed to achieve the same desirable and concealed extra-pair fertilizations that they are seeking. This is a long associated pres? ence of serious venereal diseases in a species or group. Overt signs of disease certainly deter humans. With infections present in the population, the female may need to advertise that she is uninfected or that any- way she offers so good a chance to produce a healthy offspring that the risk is worth- while. As with the factor already discussed, decisions must still be made fast, for the male, like the female, has interest to con- ceal the act?that is, he too wants to keep the female's mate ignorant so that the mate's care for the nest and future brood continues. All this says that neither partner in a hasty act can insist on careful tests and observations on the other's health. How? ever, a quick look at important points may be possible. I suspect that the issue of venereal infection, for example, may stand at the origin of the precopulatory cloacal pecking in the dunnocks. This does not exclude a subsequent role ofthe behaviour in causing extrusion of previous ejaculate (Davies, 1983). The cloaca is of course the region where the birds will make contact and the male's action may amount to seek? ing a better look. Needless to say similar suspicions can be raised about the genital swellings of primates, although, unfortu- nately for the present idea, there seem to be no suitable known diseases in those ani? mals one can point to. (But?would we know, for example, about chimpanzee chlamydias? Do we yet know enough about the HIV-like retroviruses of primates? The fact that we knew nothing about them twenty years ago surely tells the level of our igno- rance about most animals.) Back to birds and with another kind of parasite, it is already well known that some mallophaga cluster in the cloacal region. This is just as would be expected from the imperative of dispersal (Hamilton and May, 1977), and there is accumulating evidence that lice and mites do indeed transfer during the act (Hillgarth, personal communication). As noted below, bird lice, like anoplura and ticks, can transmit diseases. Since venereal infection can occur both</page><page sequence="5">Extra-Pair Choice and Parasites 345 ways, it is interesting, if peripheral to the present theme, that many male displays expose the cloacal region to the female's view. The same line offers an explanation of certain characteristics post-copulatory acts also, such as the vigorous shaking and wing beating that occurs in many birds (e.g., galliforms and anatids?with washing of water over the plumage added in the latter (Johnsgard, 1968)). The immediate contagion factor in social behaviour, in which the above mating problem is involved as a special case, was first emphasized and reviewed by Freeland (1976). As regards our present theme of showiness, we need to know more about both venereal diseases and contagion gen? erally before the factor can be assessed. The distinction of venereal and non-vener- eal from the present point of view may not always be clear, as shown in the discovery that a rather innocent-seeming louse of swans transmits a fatal heartworm (Seegar et al, 1976). The heartworm does not seem remotely likely to be venereal at first, but it turns out not only that it might be so but that it might expose faint hints of why, with the louse dark, swans should be white, and even why their neck feathers, which is where the lice mainly live, should be so opened in their display. As humans are currently being pres- sured by events to understand, true monogamy is one way to prevent venereal diseases from flourishing. But imagine a monogamous species which has a venereal disease lurking nearby?perhaps currently mainly infecting a closely related species. If the general rates of disease and parasite attacks of the right kind go up in this host, so that it comes under the selection already described?that is, increased intensity of search for good genes and correspondingly decreased emphasis on offspring nurtur- ance?then, with the venereal disease occasionally taking toll, it is not so clear as usual that it will be the male who is set to become what might be called the "sani- meter" sex of the species. Once males are less eager for extra copulations because of the risks to their own lives, it is relatively more likely that the principal form of infi- delity might become male-abetted egg dumping. Low males might now be initi- ators, encouraging favoured healthy par- amour females to lay eggs in their nests. Just as the end result of too much female infidelity combined with male eagerness and low cost, is explicit polygyny (with the female left with the burden of raising the brood), so the end result of excessive egg dumping has to be the condition of so-called "sex reversal." Most females would be too involved in advertising and with the pos? sibility of laying a further clutch to remain faithful to a particular nest and male (Reynolds, 1987; Schamel and Tracy, 1977). Most males therefore become unhelped raisers of brood. All this suggests that it might be worth looking for partic? ular problems with venereal diseases in birds and other animals that have evolved sex role reversal. As with the case of polyg? yny, the ecological factors offered to explain polyandry (Pitelka et al, 1972; Graul, 1974) have never seemed at all con- vincing as sole determinants (Maynard Smith, 1977), and some hidden factor like disease transmission might make the diver- gences more understandable. Thus for example some wetlands of the arctic have ruffs, swans and phalaropes all breeding within a space of a few miles: their foods admittedly vary?but what else would con- tribute to their profound differences in styles of sex? Since venereal diseases are expected to be rare in monogamous species while opportunities for cheap, safe copulations are by the same token abundant, it is easy to see why it is much more common for the male to become the sanimeter sex. The initiation of an opposite trend seems to need something like the parasite overflowing from another species, this parasite being infectible venereally. Thus if an already polygynous bird like the ruff were to evolve venereally transmitted ectoparasites, encouraged by its promiscuity, and if some transmit diseases which at least are dan- gerous for the other waders around when they reach them (they could be supposed generalist enough at least to bite), only then do the conditions seem set for evolution to take off along the line that leads to a bird like a phalarope. For all these conditions to be met must be quite rare, but it might be worth searching for a partial conjunc-</page><page sequence="6">346 William D. Hamilton tion of them in charadriforms, where trends to polyandry seem more common than in most other groups. We know that there are abundant sets of ectoparasites providing the potential venereal factor (Peters, 1936; Meinertzhagen and Clay, 1948; Malcolm- son, 1960), and perhaps such parasites may be particularly prevalent in phalaropes (Yanez and Canaris, 1988). But it is as yet hard to say what serious diseases, if any, they might transmit. The typical blood par? asites are low in charadriforms (Greiner et al, 1975; Pierce, 1981). Tinamous also show frequent sex role reversal and have varied and abundant mallophaga (Eichler, 1963). However, the same association is not maintained in the polyandrous ratites. These have few mallophaga, whereas in the generally polygynous galliforms they are again abundant (Eichler, 1963), so the indications from this potentially "venere? al" group are rather confusing and can be given little weight. Ability to Work For the Brood There is yet another reason why a monogamous or quasi-monogamous ani? mal should be concerned about the health of its potential mate. It is rather obvious and unexciting. Moreover although almost certainly it is playing its part in mating choices, it does not seem to me very rele? vant to the particular phenomenon we want to explain. Therefore I will treat it briefly. If both sexes normally work for the brood, both will want partners who actually succeed in working?and work hard? right up to the end of the season. There? fore it could be availability of this utilitar- ian aspect that they advertise health back and forth via their displays and colours. Several writers seem to hint that this idea is the main competitor with the idea of "good genes." Indeed when showiness is accepted as being an index of health at all, it appears most ornithologists might bet on health being advertised in token of imme- diate nurturance, and on this being the rea? son for both sexes being showy. If the idea is valid, it will lead to a prob? lem of distinguishing two contributions? the sosigonic factor and this one of imme- diate nurture. While an answer to this is needed (and does not seem easy to give) I intend to avoid discussing the issue on grounds that the idea is implausible at the root. If there is a nurturance factor in showiness, I suspect it is small. Taking another image from British history, the idea seems to me like assuming that a Royalist style of dress can derive from a Puritan ideology. In other words, the idea that showiness beyond mere cleanliness serves utilitarian decisions runs counter to intu? ition as well as counter to the arguments given at the beginning of the essay which stressed that there is plenty of opportunity to assess health in more penetrating ways. Long observations of others close up and under hardship seem a far better test than bright plumage and bursts of song. Once at the nest, moreover, bright plumage is a hazard for everyone. The most royal Roy? alist, Charles the Second, had already put on woodman's clothing when he hid in the famous oak tree. A male pied flycatcher might be expected to have evolved likewise and to resemble the female if it is survival and work that the female most needs (as implied by Lifjeld and Slagsvold, 1988). Hence I have come to much prefer the idea that bright colours and song are concerned with signalling health to relatively distant, relatively unknown receivers for the possi? ble purposes already outlined. Constant Heritability: Mutation vs. Host Parasite Dynamic In all the above sections except the last, the idea that there can be a role for sosi- gonic mate choice depends on there being a plentiful supply of unfixed genetical vari? ation undergoing selection. Accumulating evidence for sexually selected species shows that heritable variation exists (Hedrick, 1988), although how much of it is sosigonic is not yet investigated?except, as a begin? ning, in pheasants (Hillgarth, 1990). In theory, whether related to health or other matters, there are roughly three ways to get the flux that is needed (Pomiankowski, 1988). One way invokes sets of relatively ancient variant alleles that acquire ever changing values under selection: the alleles hardly ever go globally extinct but do not stabilise either?in short, they cycle. The</page><page sequence="7">Extra-Pair Choice and Parasites 347 second way involves a rapid pace of incor- poration of good new alleles into the pop? ulation (this accompanied by, of course, extinction of some of the old alleles). The third way involves a rapid pace of occur? rence of bad mutations of all kinds. Bad mutations are never incorporated but their stream can be selecting what might be called "bad genes avoidance" by potential mates and this in turn can be fuelling the excesses of sexual selection. The cycling alternative is the one that Marlene Zuk and I emphasised in our paper and it is the one that I still most favour. Against it, it must be admitted that there are not yet any real examples in nature? even population dynamical true cycles have been hard to prove, and population genet? ical cycling is still only a gleam in a theo- rist's eye. The nearest thing we have is a phytopathology resistance cycle in a crop recorded over two periods where man, anticipating a fungus, plays the selective role ofthe latter (Barrett, 1988). Almost the most we can say is that the potential for genotypic cycling exists in the very nature of host-parasite relations and resis- tances (Lewis, 1981; Eshel and Akin, 1983), and it is hard to see what would prevent cycles happening. Meanwhile circumstan- tial evidence grows stronger. Such evi? dence is the recent argument for ancient constancy of some elements of defence polymorphisms (Lawlor etal, 1988; Figue- roa et al, 1988), plus that for molecular mimicry in the same system (Guillet et al, 1987; Cohen, 1988; Vidovic and Matzin- ger, 1988), opening further possibility of dynamical pursuits. On the theoretical side recent simulations I have conducted with others (Hamilton, Axelrod and Tanese, unpublished; Hamilton, unpublished) con- firm how easily cycling occurs in antago- nistic coevolution, and show that the con? ditions for protection of polymorphism and constant heritability are easier to obtain than I once thought. Such protection is found for example in multi-locus models under weak selection where the loci are superficially unitary and independent in their conferred resistances. The insistent dynamical behaviour of such models seems often to have been regarded as an embar- assment, as if it was an outcome of unrea- sonable assumptions and needed to be explained away (Lewis, 1981). Needless to say, to my own view the dynamism is wanted; permanent dynamical behaviour tells of hope for sex and, in certain forms, gives additional hope for unravelling sex? ual selection. At first such models, admittedly, often seem dynamical to an excessive degree. Keeping alleles from being lost altogether appears a problem. But it turns out that simple and reasonable assumptions about how selection could be modelled in K-selected climax-type species?that is, those species we know to have the most insistent emphasis on sex and, often, the most extreme signs of sexual selection as well?easily provide conditions for a rest- less kind of preservation. In fact it has proved that weak coevolutionary cycling for many loci based on a naturally arising "coalpit" pattern of fitness (most geno- types of much the same value but a few deadly), is very suitable to provide a uni? form force for good-genes mate choice. This fits well with the idea that numerous, chronic parasites with moderate detrimental effects can be the ones involved. "Chronic" of course tends to imply that they are still present to be assessed during mate choice, but the model also works for parasites that act earlier and die out, provided that the course of their pathology leaves a perma? nent record in host development saying how well they were resisted. It is necessary for our view that host deaths are indeed caused by the parasites. This requirement seems to give trouble to parasitologists because it conflicts with their claim that the speeific, long-associated par? asites of a host species hardly do any harm at all. However, parasites would not be par? asites unless they did some?they would instead be mutualists and thereby outside the scope of the theory. Though the harm of a particular parasite species may be small, the small harms can add up and may in the end cause death. It needs to be made clear here that the host does not have to be shown at time of death to be suffering from par- asite-induced lesions that are sufficient in themselves to have caused the death. It is</page><page sequence="8">348 William D. Hamilton enough if we can show that the chance of death from any of a set of proximate causes, such as predation, increases substantially as parasite load goes up. There have been minor studies and many opinions to the effect that such increased susceptibility to predators does occur, but thorough work has been lacking. Very recently this gap has been filled in a survey of small mam? mals caught by a tame hawk, contrasting post mortem findings on these with others from a sample of animals shot in the wild, for which type of attack physical fitness would play much less part in their ability to escape (Temple, 1987). It was clearly demonstrated that the animals the hawk caught were much more parasitised than the controls especially if the species was one that the hawk found hard to catch. This elegant study combined with previous ample demonstration of selectability of resistance by many hosts to many classes of parasites (Hamilton, 1982) indicates a fate that parents can be avoiding for their off? spring when they choose maximal health in their mates. It may seem at first true that a mutualist cannot be a parasite in the sense of the theory, because it does not induce coevo? lutionary cycling. However there are sev? eral ways in which microbial mutualistic symbionts could create problems for their hosts. It may well be, for example, that symbionts continually mutate in ways that tend towards parasitism. A deficiency mutation may simply block a pathway that leads to the benefit on basis of which the relationship evolved?so creating a need for hosts to be both physiologically (within generations) and genetically (over gener- ations) "alert" to discriminate. It may also be that a lot of microbial symbionts exist on a borderline between exploitation and mutualism, and exist in variants that are only under proper control when paired with corresponding variants of their hosts. Finally, it may be that housing microbial symbionts in itself involves relaxing certain kinds of routine antimicrobial measures normally employed. This may open the way to habitation by unequivocally harmful parasites. Focussing on structures created for gut symbionts, the rumens of ungulates and the caecae of birds do indeed house harmful parasites that are not found else? where. Such points taken together make it not surprising that animals using microbial symbionts to aid in digestion and synthesis have often gone in for high sexual selection as well. An example is a striking series in the galliform birds culminating in the Tetraonidae with their huge caecae, dec- orative plumage and skin, and, often, their lek mating. The artiodactyl ruminating ungulates make another major vertebrate series, with horns of various types here being the outstanding morphological man? ifestation of the sexual selection. Looking on and under the ground where the ungu? lates graze it is fascinating to find the food material already processed by them and dropped as dung being gone over again by tribes of strikingly horned scarabaeid bee- tles once again using gut caecae and micro? bial symbiont flora. Of course the dung for the beetles does not have to come from artiodactyls, but the poorness of the medium expected to result from the effi? ciency of digestion in the ruminants is per? haps in favour of a need for further symbi? ont effort within the secondary processors. Related dynastine beetles living on equally poor media in rotting wood also use sym? bionts and are also dramatically horned as adults. Along with these are other wood feeders such as tipulids that show the strong sexual selection over again, doing so with colour and other morphology rather than horns. However, it has to be admitted that other xylophagous beetles which also employ symbionts show no striking adult sexual characters (Buchner, 1965). Look? ing to non-gut symbionts, several other lekking and/or strikingly ornamented groups of insects have them?for example, cicadas, membracids, various heteroptera, and picture-winged trypetid fruit flies (Buchner, 1965; Howard et al, 1985). It has to be admitted that this theme of symbionts and sexual selection is very ten- tative, and there is a lot that needs to be clarified. Why do omnivorous non-rumi- nating pigs retain fairly high sexual exag- geration, as manifested in dimorphism, tusks, et cetera? Why do some scarabaeids retain horns even though feeding on rich</page><page sequence="9">Extra-Pair Choice and Parasites 349 diets (Halffter and Edmonds, 1982)? Geese, grazers living on poor diets have big guts but seemingly make no important use of symbionts in them and have no polygyny? in fact rather the opposite. At the same time they seem to have no lack of parasites. But hoatzins, also grazers, have even heavier guts than geese and begin to look grouse-like .... Obviously there is a need for much more study of the various cases and possibilities before a real theme becomes clear. Could there be a constant stream of ben- eficial new mutations being selected into a population such that indicator traits of benefits currently experienced could be evolved and used in mate choice? On the whole I am less enthusiastic about this than I am about protected cycling, but I also think that if this version does work at all it is almost certain that the genes con- cerned will prove to be ones involved in defence against parasites and diseases. One good new feature is that all resistance mutations can now count: we do not have to worry under this scheme about the par- adox of very short cycles (period 2 or 3 generations) from powerful pathogens that might induce "worse genes" mate choice! When parasite selection is slower, how? ever, the system grades into the one already discussed though with the protection lack- ing: we can think of it as being a limit cycle that keeps hitting sticky boundaries of its space (i.e., fixation). If after travelling part way along a boundary hyperplane a muta- tion enables the system take off and increases its dimensionality once again, it does not matter on the sexual selection side whether the allele that "comes back" is the same as the one that was lost or is some- thing completely different. All that matters is that it can contribute to the almost steady heritability of fitness. As regards selection for sex itself, the system brings us back to a Weismann-Muller-Fisher type of theory but is more speeific than that one was about the stream of good genes the theory is pos- tulating; it is the abundance of the prob- able stream that makes it more plausible that the model can really work. As regards sexual selection, we are back to something like a Lande model but again with a more specific idea about the source of the con? stant heritability that is being assumed: it is not now a matter of mutation of genes that provide the blueprint of the epigamic character but rather of genes that simply affect health as a whole, and thereby deter? mine what surplus of materials and energy the individual can afford to divert to the implementation of the blueprint (Domi- ney, 1983). There is reason to believe that characters concerned with defence against parasites may involve unusual amounts of gene substitution and diversity due to the rapidity of coevolving change (Hill and Hastie, 1987; Laskowski et al, 1987), so the stream may indeed be abundant enough to account for sexual selection alone, unhelped by a more proper cycling of ancient and conserved alleles. From the point of view ofthe character ofthe sexual selection engendered and the correlation of this with parasitism, the distinction probably does not matter. The last mechanism for generating a high enough constant heritability differs from the above ideas in that it invokes all bad mutations taken together, whether they have to do with parasites or not. Thus the special correlations of sexual selection with para? site ecology, the varying afflictions of indi? viduals, and so on, are only expected in so far as a large fraction of all the functional DNA that lies open to deleterious mutation is actually concerned with parasite de? fence. The fraction is probably surpris- ingly high: this not just because the total tissue ofthe immune system forms a larger part of body mass than one might think (immune system tissues may even outweigh the nervous system), but also because almost any tissue or body protein can potentially become involved, via pathogen mimicry, in a disease-defence story (Hamilton, 1981; Vidovic and Matzinger, 1988). We are once again talking about health, but it is now health of a different kind, only incidentally connected with coevolving biotic agents. In so far as the idea works it is again overall a Lande-type situation, but it needs to be emphasized, as I don't think Lande ever has emphasised, that while the epigamic character can undoubtedly be brought in fast by the Fisher positive feedback, the</page><page sequence="10">350 William D. Hamilton arrival has now become a past event for most traits, or at most has been trans- formed into an ongoing slow change that cannot be regarded as either cause or effect of the variation in the epigamic character today. Most of that variation is still, as under the cycling alternative, a reflection of state of well being. What the present view adds is that the variation, while it includes some chance favouring by this or that genera- tion's environment, or by this or that indi- vidual's particular circumstances in it, most importantly is reflecting the summed effects of all the deleterious mutations each indi? vidual is carrying. The epigamic character then may contribute to species-wide health in so far as it serves as an amplifier of dif? ferences (Hasson, 1989), and in so far as females are declining to mate those indi? viduals whose poor ornaments show that they carry exceptional loads of mutations. Chance evolution of preference by the Fisher process (or Kirkpatrick process, he having emphasised more than Fisher the arbitrariness of the direction) may equally carry a character towards large size or towards disappearance. But the trends to enlargement, if sex-limited to a relatively throwaway sanimeter sex, are the ones that can serve to improve species health because size tests ability to produce and absence does not. Thus such characters may give some sexual species an extra buoyancy to ride upon the ever rising tide of bad muta? tion?and they only may give this because a more proper theoretical treatment is needed before we can say that they can, leave alone that they do. On the whole I feel that the connections of sexual selection with parasites already shown and discussed at this Symposium, vague and sometimes negative as they still are, are enough to indicate that this last "avoidance" or "pure negative eugenics" view of sexual selection looks at only a minor part of the whole. If the line were the whole truth, all sexual animals should manifest about the same amount of sexual selection since all, presumably, have about the same amounts of functional DNA mutating badly at approximately the same rates. This does not seem to be the case. In particular the avoidance explanation will be almost rejected if it turns out, for exam? ple, that the set of birds with wattle-like developments suffers more parasitaemia (easily revealed by wattles) than the set without wattles, if the set of birds with exaggerated showy peri-cloacal feathers suffer more diarrhoeal diseases, and if other similar special advertisements appropriate to special parasite and health problems can be shown. In general the apparatus of sex and sexual selection looks to me more com- mensurate with problems created by active enemies than with problems created by an organism's failure to buffer and correct its own internal processes, the sort of failure that leads to bad mutation: to remedy that other more efficient means would serve. CONCLUSION In the light of ever increasing knowledge of the complexity of the anti-parasite de- fence system of higher organisms, of the subtlety of weapons that parasites bring against them and how rapidly these can change, of yet other kinds of circumstantial evidence (Burt and Bell, 1987; Lively, 1987), and of the convincing success of models concerning how the interplay of these factors with recombinant multi-locus genetics could work (Hamilton, Axelrod and Tanese, unpublished), I regard the parasite theory of sex itself as very nearly established. The main challenge, the idea of sex serving for the efficient elimination of harmful mutations (Kondrashov, 1988) clearly identifies another important func? tion of sex, but, when offered as a primary force, does not seem able to explain major features of the geography, ecology and actual practice of sex and parthenogenesis. Nor does it even attempt to explain even one major feature of genetics, the much greater DNA copying fidelity and/or mutation control that is achieved by pro- caryotes without any seeming cost to their extreme efficiency of growth. The situation for the sexual-selection extension of the parasite theory is more dubious. The case for good genes sexual selection existing is becoming strong, but this only implies heritability and not the source. My own feeling is that it is hard to</page><page sequence="11">Extra-Pair Choice and Parasites 351 see any other source than parasites, the only really viable and different contender being again the one last mentioned?high rates of damaging mutation. But this view does not seem to be widely shared: there is a vague but perhaps reasonable suppo- sition of "something else out there in all that complexity" that is capable of ensur- ing high heritability. Such doubt notwithstanding, the number of studies indicating correlation of para? sites consistent with the proposed connec- tion as opposed to indicating hostile or un- informative correlations is probably already approaching significance on a sign test. But most ofthe results show correlations: much more needed are studies that put parasites, genetics, and natural history convincingly together either for a group or a focal species. Such work is beginning to be reported, as at this Symposium. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I thank N. Hillgarth for comments and J. B. Hainsworth for the suggestion of sosi? gonic. References Barrett, J. A. 1988.
