<plain_text><page sequence="1">CORRESPONDENCE. THE RELIGION OF THE ANDAMAN ISLANDERS. (Ante, p. 257.) "The bearing of the Andamanese beliefs on the theory of a primitive All-Father I do not care to discuss," says Mr. Brown, in his welcome paper on "The Religion of the Andaman Islanders" in September Folk-Lore, "as the whole theory seems to me nothing but a system of elaborate misinterpretation." As I am to some extent responsible for the theory,-(though for "a primitive" I would read "an early All-Father "),-I may be permitted to say how Mr. Brown's paper impresses me. It impresses me very favourably, for it seems much more methodical and searching than that of Mr. Man. At the same time, I am not informed to what extent either, or both, or neither, of these observers can converse with the Andamanese in their own languages or dialects. Mr. Man made a dictionary containing 6000 Andamanese words, and wrote learnedly on the grammar. It is to be hoped that Mr. Brown will speedily publish all his materials, when my ignorance on this and other points will be enlightened. As to "misinterpretation,"-a student at home has only the reports of students in the field, such as Mr. Howitt, and the charge of misinterpretation must rest on them rather than on the pale denizen of the study. They misinterpret with singular unanimity, in all uncivilised regions of our globe. They describe a non-animistic great being, of no known parentage and not an Alcheringa man, who created, or made, the world, but not all the things in it necessarily, who now lives in the sky, and, if</page><page sequence="2">Correspondence. 493 not immortal, "is still running"; and who often sanctions conduct and is a judge of souls. As to his "invisibility," at least in the Andaman islands "nobody ever sees him" or her. Though nobody ever saw Puluga, yet people describe his per- sonal appearance; such is the nature of mythological logic. When an Andamanese says that a thing is never seen, he means, I think, what we mean by "invisible." People speak amongst us of " the unseen world," when they mean the world of ghosts, which, according to them, are pretty often on view. Mr. Brown discovers that, in at least six linguistic groups out of eleven, Biliku or Bilika',-(we think of Dickens's The Billikin),- or Oluga is female, while in two cases Puluga is male, and in three cases the sex of Bilik is doubtful. In four cases the name means spider, and in one monitor lizard, which satis- factorily accounts for the circumstance that the being is eighteen feet high and anthropomorphic, at least in one instance where the name does not mean spider. But, as the word is radically the same in all the groups, let it be supposed that it always meant spider, though where the being is male the meaning is lost, which is odd. We are reminded of the African Ananzi (spider) and of the Bushman Cagn (mantis insect). A very decent All-Father Cagn is, accord- ing to what Qing, king Ngusha's Bushman hunter, told Mr. Orpen, who reports his conversation. We now consider the female Billikinses. It would be inter- esting to know if they are found in tribes with female descent, while the male beings occur in tribes with male descent. Where the Billikinses have a husband, Tarai, as in the north, we are reminded of Birrahgnooloo, who "is mother of all and not related to any one clan," and is the consort of Byamee, but not a wife, "not vulgarised by ordinary domestic relations" (The Euaklayi Tribe, Mrs. Langloh Parker, p. 7). She hears prayers for rain, and makes Byamee's actual wife "start the flood- ball of blood rolling down the mountains." But Byamee is the predominant partner. Where there are female Billikinses, named spider, their husband is the south-west wind; while, where Puluga rules, his brothers are the winds. Such variants as to the relationships of mythical beings are very common in South-East</page><page sequence="3">494 Correspondence. Australia, and are minutely discussed by Phre Schmidt, in his Origine de l'Idle de Dieu.1 The chief being, whether male or female, is in the Andamans (as almost everywhere) closely associ- ated with thunder, lightning, storm, and wind. Bad weather is caused by the anger of the being, whether male or female. Only three "causes of wrath" are mentioned by Mr. Brown; no moral cause of wrath is dreamed of. Mr. Man gave quite an opposite version; Puluga is angered by certain moral offences, as well as by actions which seem to us indifferent. Mr. Brown supposes that "a native" invented Puluga's ethical aspect, in answer to a leading question by Mr. Man. If Mr. Man had only one informant on this point, to whom he put a leading question, he is much to be blamed. But is this likely? Mr. Man writes,-" I have taken special care not only to obtain information on each point from those who are considered by their fellow-tribesmen as authorities, but who . . . were in entire ignorance regarding any save their own legends," and he took pains to test all statements.2 He got information as to Puluga being judge of the dead, giving rewards and punishments. This is a fairly common attribute among All-Fathers, and, as we have, in Central Australia, several non-moral All-Fathers, (among the Loritja, Kaitish, and Arunta), while for ethical All-Fathers in the south-east Mr. Howitt, Mrs. Langloh Parker, and Mr. Cameron may be consulted (leaving missionary evidence aside), I suggest that a belief which Mr. Man found has not been found by Mr. Brown; or it may have died out. In Revue des ftudes Ethno- graphiques for April, 1909, I examine the question, is the moral or the non-moral view of the All-Father the earlier? The student may be referred to this essay. I need not dwell on Mr. Brown's hypotheses as to the reason why the beings are credited with knowing only three causes of wrath, and these non-moral. No doubt the Andamanese have practical reasons for their faith. The odd thing is that the causes of wrath are so very few, for the tribes must object to a great many practices. The beings, in all cases, are quite distinct from the mythical 1Anthropos, 19o9. 2Journal of the Anthropological Institute, etc., vol. xii., p. 157.</page><page sequence="4">Correspondence. 495 ancestors, or Alcheringa folk. This is rather curious, for, in most mythologies where an All-Father occurs, he is a good deal mixed up with Alcheringa folk; though, when he makes the world, and makes himself, he seems on a much higher level than they. In two or three cases the Andamanese beings leave the earth in anger. " Biliku's present abode is in the sky to the north-east." This departure of the All-Father to the sky, and his unceasing residence there, are a very common, indeed almost universal, form of the myth. According to the Kaitish, Atnatu made himself and another world beyond the sky, where he dwells. Usually, however, the All-Father goes skyward after a sojourn on earth. In one Andamanese myth, Biliku has changed into a stone, like a common Alcheringa person. The story of fire-theft from these beings, such as Bundjel or Zeus, is familiar. Mr. Brown gives the legend of Biliku as "the creator of the world," adding,--"I was often told that Biliku was the first human being, and that she made the earth and the first Andamanese. But there was no legend of creation in connec- tion with Biliku." Does Mr. Brown mean that only white people told him about a creation legend which the natives repudiated? Or does he mean that, in legend, Biliku made the earth, but human beings "came otherwise "? I am anxious not to misinterpret Mr. Brown. He writes,-" Biliku, the same man told me, made the earth and sky and sea, but it does not seem that she was the creator of men." The All-Father some- times, like Pundjel, is the maker of men out of earth, wood, or other raw material: but often they come otherwise. Biliku is clearly regarded as a creator on a fairly large scale,-earth, sea, and sky,-though I am often told that savages could not possibly evolve such a belief. They can, teste Mr. Brown (and many others). We now come to the points of difference between Mr. Brown and Mr. Man. I. The latter told us that Puluga had a wife, a green shrimp, whom we may regard as a parallel to the Biliku spiders. But Puluga, in two or three groups, is the predominant partner. As to his being "like fire" (Mr. Man) or anthropomorphic (Mr. Brown), the question is otiose, as, according to both</page><page sequence="5">496 Correspondence. enquirers, nobody ever sees him; not that he is invisible, he merely cannot be seen. II. Mr. Brown holds that the belief in the male Puluga or Bilik is secondary; "those groups which represent Puluga as male have changed their belief." Perhaps,-but why? Does the change correspond to any change in society ? The question has been much discussed in connection with the goddess of "Minoan" and Asiatic civilisation. III. Mr. Man says that Puluga "is immortal." No more than "all other beings in the Andamanese myths are immortal," says Mr. Brown. "No one has ever supposed it possible that they might come to an end." But he has told us that Biliku came to as much of an end as Lot's wife (p. 265). And where are all the other beings in the Andamanese myths? Puluga and Co. are in the sky. IV. As to Mr. Man's story that Puluga, like Pundjel, "knows all the thoughts of their hearts, by day," Mr. Brown does not comment on the matter. V. We have already spoken about "causes of wrath," and Mr. Brown does not enter, at present, into the question of a future life. He gives his own theory of the origin of the beliefs, in meteorological phenomena. But how the north-east wind could be supposed to create sky, earth, and sea, I know not. Finally, except as to the female character of some of these creative and sky-dwelling persons, Mr. Brown tells us nothing for which I cannot find a parallel in the All-Father myths of the world. He shows us beings of unknown, and not of human, origin; not Alcheringa folk; makers of earth, sky, and sea, and now dwellers in the sky; who so far observe human conduct as to punish certain offences; who are wielders of the thunderbolt, and lords of the weather; who are not animistic, not exalted ghosts. These beings are already quite well recognised among certain rare types,-decadent, perhaps, perhaps not yet fully evolved,-by friends of the All-Father theory. They are no new things to us; we only ask, are they degraded or nascent types of the All-Father?</page><page sequence="6">Correspondence. 497 He was a mythical figure ignored or explained away by almost all anthropologists till quite recent years, under the sug- gestion of the animistic theory of the origin of religion. Mr. Brown has provided us with valuable materials for the study of the All-Father belief, because, strictly speaking, neither his beings nor the Tukura of the Loritja can be called All-Mothers or All-Fathers. As far as he tells us, men see in them angry rulers,-but have no filial relation to them, any more than in the case of the Loritja Tukura. But, in many instances, such creative sky-dwellers have been credited with the fatherhood of mankind, and with the sanction of ethics, and Tukura and the Andamanese beings may have once been regarded as ethical and kind, and have lost their attributes.
