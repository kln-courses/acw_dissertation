<plain_text><page sequence="1">No Pet Left Behind: Accommodating Pets in Emergency Planning Hillary A. Leonard and Debra L. Scammon New federal legislation requiring accommodation of pets and service animals in emergency planning has garnered broad, bipartisan support. The authors review changes in societal views of pets that may have contributed to the recent passage of the Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act. The authors identify some areas in which interpretation of the provisions of the act will require further debate and definition. Finally, they offer suggestions on how marketing skills can be employed to make emergency planning more effective. "The concept is as old as Noah's Ark." (Wan 2006, p. B1) On October 6, 2006, one year after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, President Bush signed the Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act (PETS Act, Pub. Law No. 109-308) into law. The act amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assis- tance Act (as amended by Public Law 106-390) and makes availability of federal disaster assistance funds contingent on states having plans that provide for the needs of people with service animals and/or household pets.1 Although other measures to address weaknesses in disaster response and emergency planning continue to be debated and discussed, this bill moved quickly through Congress and received wide support in both the House (initially passing with a vote of 349 to 24) and the Senate (which passed it unanimously). Remarkably, Congressman Lantos (2006), one of the bill's original sponsors, claims that he received more support for the PETS Act than for any other legislation in his 25-year tenure in office. As its supporters explain, the primary rationale for the PETS Act focuses in general on the safety of humans. His- tory shows that humans are less likely to take self-protective behaviors during emergencies and may actually take per- sonal risks if they are unable to care for their pets adequately (Animal Disasters 2005; Basler 2006). Many believe that if emergency planning acknowledges the significance of ani- mals to humans, enhanced safety of humans will be a natu- ral by-product. Thus, understanding the value society places on pets and service animals is important to understanding the implications of the PETS Act. Many questions related to the values society places on pets, the translation of these values into public policy, and ways that marketing can support the implementation of the new policy arise from the passage of the PETS Act. Given that no bill has been passed to address the accommodation of the sick, poor, or elderly in emergency planning (Ripley 2006), why has a bill pertaining to pets and service animals received such widespread support? What does passage of the PETS Act indicate about the value of pets in society? How pets are valued has implications for the implementa- tion and impact of this legislation. Furthermore, implemen- tation of the PETS Act could benefit from marketing tech- niques and tools that can be employed to improve both animal emergency planning and general emergency planning. Social Values and Policy Issues Public policies reflect the values of the society in which they are implemented. Emergency planning policies convey notions of who and what are worthy of and need protection. In this way, the PETS Act is a potent prism through which to examine the status of pets in American society. Although the experiences during Hurricane Katrina propelled concern for pets, service animals, and their human caretakers to the forefront of public visibility and onto the agenda of policy makers, the resulting PETS Act also reflects a slow but radi- cal change in the understanding of pets in American society. Research on the Role of Pets Historically, pets have been understood as personal property with little worth beyond their market value. However, within the past three decades, public sentiment toward ani- mals has shifted dramatically as people's understanding of the emotional and sentimental value of their pets has changed (Finkelstein 2005). These changes have not gone unnoticed by researchers in consumer behavior and soci- ology, who have examined the roles of animals in people's 1The PETS Act further authorizes funds to assist state and local authori- ties in creating plans to accommodate household pets and service animals and for creating specific emergency shelters that will accommodate people with household pets or service animals.

A decade ago in a special issue of Society &amp; Animals, researchers considered pets and consumption from various perspectives. Belk (1996) suggests that people conceptual- ize pets as pleasures, problems, parts of self, members of the family, and toys. Pets allow caretakers to explore their own consumption experiences and otherwise be self-reflective about their relationships with their pets (Holbrook 1996). Pets facilitate desired forms of social exchange and deflect unwanted public encounters (Gillespie, Leffler, and Lerner 1996). Loss or dispossession of pets also raises various themes that are important in human-pet relationships, including love and friendship, joy in life versus sorrow in death, and pets as family members (Stephens and Hill 1996). Other research in consumer behavior suggests that pets fill various positions in society, including roles as orna- ments, status symbols, equipment, or companions for humans (Hirschman 1994). For most caretakers, pets are more than mere companions; they are family (Holbrook et al. 2001; Serpell 2003). This line of research highlights a dichotomy with regard to how society views animals: Specifically, animals are cast as objects to be used or as beings with whom to interact (Sanders and Hirschman 1996). As we suggest subsequently, this dichotomy under- lies difficult issues of the interpretation and implementation of the PETS Act. More recently, a special issue of Journal of Business Research on animal companions has emphasized the impact of society's value of pets in the marketplace. One article demonstrates that pets, specifically dogs, enhance human relationship satisfaction and well-being (Cavanaugh, Leonard, and Scammon 2007). The authors suggest that these benefits, in part, drive the expenditures humans make on their pets. Another article examines human-pet relation- ships and identifies and explores the role of pets as exten- sions of the self (Hill, Gaines, and Wilson 2007). Another article reports that pet owners who are excessive spenders tend to spend extravagantly on their pets (Ridgeway et al. 2007). Together, this work highlights the important place that pets have in people's lives and, thus, the significant value they hold for humans. These values undoubtedly influenced the speedy and largely uncontested enactment of the PETS Act. Rationale for Accommodating Pets in Disasters Planning and concern for animals in disasters is based on a wide range of diverse but often overlapping concerns (Baker and Gimenez 2005). These concerns can be divided into four broad areas: economic considerations, public health issues, emotional well-being of humans who share bonds with pets, and the welfare of pets themselves. Historically, the first two considerations have been paramount. Tradi- tional planning for animals revolved around the agricultural value of animals, in terms of both their impact on the econ- omy and their importance as secure food sources (Federal Emergency Management Agency 2006; Heath et al. 2001). Public health issues have also been a concern with regard to animals. Free-roaming animals displaced by disaster can contaminate water and food supplies through uncontained elimination, trampling, and foraging. Sick and dead animals are breeding grounds for bacteria, viruses, and parasites and can cause outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as cholera and anthrax (Bloomberg.com 2005). Beyond the economic and public health concerns for household pets, additional concerns are for the welfare of their human caretakers and for the pets themselves. Humane concerns include both the emotional toll that animal disas- ters can take on humans and the consideration of appropri- ate and ethical treatment of all living creatures. These latter two concerns have increased in prominence as public senti- ment toward animals has shifted. Humane Concerns and the Legal and Policy Perspective on Pets Increasingly, humane concerns for animals and their care- takers have become evident in the legal treatment of ani- mals. Until recently, almost all legal cases involving animal injury or death calculated damages on the basis of the replacement cost of the animal (St. John 2006). However, more courts are recognizing the strong bonds between humans and their pets (Mariner 2003). Courts have included "pet support" in divorce settlements, awarded damages based on sentimental value and for emotional pain, and rec- ognized pets as legitimate recipients of pet trusts set up to provide for pets after their caretakers have died (Finkelstein 2005; St. John 2006). This more emotional-based value of pets is prominent in the move to accommodate pets in disasters. Although courts, researchers, and policies progressively recognize an increasing value of pets to humans, society today questions the morality of valuing animals solely on the basis of their worth to humans. The implication of rec- ognizing the inherent value of animals, as well as their rights to life and to a life free of pain and suffering, has become an important issue both philosophically and practically (Regan 1983). Support for giving animals legal rights for their own sake, not just as property, is often based on animal welfare and ethical moral arguments. Animal-rights philosophers use moral arguments to assert that animal rights should not be founded on an animal's relationship with humans. To illustrate, they explain that animal torture is morally repre- hensible not because it entails damage to someone's prop- erty or discomfort experienced by humans watching or knowing that the animal is suffering. Rather, it is the suffer- ing of the animal that is insupportable (Francione 2000). Furthermore, philosophers have argued that the interests of animals should not be discounted because of the animals lack of certain abilities, such as the ability to create tools, speak, reason, or act morally-abilities that certain humans with developmental or physical disabilities or in comatose states also lack. Indeed, arguments that deny animals rights because of their lack of abilities face increasing opposition as animal scientists find additional proof of animals' pos- session of each of these abilities. Many people would like to avoid animals suffering as a result of a disaster. Although advocates and congressional sponsors have rationalized their endorsement of the PETS Act primarily on the basis of how accommodating pets in emergencies will improve human safety, they acknowledge animal welfare as a secondary rationale for the law (Shays 2006).</page><page sequence="3">Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing 51 Impact of the Status of Pets on Policy Implementation Although arguments about the legal and moral status and rights of animals and pets may appear academic, how soci- ety resolves them has implications for the implementation of the PETS Act. The PETS Act could be interpreted to mean that pets have rights of their own and thus deserve protec- tion, or it could be interpreted to mean that pets are simply special possessions (as are other consumer possessions) that require special accommodation. Interpretation of the PETS Act as giving pets the status of deserving protection in their own right does not necessarily signal a formal change in the status of pets. Some public policies already confer such status on pets (Mariner 2003). In the context of such laws, anyone abetting the abandon- ment of pets in an emergency that requires human evacua- tion would be violating the law (Heath, Voeks, and Glick- man 2001). This interpretation implies that pets facing disasters are vulnerable and that accommodations for their safety are a means for minimizing their vulnerability. If policy makers interpret the PETS Act with the assump- tion that pets are property to be accommodated as other important personal property, this raises the question of how other types of property are protected. Traditionally, people protect their possessions with insurance that bases compen- sation for lost or damaged possessions on market or replace- ment value. However, insurance is of little help to disaster victims who suffer the loss of cherished possessions. As is often the case with other cherished mementos and heir- looms, people frequently view pets as irreplaceable. It is these irreplaceable items that people are most likely to bring with them when they evacuate or return to a disaster zone to save. As such, policies such as the PETS Act could help pre- serve these important possessions while protecting humans by minimizing the necessity for them to put themselves in harms way to protect their pets. Implementation of the PETS Act also raises the question of which animals are to be covered by the accommodation requirement. The PETS Act creates a distinction between pets/service animals and all other animals. The definition of what animals to cover in emergency planning will reflect society's views of different animals. Today, households keep exotic pets, such as snakes, alligators, and lions. Larger animals, such as horses and llamas, which have historically been classified as livestock, are now frequently kept as com- panions (Lockwood 2004). The animal welfare justification for considering pets in emergency planning could be inter- preted as opening the argument that all animals should be accommodated rather than simply those to which humans have the closest bonds. It is worth noting that according to the Americans with Disabilities Act, disabled people may not be denied services because of the presence of their ser- vice animal. Although not yet tested by the courts, it could be argued that to be in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, emergency rescue responders must accom- modate people with their service animals and that the PETS Act simply reinforces this obligation. The PETS Act does not specify what states must do to accommodate pets, only that they must have a plan for pets and service animals in place. As do many federal policies, the PETS Act provides the impetus for planning but leaves the details up to states and local jurisdictions. Ultimately, it is the implementation of the policy that will indicate how society chooses to interpret the value of pets. Contributions from Marketing Despite unresolved policy issues, the PETS Act's passage into law requires states and localities to include pets and ser- vice animals in their disaster planning. Marketing expertise has much to contribute to animal disaster preparedness and potentially could be used to leverage this preparedness to improve overall emergency preparedness. Even the best laid plans will not succeed unless people are made aware of how they should prepare for and respond to an emergency. Social marketing programs can be invalu- able in supporting citizen education and preparedness. As pet owners become more aware of and take a more active role in animal emergency preparedness, marketers are likely to find new product and service opportunities. Finally, mar- keters' expertise in logistics and distribution could help in planning for and implementing disaster assistance. Social Marketing Social marketing campaigns could be useful in at least two ways: (1) They could motivate pet owners to engage in pro- tective behaviors, and (2) they could educate pet owners about what protective measures they can take. Motivating people to take the steps necessary to prepare for an emer- gency can be difficult. Research suggests that people are more likely to engage in helping behavior that will benefit animals than they are to protect themselves (Selbert 2002). However, other research shows that households with pets (without children) are the least likely to comply with evacu- ation orders (Heath et al. 2001). Pet owners may be reluctant to follow evacuation orders because their pets will not be accommodated. Social marketing programs could assist emergency planners to leverage this desire to protect pets, especially among the more than 63% of U.S. households with pets, leading to better preparedness for emergencies and compliance with response efforts in the case of disasters. Educating pet owners about ways to prepare for an emer- gency is another critical need with which marketing can assist. Social marketing campaigns that encourage and facilitate pet identification should be developed, and veteri- narians and pet products retailers should be enlisted to urge that all clients participate. Advice and information about evacuation and sheltering options could be included in community-sponsored public service announcements. Social marketing campaigns should also be developed to encourage households to supplement their disaster pre- paredness kits with ones specifically for their pets. A system of identifying homes in which pets live should also be developed to support pets that people may not be able to evacuate themselves. Logistics and Planning Animal emergency planning and management require the mobilization and coordination of various resources. Recent advances in logistics could be useful in coordinating dis-</page><page sequence="4">52 Accommodating Pets in Emergency Planning aster responses. Logistics expertise could be employed in coordinating rescue operations to save evacuees with ani- mals or abandoned animals. Such expertise could assist in determining the appropriate location for animal shelters and care clinics, in stocking and staffing them, and in efforts to reunite owners and pets. Logistics expertise could also help various animal welfare organizations optimize the solicita- tion and collection of donations of money, supplies, and vol- unteers and coordinate their use to the best advantage. New Product Development As citizens become more involved in pet emergency pre- paredness, several new product and service opportunities may emerge. There is likely to be an expanded market for identification products, pet carriers and restraints, pet disas- ter preparedness kits, and even transportation equipment. Opportunities also may emerge for new products and ser- vices, such as pet evacuation transportation, emergency sheltering, and "pet disaster insurance" that would cover the costs for these services and medical care for displaced pets. Such insurance could be purchased by pet owners, similar to preventive health policies, with benefits available in case of a disaster. Conclusion The recent dramatic events of the 2005 hurricane season highlight shifts in public sentiments regarding the value of pets, how they improve the quality of life of their human companions, and the moral obligation that many people feel to ensure the well-being of all living creatures. To date, the PETS Act has received widespread support, but some states and municipalities attempting to put policies in place to accommodate pets have met with resistance (Block 2006). Some people fear that the act will protect pets to the detri- ment of saving people. Still, the goodwill that the passage of the PETS Act has engendered across party lines in Congress is being positioned as a springboard for creating a climate of cooperation and collaboration as the legislature tackles con- tentious issues related to disaster planning in general (Ober- star 2006). Regardless of how the status of animals in society is ulti- mately conceptualized and interpreted, there is a historical precedent for including pets in disaster preparedness. His- tory demonstrates that accommodating pets helps save human lives and reduces human suffering (see Animal Dis- asters 2005). The special expertise and tools that marketers use could make a contribution to communicating the impor- tance of accommodating pets in emergencies and facilitating the protection and care of animals during disasters. We hope not only that marketers will be advocates for the accommo- dation of pets in the public policy process but also that people developing and implementing policies will take advantage of what marketers have to offer in support of pub- lic awareness, logistics expertise, and entrepreneurial spirit to provide needed products and services.
