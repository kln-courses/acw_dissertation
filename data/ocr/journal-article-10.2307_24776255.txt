<plain_text><page sequence="1">St. Mawr and the Search for Community By Jerry Wasserman In his fine study of D. H. Lawrence's The Rainbow, Marvin Mudrick finds the novel "revolutionary" in two respects: its treatment of physical passion as a normal and significant part of human experience, and its rendering of the consequences of the social revolution which was destroying English community life in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. A major strain of the work of Lawrence continues his concern with these two themes and their relationship to one another. Sex, as Mudrick notes, has an important social dimension in the Lawrencean world. Modern man, bereft of a sense of community, finds in sex "the bond of tranquillity and faith between man and woman,. . . the last renewable proof of human com munity."1 As late as the last year of his life, Lawrence himself writes of sex i"The Originality of The Rainbow," Spectrum, III (Winter, 1959), 10, 17.</page><page sequence="2">114 St. Mawr and the Search for Community as "the great unifier" that is needed to overcome the sense of isolation which arises "as the feeling of oneness and community with our fellow-men declines. .. ."2 Beginning with The Rainbow, a number of Lawrence's novels explore the various degrees of success with which individuals substitute the sexual life for the communal. Among the novels which deal with this theme, St. Mawr occupies an important position both chronologically and dialectically. Written in 1924 and published the following year, St. Mawr discloses a world in which the community and its codes have lost all potency. It thus represents in its extreme the breakdown that in the earlier novels, The Rainbow and Women in Love, was still in process. Nevertheless, St. Mawr rejects the sexual alternative which those earlier novels propose and which the later works, Lady Chatterley's Lover and The Man Who Died, positively affirm. The quest for a meaningful existence, in which Lou Witt, Lady Carrington, is engaged, ends with her rejecting sexuality and, in fact, all significant human relationship. She eventually finds a substitute for the communal life she lacks in a mystical, quasi-sexual union with the "wild spirit" of the New Mexico landscape. Whether or not this choice is efficacious, however, is problem atical. The reasons which led her to it are to be found in St. Mawr\ but the significance of her choice and the possibility of a meaningful life for her can be evaluated only in the context of Lawrence's other works. At the same time, a clear understanding of the problems inherent in the decisions Lou makes illuminates the other novels in which Lawrence is concerned with the search for community. One can trace through the early novels the process of community dis integration which culminates in St. Mawr. Sons and Lovers opens with a description of the physical community by which the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Morel are strictly circumscribed. Home, the mine, and the pub define the limits of Mr. Morel's world, while her family, occasional visits from the local clergyman, and the Women's Guild are Mrs. Morel's only interests. Even Paul, who ranges beyond the physical bounds of the community, never really escapes the centripetal force of his mother's attraction. In any event his restlessness does not entail a rejection of the community or its values, and at the end of the novel he turns inward, toward the town and human fellowship. In The Rainbow the breakdown begins. The Brangwen women in the opening chapter look outward, away from the farm life in which the Brang wens have been so firmly fixed for generations. The movement of the entire novel is outward: significantly, two chapters are entitled, "The Widening Circle." With the coming of the canal, the collieries, and the railway, the insularity of the community is violated and the Brangwens begin actively to seek the alienness that has been thrust upon them. Tom Brangwen can find it in Lydia Lensky, the Polish woman; the restlessness of Anna and Will can be satiated through sheer physicality. But by the time Ursula is growing up the disintegration of the old order is imminent and calls for nothing less than complete rejection. The elder Brangwens leave the working-class 2A Propos of Lady Chatterley's Lover (London, 1930), p. 57.</page><page sequence="3">St. Mawr and the Search for Community 115 existence of Cossethay for the bourgeois life of "the new, red-brick part of Beldover," and a house whose keynote is "good and substantial." And Ursula cannot be satisfied with merely ethnic "strangeness." She rejects Skrebensky and the entire "world of artificial light," and becomes "a traveler on the face of the earth" in search of some kind of fulfillment.3 Her final vision is of a complete transfiguration of the corrupt and degraded social world; but the coming Utopian order is suggested only metaphorically, by means of the rainbow image. Nothing really concrete is offered to replace the loss of communal life. Women in Love completes the process of disintegration begun in the earlier novel. Ursula and Gudrun are equally uncomfortable in the home of their parents, the colliery town of Beldover, and the upper-crust society of the Criches and Hermione Roddice. The movement of the characters no longer has any direction; it is simply drift. The life of the community is replaced by the structureless, valueless society of the Halliday group. Stability yields to the temporary and irresolute artificial life of the resort, which becomes the norm. The country-squire existence of Shortlands and Breadalby, which seem to be presented initially as versions of pastoral,4 proves to be as false and empty as the bohemian existence of London. "Class-barriers are breaking down!" becomes an ironic statement in the mouth of Birkin, who recognizes that he lives in a world where class-barriers remain the only things which offer any sense of "community" at all. Finally, Birkin and Ursula make the ultimate break with the tradition upon which at least the Victorian idea of community was based: they reject the world of things, particularly "a house and furniture of [their] own." " 'I don't want to inherit anything,' " Ursula says, and Birkin agrees, and the very foundations of English life are shaken. The novel ends with Birkin and Ursula staying at the Mill on Willey Water "for a week or two"—and then?5 The relative stability of their relationship is the only certainty left in their world. St. Mawr portrays a society with still less of a focus, less stability, and less meaning, in which the idea of community is even further removed from the norm than in Women in Love. There are two major reasons which make this possible: the setting is post-war England and none of the major characters is English. The experience of the war was crucial to Lawrence, and none of his novels shows its effects more clearly than St. Mawr. In his 1919 "Foreword" Lawrence writes that Women in Love "took its final shape in the midst of the period of war," and asserts that "the bitterness of the war may be taken for granted in the characters."6 But in St. Mawr the effects of the war are much more explicit. The pub, an important symbol for 3The Rainbow, Viking Compass edition (New York, 1961), pp. 421-422, 452, 417. 4Like the Marsh Farm in The Rainbow, the two estates in Women in Love offer the illusion of idyllic physical isolation. "Shortlands looked across a sloping meadow that might be a park, because of the large, solitary trees that stood here and there, across the water of the narrow lake, at the wooded hill that successfully hid the colliery valley beyond, but did not quite hide the rising smoke." "There seemed a magic circle drawn about the place [Breadalby], shutting out the present, enclosing the delightful, precious past, trees and deer and silence, like a dream."

The two grooms, Lewis and Phoenix, were both wounded in the war. More important, however, are the psychic wounds, the traumatic effects the war had on the spirit of England. Writing to a friend in 1915, Lawrence made a gloomy prediction: "After the War, the soul of the people will be so maimed and so injured that it is horrible to think of."8 Later that year he wrote a story, "England, My England," in which the main character, who is eventually killed in the war, yearns for "the savage old spirit" of England, "old gods, old, lost passions,... all the lost, intense sensations of the primeval people of the place... ."9 In 1922 the story was republished in a volume bearing its title, a kind of dirge for the "death" of the nation in the war. These are the feelings that are dramatized in St. Mawr. In this setting Lawrence places his five non-English characters: two Amer ican women, an American Indian, a Welshman, and an Australian. For Lawrence the fact that they are "colonials" provides them with an inherently weaker sense of community than the native Englishman who is rooted in more than a thousand years of history and tradition. As Rico stands before Lewis, he is aware of "that man-to-man exposure which is characteristic of the democratic colonies and of America. He knew he must ultimately be judged on his merits as a man, alone without a background ..." (p. 28). But Lou and Rico are especially déracinés. Lou has "the lurking sense of being an outsider everywhere, like a sort of gipsy, who is at home anywhere and nowhere. . . . She didn't quite belong." Before she finds herself in London at the beginning of the novel, she had lived in Louisiana and Texas, had gone to school in France, and "had drifted from Paris to Palermo, Biarritz to Vienna and back via Munich to London, then down again to Rome. Only fleeting trips to her America." And Rico, the Australian son of a government functionary recently made a baronet, "floated around Europe" before marrying Lou (pp. 7-8). Against this background of total instability Lou becomes attracted to the stallion, St. Mawr, has a "vision of evil" during which she articulates a diatribe of pure Lawrencean doctrine, becomes disgusted with mankind in general, and finally retreats to the ranch in New Mexico where she plans to live a celibate and all but solitary life. In order to understand why she, unlike the characters in the previous novels, explicitly rejects the sexual relationship as a substitute for the communal stability she obviously lacks, it is necessary to examine St. Mawr in some detail. The vision of England seen through Lou's eyes is essentially a wasteland. TSt. Mawr (New York, 1925), p. 43.

Lou's social life has a strange, unreal quality: all her acquaintances "seemed so entirely contained within their cardboard let's-be-happy world" (p. 40). The ennui of such a life expresses itself in a purposeless expending of energy: "... motor twenty miles to luncheon at Lady Tewkesbury's: then young Mr. Burns came flying down in his aeroplane from Chester: then they must motor to the sea, to Sir Edward Edwards' place, where there was a moonlight bathing-party. Everything intensely thrilling, and so innerly wearisome, Lou felt" (p. 47). "England seems full of graves to me," Lawrence wrote in an earlier poem,10 and this is the image of English village life that is presented in St. Mawr. Mrs. Witt's country house overlooks a graveyard, and the morbid pleasure she finds in having "gravestones under [her] drawing-room windows, and funerals for lunch" (p. 42), reflects the quality of the life which the society of the Vyners, the Edwards, and Flora Manby affords her and Lou. Like The Sun Also Rises, the central metaphor of the English section of St. Mawr is castration. Lou comes to think in terms of "our whole eunuch civilization," in which "the very apples on the trees" are "geldings" (p. 127). Mrs. Witt rides a gelding and she is pure castrating female, as, "holding those terrifying shears with their beak erect," she cuts Lewis' hair and attempts to cut off his beard, an obvious symbol of his masculinity (p. 66). That the war has been at least partially responsible for the emasculation of England is indicated by Lewis' having had a finger shot off. And Flora Manby is "just wild to get that horse in hand," to geld St. Mawr, the one symbol of sheer male vitality left in England (p. 131). Even St. Mawr, however, cannot stud. He is effectively sterile amid the "sneaking, sterilizing cruelty" of eunuch England (p. 127). For Lou the most immediate example of this sterility is her husband, Rico. He is not physically impotent, although their marriage is sexless. But his masculinity is simply not vital. Whereas he ought to have been assertive, he was "completely ... mastered" by Lou (p. 7). His self-control, gallant kind ness, and shrewdness, Lou finds, are all "a bluff, an attitude," deliberately and unspontaneously conceived (p. 25). His head, "one of the famous 'talking heads' of modern youth," is dominant and independent of his body (p. 28). He is effeminate and foppish in his dress, and much more spiritually and socially akin to Flora Manby than to Lou. Like that insipid young lady, Rico maintains a vacuous optimism for the sake of social propriety and form. His "formula" for dealing with other people—" 'Let's know the worst, dear! But let's look on the bright side, and believe the best'" (p. 45)—is necessary for the maintenance of his own self-image: "this pretty-pretty picture of a charming young wife and a delightful little home and a fascinating success as a painter of fashionable and, at the same time, 'great' portraits.. (p. 17). Worst of all, as Lou interprets his relations with St. Mawr, Rico is actually destructive of the real life he himself lacks, "willing the minor disintegration of all positive living" with his "eunuch cruelty" (pp. 104, 127). It is in this context that Lou responds so passionately to St. Mawr. The 10"Spirits Summoned West," Birds, Beasts and Flowers (New York, 1923), p. 172.</page><page sequence="6">118 St. Mawr and the Search for Community horse is a common and important symbol in much of Lawrence's work. "He is a dominant symbol," Lawrence writes in Apocalypse, "he gives us lord ship: he links us, the first palpable and throbbing link with the ruddy glowing Almighty of potence: he is the beginning of our godhead in the flesh."11 As an embodiment of male energy, the horse has a minor role in Sons and Lovers, where Clara feels a strong physical attraction to a stallion, and a more substantial role at the end of The Rainbow, where Ursula's confrontation with the horses determines the resolution of the novel. In St. Mawr the eponymous stallion not only embodies the last remnants of maleness in a eunuch civilization; he also is informed with "Pan," "the Great God," "the hidden mystery" which dwelt in the old savage England, but which has been lost with the coming of the modern age (p. 78). His first effect on Lou is to jolt her out of her vapid existence. "She could not bear the triviality and superficiality of her human relationships. Looming like some god out of the darkness was the head of that horse, with the wide, terrible, questioning eyes. And she felt that it forbade her to be her ordinary, commonplace self" (p. 23). Ultimately, he is the catalyst through which Lou's general dissatisfaction with men is transformed into misanthropy. For she finds in the "great animal sadness" which comes from St. Mawr, "the race of men judged in the consciousness of the animals they have subdued, and there found unworthy, ignoble" (p. 106). This realization, after her "vision of evil," finally determines her flight from England and human fellowship. In the interim, however, she has been inspired by St. Mawr to seek a man who gets his life "straight from the source, as the animals do," as, specifically, St. Mawr does (p. 71). The two grooms, Phoenix and Lewis, are the only men in the novel who can conceivably meet this criterion. Both live their lives with horses—i.e., close to "the source"—and both spring from races in which, at least for Lawrence, Pan was still Unfällen and the old, dark life of the body still had primacy. As an American Indian, Phoenix has his roots in the primitive life and dark gods of his tribe. His name, of course, also suggests his potential for bringing about the regeneration of life out of the ashes of contemporary civilization. Lewis is from Wales, "one of those places where the spirit of aboriginal England still lingers, the old savage England ..." (p. 90). The old gods are still literally alive for Lewis in the Welsh fairy-tales which serve him as a quasi-religion. But ultimately, these men too are found wanting. They are servants, not masters, and as such share with St. Mawr "the slavish malevolence of a domesticated creature" toward his master (p. 103). Like Mr. Harby, the schoolmaster in The Rainbow—and like St. Mawr—they are "imprisoned in a task too small and petty" for them, which necessarily perverts their natural maleness.12 Lewis, prefiguring Lou, has .withdrawn from the sexual life completely. He realizes that to enter into a sexual relationship with Mrs. Witt would be to degrade his body, and he turns down her proposal of marriage in order to maintain its sanctity and inviolability: " 'I could never touch with my body a woman whose servant I was,'" he explains (p. 150). Phoenix is just the opposite, but he is equally unfit to be a mate for Lou. "It is il Apocalypse (New York, 1932), p. 97. 1277ie Rainbow, p. 387.</page><page sequence="7">St. Mawr and the Search for Community 119 useless to glorify the savage," Lawrence writes elsewhere, despairing over the inability of the American Indian to live up to his expectations. "For he will kill Pan with his own hands, for the sake of a motor-car."13 This is a perfect description of the way Phoenix himself conceives of his relation ship to Lou: "he was ready to trade his sex... for the white woman's money and social privileges. ... all the thrill and excitement of the white man's motor-car and moving pictures and ice cream sodas and so forth" (p. 190). The white woman is good for nothing more than this. The phallic male in him, Phoenix feels (and Lawrence seems to share his opinion), could only find a real counterpart in the dark warmth of an Indian or Mexican woman. At the same time, Lou rejects him. She soon realizes that he is just "a sexual rat," and in "his rootlessness, his drifting, his real meaninglessness," not very different from Rico (p. 191). There is neither regeneration nor stability to be had in such a relationship. Thus a sexual partnership between the two American women and the two grooms is impossible from both points of view. Earlier in the novel, Lou, referring to St. Mawr, Phoenix, and Lewis, had remarked despairingly, " 'If only they were masters! If only there were some men with as much natural life as they have, and their brave, quick minds that commanded instead of serving! ' " And Mrs. Witt had answered, " 'There are no such men' " (p. 73). This becomes the final word on the possibility of Lou's establishing a viable sexual relationship in the novel.14 There are no Tom Brangwens or Anthony Schofields or Rupert Birkins in St. Mawr. The best may be full of passionate intensity, but they are not good enough. Lou's decision to reject sexuality altogether for the life of a "Vestal Virgin" is thus determined for her, in effect, by the circumstances of her world. The inevitability of Lou's rejection of sexuality, finally, is confirmed by the experience of Mrs. Witt. Mrs. Witt is surely one of the most interesting creations in the Lawrence canon, and deserves much more than just the cursory treatment this study can afford her. She is a character more directly in the traditional vein than most in Lawrence's fiction. One thinks specifically of Henry James and the middle-aged American in Europe realizing the emptiness of his life—"The terror of too lateV as Mrs. Witt expresses it (p. 121). Introduced initially as a stock Lawrencean villainess—"a fiendish psychologist" (p. 45), a castrating female, a confirmed admirer of mind rather than the animal in man, in short, Mrs. "wit"—she gradually becomes, like her daughter, woman in quest of the essential male. She is the one who defends St. Mawr against the Vyners and rescues him from the hands of Flora Manby. Lawrence even has her recall her past life in order to reveal lä"Pan in America," Phoenix: The Posthumous Papers of D. H. Lawrence, ed. Edward D. McDonald (New York, 1936), p. 31. 14For the common critical view of St. Mawr that agrees with Mrs. Witt, see Laurence Lerner, The Truthtellers: Jane Austen, George Eliot, D. H. Lawrence (London, 1967), p. 189. The qualification that F. R. Leavis offers—i.e., that the ideal man Lou posits is not present in any character in the novel and is not likely ever to be found by her, but is present in St. Mawr "as the marvellous creative intelligence of the author"— must, I would suggest, be rejected as meaningless. Lou needs a physical, sexual male; the vague idea of one which the reader gets from reading the novel—and it is even doubtful that such an impression is effected—will certainly not do for Lou. See F. R. Leavis, D. H. Lawrence: Novelist (London, 1955), p. 234.</page><page sequence="8">120 St. Mawr and the Search for Community that she was not naturally destructive, but had been made so by her school ing and the weakness of the men whom she had known. She is indeed "the old grey mare" (her ironic rendering of Rico's nickname for her, "belle-mère"), the counterpart of the stallion who has also been perverted by weak men. For Lou and the reader, the life of Mrs. Witt gives added authority to her assertion that "there are no such men," and her flight from England further confirms the validity of Lou's own flight. So like the heroine of "The Woman Who Rode Away," a story Lawrence wrote the same summer as St. Mawr, Lou rides away from a sterile marriage and a wasteland society, but to what? In her "vision of evil" Lou asserted a doctrine of creative destruction as one of the principles of life, and the ritual death to which the heroine of "The Woman Who Rode Away" submits herself seems to be such an act. It is a kind of creative self-destruction by which the life of the Indian tribe will hopefully be resurrected. In com parison the life Lou chooses to lead in New Mexico seems like purposeless egotism. Is she carrying out her own dictum that the best the individual can do is "depart from the mass" and "retreat to the desert, and fight" (p. 101)? One thinks of the Savage at the end of Brave New World. But St. Mawr hardly evokes visions of Lou fighting off the eunuch hordes which have descended upon the ranch. The question must be asked, then, whether her final decision presents any positive alternative to the sexual life she has found it necessary to reject and the communal life which is lacking in her world. First, it must be recognized that there is much authority in the writings of Lawrence for the solitary life that Lou decides upon even before she leaves for America. "The central law of all organic life," Lawrence writes in Studies in Classic American Literature, "is that each organism is intrinsically isolate and single in itself."15 Birkin, perhaps the most explicit spokesman of Lawrencean doctrine, shares Lou's hatred of the mass and has pleasant visions of "a world empty of people."16 The interpretation Lou gives to Christ's "Noli me längere" (p. 165) is also the theme of two of Lawrence's poems, a number of lines of which could serve as an epigraph to St. Mawr— such as: Great is my need to be chaste and apart, in this cerebral age.17 And in a 1916 letter in which he explains his reasons for wanting to go to America ("... the skies are not so old, the air is newer, the earth is not tired . .."), Lawrence ends with the injunction, "One must be single."18 The experiences that Lou herself has upon arriving in America, as she encounters in rapid succession the "ugly American" tourists of Havana, the superficial, "film-psychology" existence of Texas (p. 183), and the sexual stupidity of Phoenix, reaffirm for her what she had learned in Ensland: that there can be no life for her among men. 15Studies in Classic American Literature (New York, 1923), p. 95. 16Women in Love, pp. 119, 52. 17"Noli Me Tangere," Pansies (London, 1930), pp. 60-61.

Her almost hysterical final speech, in which she envisions herself in a kind of mystical sexual relationship with the landscape, must be viewed in the light of the interpolated story about the previous owners of the ranch. One can hardly imagine Lou coping any better than they did with "the curious debasing malevolence" which defeated them (p. 202). She is certainly much less capable and less serious about ranching.19 But even assuming that she can come to terms with "the wild spirit" of the place, can she really expect fulfillment of the romantic ideal she envisions? The New England woman who had responded so passionately to the ranch had left it, "maimed... for ever in her hope, her belief in paradise on earth" (p. 213). It was "absolute beauty" that she found in the landscape, but the absolute beauty of incompatible matter: "Man did not exist for it" (p. 207). Her relationship with it could never be fruitful. Compared to the "Absolute Beauty" that Will finds in the body of Anna in The Rainbow, it is a cul-de-sac.20 And it is this landscape, symbolized by the "passionless, non-phallic column" of the pine tree (p. 203), about which Lou says, " 'It needs me. It craves for me. And to it, my sex is deep and sacred . ." (p. 221). She commits the Lawrencean sin of anthropomorphism under the pressure of her sexual instincts, which remain dominant even though there are no men to satisfy them. Her solipsistic existence will thus be a sterile one. The last words of the novel emphasize the name of the ranch, Las Chivas, the she-goats: Lou and Mrs. Witt with no he-goats to make them fertile. Neither the Great God Pan nor even his satyrs exist here. It is difficult to see how this ending can anticipate, as one critic claims, "the reborn society, the phallic millennium."21 That Lawrence was dissatisfied with the choices Lou makes is suggested by some of his own responses to New Mexico. He, too, had fled from the wasteland of Europe to America. Once there, however, he found it unsatis factory, in spite of its beauty: "It seems to me, in America, for the inside life, there is just nothing. All this outside life—and marvellous country— and it all means so little to one."22 "It is all a form of running away from oneself and the great problems . . . ," he wrote from Taos.23 The at traction America had always held, according to Lawrence, was its offer of an escape from self under the guise of "freedom." But this freedom, especially the kind Lou thinks she finds, often proves an illusion: "Men are free when they belong to a living, organic, believing community. . . . Not when they are escaping to some wild west."24 Lou escapes from a situation in which the 19See Graham Hough, The Dark Sun: A Study of D. H.

Her inability to provide a solution to this problem of community which underlies the whole novel is the final failure of her vision. The Utopia that Ursula imagines at the end of The Rainbow is a community of men. Even Birkin's ideal, ultimately, involves communal relationship: " 'To be free, in a free place, with a few other people! ... a perfected relation between you and me, and others... .' "25 But Lou's vision does not extend beyond herself to others. Unable to perfect a sexual relationship, she eschews all human relationships except the very minimal ones with her mother and "Phoenix perhaps" (217), and by so doing assures the failure of her venture. Her embracing the landscape is a desperate but futile attempt to become, as it were, rerooted in the earth; as a substitute for the vital community of human beings it can only be temporary. Unlike the rainbow, it is a metaphor which in the last analysis offers nothing transcendent. Not only do the real problems remain unresolved at the end of St. Mawr, there is no indication that they are to have a solution. The hopes Lawrence had for a successful communal or sexual life for modern man reach their nadir in St. Mawr. The bitterness with which he had been left by the war and the failure of his own Utopian schemes, as well as his disappointment with America and the general state of affairs in Europe, appear throughout the novel. But by rendering Lou's predicament dramatically, Lawrence at least showed that her ways of trying to deal with these problems were totally inadequate. Therefore, in later novels he returned to his earlier attempts to find a sexual resolution for the dilemma of the breakdown of community life. Perhaps the deleterious effects of the war had worn off sufficiently for Lawrence by 1928. Mellors, Lady Chatterley's lover, could not have existed four years earlier in the world of St. Mawr. In any event Lady Chatterley's Lover presents a fully successful, "true phallic marriage," of the type which had been tentatively explored in the earlier novels. It is explicitly intended, at least in part, to provide for the "regeneration" of an England which had lost its sense of community.26 And in The Man Who Died, his last major work, Lawrence seems to suggest the sexual salvation of all of Western civilization. The parable of Christ's resurrection and "phallic marriage" with the priestess of Isis ends with the conception of a child, the pagan-christian man of the future, who signifies the regeneration of human society.27 The process by which Lawrence was able to arrive at such a hopeful prophecy was a difficult one. Nowhere in his fiction is that difficulty more evident than in St. Mawr. The struggle which constantly raged between the ideals he imagined and the realities he saw is completely one-sided in this novel, where ugly reality is too overpowering for Lou and Lawrence both. The symbol of the horse, which holds such promise early in the novel, gradually gives way to the goat—itself an ironic distortion of the pastoral 25Women in Love, p. 308. 2M Propos of Lady Chatterley's Lover, p. 49. 27See Mark Spilka, The Love Ethic of D.

Only the beautiful lyricism of the landscape descriptions temporarily brightens the gloomy world. But the novel is saved from total nihilism by the existence of Lou Witt. Though she is ultimately a failure, she never loses the essential vitality and the "correct" doctrinal point of view for which Lawrence singles her out. She must have been, for Lawrence, a tragic figure at the end of the novel. Her final situation closely resembles his description in an early work, "Study of Thomas Hardy," of the tragedy Hardy's characters suffer: "the tragedy of those who, more or less pioneers, have died in the wilderness, whither they had escaped for free action, after having left the walled security, and the comparative imprison ment, of the established conviction."28 He goes on to say that the tragic dilemma of a Hardy character inheres in the conflict between his obligation to uphold the moral and political forms of the community on the one hand, and his compulsion to break out of its bounds on the other. This is very different from Lou's circumstances, of course. The English "community," whose sterile conventionality she flees, does not in actuality exist for her except in so far as it exerts certain pressures of convention, and she feels absolutely no obligation to uphold its forms. Rather, it is the very lack of community in the Lawrencean sense—viable social and sexual structures embodied in vital men—that causes her tragedy. The "free action" she is driven to take in America assumes almost heroic proportions in its despera tion; but it cannot fill the void or inform the wilderness with human mean ing. Nevertheless, as long as Lawrence could even conceive of such a character as Lou, he could not totally despair of seeing "a living, organic, believing community" re-established in the pitiful world he portrays in St. Mawr.
