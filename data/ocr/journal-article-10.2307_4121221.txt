<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION OF STYLE: Thorstein Veblen's The Theory of the Leisure Class as Contested Text Gary Alan Fine University of Georgia Social scientists have begun to appreciate the importance of style in academic dis- course. Style and its evaluation, I argue, are not givens, but are created and negotiated by a body of readers, judging a text. To explain the process by which style comes to be known, I choose the case of Thorstein Veblen's The Theory of the Leisure Class, published in 1899. I demonstrate that style was always important in the interpretation of his work, and that this "classic" can be read as literature, scholarly discourse, humor, or poor writing-or a combination thereof. A consensus on the qualities of Veblen's style has never emerged. Focusing on claims emphasizing Veblen's irony, I suggest that an ironic interpretation is particularly likely when an author analyzes those with superior status. Veblen, a grayfaced shambling man lolling resentful at his desk with his cheek on his hand, in a low sarcastic mumble of intricate phrases subtly paying out the logical inescapable rope of matter-of-fact for a society to hang itself by, dissecting out the century with a scalpel so keen, so comical, so exact that the professors and students nineteenths of the time didn't know it was there, and the magnates and the respected windbags and the applauded loudspeakers never knew it was there. -John Dos Passos, "The Bitter Drink" The Big Money (1946, pp. 106-107) Writing is not only the conduit through which meaning is shared, but it is the meaning (Marcus and Clifford 1986; Becker 1986). As Stanley Fish argues in his Is There a Text in This Class?, we must be concerned with the how of a text and not only the what: the doing of texts. Narratives mean how they are told. Academics rely on fact, logic, metaphor, and story. In this I follow the argument of Bryan Green (1988, p. vii; Overington 1981) who argues that "sociological theory is a form of literary activity which belongs to a ubiquitous social practice: the simultaneous representation and construction of social life in determi- Direct all correspondence to: Gary Alan Fine, University of Georgia, Department of Sociology, Athens, GA 30602.

Texts are in Hayden White's (1987, p. 213) terms a form of "meaning production," and as such provide some measure of typicality for understanding the world in which they were both inscribed and read. As scholars we are engaged in "text work," attempting to depict the world in ways that communicate to a community of readers (Van Maanen 1988). Increasingly we experiment with the forms of our discourse, producing documents that would have been roundly scorned a few years ago (Pfohl 1992; Schneider 1991; Richardson and Lockridge 1991), an earlier age in which sociologists seemed to avoid style (Mills 1953, p. vii). Some aesthetic romantics eschew normal science discourse, believing that artistic genres ennoble the social scientist: preferring the book of Revelation to Deuteronomy. Robert Bierstedt (1960, p. 4) proposes that sociology "owns a rightful place in the domain of humane letters and belongs, with literature, history, and philosophy, among the arts that liberate the human mind." Our good neighbor, economist Donald McCloskey (1990, p. 162) addresses his colleagues: If even economics can be shown to be fictional and poetical and historical its story will become better. Its experts will stop terrorizing the neighborhood and peddling snake oil. Technically speaking the economist's story will become, as it should, a useful comedy-comprising words of wit, amused tolerance for human folly, stock charac- ters colliding at last in the third act, and, most characteristic of the genre, a universe in equilibrium and a happy ending. Reading McCloskey, one hears Garrison Keillor and his ruddy, above average Lake Wobegon kin cheering the upbeat denouement. But even if one prefers tragedy or satire, McCloskey's claim of a variety of discourse is compelling. This stance presumes that style is easily knowable-it's there after all. Yet, if all social reality is a social construction, then style is as well. In line with much contemporary literary theory, I recognize that a text is not a finished object, but is continually recon- structed in reading performances (Green 1988, p. 60). The comforting belief that we can easily assess what a style is, and how it is to be judged, is questionable. Readers disagree about texts, and such dissensus does not suggest misreading, but rather is part of the essential and necessary deconstruction of texts (Clough 1992; Atkinson 1992). A simple claim that we need to write better is inadequate if one recognizes the diversity of inter- pretation. Avoiding jargon, verbosity, or obscurity is helpful, but eschewing these sins, does not mean that textual practices are translucent (Green 1988, p. 15). The underlying problem in the sociology of knowledge is to describe how we know what a writer really means. How do we place a writer in light of the text, and beyond that how do we determine whether a work is "well-written," itself a contested concept. The content of the work, the genre in which the text is placed, the reputation and identity of the author, and conventions of interpretation permit the establishment of consensus, but the definition of style is precarious, subject to dispute. In this essay, I examine the interpretation of style, using a case study: the writings of the sociologist/economist Thorstein Veblen, emphasizing his "classic" The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study of the Evolution of Institutions (TLC).' Veblen's writing itself is a source of dispute, touched on by virtually every critic. My goal is not to treat Veblen's life or theory in detail, but rather I explore how his writings -as stylistic embodiments and discursive practices-have been received by generations of readers.</page><page sequence="3">The Social Construction of Style 459 IRONIC DETACHMENT Sociology, the child of dissenting, Social Gospel ministers, is not, even at its most bracing, a hopeful discipline. We are outsiders. Sociologists proclaim (Mills 1959) that analytic detachment is the sine qua non of our collective enterprise. The sociologist is, or should be, the community's marginal man.2 With one foot inside and one outside the world described, cutting alienation and member's knowledge can meld into a report: if not cynical, contentious, and facetious, at least rigorously suspicious, questioning the taken- for-granted.3 In practice, the idea of a lean and hungry sociology is shunted aside by practitioners, intellectually weighty and lazy, living off comfortable social institutions: universities, foundations, granting agencies. A debunking stance, admired and evinced by sociological giants as C. Wright Mills, Erving Goffman, Harold Garfinkel, George Homans, Joseph Gusfield, and Robert Merton, should be our domain. Irony is the footman/handmaiden of detachment. The sociological imagination is an ironic imagination (Machalek 1979). Irony is parcel of the outsider's dialectic between the incongruous is and ought to be that detached observation emphasizes (Brown 1983, 1987). By creating alternative worlds as possibilities (Tam 1984) and implying that things are not as they should be (Schneider 1975a), we create the world from our ironic perspec- tive. Writings may induce change in our readers who, confronting the text, see the world through a new lens (Schneider 1975b). The ironic stance withholds consensus (Burns 1953), until one's audience adapts. Beyond irony lies satire, with a blurred boundary4-a trope with a demanding moral basis, exposing sins by extending them and mocking them by taking them too seriously, arguing for ought claims held up, not held to. Detachment, irony, and satire by virtue of their subversive indirection represent arche- typal cases in which stylistic devices are potentially (and, sometimes, deliberately) ambig- uous. These devices conjure a mysterious author, making humor a dangerous and rare technique in scholarly writing. In humorous and metaphorical tropes the author and the authorial persona are not identical, in contrast to much social scientific writing where the translucent writer stands as the honest broker; as a consequence, extracting meanings from these texts is especially problematic. I argue that certain topics are especially likely to produce problematic, detached, ironic, satiric texts because of the ambivalent relationship of writer (and, often, the reader as well) to the theme. These pesky topics force the social scientist to gaze upward in the social structure, confronting the limits of his or her status claim. For instance, the role of elites in bourgeois, capitalist society, is both too close to and too distant from the author and audience, making ambiguous writings and readings particularly likely. One rarely finds ironic or satiric treatments of status inferiors; we use other stylistic tropes-for example, pathos or direct injustice claims-and do not use sly wit. THORSTEIN VEBLEN: ACADEMIC MANQUE Thorstein Veblen has settled into the sloganized memory of sociologists, little used in practice (Ryan 1982). His is a known name, an eminence gris, not a read presence. Those who refer to the leisure class, conspicuous consumption, or invidious distinctions are legion, greater than those who have actually read The Theory of the Leisure Class. John Dewey predicted that Veblen's terminology would outlive him, forever altering academic</page><page sequence="4">460 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 35/No. 3/1994 discourse (Dorfman 1934, pp. 196-197). His defenders are many and enthusiastic. Ber- nard Rosenberg (1963, p. 3), for instance, described Veblen as "the greatest social scien- tist America has produced." C. Wright Mills (1953, p. vi) calls Veblen "the best critic of America that America has produced." Yet, David Riesman (1953, p. xi) found him more "interesting than attractive, more pungent than wise." The dispute about Veblen's overall reputation was neatly summarized by John Maurice Clark (1929 in Dorfman 1934, p. 595) in his obituary in the American Economic Review: He is rated among the great economists of history, or as no economist at all; as a great original pioneer or as a critic and satirist without constructive talent or achievement. Veblen was born July 30, 1857 on a small Wisconsin farm, a child of the middle border. His parents were industrious, and eventually prosperous, Norwegian immigrants; Thor- stein was the sixth of twelve children.5 When eight his family moved to southern Minne- sota, and, in 1880 he graduated from Carleton College. After a term at Johns Hopkins, studying with Charles S. Peirce, Veblen settled at Yale, receiving a Ph.D. in philosophy for a dissertation on Kant's Critique of Judgement. After seven years at his family's homestead, he appeared at Cornell to study with the noted economist J. Laurence Laughlin. When Laughlin joined the newly opened, Rockefeller-financed, University of Chicago, he brought his protege. Veblen joined the faculty, and remained on staff until 1906, when, because of his extra-marital relations and indifferent teaching, he was asked to resign. Mills (1953, p. viii) suggests, admiringly, Veblen was never a "decent man."6 Moving to Stanford, Veblen was asked to resign three years later for similar reasons. Eventually he found a position at the University of Missouri, and later worked in the U.S. Food Administration, served for a year as an editor of the radical magazine, The Dial, and taught at the New School of Social Research from its establishment in 1919 until the mid 1920s. By that time Veblen had become a center of much left/liberal debate-the Na- tion/New Republic axis. Veblen died on August 3, 1929 at his rundown shack in the northern California woods. During his life Veblen published nine books-notably The Theory of Business Enterprise (1904), An Inquiry into the Nature of Peace and the Terms of its Perpetuation (1917), and The Higher Learning in America: A Memorandum on the Conduct of Universities by Business Men (1918), two collections of essays, and a transla- tion of the Icelandic Laxdaela Saga (1925). The social construction of Veblen's biography depicts him as a marginal man through his background, preferences, and his career (Rosenberg 1955; Kazin 1942). He combined shy diffidence with a bitter dyspepsia, a talent for alienating potential supporters with a coterie of devotees, and, according to some (e.g., Riesman 1953), contradictory desires to be accepted and rejected. Veblen was likened to a "Martian professor" (Mumford 1931; Johnson 1941), the outsider looking in. Disciplinary politics contributed to the creation of Veblen's reputation. Veblen taught economics, edited the Journal of Political Economy, is a founder of institutional econom- ics, and was proposed for the presidency of the American Economic Association. His ties to economics appear secure. Yet, some claim that his links to sociology, a discipline with which he had no formal affiliation, were equally real. Several critics, including liberal economist John Kenneth Galbraith, social critic Lewis Mumford (1931), and leftist British sociologist John Hobson (1929) felt that Veblen was a better sociologist than economist. TLC was based on a trio of articles published in the American Journal of Sociology in</page><page sequence="5">The Social Construction of Style 461 1898. One bitter contemporary critic of TLC (D. Wells 1899) felt that the work brought sociology into "disrepute," no easy task then as now. Tracing influences on Veblen's thought is complex; he is a synthetic thinker: the sources of Veblen's thought include German idealism (Kant), British empiricism (Hume), Ameri- can pragmatism (Peirce, Dewey), European socialism (Marx), evolution (Spencer, Sum- ner), American socialism (Bellamy), British socialism (Hobson), French utopian social- ism (Fourier, St. Simon), Scottish political economy (Rae), Norwegian Lutheranism, Psychology (Loeb, James), and Anthropology (Boas, Tylor) (Edgell and Tilman 1989). Some (Ryan 1982; Diggins 1978, p. vii) believe that Veblen was a proto-feminist; others (Fontana, Tilman, and Roe 1992; Lewis and Smith 1980; Rucker 1969) trace a connection to pragmatism and the Chicago school. This lengthy list suggests, first, many contrary readings of Veblen, and, second, that his thought is not narrowly derivative, but is fundamentally original. WRITING THE THEORY OF THE LEISURE CLASS The Theory of the Leisure Class is an autochthonous and subversive contribution: "a stick of dynamite wrapped up . . . to look like a stick of candy" (Mumford 1935). Today its originality may be partially overlooked because our post-Goffman age has taken many of Veblen's claims for granted.7 TLC is now vaguely enshrined as a classic, but contempor- aries considered it controversial. Now, as with many "canonized" texts, those who dispute the label keep their thoughts private. Yet, according to Veblen interpreter, Rick Tilman (personal communication 1993), Veblen is "one of America's most difficult-to-interpret writers," and the subject of hearty debate among his readers. My brief is not to present what Veblen "really" meant, perhaps both an impossible and inappropriate task, yet neither do I hew to relativistic interpretative anarchy. Not all cases are equally easy to make (Fine and Kleinman 1986), and there are themes in TLC on which fair consensus exists. Style is never wholly divorced from content. Although my focus is on Veblen's style, it is usful to remind readers of Veblen's main arguments. Veblen asserted that the mark of the elite was its choice to use resources without regard to productivity. He damned business leaders, while ennobling the productive worker, enshrining technology and workmanship as core virtues (Bell 1963; Schwartz 1990). Like so many culture critics, Veblen had high standards that society could never meet. In its exploration of status politics as the motivator of human development, TLC stands as the first important American sociological treatise: the only work of Nineteenth Century Amer- ican sociology still widely referenced.8 By emphasizing the role of "wasteful" public dress, leisure activities, religion, servants, and ornamental women, Veblen notes that status is linked to non-productive activity. By drawing on anthropological sources, he argues, in a mode now ignored or dismissed by most sociologists, that the development of conspicuous consumption is evolutionary. Veblen's complaint is, in some measure, with the nature of humankind, which often seems to strive not for creature comforts, but, more significantly for the symbolization of creature comforts, whether or not those artifacts and conveniences, actually bring ease. Veblen wishes us to elevate function over form, and it is the prominence of form in so many social arenas that provokes Veblen's ire. Aesthetic concern is for Veblen an prima facie indication of injustice. Consider, for instance, the cathedral, for some the zenith of the human aesthetic (Veblen 1934, p. 120:</page><page sequence="6">462 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 35/No. 3/1994 ... in all communities, especially in neighborhoods where the standard of pecuniary decency for dwellings is not high, the local sanctuary is more ornate, more conspicu- ously wasteful in its architecture and decoration, than the dwelling houses of the congregation. Parks are similarly seen as less worthy than the functional pasture (associated with thrift and usefulness) and female dress less worthy than male dress, for it is further removed from the demands of labor. Likewise, Veblen (1934, pp. 126-128) is expansive on the subject of spoons: A hand-wrought silver spoon, of a commercial value of some ten to twenty dollars, is not ordinarily more serviceable . . than a machine-made spoon of the same material. It may not even be more serviceable than a machine-made spoon of some "base" metal, such as aluminum, the value of which may be no more than ten to twenty cents. The former of the two utensils is, in fact, commonly a less effective contrivance for its ostensible purpose than the latter. . . . The superior gratification derived from the use and contemplation of the costly and supposedly beautiful products is, commonly, in great measure a gratification of our sense of costliness masquerading under the name of beauty. That cathedrals, parks, gowns, or spoons might have an aesthetic standing that does not deserve scorn is dismissed by Veblen as a function of status politics. Despite Veblen's scorn for "style," from its publication, style proved crucial to the volume's reception. When Veblen sent his completed manuscript to Macmillan, his even- tual publisher, they responded that the major problem was stylistic (Dorfman 1973, p. 9), and Veblen rewrote the manuscript several times, eventually agreeing to a guarantee because of the publisher's uncertainty over sales (Dorfman 1934, p. 174). After being sent a page proof, Veblen requested that Macmillan eliminate "the ornamental rule under the heading, and [I] suggest that everything of an ostensibly decorative character be omitted." (Dorfman 1973, p. 13). While this request was linked to Veblen's financial arrangements (he would have reimbursed Macmillan if sales did not reach a set level), this stylistic choice was congruent with the volume's themes. The reviews of TLC were decidedly mixed, with some such as William Dean Howells and Lester Frank Ward (the latter in the American Journal of Sociology) writing glowing notices, while other reviewers were bitter. Veblen wrote sarcastically to his brother: Reviews of the Leisure Class are coming in, for the most part quite severe. Opinion seems to be divided as to whether I am a knave or a fool, though there are some who make out that the book is a work of genius-I don't know just how. (Quoted in Dorfman 1973, p. 18) Whatever the evaluation, few avoided discussing Veblen's distinctive style, rare for a social scientific work. Selecting passages to exemplify the style is difficult, because, as so often the case, passages are written differently, and one might choose different examples, depending on one's emphasis. In that this essay is primarily about the interpretation of Veblen's style, rather than a description of it, I avoid extensive quotations, distracting from the argument of how the work is taken, rather than given. Still, it is desirable to expose the reader to Veblen's</page><page sequence="7">The Social Construction of Style 463 "style." But which passage? Each choice is a selection by an author with a argument. Each choice reflects some of Veblen's rhetorical techniques, eclipsing others. At various points in my essay I will present quotations to demonstrate either the wit or cumbrous qualities of the discourse. Here I provide a fairly lengthy selection, from Veblen's final chapter of TLC, which, to me, captures some of the literary, ironic, satiric, inarticulate, and archaic features of Veblen's prose. In this passage, Veblen (1934, pp. 398-400) writes about academic and professional discourse using archaic diction for purposes of displaying status: [T]he archaic idiom of the English language is spoken of as "classic" English. Its use is imperative in all speaking and writing upon serious topics, and a facile use of it lends dignity to even the most commonplace and trivial string of talk. . . . Elegant diction, whether in writing or speaking, is an effective means of reputability. It is of moment to know with some precision what is the degree of archaism conventionally required in speaking on any given topic. .... A discriminate avoidance of neologisms is honorific, not only because it argues that time has been wasted in acquiring the obsolescent habit of speech, but also as showing that the speaker has from infancy habitually associated with persons who have been familiar with the obsolescent idiom. It thereby goes to show his leisure class antecedents. . . . As felicitous an instance of futile classicism as can well be found, outside of the Far East, in the conventional spelling of the English language. A breach of the proprieties in spelling is extremely annoying and will discredit any writer in the eyes of all persons who are possessed of a developed sense of the true and beautiful. English orthography satisfies all the requirements of the canons of reputability under the law of conspicuous waste. It is archaic, cumbrous, and ineffective; its acquisition consumes much time and effort; failure to acquire it is easy of detection. Therefore it is the first and readiest test of reputability in learning, and conformity to its ritual is indispensable to a blameless scholastic life. . . . It is con- tended, in substance, that a punctilious use of ancient and accredited locutions will serve to convey thought more adequately and more precisely than would the straight- forward use of the latest form of spoken English; whereas it is notorious that the ideas of to-day are effectively expressed in the slang of to-day. . . . The advantage of the accredited locutions lies in their respectability; they are reputable because they are cumbrous and out of date, and therefore argue waste of time and exemption from the use and the need of direct and forcible speech. Reading this passage, and others similar, provokes one to wonder whether Veblen is serious? Is there an ironic stance for one who chooses to write as he condemns? This is Veblen's style, a style that is found, largely, in his other works, and is not a cloak that he dons only in a temporary masquerade. Is this great literature or a royal mess? Who is to know? PARSING THE THEORY OF THE LEISURE CLASS The Theory of The Leisure Class as Literature Throughout the past century, a stream of admirers contend that TLC is a major literary work. When Sinclair Lewis (1920) wishes to demonstrate the alienation of Carol Ken- nicott from the stolid Minnesotans of Gopher Prairie in Main Street he has her read Veblen; Veblen, for his part, refers to Lewis's stultifying Gopher Prairie. Lewis is "dra-</page><page sequence="8">464 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 35/No. 3/1994 matized Veblen" (Johnson 1941, p. 122). Some critics believe that "almost any passage of Veblen . . . is instantly recognizable" (Riesman 1953, p. 44) and that Veblen was a conscious stylist (Conroy 1968, p. 608). William Dean Howells (1899) discovered in Veblen the material for novels, and Veblen has been likened to both the "novelists of manners" (Diggins 1978, p. xi) and the fin de siecle naturalist writers, including Theodore Dreiser, Jack London, and Frank Norris (Richard Hofstadter, cited in Riesman 1953, p. 7). Veblen's ironical realism led Mills (1953, p. xiii) to contend that Veblen "has made Alices of us all, and dropped us through the looking glass into the fantastic world of social reality." This attitude is bolstered by the use of heroes (faculty members, workers, engineers) and villains (modem businessmen, captains of industry, university presidents and trustees), adding a moral overlay (Riesman 1953, p. 80). The impression that Veblen was more artist than scientist (Young 1925) is given heft by Veblen's playfulness (Wesley Mitchell, cited in Galbraith 1973, p. v), coupled with his refusal to cite sources or present systematic data. His statements rest on the authority of the man of genius, not the man of research. Veblen put his method thus: Partly for reasons of convenience, and partly because there is less chance of misap- prehending the sense of phenomena that are familiar to all men, the data employed to illustrate or enforce the argument have by preference been drawn from everyday life, by direct observation or through common notoriety, rather than from more recondite sources at a farther remove. It is hoped that no one will find his sense of literary or scientific fitness offended by this recourse to homely facts, or by what may at times appear to be a callous freedom in handling vulgar phenomena whose intimate place in men's life has sometimes shielded them from the impact of economic discussion (Veblen 1934, p. viii).9 It is not from the ordering of phrases alone, but from method-or its absence-that some allege TLC is literature. The Theory of the Leisure Class as Academic Treatise While some emphasize the literary qualities of Veblen's writing, others emphasize his dispassionate, academic tone. Whether or not one enjoys Veblen's writing, a word count demonstrates that Veblen wrote lengthy sentences: 39 words on average in TLC (Conroy 1968, p. 609). Several reviewers felt Veblen was clear, composing readable prose (Daniels 1905). Lester Frank Ward wrote of Veblen in the AJS: "The language is plain and unmistakable, as it should be, but the style is the farthest removed possible from either advocacy or vituperation, and the language, to use the author's own words, is 'morally colorless.'" (Ward 1900 in Dorfman 1973, p. 629). David Riesman (1953, p. xiii) also concluded that "there is not a line of Veblen which cannot be understood by a moderately well-read person." Not all agree. Underlying this academic style is the belief that Veblen was attempting to be dispas- sionate, uninvolved, detached, merely parsing the facts, leading William Dean Howells to speak of Veblen's "cold, scientific analysis" (Howells 1899 in Dorfman 1973, p. 630). John Kenneth Galbraith (1973, p. xvi, xviii) explains: "He concedes the rich and the well-</page><page sequence="9">The Social Construction of Style 465 to-do nothing; and he would not dream of suggesting that his personal attitudes or passion are in any way involved. The rich are merely anthropological specimens whose behavior the possession of money and property has made more interesting and more visibly ridicu- lous. . . . Since he does it in the name of science and with the weapons of science-and since no overt trace of animus or anger is allowed to appear-he does it with near perfect safety." Yet, recognizing that the book is overtly in the style of an academic treatise, doesn't mean that it will necessarily be read as such. For some Veblen's academic indifference (Hazlitt 1929, p. 9) or "deliberate stodginess" (Johnson 1941, p. 122) makes the humor and bite of the work so compelling, for others it is a mark of a turgid mind. The Theory of the Leisure Class as Comic Masterpiece Humor is a vast domain: puns, wit, mimicry, parody, irony, satire. Some categories are easier to distinguish than others. TLC carries the weight of irony and satire, leading Mills (1953, p. vi) to puff that Veblen is "the only comic writer among modem social scientists" and Conroy (1968, p. 607) to snort "only a person utterly lacking a sense of humor could possibly miss the ironical outlook which pervades every page." For some critics irony and satire seem undefined, overlapping, and ambiguous; others are more likely to distinguish them, claiming that Veblen was either a satirist or an ironist. In either event, humor refers to discursive practices that depend upon a fundamental incongruity between what is and what ought. By framing the unexpected in incongruous ways, with a moral implication (stronger in the satiric than in the ironic), one demands change to avoid hypocrisy. Satiric and ironic writings have power in changing behavior or definitions of behavior (Schneider 1975b; Machalek 1979). For many readers, particularly those of a liberal or radical slant, Veblen's account of the upper "leisure" class seems designed to ridicule these worthies, valuing a counter- example, ennobling workers. They believed Veblen should be read on two levels- denotative and connotative. His presumed bitter intent was reminiscent of Shaw (Anony- mous 1929), Twain (Riesman 1953), or Swift (North American Review 1919 in Dorfman 1973, p. 661). For these readers TLC was brilliant satire (Dorfman 1934, p. 196; Johnson 1941), leading some to describe Veblen as the "Bard of Savagery" (Miller 1954, p. xlix): In part [Veblen] is the remote scholar, the skeptical scientist subjecting everything to the test of his laboratory apparatus and the tribunal of reason. In part he is a growling and surly old Norwegian uncle whose smelly pipe and acid home-truths we wonder at ourselves for putting up with (Johnson 1941, p. 121). Some critics, recognizing the satire, felt Veblen went to excess (Hazlitt 1929, p. 9); Galbraith (1973, p. vi), a sympathetic commentator, suggested that when "faced with a choice between accuracy and a formulation that he felt would fill his audience with outrage, [Veblen] rarely hesitated. He opted for the outrage." Kenneth Burke (1950, p. 129), capturing the marriage of the academic and satiric, described Veblen's style as "deadpan satire." Where some speak of satire, others, emphasizing the incongruous, call Veblen's style ironic (Broyard 1973), leading to continued relevance. Riesman (1953, p. 78) writes: "His cavalier quality, the irony which permits him at once to embrace and to fend off life, these</page><page sequence="10">466 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 35/No. 3/1994 make him 'modemrn:"' His irony cloaks him in a "sociological imagination" (Walton 1979). These critics point to techniques that depict society in a fractured manner. Veblen combined items in odd, incongruous, and revealing lists, a technique that is known as "the Swiftian miscellaneous catalogue" (Conroy 1968, pp. 612-613; Toulouse 1985, pp. 263- 264). For instance, Veblen (1934, p. 73) writes of conspicuous consumption: The quasi-peaceable gentleman of leisure, then, not only consumes of the staff of life beyond the minimum required for subsistence and physical efficiency, but his con- sumption also undergoes a specialisation as regards the quality of the goods consumed. He consumes freely and of the best, in food, drink, narcotics, shelter, services, ornaments, apparel, weapons and accoutrements, amusements, amulets, and idols or divinities. Linking narcotics, weapons, and divinities among the "quasi-peaceable" is the technique of the satirist. In addition, Veblen deliberately uses words in perverse ways (as Goffman attempted). He relies on highly pejorative and loaded words, but claims that he disregards their moral moorings. Veblen (p. 26) speaks of the accumulation of wealth as an "in- vidious distinction," then notes innocently: In making use of the term "invidious," it may perhaps be unnecessary to remark, there is no intention to extol or depreciate, or to commend or deplore any of the phenomena which the word is used to characterize. (p. 34) The reader cannot be moved quite so easily. Further, Veblen suggests the similarity of delinquents and elites (p. 238) and refers to "inmates" of colleges (cited in Conroy 1968, p. 611), much as Goffman for his part refers to the "campus" of a mental hospital (Goffman 1961; see Fine and Martin 1990). Or Veblen writes gently that "gentle blood is blood which has been ennobled by protracted contact with accumulated wealth or unbroken prerogative" (Johnson 1941, p. 123). While a consensus exists that TLC is a humorous text, agreement is not complete (Conroy 1968, p. 606): even the presence of wit is a social construction. Russell, for example, could not see the irony (Dorfman 1934, p. 134), and Dorfman, noting the similar goals of Veblen and Herbert Spencer, of whom no one would claim is a satirist, is uncertain of Veblen's intent. Riesman (1953, p. 46), impressed by the irony, the drama, and the dash, adds "we don't know where he stands and hence how literally to take him." The author has become shrouded in mystery-until we put him in his place (White 1987). Veblen himself seemed to wish to deflect claims of his satire: "He was disappointed at the popular view of it as a satire upon the aristocratic classes, although he admitted . .. that the book was not altogether free from satire" (Dorfman 1934, p. 197). The Theory of the Leisure Class as Meretricious Rot In an increasing proportion as time goes on, the anthropomorphic cult, with its code of devout observances, suffers a progressive disintegration through the stress of economic exigencies and the decay of the system of status. As this disintegration proceeds, there come to be associated and blended with the devout attitude certain other motives and impulses that are not always of an anthropomorphic origin, nor traceable to the habit of</page><page sequence="11">The Social Construction of Style 467 personal subservience. Not all of these subsidiary impulses that blend with the habit of devoutness in the later devotional life are altogether congruous with the devout attitude or with the anthropomorphic apprehension of the sequence of phenomena. Their origin being not the same, their action upon the scheme of devout life is also not in the same direction. In many ways they traverse the underlying norm of subservience or vicarious life to which the code of devout observances and the ecclesiastical and sacerdotal institutions are to be traced as their substantial basis. Through the presence of these alien motives the social and industrial regime of status gradually disintegrates and the canon of personal subservience loses the support derived from an unbroken tradition. Extraneous habits and proclivities encroach upon the field of action occupied by this canon, and it presently comes about that the ecclesiastical and sacerdotal structures are partially converted to other uses, in some measure alien to the purposes of the scheme of devout life as it stood in the days of the most vigorous and characteristic develop- ment of the priesthood. (TLC, pp. 332-33) After the paeans, it is startling to realize that many not only felt Veblen was wrong, but was an egregiously poor writer (Matthews 1919). One biographer speaks of Veblen's "opaque, convoluted style, marked by polysyllabic neologisms and esoteric terminology" (Diggins 1978, p. 37). Another wonders: "Is it too much to hope that some of his followers will translate this book [The Place of Science in Modern Civilization] into English readable to economic laymen?" (Anon. 1920, cited in Simich and Tilman 1985, p. 15). Contrary to claims that any literate person could understand Veblen, others claim that few could understand him. The best-known criticism of Veblen was penned by that poisoned master, H. L. Mencken (1919, pp. 59, 64, 69, 70): The more I read [Veblen's] columns, in fact, the less I could make of them, and so in the end, growing impatient and impolite, I denounced this Prof. Veblen as a geyser of pishposh. ... the whole canon of the singularly laborious and muggy, the incompara- bly tangled and unintelligible works of Prof. Dr. Thorstein Veblen. . . . a cent's worth of information wrapped in a bale of polysyllables. It is as if the practice of that incredibly obscure and malodorous style were a relentless disease, a sort of progressive intellectual diabetes, a leprosy of the horse sense. Words are flung upon words until all recollection that there must be a meaning in them, a ground and excuse for them, is lost. One wanders in a labyrinth of nouns, adjectives, verbs, pronouns, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions and participles, most of them swollen and nearly all of them unable to work. It is difficult to imagine worse English, within the limits of intelligible grammar. It is clumsy, affected, opaque, bombastic, windy, empty.... Worse, there is nothing at the bottom of all this strident wind-music-the ideas it is designed to set forth are, in the overwhelming main, poor ideas, and often they are ideas that are almost idiotic. Mencken is enjoying himself at Veblen's expense,'0 but, as noted above, Veblen does write long and complex sentences-"forbidding writing" (Chase 1934, p. xii) that some deride as "futile, archaic, and cumbrous" (D. Wells 1899, p. 218). Alfred Kazin (1942, p. 180-81), praising Veblen's wit and facility as a phrase maker, doubts his ability as a writer and his interest in diction and rhythm: he was . .. not a good sentence maker. The peculiar quality of his prose lies . .. in the use he made of a naturally cumbersome and (despite its polysyllabic sophistication)</page><page sequence="12">468 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 35/No. 3/1994 primitive medium. . . . Veblen who mumbled in the classroom those "long spiral sentences, reiterative like the eddas," as John Dos Passos called them, also mumbled in his books. The criticism of Veblen's style is not limited to his early writing; in a review of his harsh attack on university administrators, The Higher Learning in America, regarded by some as superb satire, Professor Brander Matthews (cited in Galbraith 1973, p. xxiv; Dorfman 1934, p. 409) of the English Department at Columbia University assayed in the New York Times: His vocabulary is limited and he indulges in a fatiguing repetition of a dozen or a score of adjectives. His grammar is woefully defective. . . . So frequent and so flagrant are Mr. Veblen's violations of accepted usage that I was moved to look him up in Who's Who, and I was astonished to learn . .. that he is not only a college graduate but that he is even a doctor of philosophy. Finally, some, recognizing the satire and irony, suggest that Veblen went to excess. One critic suggests that "the average reader needs a walk in the sun to clear his head of sulphuric acid fumes between every two volumes" (Reynaud 1925 in Simich and Tilman 1985, p. 21). John Cummings (1899, p. 455) in a critical review of TLC in Veblen's own journal, Journal of Political Economy, noted: If there were less consummate cleverness displayed, one would feel less disposed to criticise. It is the cleverness itself, the sophistry consistently maintained that bears witness to a more or less conscious intent on the part of the author, and itself elicits criticism. The author of the Theory of the Leisure Class is clearly a master of sophisti- cal dialectic. When one reads the critics of Veblen's style one is reminded of the "brilliant" works-Let Us Now Praise Famous Men and Finnegan's Wake come to mind-that many find unap- pealing and unreadable. SITUATED STYLE Symbolic interactionist theory (Fine and Kleinman 1986) and post-modern literary analy- sis both assume that a text receives meaning from the audience. This meaning involves all facets of the text-"substance" and "style." The whole of interpretation is situated. In analyzing Veblen's The Theory of the Leisure Class I argue that the divergent interpreta- tions of the text's style cannot be explained by the text itself, but are social constructions by the readers. In cases-such as Veblen-in which the text may not be translucent, issues of stylistic evaluation are particularly central. Irony and satire depend on a funda- mental gap between what is written and what is meant, and is found in certain topical areas more often than others. Veblen's text, dealing as it does with the conflict between class positions and the values associated with them, provides a easy base from which an ironic analysis is possible. In such cases, the objective, denotative reading of a text is not sufficient. The reader must contribute to the meaning of the text-to recontextualize it. As suggested above, some social scientific topics plead for an ironic stance. We have had little in the way of irony aimed at those at the bottom of the social structure. Perhaps</page><page sequence="13">The Social Construction of Style 469 their position is so severe that humor at their expense is unworthy, perhaps they are not the audience of the text, and, so, could not be changed, perhaps our political stance places us in sympathy with them and so any attack is "politically incorrect." The upper classes, and bourgeois lifestyles in general, present an inviting target. Thus, Goffman's Asylums which deals with the unfortunate mental ill, aims its irony at their keepers (Fine and Martin 1990). Goffman's other work-such as "Symbols of Class Status" (1951) and The Presen- tation of Self in Everyday Life (1959)-targets middle-class life styles (Ditton 1980; Gouldner 1970)." Mills is at his most ironic in White Collar and The Power Elite.'2 Even E. Digby Baltzell, surely more sympathetic to those wealthy WASPs he portrays and less a marginal man, cannot resist a few ironic jabs.'3 Those targets with status surpluses are easily hit by indirect attack. The stylistic analysis of social science texts has only begun, but before it extends too far, we should be wary of perspectives that focus on the text as an discrete object, rather than an interactive nexus. The examination of responses to Veblen reveals the diversity of reactions to a literary text. One cannot say-objectively-that Theory of the Leisure Class is well or poorly written, that it is satire or serious; rather, audiences make these decisions from external forces, as well as from the text itself. Even the most scrupulous social scientist is ultimately at the mercy of those who choose to digest the text. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I thank Lori Ducharme and Lori Holyfield for their help in the preparation of this article. I appreciate the literate and thoughtful responses of Charles Lemert, Patricia Clough, Andrea Fontana, Rick Tilman and the anonymous reviewers. NOTES I. As with many classics, out of copyright, numerous editions compete. I cite the Random House Modem Library edition (1934). 2. The phrase "marginal woman" rings wrong. Gender rules prevented women from strad- dling society, as marginal. Women represented values, while always being outside power. The marginal woman is a harlot. 3. Stephen Tyler suggests that ironic writing is characteristic of modernism, whereas parody is the pomo preference. I have never been comfortable with such sharp decisions, but feel that ironic detachment is characteristic of many who we label post-modern. 4. For a discussion of the links and differences between irony and satire, see Fine and Martin (1990). 5. The most complete biography of Thorstein Veblen is Joseph Dorfman's (1934) encyclope- dic Thorstein Veblen and His America (also Dorfman 1973). Some critics, including members of the Veblen family, dispute Dorfman's contention that Veblen could not speak English fluently until matriculating at Carleton, and deny the claim that the Veblens were culturally isolated (Tilman 1992, p. 4). Dorfman's argument underlines Thorstein Veblen's marginality. David Riesman's (1953) Thorstein Veblen: A Critical Interpretation assays Veblen's life in a quasi-psychoanalytic mode, emphasizing Veblen's passive aggressiveness, record of failure, and deficiencies in "manly virtues." 6. The sympathy Mills felt for Veblen is unsurprising, as cultural outsiders, academic "fail- ures," and home-grown radicals. When Mills speaks of Veblen by saying "there is no failure in American academic history quite so great as Veblen's," the statement has an autobiographical ring. 7. Goffman, himself, surprisingly does not refer to Veblen either in his Veblenian "Symbols of Class Status," or in Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, although he uses the phrase "conspicu-</page><page sequence="14">470 THE SOCIOLOGICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 35/No. 3/1994 ous consumption." This is curious since Goffman was a student at Chicago at the time that David Riesman, then Assistant Professor, published his book on Veblen. 8. TLC is cited forty-four times in the 1990 issue of the Social Sciences Citation Index. Not all American sociologists give TLC so much weight, Parsons (Simich and Tilman 1983), for instance, felt that there was little of value in Veblen's theories. 9. Pace Goffman (1974, pp. 14-16). 10. Mencken later, in a 1934 letter, admitted that his conscience bothered him about the article, "it was planned as buffoonery, but it turned out to be rather serious" (Dorfman 1973, p. 21). Mencken should have been sympathetic to Veblen's castigation of the idle rich. 11. Goffman (1951, p. 299) writes: "children may share, in part, the status of their parents not only because the connection is demonstrable but also because the number of children a woman can bear is strictly limited. The family name may then be used as a symbol of status on the assumption that it can be acquired legally only by birth or by the marriage of a woman to a son of the house." 12. Mills (1956, p. 93) writes, for instance, after describing various extravagances of the wealthy: "Here are all the expensive commodities, to which the rich seem appendages. Here is the money talking in its husky, silk voice of cash, power, celebrity." 13. Baltzell (1958, p. 396) concludes his Philadelphia Gentlemen by noting: "In this young nation, an ancient mansion of democracy, the stairway of social prestige has been 'forever echoing with the wooden shoe going up, and the polished boot descending.' When the echoes die, however, the ancient mansion will have been deserted." REFERENCES Anon. 1919. Review of The Higher Learning in America. North American Review 209(March 19): 417-420. Anon. 1920.
