Mertz Biomedical Science Department General Motors Research Laboratories CURRENT STANDARDS - Chest and thoracic organ injury are observed in automobile accidents. Ap- propriately, the National Highway Traffic Safety Ad- ministration (NHTSA) specifies the chest as one of the three body areas where injury-inferring transducers are located in the vehicle crashworthiness tests re- quired by MVSS 208 (1)*. This standard specifies that some function of the acceleration as measured in the rigid spine box, supposedly "the center of gravity of the upper thorax" (1), of a dummy - Part 572 (2) - meet some criterion. The eventual criterion has been expressed by NHTSA as "the resultant acceler- ation. . . shall not exceed 60 g, except for intervals whose cumulative duration is not more than 3 ms. " However, a Gadd Severity Index (GSI) not exceeding 1000 was required for vehicles manufactured prior to August 15, 1975. At this writing there is a NHTSA proposal to extend the 1000 GSI for at least one more year. Currently, both criteria are commonly used in automotive testing, and one or both are likely to be included in a final version of MVSS 208. The Part 572 dummy required for crashworthiness tests was not designed to have biomechanical fidelity and has been shown to not possess biomechanical fidelity under blunt thoracic impact (3). Dummy chest bio- mechanical fidelity has been defined as having pre- scribed force- deflection responses from two different blunt frontal impact conditions (3) . Additional efforts to protect the thoracic region from injury are mandated in MVSS 203 (4), which limits the chest load as measured from the impact of * Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. a body block against a steering assembly to 11. 1 kN (2500 1b). Accident investigations, for example Gloyns and Mackay (5), have brought this procedure into question. They found that tests according to this standard failed to differentiate between steering sys- tems which were found in accident studies to be highly different in effectiveness in preventing chest injuries. The so-called "Blak Tuffy" body block used in this test has a specification on its static spring rate at a given deflection, but no dynamic requirements. Various body blocks may, in fact, have different dynamic characteristics and yet qualify under this standard. Dynamic biofidelity was obviously not a factor in establishing this specification. CHEST IMPACT STUDIES - Two early papers by Patrick, Kroell, and Mertz (6,7) form a genesis for analysis of human response and tolerance to blunt thoracic impact. In these studies using a crash simu- lator, unrestrained embalmed cadavers impacted in- strumented chest loading surfaces simulating car crash conditions. In these two papers, responses were reported in a force versus deflection format, and rib fracture was reported at 5. 96 kN (1340 lb) load and 43. 4 mm (1. 71 in) deflection. Nahum et al. (8) brought more control into this type of experiment by impacting a prepositioned em- balmed or fresh cadaver with an instrumented 152 mm (6. 0 in) diameter 19. 3 kg (42. 5 lb) mass. Impacting velocities varied from 4. 0 m/s (9. 0 mph) to 6. 48 m/s (14. 5 mph), producing sternal deflection of as much as 82.3 mm (3. 24 in). This study included multiple impacts of some cadavers and radiological assess- ment of rib fracture after each impact. Post-impact thoracic dissection indicated that X-ray assessment ABSTRACT Currently used criteria based on functions of spinal acceleration obtained from crash test dummies are shown to be invalid indicators of chest injuries in blunt frontal impacts. Cadaver impact data are ana- lyzed; and injury is found to be a statistically signifi- cant function of chest deflection, chest depth, and cadaver age at death. Based on the resulting re- gression equations, injury-limiting chest deflections are recommended for various size test dummies. The recommendations apply only to test dummies that have significant thoracic biofidelity for blunt frontal impact. They are valid for environments which in- clude signigicant blunt frontal impact. Their ex- tension to other environments has not been validated. 3178</page><page sequence="2">revealed less than half of the fractures and was there- fore inadequate. The authors noted that injury was produced at lower loads than previously seen. They cautiously suggested "deflections (sternal of the order of 1. 5 in (38 mm) represent a level at which some damage may be expected in the elderly subjects used," and noted "Deflection exceeding 2 in (50. 8 mm) is quite frequently associated with severe skeletal damage. " The average age of these "elderly sub- jects" was 72, and the multiple impacts may have been a confounding factor. Kroell, Schneider, and Nahum (9) further re- ported on 14 additional cadavers in the same research program. In this series the impactor mass varied from 1. 63 to 23. 6 kg (3. 6 to 52. 0 lb) while the 152 mm (6. 0 in) diameter was maintained. Impact velocity ranged from 6. 26 m/s (14 mph) to 14. 3 m/s (32 mph). This series of tests introduced the pressurization of the thoracic aorta. Penetrations of greater than 102 mm (4. 0 in) were produced. A strong age dependency was indicated when two specimens which were under 30 years of age had penetrations (total chest de- flections) of about 76. 2 mm (3. 0 in) without signifi- cant injurt. The association between peak force and injury came into question based on results from two low mass-high velocity tests. These two tests pro- duced high loads - 5. 24 to 8. 90 kN (1200 to 2000 lb) - low deflections - 45. 7 to 55. 9 mm (1. 8 to 2. 2 in) - and no injuries. Kroell developed the GM recommendations for biomechanical fidelity from the above data. These recommendations consist of force-deflection response corridors which define the response that should be produced in dummies when they are impacted under codified conditions" similar to those used in the ca- daver tests. Force levels were increased to account for probable muscle tensing based upon the results of human volunteer tests. The recommendations were reported in Lobdell et al. (3). The data base for these corridors was broadened by the next Kroell, Schneider, and Nahum (10) paper. Neathery (11) used this enlarged data base to develop corridors scaled to account for test subject size. These corridors constitute the current GM recommendation for thoracic biofidelity under blunt frontal impact con- ditions. The latest paper in this series by Kroell, Schnei- der, and Nahum (10) reports on 23 more tests using unembalmed cadavers in which additional variations of impactor mass and velocity were included. In this paper the AIS rating was correlated with the maxi- mum plateau force and the "normalized chest de- flection" (penetration/chest depth). They found that the force level did not correlate well with AIS rating, while normalized deflection did. While not enunciated in the paper, but obtainable directly from the data (Fig. 17, p. 406, Ref. 10), an AIS rating of 3 corre- sponds to a normalized deflection of approximately 0.34 or a penetration of about 78. 7 mm (3. 1 in) for a 50th percentile male. Stalnaker et al. (12) conducted similar tests with unembalmed cadavers, using a 152 mm (6.0 in) dia- meter impactor of 10. 0 kg (22. 0 lb) mass at impact velocities of 5. 50 to 6. 75 m/s (12.3 to 15. 1 mph). A major difference between this study and the Kroell data is that the impactor was stopped after it traversed versed a predetermined displacement. Consequently, penetration varied only from 45. 7 to 53.3 mm (1. 8 to 2. 1 in). Autopsies revealed that no rib fractures and two sternal fractures resulted from these impacts. In a later paper Stalnaker and Mohan (13) , in interpreting the above and other results, impugn the use of acceleration or force for evaluating chest in- juries. For what they term "conservative tolerance limits, " they allow a chest penetration of 44. 4 mm (1. 75 in). Since they found no rib fractures and only two sternal fractures, this would correspond at the absolute highest to an AIS rating of 2, but more probably a 1 and possibly a 0. BRIDGING PRACTICE AND RESEARCH - It is clear that the practice of evaluating chest injury from forces or functions of acceleration produced by human simulators totally lacking in known dynamic biofi- delity is not congruent with the available data from human impact research. Further, biofidelity in me- chanical response, as currently defined, is in terms of force-deflection parameters. Even if this biofi- delity were incorporated into dummy devices, there would be no assurance that the accelerations produced would be humanlike. The purpose of this paper is to bridge between practice and available research data. To do this, the inadequacy of current practice under certain impact conditions will be demonstrated with data from cadavers, a mathematical model, and me- chanical models. A further analysis of the Kroell data will be made to indicate what appropriate injury indicators should be used and their critical values for various segments of the population. The criteria established will be valid for blunt frontal impact. They may also be a good estimate, perhaps even the best available in the laboratory, for the evaluation of other forms of restraints; but that remains to be demonstrated. Accordingly, great care should be exercised in extrapolating these re- sults to other impact conditions. The usual pre- cautionary statements regarding cadaveric material apply. It is not the purpose of this paper to discuss whole body response data. However, it should be pointed out that a number of papers deal with whole body exposure to acceleration under various con- straints; see, for example, Stapp (14). Some of these data may tend to support parts of the present practice in evaluating chest injury. It is emphasized that the present paper is concerned with blunt frontal thoracic impact and not whole body exposures. 3179</page><page sequence="3">3180 R. F. NE ATHERY, ET AL.

An analysis of both spinal and sternal accelerations from those tests is presented more fully by Nahum, Schneider, and Kroell (15) in another paper at this conference. Table 1 gives a summary of the spinal acceleration data from that paper. It appears that there may be a relation between AIS rating and the functions of acceleration. This is explored in the cited paper (15). The point to be made here is that neither the currently used GSI of 1000 nor the 3 ms cumulative duration acceleration level of 60 gTs were approached in these tests, where AIS ratings as high as 6 - fatal - were obtained. A mean AIS rating of 3.4 was produced with a mean GSI of only 48 and a 3 ms acceleration of only 27 g. Both are low compared to the standard; the GSI value of 48 is trivial com- pared with 1000. MECHANICAL SIMULATIONS - There are two aspects to the problem of using functions of spinal chest acceleration from dummies to indicate injury. The first of these is somewhat philosophical. Bio- mechanical fidelity has been defined as having an ap- propriate force-deflection relationship when the dummy chest is impacted under certain conditions. If such chests are used for injury assessment, for realistic results the parameters which have been accurately modeled - namely, force and/or deflection - must be used as injury indicators. If it were es- tablished that some function of chest acceleration was a better indicator of injury that either force or de- flection, then biofidelity response for dummies should be established in terms of acceleration; or the re- lationship between the acceleration and the specified Table 2 - Spinal Chest Accelerations and Severity Indices Produced by Biofidelity Tests of Various Dummies 3 m&lt;; Peak Chest Test Number Load Displacement Acceleration Chest Dummy Condition of Tests kN (lb) mm (in) g gsi GM ATD 502 43 lb 3 2.97 52.2 (2.06) 9 3 with GMR 11 mph (668) Chest 51 lb 3 5.31 68.8 (2.71) 17 12 16 mph (1194) GM ATD 502 43 lb 2 4.00 56.8 (2.24) 8 4 11 mph (898) 51 lb 2 11.44 - 29 38 16 mph (2571) Hybrid II 51 lb 3 6.18 21.6 (0.85) 28 30 (Part 572) 9.5 mph (1390) 51 lb 3 - 36.8 (1.45) 43 103 15 mph force-deflection response should be clearly demon- strated. The second aspect of this problem is that when current industry dummies, or experimental dummies with biomechanically correct chests, are impacted under conditions known to be injurious to cadavers, the spinal accelerations produced are extremely low. Table 2 shows the results from the two prescribed tests for biomechanical fidelity using the GM ATD 502 dummy (16) with its own chest and with the GMR chest. The GMR chest satisfies the requirements for biomechanical fidelity (those requirements include adjustments for probable muscle tensing) . The re- sulting severity indices are extremely low, ranging from 3 to 12 in the case of the biomechanically cor- rect chest and from 4 to 38 in the other. If one were to believe that a severity index as high as 1000 was required to produce signigicant injury, then compared with 3 and 12, one might be pursuaded to volunteer for these impacts! The high-speed impact, which produces an average severity index of 12 in the dummy, 1.2% of the critical value, has produced in- jury in cadavers judged to be AIS-6: fatal. (These results do not necessarily imply that a living person would receive the same level of injury. ) The stan- dard GM ATD 502 chest, which does not have bio- mechanical fidelity, produced higher numbers but was still trivially low compared to 1000. While the 3 ms chest accelerations from both chests represent a larger percentage of allowed value that the GSI' s did, they also are very low when com- pared with the standards. Table 2 also shows results from the two Part 572 (2) chest compliance tests for a Hybrid H dummy. These test conditions approximate the two biome- chanical test conditions. While the resulting acceler- ation parameters were still higher due to the in- creased stiffness of this chest system, they again indicated no danger of injury. It is further noted that lateral ringing of the accelerometer contributes sig- nificantly to the severity index in the Hybrid n dummy under these conditions.

This model was used as a basis for the design of the GMR chest which has biomechanical fi- delity (17) as specified by Kroell for blunt frontal im- pact. The higher-speed test for biofidelity was simu- lated with this model. The acceleration of the spinal mass was determined and the resulting severity index was calculated. A severity index of 28 was indicated which compared reasonably well with the value of 12 obtained in the dummy tests and was also trivial com- pared with the critical value of 1000. The 3 ms ac- celeration level was 18 g. SUMMATION - It has thus been demonstrated from cadaver data, from dummies with thoracic bio- fidelity as specified by Kroell, from dummies with- out this biofidelity, and from a mathematical simu- lation which satisfies these biofidelity requirements for blunt frontal impact that both a 3 ms acceleration of 60 g and a severity index of 1000 based on spinal acceleration are grossly in error and completely misleading in predicting injury binder these blunt frontal impact conditions. ANALYSIS OF KROELL DATA Kroell et al. (10) correlated AIS rating with maximum force and normalized chest deflection. They concluded that the AIS rating did not correlate well with maximum force but did correlate well with normalized deflection. Neathery (11) has indicated the deviation of Kroell1 s cadaver subjects from 50th percentile male dummy characteristics and the need to adjust me- chanical responses prescribed for test dummies to account for this deviation. Using dimensional analy- sis and multiple linear regression analysis, he was able to correct for this deviation and, in turn, pre- scribe scaled response characteristics for blunt frontal impact for 5th and 95th percentile dummies as well. These requirements included a correction for muscle tensing. In the present paper the same analytical techniques are used to scale the AIS rating as a function of cadaver characteristics and respones. DATA BASE - There have been 48 test subjects reported by Kroell et al. (9, 10). No necropsy was performed on the first 10 subjects, 1IM through 10FF. No chest dimensions were recorded for 11FM. Six of the subjects - 48FM, 50FM, 51FM, 52FM, 56FM, and 58FM - were tested with the spine rigidly supported. The pattern of injury obtained in these six tests was erratic and did not fit the re- maining data. In three tests, 32FM, 54FF, and 55 FF, the impacting mass engaged the invertube safety stop before maximum penetration was reached. One fe- male subject, 21FF, had a very large bust; one sub- ject, 63 FM, was intentionally in rigor mortis; and in one test, 43 FM, an instrument failure prevented the force from being recorded. In addition to these, the response and injury rating of subject 3 7 FM indicated it was clearly an outlier. None of the above cited subjects were included in the analysis which follows. This left the data for 20 male and 4 female cadavers for the analysis. Listed in Table 3 are the pertinent data for these subjects. Also listed are the di- mensionless terms used by Neathery (11).</page><page sequence="5">3182 R. F. NEATHERY, ET AL.

An AIS rating of 1 was basically unavailable since, for the chest, it requires subjectively self-determined "aches" or "stiffness" (18). However, three of these five (20FM, 42FM, and 46FM) were impacted under severe conditions which produced injury ratings up to 6 (fatal) in other subjects. The other two cadavers (26FM and 28FM) were tested under low mass-high velocity impact conditions which resulted in an AIS rating of 2 to the only other subject (30FF) tested under these conditions. Each cadaver in the first group (of three) received approximately seven times the momentum and four times the energy from the impact as each cadaver in the second group (of two) . Because of these difficulties and differences, the first three were changed to a rating of 1; while the remaining two were kept at 0. As indicated by Kroell et al. (10), such changes produce only slight differences in correlation between the AIS rating and response parameters. RESULTS - The data were analyzed with each variable considered separately and with the variables grouped together in the dimensionless terms. The multiple linear regression analysis utilized the Honeywell Series 400 time -sharing library program "SMLRP***" (19). Table 4 is the correlation coefficient matrix for the separate variables. Table 5 is the same for the dimensionless terms. Of note from Table 4 is the very high correlation between penetration and AIS (0. 772) and the very low, practically zero (0. 003) correlation between force and AIS. Age and height also indicate an appreciable correlation with AIS. 2 Table 6 - Multiple Correlation Coefficients and Determinants (R ) All Penetration Variables Depth, and Age Separate Terms 0.880 0.875 (0.775) (0.766) Dimensionless Terms 0.873 0.872 (0.762) (0.761) Logarithm of 0.904 0.892 Separate Terms (0.818) (0.796) Logarithm of 0.901 0.892 Dimensionless Terms (0.812) (0.796) In the dimensionless terms, Table 5, corre- lation between penetration divided by depth (P/D) is very high, 0. 825. The correlation between age and AIS is, of course, the same as in Table 4. None of the other terms show an appreciable correlation with AIS. A parallel study by Nahum et al. (15) has demon- strated good correlation between both spinal GSI (for levels much less than 1000) and induced spinal ve- locity versus AIS rating for blunt frontal thoracic im- pact in the absence of back restraint. The data used was smaller than that available for this study (10 versus 24) and contained certain adverse cross- correlations of parameters. A good correlation be- tween P/D and AIS was also found, however, which is consistent with that of both this study and that of Kroell et al. (10). Moreover, the authors (15) recommend the use of P/D - as opposed to functions of spinal acceleration - as a more fundamental mea- sure of AIS rating. Equation Form - The possible arrangements of the data are virtuaHy endless. The following con- siderations led to the form of equation used in this paper. Table 6 shows the multiple correlation co- efficients and determinants (R2) for various arrange- ments of the variables and their logarithms. The logarithmic terms (rows 3 and 4) give higher corre- lations. However, since it is the deviation of the logarithms of the variables that are being minimized - in a least squares sense - this will not generally minimize the linear error. The result is that, in spite of the higher correlation coefficients, equations from the logarithmic relations produce more error when attempting to predict observed AIS ratings than the linear equations do. A second difficulty with the logarithmic relations is that the data base includes AIS ratings of zero. Since the logarithm of zero is negative infinity, it can only be approximated in any actual regression analy- sis. The resulting regression equation will depend on the extent of the approximation. This difficulty can be avoided by adding a constant to the variable to move it away from zero. (A constant of one was used in this study.) The results will then depend upon the</page><page sequence="6">PREDICTION OF THORACIC INJURY 3 1 83 Table 7 - Development of Empirical Equations Cumulative Coefficient Cumulative of Multiple Multiple f f Initial Determination Correlation v F Variable (R2) Coefficient Coefficient Ratio Penetration Depth 0.6798 0.8245 0.1463 46.71 Age 0.7613 0.8725 0.3742 7.16 Depth Height 0.7616 0.8727 5.9179 0.03 Force Mass X Gravity 0.7617 0.8728 10.0277 0.01 value of the constant selected. These problems gave preference to a linear relation. Comparing row 1 with row 2, or 3 with 4 (Table 6), indicates very slight differences in correlation coefficient between the separate variables and the dimensionless terms. The little variation that is seen is due primarily to the additional terms, 6 terms versus 4 terms and 3 versus 2, in the equations for the separate variables. Because the dimension- less forms of the equations involve fewer terms, are independent of dimensions (except for age), are more likely to have broad application, and have been used to define response, they were preferred in this study. Thus, a linear relation involving the dimensionless terms was the selected form of the empirical equa- tion. Development of Equation - Table 7 shows the development of the empirical equation from the multiple linear regression analysis. The first and most significant variable selected was penetration divided by depth (P/D). The cumulative coefficient of multiple determination (R2) was 0. 6798. This indicates that approximately 68% of the squared deviation from the mean AIS rating is accounted for by the regression equation. The third column is the square root of the second and is known as the mulitple correlation coefficient. In this case, involving only two variables, it is the same as the simple corre- lation coefficient between AIS and P/D shown in Table 5. The fourth column gives the coefficient of vari- ation (C, standard deviation of the regression equation coefficient divided by the coefficient). If the statisti- cal data strongly support the determined coefficient, Cv will be small; which is the case for P/D having a Cv of 0. 1463. The last column gives the F- ratio from a statistical test of the significance of the co- efficient of the particular variable; that is it indicates the statistical evidence that the particular independent variable should be included in the expression. For this size data sample, representative critical F- ratios and their corresponding confidence levels are: 0. 5 for 50% confidence level 3.2 for 90% confidence level 9. 0 for 99% confidence level.

The F- ratio for P/D is ex- termely high - 46. 71. The addition of the second variable, Age, sub- stantially increases the R^ value from 0. 6798 to 0. 7613. The Cv is a reasonable 0. 3742 and the F- ratio, 7. 16. The addition of the remaining variables, Depth/Height (D/H) and Force/Mass x Gravity (F/M* G), produce very slight changes in the R2 value - about 0. 05%. The respective Cv of 5. 9179 and 10. 0277 indicate the linear coefficients are very poorly determined, and the very low F- ratios indicate that the dependency of AIS rating on these terms can be statistically inferred only at very low confidence levels. Because of the very low confidence levels, these two variables were not included in the final equation. The final equation was: AIS = 5. 1508 + 17. 4338 P/D + 0. 03128 (AGE) (1) Table 8 gives the various statistical parameters as- sociated with this equation. As indicated, there is a greater than 90% confidence that the AIS is a function of P/D and Age. Table 9 gives the means and ranges of the data base. Eq. 1 will be very reliable near the means of the table, whereas extrapolation be- yond the extremes will ve very risky. DISCUSSION OF ERROR - In the plotting of the calculated data versus the observed data in Fig. 1, the calculated data is rounded to the nearest integer; since the AIS has discrete values.

As indicated in Table 8, the standard error (standard deviation) is 0. 89. States et al. (18) made two validation studies of the AIS. In the first, one of the authors independently rated 200 injury reports submitted by the Multi- displinary Accident Investigation Teams (MDAIT) to the NHTSA. His rating agreed with those reported in 80% of the cases, differed by one in 15%, and differed by two in 5%. In a second validation study reported in the same paper, twenty-five reports were independently evaluated by 15 accident investigators with various professional backgrounds. Their ratings were compared with the ratings of the senior author, a physician. Although there were some inconsis- tencies in the data presented (Table 7, p. 718, Ref. 18), accepting it at face value gives the following results. The group agreed with the senior author in 53% of the cases, differed by one in 43%, and differed by two in 4%. Thus, the prediction equation devel- oped here appears about as accurate as the multiple displinary group but not as accurate as that done by a single investigator. REJECTED DATA - Fig. 2 is a plot of the AIS ratings for the rejected data versus the predicted ratings based on Eq. 1. The line and envelope repre- sent an exact prediction and + one standard error of the estimate. Only one of the six subjects with the spine supported, 58FM, fell within the envelope. One of the three subjects where the impactor was prematurely arrested, 3 2 FM, was in the envelope. A lower injury was predicted for each of the three than actually occurred. Had the impactor not been arrested, a higher injury value would have been pre- dicted, possibly resulting in better agreement with t the data base. It is also possible that more injury would have been done as well.

The high ratings for these three were the result of cardiovascular injuries. The very high impactor penetration of the female with the very large bust, 21 FF, resulted in a much higher prediction of injury for her than actually oc- curred. The one subject in rigor, 63FM, fell just outside of the envelope. The subject for which the load was not recorded, 43 FM, was well within the envelope, as expected. And finally, the one subject judged to be an outlier in response and injury rating, 37FM, was clearly that, being more than four stan- dard deviations away from the predicted value. If all of the above cases are rounded to the nearest integer, none are exact; five miss by one; four miss by two; two miss by three; and two miss by four. APPLICATION TO NHTSA DUMMIES DUMMY AGE - The regression equation of the previous section was applied to NHTSA (2) specified 5th percentile female and 50th and 95th percentile male characteristics to determine chest penetration injury criteria from blunt frontal impact for dummies of those sizes. While chest depth is specified, age is not. In the previous study by Neathery (11), where biofidelity of response for dummies as a function of their characteristics was developed, the issue of dummy age was avoided by developing empirical equations where age was not included as a factor. This effectively assigns the dummies an age by de- fault; namely, the mean of the cadavers data base. This was acceptable in that case because the re- sponse to impact was not strongly dependent on age and assigning a more reasonable age would have little effect on the results. However, in the problem at hand, the AIS rating is strongly dependent on age, and it would be unrealistic to assign the dummies the average age of the cadavers, 62, by default.</page><page sequence="8">PREDICTION OF THORACIC INJURY 3185 Table 10 - Recommended Chest Penetration and Sternal Deflection for AIS Rating of 3 and Age of 45 Years Recommended Dummy Chest Allowable Allowable Sternal Deflection Percentile Depth Penetration Sternal Deflection (Rounded) Size mm (in) mm (in) mm (in) mm (in) 5th Female 190 73.7 61.0 60 (7.5) (2.90) (2.40) (2.36) 50th Male 229 88.4 75.7 75 (9.0) (3.48) (2.98) (2.95) 95th Male 267 103.1 90.4 90 (10.5) (4.06) (3.56) (3.54) The sizes specified by NHTSA for the various percentile dummies are based on the survey by Stoudt et al. (20). Ih this study more than 6000 civilian men and women from 18 to 79 years of age were examined. The average age for both groups was 44. The es- sential driving population is probably at least a differ- ent range of ages, perhaps 15 to 75 years for a medi- an age of 45 years. For a representative and signal age, 45 is recommended. A more sophisticated de- termination of average driver age may be in order, but a year or two in either direction will not be im- portant. Obviously, larger differences will be impor- tant. In any case, Eq. 1 may be used to determine allowable deflections for ages other than 45 if desired. DEVELOPMENT OF CRITERIA - Protection at the AIS rating of 3 (severe: not life-threatening) is a reasonable compromise between occupant protection and efficient use of available stopping distances. This philosophy accepts a probable increase in minor in- juries in exchange for a probable reduction in major injuries. Others have recommended this level as well; for example, Patrick et al. (21). As in the case of age, Eq. 1 may be evaluated for other ratings if desired. Prediction Equation - Solving Eq. 1 for P/D gives: ^ = 0. 29545 + 0. 05736 AIS - 0. 00179 AGE (2) For an AIS of 3 this becomes: = 0. 46753 - 0. 00179 AGE (3) And for an AGE of 45: ~ = 0. 38680 (4) Penetrations obtained from applying Eq. 4 to the three sizes of dummies are given in Table 10. DISCUSSION OF CRITERIA - The values given in Table 10 are greater than those obtainable from Kroell et al. (10). As mentioned above, they had 78. 7 mm (3. 1 in) allowable penetration for 50th per- centile male. The difference of 10. 2 mm (0.4 in) is due primarily to the difference in ages. The Kroell estimate is not corrected for age, and the data base has an average age of 62. When that value is used in Eq. 3, an allowable deflection of 81. 3 mm (3. 2 in) is obtained. The remaining small difference is due to slight differences in the data base and round-off error. The 88.4 mm (3.48 in) penetration recommended for 50th percentile male is twice the 44.4 mm (1. 75 in) recommended by Stalnaker and Mohan (13). As discussed earlier, their recommendation probably corresponds to an AIS rating of 1. The average age for the Stalnaker data was 66. 1, and the average chest depth was 206 mm (8. 10 in)*. Evaluating Eq. 2 for these values yields a penetration of 48.3 mm (1.90 in). Alternately, using their recommended 44.4 mm (1. 75 in) penetration in Eq. 1 with the other average data gives an AIS rating of 0. 7, a very re s- sonable value for Stalnaker data, especially if rounded to a discrete 1. Thus rather than a 2 to 1 difference in recommendations, the results are in agreement when properly scaled. The above apparent 2 to 1 disagreement in results illustrates the great value of the dimensional analysis- -regression analysis approach to the handling of body system and whole body response and tolerance data. Apparently contradictory results are completely reconciled by appropriate scaling. It should be noted that Eqs. 1-4 are in terms of penetration. The biomechanical response corridors are for sternal deflection. The latter have been taken by Kroell to be about 12. 7 mm (0. 5 in) less than the former. The values for sternal deflection in Table 10 reflect this difference. For convenience, values are rounded to 60, 75, and 95 mm (2.36, 2.95 and 3.54 in) for the 5th percentile female, the 50th percentile male, and the 95th percentile male, respectively. These values apply only to test dummies that have significant thoracic biofidelity for blunt frontal im- pact, as described in Ref. 11. They are valid for environments which include significant blunt frontal thoracic impacts. Their extensions to other environ- ments have not been validated. *See Neathery (11) for the calculation of chest depth based on other physical characteristics. Chest depth was not taken in the Stalnaker data.</page><page sequence="9">3186 R. F. NEATHERY, ET AL. CONCLUSIONS 1. The current practices of evaluating thoracic injury in automotive testing are invalid under blunt frontal thoracic impact loading conditions. 2. Since these practices are shown to be invalid in blunt frontal thoracic impact, their use in other specific environments is also questionable and in need of evaluation. 3. The specification of biofidelity of crash test dummies and the injury criteria employed using dummies cannot be treated independently. Para- meters used to define injury criteria must be included in - or predictably dependent upon - the parameters used to specify biomechanical fidelity. 4. The production of trauma from blunt frontal impact to unembalmed cadavers was found to be a statistically significant function of the penetration of the impactor and the age and chest depth of the cadaver. 5. The production of trauma from blunt frontal impact was found not to be a statistically significant function of either the force produced by the impact, the cadaver mass, or cadaver height. 6. The conclusion of Stalnaker and Mohan on allowable chest penetration is consistent with those given here when scaled for size, age, and level of injury. RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Sternal deflection measured in dummy chests with substantial biomechanical fidelity (GM corridors) should be used to evaluate the injury potential of auto- motive systems where blunt thoracic impact is pre- dominant; for example, steering column involvement. 2. The following sternal deflections are recom- mended to limit the injury level to an AIS rating of 3 for blunt frontal impacts of the thorax using 45 years as a representative age: 5th percentile female : 60 mm (2.36 in) 50th percentile male : 75 mm (2.95 in) 95th percentile male : 90 mm (3. 54 in) These recommended sternal deflection levels will have meaning as tolerance indicators for evaluation of dummy responses only if the dynamic response characteristics of the chests of the dummies satisfy the appropriate biofidelity performance corridors recommended by GM. Realization of these perfor- mance corridors may not be sufficient to yield whole body dummy behavior of sufficient fidelity to accu- rately reflect the crash performance of vehicle sys- tems. Accordingly, additional dummy performance specifications may be necessary. Sternal deflection should be measured in the same manner as it is in determining thoracic biofidelity. 3. Current methods of evaluation of occupant protection (severity index or 3 ms level of thoracic spinal acceleration or chest load level) should not be used when significant blunt frontal chest impact occurs. 4. Studies should be conducted to evaluate the appropriateness of force level, thoracic acceleration, and sternal deflection in other restraint environments such as three-point harness and air cushions.
