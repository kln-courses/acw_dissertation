A S I think of the time when, as an undergraduate, I studied under Professor Pringle-Pattison in St. Andrews Univer- sity, and consider that I am now called upon to act as his suc- cessor, I feel that I stand much in need of the kindly consider- ation you so generously extend to me. I can but pray that the, traditions of this famous Chair, handed on with added lustre by Professor Pringle-Pattison, may in some degree support me; and I can at least promise that I shall not be found wanting through any failure to appreciate the magnitude of the task and the greatness of the responsibility which it imposes. Before this audience, and in Professor Pringle-Pattison's presence, it would be presumptuous for me to speak in praise of his great services to the university and to philosophy, but there are certain matters upon which I may claim that I am qualified to pronounce with some authority. It is well when succeeding generations are bound together by respect and reverence; and I know that I shall be expressing the feelings of all Professor Pringle-Pattison's former pupils here present when I say that there is no one to whom the younger generation in philosophy looks up with more unqualified admiration, reverence, and affec- tion. We count it a high privilege that he will continue in our midst; and we look to him to give us, as the fruits of his greater leisure, still more of the inspiration that has meant so much to us in the past. As Professor Pringle-Pattison left St. Andrews, to occupy this 1 An inaugural lecture delivered at the University of Edinburgh, October i6, i9Xg9 I</page><page sequence="2">2 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIX. Chair, while I was only in the third year of what was then the four years' arts course, I did not have the privilege of his instruc- tion in the honors classes, but already in the junior class I had sufficient opportunity of appreciating what I believe has been an outstanding feature of all his teaching; and it is one that I would wish to imitate. The teacher of philosophy stands to his students in a relation of greater delicacy than does the teacher of any other subject in the university curriculum. He deals, and is obliged to deal, with problems that are concerned in the most intimate and searching way with the ultimate issues of life; but since, unlike the workers in the positive sciences, he cannot in so doing appeal to any authoritative and universally accepted body of doctrine, he is by the nature of his subject peculiarly exposed to the temptation of imposing upon his hearers his own merely personal views. The Scottish student is not, indeed, entirely at the mercy of his teachers in any subject, and certainly not in a class of philosophy. But none the less, if a teacher selects his material, and does not press his conclusions until he has prepared the ground beforehand, he can prejudice the issues before they have been squarely faced. He has also under his control the reading prescribed for class and degree examinations; and by its means he can enlist in his support standard works that do not raise in too convincing or too sug- gestive a form the difficulties which his own philosophy is least capable of meeting; and the books will thus seem, as by independ- ent testimony, to confirm the soundness of the doctrines that he is propounding. From this particular disadvantage Professor Pringle-Pattison's teaching has always been singularly free; one of its most im- pressive features has been the faithfulness with which he deals with his hearers, not concealing, and not withholding, the expression of his own convictions, but also at the same time demanding that the problems should be faced in all their difficulty before judgment is passed upon them. None of his students, in looking back, can feel that their introduction to the great and critical problems of philosophy has been unduly biased, or that the perspective in which they have been presented was other</page><page sequence="3">No. I.1 THE PRESENT SITUATION IN PHILOSOPHY. 3 than that which a fair-minded thinker could rightly give to them. I shall endeavor, to the best of my powers, to follow Professor Pringle-Pattison's example in this respect. If the teacher of philosophy can enable his students to appreciate the problems at issue, and the conclusions to which they will in consistency stand committed according as they adopt a philosophy of one or another type, and if, further, he can interpret to them the great historical traditions within which these conflicting philosophies appear, then the Scottish student may generally be relied upon, sooner or later, to acquire a philosophy for himself. What that philoso- phy will be, is determined, as is only fitting, by wider and more representative influences than can, or should be, brought to bear in the class-room. On an occasion such as this, however, I shall very rightly be expected to give some indication of my personal sympathies and convictions, and I have therefore chosen as the topic of my remarks the present situation in philosophy. Though philosophical systems vary indefinitely, they are reducible, broadly considered, to three main types. They are either idealist, or naturalistic, or sceptical. Under one or other of these three rubrics every philosophy can be brought; and at every period in which free discussion has been possible, we find the sum-total of knowledge and experience being interpreted from these divergent points of view. The three types are, it would seem, perennial in the fluctuations of human thought. Each of them every little while finds some new and hitherto unconsidered difficulty cropping up in its path. Fresh additions to knowledge seem at first sight conclusively to favor one of them and to rule out the others. In the end, however, each contrives to reassert itself, and to propound some method, more or less feasible, of reconciling the new knowledge with its own standpoint. Scepticism and naturalism, not to mention idealism, are as much alive to-day as they were in the time of Aristotle. Idealism now, as hitherto, is probably the philosophy of the great majority of men. Naturalism still represents the attitude of those who incline, whether on pragmatic or on scientific grounds, to a secularist reading of human life and destiny.</page><page sequence="4">4 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIX. Scepticism still draws its comparatively small band of followers from very various sources. But in nearly all other respects the situation has undergone complete change. Each of the three typical philosophies has developed almost out of recognition. The sceptical and naturalistic philosophies of the present day differ from those in ancient Greece even more fundamentally than the Hegelian philosophy differs from the idealism of Plato and Aristotle. Most histories of philosophy have, as it happens, been written by idealists; and we are therefore well acquainted with the ideal- ist's claim that his type of philosophy has progressively deepened, has been fertilized, strengthened, and enriched by the whole progress of human thought throughout the centuries. Have not the natural sciences confirmed idealist teaching as to the ration- ality of the Universe, and have they not by their magnificent conquests borne striking witness to the capacities of the human spirit? And have not the labors of the sceptics likewise furthered the idealist tradition? Could idealist philosophy have developed its present strength save under the severe and salutary discipline to which the sceptics have so continuously and zealously sub- jected it ever since the time of Zeno and Protagoras? That is to say, both the results of the positive sciences, the facts to which naturalism makes appeal, and also the arguments upon which the sceptics have reared an agnostic philosophy, have all con- tributed to the ultimate strengthening of the idealist position. The stream of tendency has been towards idealism. As a matter of fact, however, scepticism and naturalism have undergone a corresponding development. The history of phil- osophy can be written from the sceptical point of view, and several such histories exist, the best known being the famous biographical history by George Henry Lewes, probably the most widely read history of philosophy ever written. Though now considerably out of date, it is still readable. He wrote it in order to show that the lesson which history teaches is that every idealist system and every naturalistic system, in short every constructive philosophy, inevitably, sooner or later, falls prey to the sceptic. The idealists, he argues, by their ingenious</page><page sequence="5">No. I.] THE PRESENT SITUATION IN PHILOSOPHY. 5 attempts to elude refutation, have so sharpened the wits of their opponents, that largely thanks to these idealists-thanks to Socrates, Plato, Descartes, Kant, and Hegel-the sceptical position has now at last been firmly established. Scepticism, he maintains, can now demonstrate from the very constitution of our faculties, and from the so-called knowledge which we have acquired in the natural sciences, that we know nothing of ulti- mate reality. Similar claims may be urged on behalf of naturalism. As Friedrich Lange has shown in his History of Materialism, there is as great a difference between ancient and modern materialism as there is between primitive forms of life and the complex organisms which have evolved from them. Naturalism, it may be contended, has kept pace with moral and religious experience as well as with the growth of the positive sciences; so that it can now account, from a naturalistic point of view, not merely for physical, chemical, and physiological processes, but for the development of civilization and for the misconceived, but none the less indispensable, services rendered by idealist and sceptical thinkers in Greek and modern times. These three typical philosophies thus stand in a constant relation of interaction and mutual aid. Each in the struggle for self-maintenance compels the competing systems to develop on fresh lines, meeting new objections by modification of their former grounds. But they are so opposed in fundamentals that, with the best will in the world, they can neither compromise on their differences nor convert one another to common conclu- sions. So that while each main type of philosophy has under- gone what may accurately be described (allowing for minor deviations) as a continuous and steady development of its initial principles, this development, astonishingly rich and fruitful as it has undoubtedly been, has not enabled any one of them quite decisively to displace the others. However they may have altered in their methods of argument, and however they may have approximated on this or that particular tenet, in their fundamental principles they remain as antagonistic as at any period in the past. In this address I propose to define the rela-</page><page sequence="6">6 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIX. tions in which they stand to one another in present-day con- troversy. The idealists, ever since the time of Socrates, have contended that in interpreting man in terms of his physical conditions naturalism rules itself out from answering those questions, moral, social, and religious, that outweigh in human interest and in practical importance the more purely theoretical problems with which a naturalistic philosophy chiefly concerns itself. To such a charge naturalism, even in its least developed stages, has always been able to make weighty reply. Frankly non-religious, it could point to the superstitious, ambiguous character of religious belief and practice; frankly revolutionary, it could trace moral distinctions to social conventions adopted for their beneficial consequences in forwarding the secular welfare of the individual and of society. And regarding happiness as the end of life, it could welcome the fine arts; rejoicing in the lust of the eye and in the pride of life, are they not its natural allies? For several reasons, however, this naturalistic philosophy has seldom succeeded in obtaining acceptance save in strictly limited circles. But there can, I should say, be no more fatal error than to argue that this must necessarily continue. Though speaking as a convinced idealist, I should like to indicate in what respects the naturalistic position has been strengthened-and it has, I should say, been very greatly strengthened-by the advance of knowledge, especially in the historical sciences, in the nineteenth century. Naturalism can now profess to meet idealism on more equal terms within its own field, that of our specifically human activities. But let me first define the present situation as regards scepti- cism. Scepticism must hold a high and worthy place in every history of philosophy, by whomsoever written. It has been one of the main agencies of human advance. It is the enemy of fanaticism and of false sentiment in every form. The mind to which it is utterly uncongenial can have no capacity for philoso- phy, and is little likely to have discrimination in regard to the truth. Professor Paterson has recently said that the Scotch- and we always like to hear ourselves praised-have the most</page><page sequence="7">No. -.1 THE PRESENT SITUATION IN PHILOSOPHY. 7 complex character of any people in the world. Is not David Hume one of the greatest figures in the history of philosophy, and does he not represent a national trait? For though we are theologically inclined, and endowed with a Celtic fervor in the convictions we adopt, are we not hard-headedly sceptical in equal degree? To what is the admitted Scottish capacity for philosophy due, if not to this happy combination of caution and tenacity, of circumspection when we are invited to accept a statement, and of readiness to fight for it once we have made it our own? But while scepticism is valuable as a regulating balance-wheel, it can supply no engine-power. When through the miscarriage of positive efforts at construction error arises, or when beliefs and institutions justified in their day and generation outlive their usefulness and abuses accumulate, the sceptic is indeed in his element. But when his destructive work is completed, and the ground is cleared, he is left without occupation. He is a specialist in the subject of error, and when the community's stock of error gives out, he is faced by the spectre of unemployment, condemned to idleness until a new crop has been grown. If he takes to some more constructive line of life, his creed commits him to the belief that he will himself be adding to the sum of what, as a sceptic, he lives only to condemn. Thus though scepticism contributes to the history of philosophy some of its most exciting and critical incidents, it has perforce, when it endeavors to represent this history as establishing its own truth, to defer its apotheosis to the close of the drama, leaving the stage free for the more positive creeds. The history of philosophy, quite obviously, is not the history of sceptical thinkers. Scepticism is, at most, a kind of Greek chorus, com- menting ironically upon the course of the action, and when it closes tragically, in failure and disappointment, summoning the spectator more wisely to be content with the cry of wonder and ignorance that alone befits a creaturely being such as man. The sceptic, therefore, if h1 be as keen in his powers of appre- ciation as he is clear-sighted in the detection of error and illusion, will recognize that the creative forces of civilization are positive</page><page sequence="8">8 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIX. in character. Is not even his own onslaught upon error due to a fastidious insistence, more or less unreasoned, upon intellectual standards? The better understanding of these positive forces has indeed led, during the past thirty years, to a very remarkable change of attitude in the philosophical world. Scepticism, or to employ the term invented by Huxley, agnosticism, was never probably more favorably regarded or more influential than in the period between i820 and say i890. It was developed as a self-sufficing creed by Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer, by Huxley and Helmholtz; and in the hands of Sir William Hamilton and Mansel was even employed as a buttress to traditional religion. More recently, however, the trend alike of philosophy and of popular opinion, both in the scientific and in the religious spheres, seems to have set very definitely against it. It is now generally recog- nized that though for certain of our problems we have no suffi- cient available data, we cannot so far predict the future as to set up a boundary-line between the possibly knowable and the absolutely unknowable. And even granting this could be done, the exigencies of life constrain us to adopt an attitude towards practical, social, and religious problems. The position thus taken, even if only on pragmatic grounds, is what determines our philosophy. Our attitude to these more immediate ques- tions must be either naturalistic or idealist in type and tendency, and consequently it is between these two forms of philosophy that we are called upon to decide. Before I leave scepticism, allow me to indicate what were the influences that gave it a new lease of life in the nineteenth cen- tury, and why, while at first seeming to contribute to the estab- lishment of an agnostic philosophy; they have in the end led away from it. At the period I refer to, say roughly from about i820 onwards, the Romantic movement, passing from literature into scholarship and history, awakened a new interest in human life as lived under conditions different from our own, whether in the Far East, in classical, or in primitive times, and so originated the historical study of civilization in all its manifold forms. This historical</page><page sequence="9">No. i.] THE PRESENT SITUATION IN PHILOSOPHY. 9 method obtained an added prestige from Darwin's application of it in the biological sciences; but it had already borne good fruit prior to the publication of the Origin of Species, and very soon thereafter was able to systematize its main results through the creation of the new science of anthropology. Now anthropology made possible for the first time an under- standing of the beginnings in which human thinking takes its! rise. It has shown that primitive thinking, among savage peoples in all parts of the earth, invariably bases itself upon a distinction between soul and body, and that it employs this distinction to account for all those phenomena which most attract its attention, especially the facts of disease and death. Animism, as it is called-that is to say, the animistic distinction between the body and a soul supposed to be capable of leaving it in sleep and of surviving it in death-is the cradle of all human thought. It has made possible the first beginnings of religion, and has thereby yielded the necessary sanctions for the moral and social values embodied in custom and in tribal institutions. The conclusions to which the study of primitive thought thus led were mainly twofold-that animism is false as a theory, and yet profoundly beneficial as an influence. It is false because the data upon which the distinction between soul and body is based have been wrongly interpreted. The asserted facts are either themselves fictitious or, owing to primitive man's ignorance of the forces at work within and without him, have been misunder- stood. Thus human thought is cradled not in ignorance, but in positive error and delusion. Its primitive beliefs rest upon foundations which, from a logical point of view, are grotesquely incapable of supporting the superstructure. These beliefs may be reestablished on other grounds, but certainly not on the evidence which originally led to their adoption. But that is only one side of the picture; the other was for its first discoverers even more important. For they were con- strained, by the same line of reasoning, to recognize that since animism has not been arbitrarily invented, but has arisen from natural causes among peoples in all parts of the earth, being indeed coextensive with human thinking in its earliest known</page><page sequence="10">IO THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIX. periods, it must have performed in a relatively satisfactory manner some useful function. It must have aided in the de- velopment of civilization. They therefore concluded that the justification for the animistic beliefs is to be looked for exclusively in the practical domain. Save in the favoring environment of animistic beliefs, religion, they argued, could never have come into existence; and in the absence of religion, the social and moral codes could never have acquired those terrific sanctions which only the religious emotions (so powerful in primitive societies) could confer, and through which alone the counter- influence of the self-regarding, non-social instincts and passions could be broken down. Religion, that is to say, is on this view a by-product of evolution. It is simply one of nature's many and strange devices for furtherance of her ends. The communi- ties in which religion appears and takes root acquire all the advantages of unified action, and are therefore favored by the processes of natural selection. These services, however, are only temporary. Though they have proved indispensable in the earlier stages of man's development, they cannot hope to main- tain themselves under the altered conditions of a civilization that is scientifically organized. From this point of view, agnosticism proceeded to extend the pragmatic method of explanation to our so-called scientific know- ledge. Even science, it was contended, is not a form of theoretical insight; it is merely a means to power. Science, rightly under- stood, never seeks to explain, but only to simplify. By scrupu- lously careful observation we verify the ultimate coexistences and sequences among our sensations, and under the guidance of elaborate hypotheses, which have a merely subjective value in directing inquiry, we define the coexistences and sequences in exact quantitative terms. Acquaintance with these relations, when thus precisely defined, enables us to predict the future, to construct machines, and so progressively to gain control over our physical environment; but they yield no insight, it is main- tained, into the independently real. What is alone truly char- acteristic of science is not the obtaining of insight, but the acqui- sition of power. Thought is an instrument developed through</page><page sequence="11">No. I.] THE PRESENT SITUATION IN PHILOSOPHY. II natural processes for the practical purposes of adaptation. Its criteria and values are exclusively determined by the instinctive equipment of the species in its adjustment to environment. They have no independent validity of any kind. The human mind, the argument proceeds, is limited to appearances; to attain knowledge in the absolute sense, that is to say through distinguishing between the true and the false, is impossible. There is a mechanism or economy of human thought; but logic, so-called, is a science with pretensions as excessive and quite as unfounded as those of theology. The distinction between the true and the false claims to be an absolute one; and how can man, a merely natural existence, expect to have dealings with the absolute in any form! These conclusions made possible a sceptical philosophy immensely more comprehensive in its scope, and much more assured in its methods, than any that had previously been pro- pounded. The history of human thought, when thus taken on its philosophical side, is the record, not of a progressive discovery of truth, but of our gradual emancipation from error. Recog- nizing the misleading character of this, that, and the other belief, we renounce them; and those beliefs that are left we retain, not because they can be demonstrated, but simply because we find them serviceable. Though they cannot be proved, they cannot be refuted; and the probability, it may be argued, is that, like the beliefs which we have come to reject, their usefulness is no criterion as to their truth. They aid us in adapting ourselves to our physical and social environment, but that is no reason for ascribing to them any independent validity. We cannot have dealings with the absolute in the practical any more than in the intellectual domain. But in proportion as agnosticism developed this position, it overreached itself, and fell into unstable equilibrium. It is easily shown that in drawing an absolute distinction between appearance and reality-and it is upon the absoluteness of the opposition that its scepticism rests-it is simply retaining from metaphysical thinking a belief for which, on a secularist reading of human life, no practical or instrumental justification is or can</page><page sequence="12">12 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIX. be offered; while, on the other hand, it is equally clear that all those beliefs of the traditional religions, which agnosticism is so bent upon eliminating, are bound up with it. If the distinction between appearance and reality be retained, then more must be made of it, and justification must be given for our preferential treatment of it. But in that case the agnosticism is undermined, and the way is opened for idealist teaching. This is the line taken by those who employ it in support of religion. If, on the other hand-and this has been the more usual tendency of the School-the distinction between appearance and reality be allowed to be as relative and empirical as any other, agnosticism at once reveals its true affiliations. Agnosticism, in its usual and most influential forms, has really been naturalism in disguise. Present-day naturalism, if asked to outline the history of philosophy, would therefore reply somewhat as follows. Animism developed through Pythagoras, Socrates, and Plato into spiritual- ism. This spiritualism was reaffirmed in modern times by Des- cartes and his successors, and under the disintegrating influence of sceptical inquiry was developed by Locke, Hume, Kant, and others into agnosticism. But agnosticism, naturalism maintains, is itself a compromise between science and animism. The dualism between the phenomenal and the real, upon which agnosticism bases itself, is the last survival of those many dual- isms which owe their origin to the primitive distinction between soul and body. With the total elimination of all dualistic dis- tinctions, agnosticism likewise vanishes, and we are then for the first time left with a thoroughgoing and completely consistent creed-the creed which is progressively strengthened by every advance in science, namely, naturalism. Up to a certain point, in its treatment of animistic beliefs, naturalism argues on lines very similar to those of scepticism, viewing the primitive distinction between soul and body as resting upon a number of false inferences, and as being the ulti- mate source of all those dualisms-between mind and matter, between the natural and the supernatural-that, as it believes, have hitherto vitiated philosophical thinking. What distin- guishes naturalism is its more sympathetic attitude towards</page><page sequence="13">No. i.] THE PRESENT SITUATION IN PHILOSOPHY. 13 animistic beliefs on their practical side. For as I have already suggested, naturalism has ceased to be exclusively interested in physical and cosmological problems. As a philosophy, it now rests its main hopes on the medical, psychological, and social sciences; and from the recent developments of these sciences it has, like idealism, learned many lessons, especially as regards the predominant part played in practical life by instinct and the emotions. It recognizes that in virtue of our instinctive equip- ment we have profound idealizing tendencies, and that one of our fundamental needs is that of devoting our energies to some end more enduring and wider than our own personal well-being. And it also recognizes-what is so abundantly evident in the light of history-that until a social movement takes on an emo- tional character, and indeed becomes a religious crusade that can regard itself as directed against the powers of darkness, it can never be genuinely popular and secure the adhesion of the masses of men. Accordingly naturalism has in recent times more and more expounded itself in the form of an enthusiastic, humani- tarian, and indeed utopian creed, with an ethics emotionally charged by the harsher impulses of hatred and indignation as well as by the softer sentiments of love and pity. Even of the traditional religions naturalism now speaks in a more sympathetic manner. Having discovered, as it believes, a use for religion, it has a fondness for eulogizing the beneficial influence exercised by religious illusions in the past; and may even be heard to express fears that, owing to their merely theoret- ical falsity, they may be undermined too rapidly, before educa- tion and social reform can be sufficiently advanced to allow of the more reliable sanctions of a secularist religion taking their place. This view of traditional beliefs as illusory and yet temporarily beneficial also enables naturalism to assign an honorable place to poetry and the fine arts. They have strengthened the illusions that are biologically necessary, eliminating what is deleterious in them, and purifying them of all but their quintessential stimu- lating power. This, it is contended, is the function of the arts so long as we remain at play in nature's nursery. But even in the enlightened society of the future, when nature will no longer</page><page sequence="14">14 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIX. be allowed-so it is argued-to treat us like children, deluding us for her own ends, and when nothing, therefore, will be permitted to come between us and reality, to the arts will still belong the task of keeping up man's courage and of allaying his discontent- ments. They will depict the ideals of a secularist society and the modes of life that most contribute to its consummation. Thus present-day naturalism has all the more seriously to be reckoned with that it is no longer exclusively intellectualist in its interests and outlook, but endeavors to organize a type of civili- zation and of religion in harmony with itself, and can provide a programme that may guide us in the supreme and ultimate choices of our practical life. Naturalism has also, in the past twenty-five years, made one other very notable change of position, and again in reaction against agnostic teaching. In its most recent expositions it shows an eagerness to come into line with the idealist view that the logical criteria have absolute validity, that knowledge is 'really knowledge, that is to say a form of genuine insight, revealing to us the independently real. Accordingly what present-day naturalism is now generally most anxious to disavow is any sympathy with the sceptical, subjectivist, pragmatic view of knowledge. It claims to be realistic, and to interpret man, not in the manner of John Stuart Mill or Huxley, as dealing with reality only through the mediation of subjective sensations, but as apprehending it face to face. The distinction between truth and falsity is as absolute a distinction as can well be conceived. WThen we assert that a proposition is true-for instance the proposition, gravity varies inversely as the square of the distance we are claiming that it must be recognized as valid by other minds as well as by our own. This is the feature whereby the true is distinguished from the merely advantageous or useful. It holds independently of the needs and special constitution of the individuals that assert it. Knowledge is objectivist in character; and its judgments have jurisdiction throughout reality as a whole. That naturalism should thus have come to agree with idealism in rejecting the sceptical, subjectivist view of knowledge, may</page><page sequence="15">No. i.] THE PRESENT SITUATION IN PHILOSOPHY. 15 at first sight appear to be a comparatively small matter. Both types of philosophy, it may be said, are, of course, concerned to maintain the validity of logical distinctions, since otherwise neither can hope to establish itself as true. What we desire to know is not whether we can distinguish between truth and falsity-that may be granted-but in which of the competing systems truth is to be found. For why, it may be asked, should the conclusion that science is really science, revealing to us the independently real, be regarded by idealism as so vitally im- portant, especially when what science teaches seems to place so many obstacles in the way of an idealist philosophy, and seems indeed, if anything, to favor naturalism? To these questions there is a twofold reply. In the first place, the supreme concern of idealism is to show that the aesthetic and spiritual values have a more than merely human significance; and there is apparently not the least hope of so doing if the values that hold in the intellectual domain cannot be substantiated as possessing objective validity. If you will pardon the seeming truism, it is the very purpose of knowledge to know. If know- ledge is itself a deception, and its conclusions are merely practical devices for temporary adaptation, forcing belief independently of demonstration, there can be no hope of vindicating for the other values in life any supra-human significance. The genuineness of scientific knowledge must therefore be regarded as one of the main supporting pillars of an idealist philosophy. Idealism cannot afford to be obscurantist; it may legitimately in certain circumstances be sceptical as to whether or not a theory has been scientifically established; but should it attack science, it will be undermining its own foundations. But there is also a second reason why idealism welcomes, as no small advance towards eventual agreement, the recognition by naturalism of the absolute validity of the logical criteria. If, as idealism maintains, intellectual and spiritual values stand on the same plane of objectivity, and therefore justify parity of treatment, half the battle is won when the human mind, its natural history notwithstanding, is allowed to be capable of transcending not only its subjective but even its planetary</page><page sequence="16">i6 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIX. limitations. That the human mind should possess the power of comprehending its own natural origins, and of ranging in what we call thought over the entire material universe, of which, as an animal existence, it is so minor and transitory a product, is, in the view of idealism, a fact of such central and supreme signifi- cance that agreement in regard to it must, in consistency, bring other important consequences in its train. And this, indeed, is why the problem of knowledge-somewhat to the bewilder- ment of the outsider in philosophy-has always bulked so promi- nently in idealist systems. The specific results of the natural sciences, taken by themselves and so far as they go, may support naturalism no less than idealism, and perhaps on the whole can be regarded as favoring naturalism-I should myself be willing to make this admission-yet the fact that science exists at all, that the human mind has proved capable of acquiring it, when taken with the other achievements of the human spirit, in the arts, in the moral, social, and religious life, outweighs in philosophical significance, and sets in a very different perspective, the conclu- sions reached exclusively through study of man's physical con- ditions. If, then, skepticism, though likely to come forward again in the future, is meantime in abeyance; if present-day thinkers, with very few exceptions, can be classed as either naturalistic or idealist in tendency; and if, further, naturalism and idealism have in certain respects come more into agreement with one another, what are the issues that still divide them? Obviously this is too large a question for me to discuss at this time; but the differences are few and vital, and can be briefly stated. But before I do so, I must indicate the interpretation which idealism gives to animistic beliefs. In most respects it is almost diametrically opposed to that given by naturalism. Since in the early stages of human development reflective thinking plays only a very minor part, what we have to consider is not the logical sufficiency of the causes generating the animistic beliefs, but the extent to which these beliefs have themselves stood the test of later experience. And judging them by this criterion, idealism is prepared to maintain that so far are the dualisms in which</page><page sequence="17">No. I.] THE PRESENT SITUATION IN PHILOSOPHY. 17 animism has issued from being the main source of error in philoso- phy, that on the contrary only through recognition of the dis- tinctions to which they direct our attention can human life be rightly understood. Primitive man's distinction between the body and its ghostly duplicate is simply the first crude formulation of that later distinction between the physical and the psychical which in one form or another we are bound to accept as funda- mental. The particular forms in which such beliefs first present themselves are largely false. But how could it have been other- wise? Their crudity stands in a necessary correlation with the limitations of the social milieu in which they are formed. Their beneficial consequences are, indeed, dependent upon this corre- lation; and to that extent their serviceableness is proportionate to their falsity. This, however, is not because primitive beliefs are not travelling upon the path to truth. The path is long and devious, and can lead to its goal only as civilization itself pro- gresses. But from the point of view of idealism, animism has another and even more important aspect. It embodies certain values and criteria which reveal the human spirit, already in the earliest stage in which it is known to us, as being radically different, in nature and destiny, from the animal. There may perhaps be no breach of continuity. Upon that we can hardly decide until more is known. But meantime, as in the distinction between the living and the lifeless, the differences between the two are, for philosophy, more significant than any features in which they agree. For, as we must remember, with animism is bound up the first emergence, not only of intellectual curiosity, and there- fore of the strictly logical criteria, but also of the moral, social, religious, and aesthetic aspects of human life; and the fundamen- tal, permanently valuable character of the categories which they involve is sufficiently established by their after-history. Naturalism, in contradiction of its own earlier prophecies, has itself been compelled to recognize that they have a continuing validity, and represent so many ultimate and irreducible aspects of human existence. Animism is indeed the cradle of human thought; and what</page><page sequence="18">I 8 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIX. most surprises upon study of it is not the extent and perversity of its false beliefs, but, allowing for its necessary limitations and defects, the extraordinarily sound appreciation which it displays for those distinctions which reach deepest and best stand the test of more developed experience. And now I return to the questions at issue between naturalism and idealism. They are opposed on one fundamental conviction. According to naturalism, parts of the Universe are more complex and are more completely unified than is the Universe as a whole. Certain parts, too, possess higher qualities, such as life and consciousness, which are not to be found in the wider reality that includes them. That is to say, when we sample reality, parts are found to be superior to the whole. The Universe is, as it were, merely the stage, and is not itself a center of interest; what alone signify are the episodes that happen in this or that part of it. Idealism, on the other hand, is committed to the assertion that the Universe is at once richer and more highly unified than any of its parts. And as man is the most complex existence known to us, it is upon the clues supplied by our specifically human experience that idealism bases its ultimate conclusions. For though man can, indeed, be studied only in his natural setting, for an understanding of his nature and destiny idealism refers us to that wider reality which is depicted in poetry and the arts, and worshipped in religion, and which, though not yet scientifically known, can be philosophically discerned as con- ferring upon human life its standards and values. This main cleavage of opinion determines all the other dif- ferences between naturalism and idealism. Naturalism finds in matter, or at least in the non-conscious, the ground-work of reality; idealism finds in spiritual values the key to ultimate problems. Naturalism has to treat human values as merely relative; idealism interprets them as disclosing a richer and more comprehensive Universe than can yet be defined in scientific terms. The picture which naturalism forms of the Universe is decided for it, in its main features, by astronomy. Reality is made up of solar systems scattered throughout infinite space, many of</page><page sequence="19">No. I.] THE PRESENT SITUATION IN PHILOSOPHY. 19 which, presumably, contain planets inhabited by beings more or less similar to the human race. These systems arise and decline, in the manner of plants and animals on the surface of the earth; their life-period is immensely longer, but not otherwise different. Though innumerable civilizations have, we may believe, already made their appearance and vanished in infinite time and infinite space, they do not, like the lives on one planet, form a series or evolution. They are detached episodes that combine to form no cosmic drama. Meaning is to be found only within the parts of the Universe; there is no meaning in the Universe itself. Idealism cannot, in opposition to this cosmology, profess to offer any definite picture of physical reality as a whole. This, frankly, is the weaker side of idealism. At best, it can only confess its ignorance. But since astronomy makes no claim to finality in these matters, and indeed can already detect traces of a systematic order in the stellar Universe, idealism is not dis- abled from postulating that on fuller knowledge physical reality will be found to be unified in a manner consistent with all that the facts of the spiritual life may demand. Idealism can venture on this postulate without professing to have the least knowledge how in detail the required unity can be possible, and on what lines, mathematical, astronomical, or other, science may ultimately perhaps be led to its establishment. Now since the only basis upon which idealism can rest this far-reaching conclusion is the contention that spiritual no less than intellectual criteria have an absolute validity, idealism must stand or fall according to its success or failure in upholding this latter position, in face of the counter-arguments of the natural- istic philosophies. Present-day naturalism, as I have already stated, is not only willing but eager to recognize all values, spiritual as well as intellectual. As a philosophy, it embraces the whole ambit of human existence, and professes to offer an interpretation ade- quate to every one of its many aspects. But while doing so, it claims that the intellectual values stand apart by themselves, and that from them no argument applicable to aesthetic and moral values can be obtained. Logical criteria, it is argued, are indeed</page><page sequence="20">20 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIX. absolute; scientific judgments are valid throughout reality as a whole. But the aesthetic, spiritual, and social criteria, it con- tends, are in a very different position. They are so inextricably bound up with the civilization of our planet, that upon them no judgments having wider jurisdiction can legitimately be based. Our terrestrial civilization, in all its main characteristics, is determined by the particular physical, geographical, biological, economic, and other conditions that render it just the kind of civilization it is; and should we attempt to consider moral or spiritual values in abstraction from the complex contingencies in which alone they are known to us, they lose all definiteness and all meaning. They are so many forms of adaptation, and are as specific as the environment that prescribes and defines them. Anthropomorphic conceptions are meaningless, and therefore useless, in metaphysics. This is surely obvious, naturalism argues, in the case of the fine arts. They are merely human, being conditioned by physi- cal, physiological, and psychical factors that cannot be conceived to exist with sufficient uniformity beyond this earth. Is it likely that on other planets other animal species should develop senses exactly like those of the human race? And if not, can any of the fine arts have meaning beyond this planet? Is not even the most sublime poetry inseparably bound up with the lan- guage in which it is composed, and is not this language accessible only to beings with organs of articulation and of hearing identical with our own? Or, as Spinoza has asked, can we conceive a Divine Being as delighting in music and harmony? Would not that be to picture God as an animal and as having ears? In respect to moral values the argument may not be so obvious, but can be developed, naturalism teaches, on analogous lines. We cannot distinguish in our civilization between elements strictly human and elements of a higher order. Our civilization is all of a piece. It cannot be divided.. What is highest in it has meaning only by reference to the detailed contingencies of terrestrial existence. Indeed, if a distinction is to be drawn between higher and lower, it must be to the lower that we assign the wider meaning. The physical elements are more uniform</page><page sequence="21">No. I.] THE PRESENT SITUA TION IN PHILOSOPHY. 21 than the chemical, the chemical than the organic, the organic than the psychical. As we rise in the scale we pass from the less to the more organized, and therefore, according to naturalism, depart ever further from the types which alone exist universally. As we rise in the scale, existence, in growing ever more complex, increases in contingency, in uniqueness; it becomes, as naturalism teaches, less and less like what is elsewhere in the Universe, more and more provincial, more and more characterized by the idio- syncrasies of its own peculiar modes of existence. Idealism, when asked to meet this philosophy, has, it is clear, no easy task. So much of the argument must at once be granted. Man is indeed, in one sense, all of a piece. The products of art, in their aesthetic quality, have no existence save by reference to our specific sense-organs. Only beings with ears exactly like our own can appreciate or even hear the sonatas of Beethoven. The coloring and perspective in a landscape by Turner can have no aesthetic value save in reaction to the human eye. Our moral duties are similarly determined by our social institutions. Looking back on the history of the race, we see how they have varied in correspondence with social customs; and presumably our descendants, looking back upon us after some thousands of years, will discern a similar correlation in our present moral codes. Idealism does not proceed by evading these facts. On the contrary, it objects that naturalism has inconsistently broken off its argument in mid-career. When naturalism distinguishes between logical and all other values, assigning absoluteness to the one and denying it to the others, by what right does it do so? If man is the most highly organized form of existence known to us, and therefore the most contingently conditioned, and there- fore also, as naturalism is constrained to argue, the most pro- vincial, how comes it that he can pass judgments that have universal validity? These judgments depend upon the working of a nervous system that is even more elaborately organized than the eye and the ear. They are expressed in a grammar and through concepts all of which are as complexly conditioned in their historical development as are any of the products of the fine arts. If naturalism replies that at least in its concepts science</page><page sequence="22">22 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIX. contrives to abstract from the limiting, conditions peculiar to human thought, the sufficient answer is that, by its own teaching, conception is conditioned by imagination, that imagination is conditioned by perception, and that power of perception is as relative to the constitution of our sense-organs as are any of the aesthetic qualities. And lastly, there is no such thing in human experience as thought apart from language, any more than according to naturalism there can be thinking apart from the brain. If all this does not disqualify thought from possessing independent validity; if man, the most complexly conditioned of known existences, can none the less so far rise above his individual and planetary limitations as to apprehend the universal, a more subtle treatment of the allied problems is surely demanded. That the moral duties imposed by the honor code of the blood- feud are no longer recognized as binding, and would indeed under present social conditions be actively anti-moral, does not prove that these primitive distinctions have no wider or deeper moral significance than that discerned by those who practised them. Meaning is always relatively independent of its embodi- ments. This is why the same meaning can in some degree, however small, be translated from one art into another, from one language into another. The essential characteristic of meaning is that it carries the mind beyond what is immediately appre- hended, disclosing to it something more than is actually pre- sented. Beauty is not in sounds, nor in form and coloring, taken by themselves; it exists only in and for the mind in its reaction to them. Similarly, morality does not consist in this or that act, but in the disposition and the will that find through such acts a mode of expression. And this is equally true of intellectual apprehension. The materials employed are certain sensations and certain articulate sounds, and the psychological mechanism through which they are filled out from past experience. But the outcome, the apprehension of meaning, while made pos- sible by these materials, is distinct from them; it is an act of the mind, and only so is able to transcend subjective contingencies and to reach to the independently real. Naturalism, that is to say, cannot explain the fact of know-</page><page sequence="23">No. i.] THE PRESENT SITUATION IN PHILOSOPHY. 23 ledge and the employment of logical criteria, save by allowing to the mind a power of transcending its subjective limitations, and of apprehending from subjectively conditioned data, by means of subjective processes, an objective meaning. No more is required in order to render intelligible the objective claims of aesthetics and morals. As possessing some kind of absoluteness, they are neither more nor less mysterious than the fact of knowledge. They reveal human existence as being of the same ambiguous texture-rooted in contingency, acting only through the chan- nels provided by its natural setting, and while transmuting itself to ever higher forms, yet still to the end remaining a creaturely existence that finds its salvation not in independence of its animal conditions but in using them as the instruments for the expression of desires and meanings that genuinely transcend them. For, from the point of view of idealism, once it has been accepted, the chief mystery is not how the human spirit should be able to rise above its natural conditions, but how these conditions should be so amazingly responsive to the demands made upon them- that in sounds, in rhythm, in pigments, in lines and surfaces, that by such a beggarly bag of tricks as constitutes the stock in trade of the poet and the artist, so great a wealth of spiritual meaning can be conveyed. But it is no more wonderful than that man, a being endowed with some few senses, and incapable of thought save through the conventions of language, should be able to discover in science the secrets of the Universe. A priori arguments, and analogies drawn from the purely physical, cannot decide the issue. It is not to be dealt with in any merely dia- lectical fashion. It must involve a first-hand study of the facts to be accounted for. Bertrand Russell has advocated the limiting of philosophy to the strictly a priori; and others, while allowing it a wider range, would assign aesthetic, ethical, and kindred problems to special sciences. These are views which I cannot now discuss. But in any case, it will probably be agreed that the most important and fruitful of the changes that have taken place in the philosophical disciplines since the eighteenth century has been the growing recognition that logical analysis and dialectic, however indis-</page><page sequence="24">24 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIX. pensable, can play only a subordinate part in the solution of the problems traditionally assigned to philosophy. For instance, in theology it is no longer regarded as possible to demonstrate by dialectical argument the existence of God. It is recognized that such so-called proofs are at best merely outline indications of the various directions in which such demonstration can be sought. It is in the highly specific facts of religious experience in the past and in the present, in their coordination with the other aspects of life, and through study of them in all the detail of their his- torical accompaniments, that the evidence-if adequate theoret- ical evidence there be-is alone to be found. In philosophy, as in all science and in all art, the fundamental maxim of sound workmanship is that we keep our eye upon the object. Many opponents of idealism, to judge from their frequent practice, seem to believe that the more they keep their eyes off the human values, or at least away from the great tra- ditions in which they have found-,expression, the less they will be biased in passing philosophical judgments upon them. They approach them only through the study of our natural and eco- nomic setting, or through analogies derived from the study of animal behavior. Virtually, the result is that they do not study them at all. In effect, though not in intention, they depict them from hearsay and condemn them in absentia. The outcome is not science but pseudo-science, and a violation of all those principles of sound reasoning to which they give their adherence in the fields in which they are more familiarly at home. The more intimate aspects of human existence must be appreciated from the inside; otherwise the distorting preconceptions that are inevitable to an outside spectator will never be detected. Philosophy, it is admitted, must not presume'to compete with the sciences in the fields appropriated by the sciences; but this makes it all the more necessary that it obtain due recognition of those aspects of life for which no sciences have yet been able to to make themselves responsible. And for this reason philosophy is more closely bound up with the historical and humanistic disciplines than with those of the deductive and demonstrative type. As Renan has remarked, the modern philosophical school</page><page sequence="25">No. I.1 THE PRESENT SITUATION IN PHILOSOPHY. 25 should have as its device: "Let no one enter here who is not acquainted with the human spirit." In Plato's time geometry was a new thing, and few had knowledge of it. Nowadays science is in the ascendant, and is even in danger of encroaching on other legitimate interests. If, therefore, objection be made that the argument upon which idealism rests its case is merely general, and lacks the detailed evidence that makes science so irresistible, I should reply that in what I have said thus far the evidence proper has not been considered. As I have suggested, it is to be obtained only through careful and exhaustive study of all that the human spirit has brought into existence, in the arts, in the moral, social, and religious spheres, as well as in science. By these activities it has added, as it were, new dimensions to the non-human world which, according to naturalism, alone previously existed, and by which naturalism has allowed the-main outlines of its phil- osophy to be predetermined. When all is said, it is still, of course, true that philosophy re- mains philosophy. It is a more precarious enterprise than science. The personal factors cannot be eliminated in the same complete degree; and at the present time, as I have tried to show, we are faced by two alternative ways of thinking, neither of which has been able, quite decisively, to displace the other. Allow me, in conclusion, to restate the opposition in a few sen- tences. In the view of a naturalistic philosophy, man is a being whose capacities, even in their highest activities, are intelligible only as exercised exclusively in subordination to the specific requirements of his terrestrial environment. For the student of the humanities, on the other hand, man is adapted, indeed, to his environment, but measures himself against standards for which it cannot account. He is not a piece of nature's mechan- ism, but himself a microcosm, prefiguring in his art, in his moral codes and social institutions, and in religion, the wider reality to which as a finite being he can have no more direct method of approach. His true self-knowledge is made possible by values and standards that constitute his humanity in distinction from the animals; and it is by their absoluteness that they deliver him from the limitations of strictly animal existence.</page><page sequence="26">26 THE PHILOSOPHICAL RE VIEW. Naturalism grants this argument in so far as it applies to our intellectual standards. We attain absoluteness, naturalism declares, in the intellectual domain, but never in other fields. That we attain it in the intellectual domain, and likewise in other fields, is the creed of idealism. And if, as must be ad- mitted, idealism has its own difficulties, they are not, I should say, of the same desperate character as those which naturalism is called upon to face. There is, it appears to me, this difference between naturalism and idealism. The first steps towards naturalism are easy and convincing. Naturalism takes the present results of the positive sciences at what appears to be their face-value, and from them it professes to obtain data sufficient for the establish- ment of a comprehensive philosophy. When, however, this. philosophy is applied in interpretation of the more intimate as- pects of human experience, it becomes ever increasingly unsatis- factory. With idealism, on the other hand, the first steps are the most difficult. Its final conclusions exceed the insight yet yielded by the positive sciences, but do not contradict them; and it may be claimed that they are based upon a more thorough study of those features of our experience which have not yet been subjected to scientific treatment. I did not, however, set out to argue these high matters, but only to present the issues upon which naturalism and idealism are at present divided. Though each of these types of philosophy may be developed in a variety of forms, with subordinate differ- ences, in regard to the main issue they express the two alter- natives between which we are called upon to choose. They are, we may say, the summary and expression of opposing types of civilization; for there is little in human life that will be left- unaffected, according as we make our decision for one or the other..
