Without knowing the ford, don't jump into the water. (Russian proverb) I have to start this article on a somewhat personal note, so that I will not send those readers who have been closely following the Altaic debate for the last ten years into state of shock when they read a little bit further. Although I started my scholarly career as a supporter of the Altaic hy- pothesis, within the last four years I have been gravitating slowly but steadily toward an opposite point of view. This evolution was caused by many factors, so I should name among those only the most important. 1 I wish to express my gratitude to my colleagues Uwe Bläsing (Leiden), Magsar Bayar- saikhan (Ulan-Baator), Stefan Georg (Bonn), Juha Janhunen (Helsinki), Robert Ram- sey (College Park), and Giovanni Stary (Venice) who either read the draft of this paper and provided me with valuable comments, or answered some very important questions. All mistakes and/or shortcomings remain mine. CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="2">72 Alexander Vovin First, an excellent article by Stefan Georg (Georg 1999/2000), presenting a thorough and well-deserved criticism of my publication on the validity of Altaic, which I co-authored with Manaster Ramer and Sidwell (Man- aster, Vovin &amp; Sidwell 1998), was in many respects an eye-opener.2 My first face-to-face meeting with Georg in the fall of 2000 was another ma- jor boost in that direction, and our subsequent meetings and discussions in Germany, Japan, and Turkey were no less fruitful. I am greatly indeb- ted to my friend and colleague Georg for many of the methodological insights presented hereafter as well as my present better understanding of Turkic and Mongolie structure and data that he has patiently discussed with me over the years. Second, I believe that my overall knowledge of Altaic philology has slowly improved over the years, and with that came a better understanding of various linguistic facts and data. Gradually, I came to realize that the Turkic and Mongolie data do not present any evidence for a genetic relationship with Tungusic, Korean, and Japonic. Until recently I felt that Tungusic might be related to Korean and Japonic (Vovin 2003), but, alas, in the late 2002 I realized it was only an illusion. At present, I am skeptical even about the Koreo-Japonic relationship, since even there most of the traditional strong comparisons can be ex- plained, in my opinion, as old loans from Korean into Japonic. The recently published Etymological Dictionary of the Altaic Lan- guages (henceforth: EDAL)3 was extremely helpful by providing me (and, as I believe, to many other colleagues) a full scale demonstration 2 I should add that Doerfer's critical remarks on the same article (Doerfer 1999: 199) are also well justified, and that his article was very influential in formation of my present views on Altaic hypothesis, too. I dedicate this article to his memory. 3 Etymological Dictionary of the Altaic Languages , by Sergei Starostin, Anna Dybo, and Oleg Mudrák with assistance of Ilya Gruntov and Vladimir Glumov, Leiden &amp; Boston: Brill, 2003 consists of three thick volumes. Volume 1 includes the Preface (pp. 7-9), Introduction (divided into five chapters: Chapter 1: The problem of inter- lingual borrowings in Altaic languages (pp. 13-21), Chapter 2: Comparative pho- nology of Altaic languages (pp. 22-135), Chapter 3: Comparative and historical pho- nologies of Altaic subgroups (pp. 136-172), Chapter 4: Elements of a comparative morphology of Altaic languages (pp. 173-229), Chapter 5: Classification of Altaic languages and dating of Proto-Altaic (pp. 230-236), Structure of the dictionary and adopted conventions (pp. 237-240), Selected bibliography and abbreviations of quoted literature (pp. 241-264), Abbreviations of periodical editions (pp. 265-266), Abbreviations of language names (pp. 267-269), Dictionary (A-K) (pp. 271-858). Volume 2 includes Dictionary (L-Z) (pp. 859-1556), and Volume 3 includes indices (pp. 1557-2096). This publication is exorbitantly expensive, with a list price set at US $ 399.00 or EUR 352.00. CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="3">The End of the Altaic Controversy 73 that the Altaic hypothesis has failed, although the main goal of this grandiose publication was just the opposite: to prove to the outside world that the Altaic language family exists and that five language families included into this tentative stock are all genetically related. I really feel indebted to ED AL' s authors for their massive effort to provide such a bulk of non-evidence for Altaic conveniently collected in one place for those of us who humbly disagree with the authors' main premise. This sense of heartfelt gratitude prompted the pages that follow: I really be- lieve that such a significant work should not go unnoticed. The authors announce the success of their enterprise right in the pre- face: "The very fact that it is possible to compile a dictionary of common Altaic heritage appears to be a good proof of the validity of the Altaic theory" (p. 9). This statement is, however, quite problematic, since the existence of the "North Caucasian Etymological Dictionary" (Nikolayev and Starostin 1994) has so far failed to persuade specialists and general linguists alike in the existence and validity of "North Caucasian" (Schul- ze 1997). Given this interesting situation, it seems to me that the best explanation is that the ED AL authors' methodology is often at odds with what is con- sidered standard methodology in mainstream historical linguistics. There- fore, before discussion of any actual data in EDAL it seems only fair to outline the standard methodology and see how the former squares against the latter, spicing the comparison with some examples from EDAL. First, it is only possible to prove a genetic relationship, but it is im- possible to prove a genetic non-relationship. The best a critic of a pro- posed genetic relationship can do is to demonstrate that the data pre- sented in favor of a proposed genetic relationship do not stand a scrutiny of a historical linguist. Therefore, it places the burden of proof on those who propose such a genetic relationship, and not on those who criticize it. Consequently, any proof of a genetic relationship must be very tight. The best way to make it very tight is to prove a suggested genetic relationship on the basis of paradigmatic morphology (if it is present in languages included in a given proposal), and not on the basis of vocabulary, because morphology overall is more stable and more systematic than vocabulary which represents the most unstable part of any language. I want to stress once again that such proof must be based on paradigms that are generally regarded as much less susceptible to borrowing (except in the case of mixed languages) rather than on isolated morphological markers that do CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="4">74 Alexander Vovin not constitute any paradigm, and that are much more prone to borrowing than the paradigms. Unfortunately, the methodology used in EDAL at least partially does not agree with this methodological principle of mainstream comparative linguistics. Thus, EDAL is weighted toward lexical comparisons - that should come as no surprise - after all, EDAL is a dictionary. However, since a description of comparative Altaic morphology is included, one can only guess why it is so sketchy, with no paradigmatic comparisons offered at all. Instead the reader is presented with a list of isolated morphological comparanda, some of which, I dare to say, is the result of incorrect or ad hoc morphological analysis, as the reader will see below. Within the sketch of comparative morphology (Chapter 4) derivational morphology has a lion's share of the chapter (pp. 173-220), while in- flectional morphology takes less than nine pages (pp. 221-229). It is no secret that derivational morphology is borrowed much easier than in- flectional. In addition, all reconstructed derivational morphemes are mon- ophonemic, which makes the possibility of chance resemblances rise dra- matically high. Out of the eight pages and several lines allotted for in- flectional morphology, more than three pages are occupied by numerals and pronouns, which, strictly speaking, belong to lexicon, and not to mor- phology, unless their paradigms are discussed. However, this is not done. Second, the internal and comparative reconstructions within an uncon- troversial genetic grouping must be thoroughly done before attempting any external comparisons. Thus, e.g., internal Tungusic reconstruction and comparative reconstruction based solely on various Tungusic lan- guages and dialects must be done prior to attempting any external com- parisons with, say, Mongolie languages. Under no circumstances can ex- ternal etymologies take any precedence over internal etymologies based on thorough analysis of a language itself. For example, it is fallacious to draw morphemic boundaries in a given language and create a non- existing "morpheme" on the basis that the same "morpheme" can be found in its distant relative, especially when the relationship is not proven. It is even more fallacious to segment the root *alga in the language A as *al-ga and the root *aldu in the language B as *al-du without any in- ternal evidence in A and B for suffixes *-ga and *-du respectively, just because A and B happen to share the common part *al. External comparisons reign supreme in EDAL. Its authors do not pay any attention to internal reconstruction. In a skyrocketing number of cases they also willingly ignore the structure and/or morphology of a CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="5">The End of the Altaic Controversy 75 given language. When quite an obvious case that can be easily explained internally contradicts a proposed external etymology, the former is discarded as being "most probably a folk etymology in the light of external evidence," a typical phrase that is repeated time and again throughout the dictionary like a magical mantra. The only justification for this approach seems to be an urge to create a new "Altaic" etymol- ogy. In many cases a reconstruction of "Proto-X" is based on an attesta- tion in only one language belonging to one of five Altaic groups, or, even worse, on an attestation found in only one dialect or subdialect of a given language. I have grave doubts that a word attested, say, only in one of subdialects of the Northern dialect of the Ewenki language has any Proto- Tungusic provenance, let alone "Altaic." Third, comparative linguistics does not exist in vacuum. One should not forget that every language has a history, and that this history is intimately connected with the cultural and sociopolitical history of the people who speak a given language. Authors of EDAL have no respect for and no need of cultural history of languages they compare. History appears to be sacrificed for the sake of comparison alone. Concrete ex- amples of such an "etymologizing" will be given below, but I wonder how the dating of Proto-Altaic by the 6th millennium B.C.E (p. 236) agrees with reconstruction of so many lexical items typical for agri- cultural and mounted pastoralists' societies? For example, if a linguist wishes to compare a word for "sword" in Old Japanese with another word with a similar meaning in another language, s/he should clearly realize what kind of swords existed in Ancient Japan, what they looked like, and how they were used. Anyone reading EDAL quickly discovers very soon that this is not the case. For example, PA *gàr[à] PA "sharp edge" includes PJ *kàtànà "knife" alongside with other incredible par- allels, such as PMT *gara "bough, stick" (p. 531). It is clear that EDAL' s authors treat OJ katana "sword, knife" as *kata-na with the first part *kata- reflecting their PA "sharp edge" and the second part *-na being one of the numerous "suffixes" unsupported by internal data and invented just for the sole purpose of facilitating the external comparison. However, it helps to know what is the object that was referred in Old Japanese as katana. There are two similar, but not identical kinds of swords in Old Japanese: turugî,4 which refers to a double-edged sword, 4 My transcription of Old Japanese is based on Gerald Mathias's transcription that indicates A series of vowels (Jpn. kô-rui: t [i], ê [e], ô [o]) with a circumflex A over the vowel, and B series of vowels (Jpn. otsu-rui: ï [ï], ë [ay], ö [a]) with a trema " over the CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="6">76 Alexander Vovin and katana which refers to a single bladed one. The etymology of katana is quite transparent: it is kata- "one" and na "blade". Kata- "one" is found in a number of compounds even in modern Japanese, such as kata- miti "one way," kata-asi "one foot," kata-ude "one arm," kata-omoi "unreciprocated love," kata-oya "one parent," kata-gawa "one side", kata-toki "single moment," etc. Both parts of the compound are Korean loanwords: although MK has honah (SSK hana ) "one," pre- 15th centu- ry Korean materials much despised in EDAL (see below) clearly indicate earlier *xata-: EMK xatun (Kyeylim yusa #19), OK HAtAn "one"5 (Kwangumka 6, 8) OJ na "blade" &lt; MK nolh [nArh] "id." Needless to say, a comparative linguist should also have a very clear idea of the natural habitat where a given language is or was spoken (see PA *agà "rain, air" discussed towards the end of this article). Fourth, historical linguistics is intimately connected with philology. It means that overall wordlists and dictionaries are not the source for serious work in historical linguistics. It is fallacious to put several dictionaries on one's desk and just pick and choose data according to one's whim, with- out verifying the reliability of the data through texts that are the most re- liable sources for a historical linguist. This is especially true in the case of languages that are no longer spoken, simply because we do not have the benefit of consulting native speakers of those languages. Philology practically does not exist in EDAL. With the exception of some Turkic texts, and a reference to an outdated edition of the "Secret History of Mongols" (Kozincev 1941), there is no references at all to any Japanese, Ryukyuan, Korean, Mongolie, or Tungusic texts either in the bibliography (pp. 241-266) or in the body of the dictionary. Apparently, none of the texts in the Altaic languages except Turkic were consulted, and the reader will see below the disastrous consequences of such a negli- gent attitude. Instead, we have plenty of references to dictionaries and all sorts of wordlists. Fifth, phonetic correspondences maintained in a given proposal of a genetic relationship must be really recurrent. Having a correspondence vowel. The cases where A/B distinction is not known or neutralized are left unmarked: i, e, o. Transcription of MK and SSK is Yale system of romanization where wo = [o], wu = [u], o = [a], u = [ï], e = [a]. Vowel o = [a] no longer exists in SSK, therefore in SSK o = [o], MK woy, wuy, oy, uy, ey, ay, ye, ya, ywo are combinations of a V with [y], in SSK oy = [we], wuy = [wi], ey, ay = [e] (innovative variety). The conservative variety distinguishes ey = [e] and ay = [e]. 5 In transcription of Old Japanese and Old Korean data capitals are used to render the word or a part of the word that is written semantographically with Chinese characters. CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="7">The End of the Altaic Controversy 77 that has numerous exceptions and/or exhibits many different rules for reflexes of one and the same phoneme really undermines the essence of comparative linguistics. In other words, the possibility of a genetic rela- tionship should be easily demonstrated with a small set of paradigmatic morphology and/or cognate vocabulary that clearly reflect the proposed correspondences. Only in this case a proposed language family will be uncontroversial. The majority of phonetic correspondences presented in the introduc- tion have multiple variants or exceptions. Many of them are limited only to very few examples within the 2,800 etymologies presented, thus they are not recurrent. It is impossible to take a small set of words and demon- strate regularity within that set. Multiple reflexes of the same phoneme in the same environment represent a norm rather than exception. In addi- tion, there are gaps. For example, reliable Turkic etymologies with re- flexes of PA *m- or *ñ- are few and far between. What is even worse it is that proposed phonetic correspondences are frequently violated. Sixth, ideally, the relationship between the languages constituting a given language family should be productive-predictive, using the termi- nology suggested by the late Robert Austerlitz (Austerlitz 1983: 52-53). This means that if given a form in language A, we should be able to pre- dict what the corresponding form will be in language B based on the set of proposed regular phonetic correspondences. In practice this might have certain limitations, like, e.g., in case of Tocharian where all three Indo-European series of stops merged as one, so it would be impossible on a basis of a given Tocharian form with stops to predict a form, let us say, in Greek or Sanskrit. Needless to say, productive-predictive relation- ships do not exist in EDAL. It is impossible, for example to predict a Japonic form on the basis of a Tungusic form, and vice versa, or a Turkic form on the basis of any of those two. Seventh, there is a fair amount of lexical ghosts in EDAL. Under PA *gele "to come, to go" (speakers of PA apparently did not differentiate between "come" and "go" - A.V.) we find PM *gel- "to stroll", based on WM geldüri- and gelgiiri- (p. 538). While the first of these verbs does exist, the second is a ghost, also found in (Starostin 1991: 99), with reference to (Ramstedt 1935: 132). Needless to say, non-existing WM *gelgiiri- is not found in Ramstedt' s dictionary, and after a quite thor- ough search through various sources I think I know where it came from: Cincius provides WM *gelgüri "to stroll" as a parallel to Ewk. gel- "to get on one's way with difficulty" (also included and misglossed in ED- CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="8">78 Alexander Vo vin AL as "to get hardly on one's way" (p. 538)) (TMS I: 178), but this is an obvious typo for WM geldiiri-, as the word *gelgüri- is not attested anywhere else. Now this typo seems to be firmly incorporated as evidence for "Altaic."6 Eighth, the Altaicists of the older generation, such as Ramstedt, Poppe, and Räsänen, could have made honest mistakes in their assumptions or analysis of the languages and texts, but they never tried to sweep the data under the rug. Unfortunately, this is not the case with ED AL' s authors who have attempted, I am sorry to say, a willful misrepresentation of data on more than one occasion. One example will be sufficient to illustrate my point. On p. 1269 one finds PJ *situ "damp place, dampness," al- legedly based on MJ situ and STJ situ as one of the etymologies supporting PA *siaři "earth, sand, marsh." The circulation of PJ *situ as an "Altaic" etymology goes back to another Starostin's paper where it was used to support a quite different "Altaic" etymology: PA *siřo "to leak, to ooze" (Starostin 1997: 337). The author of these lines criticized this etymology before, and I cite verbatim : "Unfortunately for the Altaic 6 While we are "getting hardly on our way", two other notes should be made about this etymology that also demonstrate the methodological foundations of EDAL. First, established regular correspondences within uncontroversial families mean nothing when the need arises for an "Altaic" etymology. Thus, aforementioned PMT *gel- is reconstructed on the basis of Ewk. gel-, cited above, and Orok gilin- "to start moving [TporaTbcH c MecTa]" (left unglossed in EDAL's English gloss, p. 538) with ref- erence to (TMS 1975: 150). However, Ewk. -e- does not correspond to Orok Second, Orok gilin- does not mean "to start moving" in general, but to "take off (about a string/caravan of reindeers attached to a sledge)." This can be easily learned even from existing Orok dictionaries (Ozolinia 2001: 61), (Ikegami 1997: 70). Third, no internal Orok evidence is provided for the suffix -in in EDAL-. However, in spite of the fact that Ikegami does not list this suffix in his article on Orok verb stem- formative suffixes (Ikegami 2001: 73-93), there is a possibility that it is an obsolete suffix, but the news are bad for the "go/come" etymology: there is Orok gilbs "rein- deer that goes attached to the sledge where people are riding" (Ikegami 1997: 70). Thus, Orok gilin- obviously has nothing to do with "coming" or "going," as it is a derivation from a name of a very specific type of domesticated reindeer. Finally, MK ká- "to go" belongs to the accentual class 3 with highly irregular accentuation (Ram- sey 1991: 232), the only reason it is "reconstructed" in EDAL as PK *ká- with high pitch seems to be that in its dictionary form ká-tá (Yu 1964: 18), (Nam 1997: 3) it indeed has high pitch. But reconstructing high pitch even for MK, let alone PK, is to beg the issue. Finally, there is some oblique evidence that it should be reconstructed with a final consonant, but not the *-1, as EDAL suggests without providing any evi- dence, but with *-n. Thus we can safely put at least the Korean and Tungusic parts of the etymology to rest. CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="9">The End of the Altaic Controversy 79 hypothesis, Japanese situ "damp, wet" (attested for the first time in "Tsure-zure gusa (ca. 1331 C. E.» is an apparent Chinese loan: situ is, in fact on-yomi (Sino-Japanese reading) of the character M "damp, wet," with a footnote: "The reading situ is kan'yôon ("costumary Sino-Japan- ese reading"), adopted instead of less frequent syuu &lt; sipu (MC M çip)- There are several cases of replacement of MC final -p by -tu in kan'yôon, e.g. MC a L lip &gt; kan'yôon ritu (instead of less frequent ryuu &lt; ripu), MC (cip &gt; kan'yôon situ (instead of less frequent syuu &lt; sipu), etc." (Vovin 2001: 113)7 A failure to recognize this quite obvious and well- known fact (Vance 1987: 168) by one of the authors who is considered to be a renowned Sinologist can be only explained by a desire to create a new "Altaic" etymology at all costs. Otherwise it is inconceivable why one finds the following note in ED AL after the alleged PJ *situ, obvious- ly addressing the criticism cited above, but without any reference: "The word is usually considered to be an on-reading of the Chinese character M MC šip.s The latter should normally have a reading MJ sifu, mod. shû (which exists), while situ/shitsu, attested in separate usage since Middle Japanese, appears quite irregular phonetically for a Chinese loan. We should rather think of a genuine *situ, misconceived as a Chinese loan" (p. 1269). Since ED AL' s authors do not address other cases of irregular phonetic loans from Chinese that were mentioned above: ritu &lt; MC a l lip "stand" and situ &lt; MC tçip "hold," it is quite obvious that we are dealing here with an intentional misrepresentation of the evidence. The first of these has initial r- that does not occur in native Japanese vocab- ulary, but may be Sino-Japanese ritu is also a genuine PJ *ritu that was misconceived as a Chinese loan? ED AL' s authors definitely should not ignore this possibility, as it will allow them to reconstruct PA *r- on the basis of this "evidence," and consequently to create many more "Al- taic" etymologies. I should add that everything else in this Japanese ety- mology and in the additional note that was cited above is a hoax. Japanese situ is not Middle Japanese, because, as was noted above, it is attested for the first time in a text written around 1331 C. E. - very late by any Japanese standards, and certainly outside of the MJ period, even 7 There are other cases of the same replacement, e.g. kan'yôon zatu &lt; MC H dzap "various." In modern Japanese kan'yôon ziQ &lt; *zitu &lt; MC dzip "ten" also appears instead of kan'on zyuu &lt; MJ zifu in compounds of Chinese origin either as a variant of the latter, or as the only possible reading, e.g. ziQkai T~ fiX "ten commandments," ziQsyukyoogi tSSS "decathlon," ziQpun ~ zyuQpun -ļ- ii "ten minutes." 8 EDAL uses a different transcription system for Middle Chinese. CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="10">80 Alexander Vovin with Late Middle Japanese not extending beyond 1300. Still, one may argue that thirty years is close enough. But there is one serious problem with this attestation, because the word is not written phonetically in the text, it is spelled semantographically with the character M "damp," which can also have native Japanese reading simeri "dampness." When I wrote my first critique of the "Altaic" etymology for Sino-Japanese situ, I did not have at my disposal all relevant manuscripts of the text, so I decided to stay on the conservative side and trust IKJ, which glosses this character in TZG 171 as situ (IKJ 633), thinking that Ôno Susumu and his co-authors have manuscripts at their disposal that have a phonetic spelling. Now that I had a chance to look at photocopies of oldest extant manuscripts, I know that I was overcautious in my approach and that the IKJ reading is completely ad hoc , since we do not have a phonetic spelling. Furthermore, if we really look at the text, we see the following (I provide the transliteration of the Japanese text): KAZE ni atari SIMERI [or: SITU] ni fusite YAMAFI wo SINREI ni utafuru fa oroka naru fito nari to IS YO ni iferu ga gotosi "Like it is said in the medical book: "The one who complains to gods about [his] illness, lying in dampness with the wind blowing over, is a stupid person" (TZG 171). Thus, the phrase where the alleged SITU "dampness" occurs is a citation from a medical book. The medical books in medieval Japan were all written in Chinese, and this citation is nothing but a translation from the first known Chinese medical book, Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing, which was compiled during the Later Han and was very popular in pre-modern Japan. Even if the character in question were to be read as SITU, it proves nothing, because this is simply not the authentic Japanese passage. But here comes another problem: this appears to be the only example where situ is used as a noun with EDAL's alleged meaning "dampness, damp place." There are sim- ply no other examples of situ used as an independent noun with this meaning neither in texts contemporaneous to TZG, nor even in modern Japanese where it occurs only in Sino-Japanese compounds, like sikke "humidity," situdo "[degree of] humidity."9 Thus, PJ *situ "dampness, damp place" turns out to be a complete hoax, consciously concocted by EDAL's authors to advance the Altaic hypothesis, as there is no such word in Japanese. 9 In Early Modern Japanese situ was used as a noun "scabies"; it can be still found in some dictionaries of the modern language, but apparently the word is not recognized any longer by younger speakers of the language. In any case, the first attestation of situ "scabies" is only in the 17th century, and that is too late for MJ. CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="11">The End of the Altaic Controversy 8 1 Ninth, the semantic side of comparisons, especially of those that the ED AL authors propose for the first time is often vague and even stretched beyond any credibility. Certainly, semantics is the most subjective area, but there should be some reasonable limits. Any bird's name can be compared in ED AL to any other bird's name with reconstructed semantic archetype "a kind of a bird". Apparently, as long as a creature could fly and had feathers and a beak, speakers of "Proto- Altaic" could call it " a kind of a bird", but failed to have words for concrete subspecies. The same fate is shared by other species, such as fish, trees, etc. This is a very striking contrast with how things are done in well-established families, like Austronesian, where we have comparatively small but quite reliable lists for common fauna and flora for common subspecies without any attempt to compare a "crab" to a "lobster" or a "clam" and reconstruct Proto- Austronesian "a kind of sea creature with shell". Quite often, it turns out that the poor creatures involved in a process of creating a pan-Altaic etymology have transparent internal etymologies resulting from a met- aphor or a metonymy. One example will be sufficient to demonstrate how ED AL' s authors skillfully manage to bring these creatures to life. Let us take, e.g., PA *pali "a kind of fish" &gt; PMT *palu "a kind of fish (simi- lar to [a - A.V.] bream);" PM *bilayu "carp, a kind of salmon;" PT *bālik "fish;" PJ *pírámái (~miá) "fluke, plaice;" PK *par- "carp" (p. 1076). On a close and not so close inspection one can see that all this is pure nonsense. PJ *pírámái (~miá) &gt; STJ hirame is of course "flounder, flatfish," as plaices do not live in Japanese waters, being a variety of At- lantic "flatfish." More important, though, is the simple fact that Japanese hira-me is a transparent derivation very similar to English flat-fish : it consists of hira "flat" and -me, a non-productive nominalizer, used after stems of quality verbs and adjectives. There is nothing fishy about this word, and no PA origin is even remotely possible. PK *par- is even more skillfully carved out of Korean palkangi (which in reality means "a vari- ety of young carp, found in rivers of the Kyengsang province and the Hankang river" (Hankul hakhoy 1999: 1633)) with a note "the word is attested in MK with -a-, not -ä-, thus Martin's derivation; "a red one"can- not be correct" (p. 1076). The sobering truth is that, of course, Martin's derivation (KED 724) is correct, simply because Martin knows well the history and the structure of Korean, in contrast to the EDAL authors. It remains unclear what the remaining part -kangi in EDAL' s analysis means, for there is certainly no such suffix in Korean, but maybe it means "carp's tail" in the Muscovite dialect of Proto- Altaic. Korean palkangi is CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="12">82 Alexander Vovin not attested in MK, either, as the earliest attestation of this word is from the text of 1824 C. E., promptly indicated in (Yu 1964: 368), the very source where the EDAL authors took it from. Thus, the word is at best Early Modern Korean, and it is well known that long before 1824 C. E. the MK vowel -a- merged with -a- in a first syllable. While suffix -kangi does not exist in Korean, nominalizer -ang and dimunitive -i certainly do exist, therefore Martin's derivation palk-ang-i "a [little] red one" is more than realistic. PMT *palu "a kind of fish (similar to [a - A.V.] bream)" is based exclusively on Ma. falu "fish looking like a bream" (TMS II: 298). Well, Ma. falu is a "black Manchurian bream" (Megalo- brama terminālis), a very localized species with doubtful PA affiliation. PM *bilayu "carp, salmon", I believe, is simply fantasy. Thus, BAMRS does not contain WM bilayu, buluu, buluyu "carp" as cited in EDAL with reference to BAMRS (but without the page ##) (p. 1076). I was only able to find it in BAMRS in the compound buluu cagaan "a freshwater fish from the carp family" (BAMRS 286), with no traditional Mongolian script attached,10 so WM *bilayu has no supporting evidence. The compound buluu cagaan is identical with the same compound found in KH (Luvsandendev 1957: 86). The constituents of the compound are quite clear: buluu means there just "thick end of a marrow bone," "lump on the body, especially on the forehead" (Luvsandendev 1957: 86), (Hangin et al. 1986: 81), and cagaan is "white." As a matter of fact, a colleague from Mongolia informed me that Mongols call this fish buluu due to its plump form (Magsar Bayarsaikhan, personal communi- cation). Thus, buluu has nothing to do with any "fish." That leaves us with PT *bālik "fish," but even in this case there is possibility that it is a deverbal noun (ÉSTIa 1978: 60). Thus, essentially nothing remains of EDAL' s PA *pali "a k[ind] of fish." Any kind of a body part term can be compared in EDAL to any other body part, e.g., "horn" is compared to "gum" (p. 948). Proto-Altaic speakers apparently were bestowed with a unique physiological feature, unknown to any other types of homo sapiens, with horns instead of teeth growing from their gums. There is also a very alarming tendency to add ghost meanings not present in the source, or to "edit" the meaning so 10 There is another Mongolian fish on the same page in BAMRS: WM buluučayai, KH buluucgai zagas "ide," that is also "a kind of fish," but that strangely made its way to EDAL only in the form of BUR buluusxai "ide," that is treated by EDAL authors as a cognate of KH buluu cagan, but apparently not a cognate of WM buluučayai, KH buluucgai zagas "ide." CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="13">The End of the Altaic Controversy 83 that a comparison would look better. Finally, there is a true revelation: "For most languages the basic sources were Russian dictionaries, which means that most meanings had to be translated into English from Russian" (p. 237). So, that is what readers get in EDAL for the semantics of the lexemes: not the original meanings, but the English translations of the Russian translations. One example will suffice: Japanese sukum- is "translated" into English as "to become numb" (Russian "ouene- HeTb") p. 1250). But sukum- has no such semantics: it actually means "to crouch (of human beings), to cower, to shrink (with fear), to draw back." Of course, both Japanese sukum- "to cower, to shrink, to draw back" and sibire- "to become numb" are translated into Russian as "oueneHeTb", but doing it for English achieves two major goals: a) it misleads readers infamiliar with Japanese, and b) it clearly demonstrates that the authors do not know the Japanese language and are doing word- lists linguistics. Tenth, EDAL is full of all kinds of anachronisms. One example will suffice as well. In their reconstruction of PA *nļa "eye" &gt; PMT *ñia-sa "eye", PM *nidü "eye", PT *jâí "tear", PJ *mài(N) "eye", PK *nún "eye" (p. 981)11 the authors stubbornly cling to Starostin's old idea that nasal "eye" attested only in Central Nanai preserves the "archaic" initial nasal (Starostin 1991: 30) in spite of the cogent demonstration by Doerfer that it is in fact an innovation (Doerfer 1995: 252-253). Doer- fer's arguments are quietly passed over, as usual, but to find further "evi- dence" for PMT initial nasal, EDAL' s authors enlist the help of Jur. gia- ci "eye" followed up by the statement: "The Nan. and Jur. forms un- mistakeably point to an initial nasal, lost in other languages in the ex- ceptional position before the diphthong *iä (p. 981). The Jurchen word for "eye" indeed appears in Chinese transcriptions such as 5j* êf (Kiyose 1977: 124) or fift (Kane 1989: 314). The Chinese character "fang" has LMC reading /già:/, so the Altaic hypothesis seems to be vindicated and emerges victorious, but the EDAL authors forget to inform their readers that both of these transcriptions are found in the Jurchen Hua-yi yi-yu which were compiled during the Ming period (1368-1644 C. E.). For this period LMC reading /rjia:/ is simply anach- 1 1 There is a discussion of the whole etymology in (Georg 2003b: 444-445), and 1 have also pointed out elsewhere that the Japanese form cannot be compared with other "Altaic" forms (Vovin 2001: 107-108). I will deal here only with Tungusic, but the other parts of the "etymology" are no less spurious, as can be gathered from (Doerfer 1995: 252-253) and these two publications. CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="14">84 Alexander Vovin ronistic, and one has to use the EM reading /ya/ for the charcter "fang" (Kiyose 1977: 34-38). It is quite obvious that the character 3? "fang" transcribed Jur. /ya/ and not Jur. /rjia/, because all one has to do is just to browse through Jurchen Hua-yi yi-yu and see that other Jurchen words with initial syllable /ya/ are also transcribed with this character: y ali (5p ý] ) "meat" (Kane 1989: 310), yadahun "poor" H" #£) (Kane 1989: 269), yafa "garden" (3f ft) (Kane 1989: 176). 12 Thus, Jurchen offers no evidence for any initial nasals in PMT. Quite on the contrary, it offers evidence against it, confirming that the PMT form is just *iä "eye." Incidentally, Jur. yali if ýj "meat" appears as such and not as giali in another ED AL entry on p. 985. If the ED AL authors possess some esoteric knowledge that allow them to treat the same Chinese tran- scription in different ways, it would be extremely helpful if they could share it with the rest of us. Finally, another perennial problem is the EDAL authors' refusal to recognize the reality that some of the Altaic "cognates" are just loan- words. Chapter 1 on interlingual borrowings in Altaic languages treats only Turco-Mongolian contacts and Mongolo-Tungusic contacts. About other contacts we learn from EDAL: "There had also been some contacts between Tungus and Korean, Korean and Mongolian, Korean and Japanese - but they are relatively insignificant in comparison with very intense Turko-Mongolian and Mongolo-Tungus contacts" (p. 13). But this is simply not true. Korean-Japanese contacts have been very intensive since times immemorial until the 9th century despite the fact that a lot of cold water separates the Korean peninsula from the Japanese islands. The same is true about Korean-Tungusic: one should not forget that the whole Korean Northeast used to be Tungusic territory once. Even Korean- Mongolian contacts were not insignificant: Mongolian garrisons were sta- tioned in Korea throughout the Yuan period (1268-1368 C. E.), reaching as far as Ceycwuto island. There was also a considerable intermarriage within the nobility. Mongolian loanwords are found in Korean in sig- nificant numbers, and the study of those (Lee 1964) is cited in the bib- liography, but is not taken into consideration. Apparently, EDAL' s au- thors believe that any given lexical similarity between Korean and Tung- 1 2 The character ii~ is used almost exclusively to transcribe Jur. /ya/ in the Vocabulary of the Bureau of Interpreters (Kane 1989: 128).

It is the only sign transcribing Jur. /ya/ in the Vocabulary of the Bureau of Translators (Kiyose 1977: 66). CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="15">The End of the Altaic Controversy 85 usic, Korean and Mongolian, and Korean and Japanese are due to genetic inheritance and not to contacts. Therefore, I must conclude that the approach adopted in EDAL carries all the hallmarks of Omnicomparativismus as defined by (Doerfer 1973, 1995, 1999). Before I proceed to the examples of the outlined above fallacies illustrated by etymologies from EDAL, I have to add that the authors of EDAL often make pronouncements and statements with a voice of authority that are outdated or mistaken. Quite frequently they also present a one-sided judgment not supported by any argumentation on an issue that is known to have a history of a heated debate in the past and for which no universally accepted solution is known. Sometimes they just ignore what their opponents have been repeatedly saying. Overall, their knowledge of the current state of the art in the field and/or of the most pertinent sources is sadly lacking. Thus, Dybo in a sketch of Turkic comparative and historical phonol- ogy makes no reference to works by Doerfer (1969, 1971) that represent a thorough refutation of Illich-Svitych's (1963, 1965) proposal regard- ing the reconstruction of voiced intial *d- and *g- for Proto-Turkic (p. 137). As Doerfer pointed out, the initial voiced d- and g- in Oghuz languages cannot be old, because they are found in recent loanwords from Persian that have original voiceless initial consonants, e.g. Persian tõbra "bag" (&lt; Indo-Aryan töbrä) &gt; Tur. dorbacik', Persian taģār "ves- sel" &gt; Tur. daģarcik (Doerfer 1971: 276). Starostin also attempted to support Illich-Svitych's reconstruction solely on the basis of Oghuz data (Starostin 1991: 6-10), again without any attempt to answer Doerfer's counterarguments. Until the authors of EDAL manage to disprove Doer- fer' s argument, I, like most Turcologists nowadays, will side with Doerfer and reconstruct only voiceless *t- and *k- for PT. In the section on Altaic numerals, EDAL cites Old Bulg[har] tvi-rem "second" (p. 223). The word tvirem is attested in the famous "List of Danube Bulghar Princes," but the problem is that we simply do not know what it means, as there are many interpretations of the Bulghar words on this list, and most of them are controversial. Maybe EDAL' s authors managed to achieve a major breakthrough in deciphering this list, but without revealing to the rest of the scholarly world the results of their study with all pertinent ar- gumentation, it makes assigning to this word the meaning "second" just on the basis of MM jirin "two (fem.)" and PMT *juwe "two" (let alone CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="16">86 Alexander Vovin segmenting tvirem as tvi-rem ) look like elementary cheating.13 In- cidentally, tvirem occurs in the List of Princes together with the preceding word dilom in the phrase AVfc EMB.AHAO^TBHpertvzi "his years dilom tvirem " (PL 1: 11). Contrary to tvirem, dilom is likely to be the least controversial word on the list, as most scholars agree that it means "snake" (CT yïlan). If it is true, then tvirem can be anything but a numeral, because in Turkic numerals are found in preposition to nouns they modify, and not vice versa, e.g. OT iič körüg kiši ķelti "three spies came" (Toñ 33). Inci- dentally, the word dilom "snake" may pose another significant problem to ED AL' s reconstruction of PT *d- and *g- on the basis of Oghuz evidence, since it demonstrates alongside with early Turkic loanwords in Mongolie that CT y- &lt; *d-, see, e.g. (Caferoģlu 1984: 91). Under this scenario, one is faced with two *d- in PT, which is, of course, impossible. Mudrak's statement in the comparative sketch of Mongolie phonol- ogy that "all modern Mongolian languages can be sufficiently well derived from the attested Middle Mongolian language" (p. 149) is an oversimplification, cf. (Janhunen 2003: 1). For example, the reconstruc- tion of PM 'laryngeal' intervocalic *x cannot be based on MM, as MM only occasionally presents evidence for it (Janhunen 2003: 7). I am puzzled by Mudrak's reading of MM initial x- before back vowels in MNT and HY as [q-] (pp. 151, 154). It is true that some syllabic signs 1 3 The same etymology is found in the body of the dictionary: PT *TVbVr "second" &gt; OT Bulg. tvirem (this time without morphological boundary - A.V.), Chuv. fetor, tebarew, with the note "Chuv. -b- is secondary, on analogy with pawrem "first" (p. 1374). But Chuv. te bar is not an ordinal numeral "second," it means "other, fol- lowing, different" (Skvortsov 1985: 466). Ashmarin translates Chuv. fetor in Rus- sian as "zipyroH ibtopoh), BTopoň h3 aßyx" ("other (second)", "second out of two") (Ashmarin 1937.13: 297-299), but the duty of a linguist is not to pick mechanically a headword in a dictionary entry, but to look at its usage. Thus, its usage tells us that Chuv. tetor actually means "following" or "other", not just plain "second", e.g. Chuv. te bar jīšši means "another kind," not " second kind," etc. Chuv. tebarew is defined only as "different" (Ashmarin 1937.13: 300). Chuv. pawrem is either a ghost, or the authors' deliberate invention, as "first" in Chuvash is represented by para? (Ashmarin 1936.10: 219), paramas (Ashmarin 1936.10: 219), or, most frequently, parramaš (Ashmarin 1936.10: 235), (Skvorcov 1985: 291), with -maš being a regular suffix or ordinal numerals (Andreev et al. 1957: 114), and -w- that could influence Chuv. -b- (which is, of course, just intervocalically voiced -p ) in tebar "by analogy" is found nowhere. Although the authors do not make any reference to it, the idea to treat tvirem as a numeral can be traced to Pritsak who considers it to mean "ninth" (Pritsak 1955: 34). Pritsak's monograph is included in EDAL's bibliography, but is not referred to in connection to tvi-rem/tvirem. See also Benzing's critical notes on Pritsak's proposal (Benzing 1959: 688).

In addition, only syllabic signs with [x-] are used in the un- ambiguous cases, like for the syllable [xa], when the corresponding sign + "n was not used to write words with front vocalism. All this, along- side with the presence of variation itself suggests that in the MM language of MNT and HY initial q- &gt; x-. Finally, a number of points where Mudrak's PM reconstruction is different from the conventional wisdom are not explained at all, and/or are not supported by any actual examples, such as, e.g., reconstruction of PM *w (p. 151-152). Dybo and Starostin start the sketch of comparative and historical pho- nology of Manchu-Tungusic with the following statement: "While deal- ing with the MT protoforms, we have basically adopted the classical re- construction of V. Cincius14 (Cincius 1949) rather than its somewhat reduced version in Benzing 1955; some modifications were also intro- duced in H^jihm-Cbhtwm 1965, in AIUlHllfl (Starostin 1991 - A.V.) and ZJbi6o 1990" (p. 156). Therefore, Dybo and Starostin either ignore (or are unaware of) all the research that was done on the reconstruction of PTM between Cincius' s seminal monograph and their own publications. The list is too long to be enumerated here, but (Doerfer 1978) and (Ike- gami 1989) are two outstanding publications that cannot be ignored because their impact on comparative Tungusic was very significant. In the first of these publications Doerfer cogently demonstrated that an addi- tional vowel *ö has to be reconstructed in PMT (Doerfer 1978), and this reconstruction creates havoc in some of ED AL' s vowel "correspon- dences." Ikegami's updated reconstruction of many PMT medial conso- nantal clusters was extremely important contribution (Ikegami 1989: 1074-1077). There are many other problems, such as a very peculiar and poorly justified treatment of PMT vocalism, based on (Starostin 1991: 21-23); an outdated description of Tungusic vowel harmony as "back" and "front," etc. Readers of the Central Asiatic Journal will see for themselves many other fundamental flaws in the sketches of comparative phonologies of Turkic, Mongolie, and Tungusic, so I better concentrate on presentation of Korean and Japanese as issues that may be less famil- iar. In a sketch of Korean comparative and historical phonology Starostin provides his readers with the expert statement that "Korean is one Ian- 14 I have changed ED AL' s spelling "Tsintsius" to "Cincius," which is commonly used in the West. CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="18">88 Alexander Vovin guage with a set of very close dialects" (p. 163). Apparently, Starostin has never consulted the standard Korean dialect dictionary (Choy 1978) or a monograph on Korean dialectology, such as (Choy 1991), since neither appear in ED AL' s bibliography. Many Korean dialects are close to Standard Seoul Korean (further: SSK), but at the same time there are two very divergent dialects: the Ceycwuto dialect and Yukchin dialect in the Hamkyeng province. These two dialects are so different from SSK and from each other, that they should be called separate languages rather than dialects. Needless to say, both dialects preserve certain features that are crucial for reconstruction of Korean, and even in the close enough dialects, such as, e.g., Kyengsang dialect, there are some historically cru- cial features that have disappeared altogether from SSK. There are tons of published materials available on the Ceycwuto dialect, e.g. (Hyen et al. 1995), (Pak 1988), (Kim et al. 1995), etc., and data on the Yukchin dialect are also available (King 1991), (Kwak 1994); although they are much more limited. However, all these materials escaped Starostin' s attention. Starostin goes on: "The earliest attestations (the Kirim (sic! - A.V.) wordlist) are from around the 10th century, but the wordlist is short and Chinese transcriptions seem to be applied unsystematically, so that proper phonetic interpretation is difficult (and perhaps impossible)" (p. 163). Here we encounter a strange and unexpected disdain for a precious wordlist alongside with numerous problems among which the misspelling of the name Kyeylim as Kirim and its misdating (the Kyeylim yusa text where the vocabulary is found is actually from 1 103 C.E.) are the most benign. The main problem is that there are fourteen Silla period hyangka texts that date mostly from 7th - 8th centuries with the earliest two texts dated by between 579 and 632 C.E. There are also eleven hyangka preserved in the biography of the Buddhist priest Kyunye (1075 C. E.), one more hyangka from 11th or 12th century, and quite a significant number of texts written in the kwukyel script from the Korye period (918- 1391 C.E.). Apparently Starostin is unaware of the existence of these texts (although they are discussed in any introduction to the history of the Korean language). Certainly, most of these materials are worthless for wordlists linguistics, since the roots are written semantographically, but the information they contain on the earlier history of Korean phonology and morphology is quite revealing. There are also other pre-mid-15th century sources, such as the Sino-Korean vocabulary "Cosen kwan yeke" (1400+ C.E.) and some other more fragmentary sources that were not utilized. Getting back to the poorly misspelled and misdated Kyeylim CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="19">The End of the Altaic Controversy 89 yusa vocabulary, I must note that it is neither short with 355 entries (al- most all of them representing Starostin's favorite basic vocabulary), nor is its Chinese transcription unsystematic. There are several studies of Kyey- lim yusa vocabulary, and among those (Kang 1991) and (Sasse 1976) are the best in my opinion. None of these are found in the bibliography, so it might have remained unclear on what Starostin's expert opinion is based, but I suspect that the reason for rejection of the Kyeylim data is very simple: it reveals certain facts in the history of the Korean language that destroy important "Altaic" etymologies. For example, it becomes clear on the basis of EMK mati "head" (Kyeylim #161) that MK mali [mari] "id." cannot be compared with Turkic baš "id.", because MK -r- in this word resulted from a lenition -t- &gt; -r-, and PK *-t- does not correspond to Turkic -Í-; see for details (Vovin 2000: 143-44). Slightly below we receive a confession: "The phonology of Middle Korean is basically used as "Proto-Korean" in this dictionary, with some additional reconstruction based on morphophonemics: the alternations -p-/-w- (in fact -p-/-ß - A.V.) and -t-/-r- in verbal stems indicate the existence of special intervocalic stops *-b- and *-d- in Proto-Korean" ... "we accept here the basic reconstruction proposed in Ramsey 1986, rather than poorly grounded theory of intervocalic voicing [not just intervocalic voicing, but lenition - A.V.] *-VCV- &gt; *-VZV- put forward in Martin 1996" (pp. 163-164). The reader should be aware that in fact "poorly grounded theory" is the one that is currently accepted by a majority of Korean historical linguists both in Korea and abroad, and that it was not invented by Martin. However, in his seminal 1996 book, Martin provided inescapable evidence for the lenition theory which is now swept away by Starostin in one phrase, and, as always, without any argumenta- tion. But the main point here, of course, is the fact that the reader is get- ting asterisked MK forms as "Proto-Korean". Unfortunately, MK is not Proto-Korean, with crucial evidence coming from internal reconstruction of MK, OK, and the dialect data, as the reader will see below. Finally, con- trary to Starostin's unfounded opinion (p. 165), PK was a language with- out vowel harmony; see (Martin 2000) for details. A sketch of Japanese comparative and historical phonology, also written by Starostin in EDAL, is also full of sweeping and misleading statements. Any serious Japanese historical linguist will just marvel at the following: "Japanese, like Korean is a single language. However, it is at- tested considerably earlier (major literary monuments already since 8th century), and has a much larger dialectal diversity than Korean.

However, some phonetic features of the Ryukyu dialects - such as preservation of labial *p-, *b- and dental *d - may be actually archaic and preserve the situation preceding that of Old Japanese" (p. 166). Contrary to this statement, Japanese15 (or better Japonic) is not a single language, but a portmanteau family, consisting of two branches: Japanese proper and Ryukyuan, which is not a "dialect" but a sister language of Japanese (more precisely, there are probably several Ryukyuan lan- guages). The following example representing a phrase in Okinawan Ryu- kyuan (Shuri dialect) and its STJ equivalent provides a good illustration of the magnitude of existing differences: SR: ?iyugumui-wutee íashidee nar-aN di-nu kutoo waka-ibii-shi-ga ?u- gushiku-Nkai ?Nji ?ashidee na-ibir-aN naa Dragon Pond(p.n.)-LOC play/SUB/TOP become-NEG DV/ATTR-GEN matter/TOP understand-POL-NML CONJ PREF-castle-DAT go/SUB play/SUB/TOP become-POL-NEG PART STJ: ryuutanti-de asonzya ik-e-na-i koto wa wakar-imas-u ga o-siro-ni itte asob-u no mo ik-e-mase-n ka Dragon Pond(p.n.)-LOC play/SUB/TOP go-POT-NEG-ATTR matter TOP understand-POL-FIN CONJ PREF-castle-DAT go/SUB play-ATTR NML PART go-POT -POL-NEG PT "[We] understand that we cannot play at the Dragon pond, but can [we] go to the castle and play [there]?"

Starostin managed to report an important discovery in the passage quoted above: namely, that OJ is the Latin of Japonic since all modern varieties of Japonic including Ryukyuan can be derived from OJ. If this were true, Starostin would certainly deserve the Order of the Rising Sun from the Japanese government for his outstanding contribution to Japan- ese historical linguistics. Unfortunately, it is not, since the Ryukyuan lan- guages preserved certain features not found in OJ and have much to offer to the reconstruction of PJ. One example will suffice. It has been already pointed out by Hattori Shirô more than twenty years ago that many Ryu- kyuan dialects preserve PJ *e and *o that have been raised to *i and *u, merging with original *i and *u in other Ryukyuan dialects and in most of the Japanese dialects (Hattori 1978-79), with the exception of EOJ and the Hachijõ dialect that also preserve the distinction at least partially (Hôjô 1966)17 The evidence from the phonology and morphophonology of Ryukyuan (Serafim 1985) as well as from pre-Old Japanese sources (Mi- yake 2003) for the PJ *e and *o continues to increase. The consequences of this negligence in ED AL are rather dramatic: PJ does not have four vowels as alleged by Starostin (p. 169), but six: *a, *u, *o, *i, *e, *3, and that, as the reader will see below, is going to influence correspon- dences and, therefore, the validity of suggested "Altaic" etymologies. On the other hand, the "archaic" features of Ryukyuan allegedly not surviving in OJ, according to Starostin, are either present in OJ, or controversial at best. Thus, OJ has /p/ corresponding to later MJ F w-/- 0- and STJ h 0-/-w- as convincingly demonstrated by (Miyake 1999: 306-400) on the basis of scrupulous analysis of the OJ script.

As the reader might have guessed, I do not see any real progress in EDAL as compared to previous Altaic scholarship. In a sense, I think that it takes Altaic linguistics right back into the 17th century, because the version of "comparative method" used in EDAL has nothing in common with tra- ditional Comparative Method, and is essentially prescientific (Doerfer 1995: 261). Among the 2,800 etymologies presented in the book, the majority represent just comparanda generated by the faulty methodology described above, and the rest are mostly etymologies that existed before EDAL that can be explained away as mutual borrowings. Of course, it is impossible to invalidate all 2,800 etymologies in one review article: it would be necessary to write a treatise at least five times longer than EDAL itself, which would present all criticism with supporting textual data and references to relevant literature. A reviewer cannot just pick, let us say, any 20 etymologies and criticize them, because then the EDAL authors will have the right to say: "OK, the reviewer selected only weak ety- mologies but we still have 2, 780 remaining." The only way of demon- strating that EDAL does not confirm to the rules of modern comparative linguistics and actually represents a disguised case of mass comparison à la Greenberg, is to follow some kind of objective criteria. The objective criteria I am going to use are the following: 1)1 will only use those ety- mologies that have reflexes in all five "Altaic" branches, since those ety- mologies provide much stronger support to the Altaic theory than those that are attested only in two or three branches; 2) all the etymologies will include one and the same correspondence; in this case PA non-initial *-í- &gt; PMT *-1-, PM *-1-, PT *-í-, PK *-r-, PJ *-s- (lambdaism) that is sup- posed to be one of the pillars of the Altaic hypothesis.

Thus, there are altogether 8 etymologies among 76 that are: PA *dàíà, *ííi, *k'ìla, *p'eío, *sjoíe, *slía, *tļoli, *zjoía (pp. 65-66), which constitutes 10.52% of the total 76, but being represented in all 5 branches they objectively represent the best proof. Below I will discuss these 8 etymologies one by one. (1) PA *dàíà, "to close, hide" &gt; PMT *dal(i)-, PM *dal-, PT *jaí-, PJ *dàsìrè, PK *tyél (p. 462). PMT *dal(i)- "to close" is based on data found in (TMS I: 192), and is almost valid, except for the fact that final N which stands in the way of Altaic etymology is supported by all languages, including Ewk. which happens to have competing forms dal- and dali-. There is no internal Tungusic evidence for analyzing this /i/ as a suffix, and Ewk. form dal-, since it occurs only in one language is more successfully explained as an apocope. Moreover, it is well known that Northern Tungusic languages lose N and /u/ in the non-first syllables. This has been demonstrated for nominal stems and roots as well as for inflectional and derivational verbal and nominal suffixes (Cincius 1949: 125-126, 128-129), however verbal stems also undergo this apocope, e.g. Ewk. adii, Orok aduli "net", Ewk. āk-, Orok aki- "to moor." Although the correspondence i : ia that we have in this word: Ewk. dali-, Ul. dali-, Nan. dalia-, Ma. dali- (TMS I: 192), is not equivalent to the correspondence Ewk. -0 : Southern Tung- usic -i, -u, and it is not completely clear, it occurs in other words, e.g. Ewk. gori-, Nan. goria- "to go crazy" (TMS I: 161), Ul. dali(n), Nan. dalia "bag" (TMS I: 194), etc., and cannot reflect just zero sound. Therefore, the reconstruction should just be *dali- or *dalia- without any parentheses around N, used solely for the convenience of the external comparison. PM *dal- is a result of an ad hoc segmentation of PM *dalda "hid- den, secret", amply attested in various Mongolie languages. There is no internal evidence for adjectivizing suffix *-da- in Mongolie. 19 The count reveals altogether 77 etymologies, but PA *kjule on this list does not appear in the dictionary itself. It is necessary to note also that searching the EDAL by "Altaic" protoforms is not an easy task: the alphabetic order is frequently not con- sistent, especially when it comes to vowels having multiple diacritics. CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="24">94 Alexander Vovin PT *jal- "to close, to hide" does not present any problems, except that it does not mean "to close": the sources that the ED AL team cites for this reconstruction do not indicate the meaning "to close" in any of the languages (VEWT 192) (ÉSTIalV: 160-161). The semantic gap bet- ween "to close" and "to hide" is not impossible to overcome, but it ap- pears that "to close" is added by ED AL' s authors just to make the com- parison look better, while it is the duty of any researcher to cite data honestly as is. Also, in my opinion (as well as in opinion of majority of Turcologists) the reconstruction should be *yas, but the whole *-š- vs. *-1- debate has such a long history that I am not going to address it again here. PJ *dàsìrà "shrine, enclosure for worship of deities" is based on OJ yasirö, etc. has multiple problems, starting with faulty nature of evidence for the reconstruction of initial *d- that has been already discussed above. The word is not attested in Ryukyuan, and that together with the fact that the word is three syllables long (which points to a compound) casts serious doubt on its "Altaic" antiquity. There is a traditional ety- mology for OJ yasirö, taking it to be a compound of ya "house, dwel- ling" + sirö "substitute," since deities in Shintô tradition are considered to come to dwell to shrines. However, this is likely to be a later interpreta- tion, since the earliest textual evidence indicates two important things: a) that OJ yasirö refers to sacred place or ground itself where a deity is venerated, and not to the building, and b) that yasirö can mean "deity" as well (JDB 760). The first point is clear on the basis of MÎWA-nô YASIRÖ20 N-Ö YAMA "mountain that is the sacred place of Miwa" (MYS VIII: 1517), and is supported by the fact that there are many yasirö in Japan that are represented by natural objects, such as mountains, trees, and rocks.21 No enclosures, buildings or hiding are involved. 20 In this poem yasirö is spelled semantographically with the character $¡¡ "veneration, celebration," that some of modern commentators of the "Man'yöshü" read as papuri "Shintô priest" (Takagi et al. 1959: 311-312), (Nakanishi 1984: 611) which does not make any sense in the given context. There are other readings as well, e.g. Edo period scholar Kamochi Masazumi reads this as ipapî "veneration, celebration" in his com- mentary on the "Man'yöshü" completed by 1857 (Kamochi 1912.4: 4). I prefer to fol- low the reading of the great "Man'yöshü" scholar, Omodaka Hisataka, who gives a de- tailed argumentation of his reading (Omodaka 1982.8: 148-49), that is also followed by (Kojima et al. 1974: 329-330), (Kojima et al. 1984: 219), and (Satake et al. 2000: 264). 21 A good example is the Miwa shrine near the city of Sakurai (mentioned in MYS VIII: 1517), that is considered to be one of the oldest in Japan, if not the oldest, and where the main shrine is the mountain Miwa itself. CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="25">The End of the Altaic Controversy 95 PK *tyél "temple" is an asterisked MK tyél, and I agree with EDAL that it should be reconstructed with HIGH pitch which is supported by post- 1458 MK texts as well as by accent patterns in modern dialects. However, the earliest attestation of this word appears with LOW pitch in Haylyey (1446 C. E.), and this at least should have been mentioned.22 This is, however, less important than the fact that MK tyél is not any kind of "temple," as it can only mean "Buddhist temple." I have great doubts that speakers of PA have been converted to Buddhism about 5,000 years before Shakya-muni's birth. Indeed, if we look back at the MK texts, we will see that MK tyél "Buddhist temple" is used as a translation equivalent (and most MK texts are translations of sutras texts written in Chinese) of not only character "Buddhist temple", but also of the character $J "[property of a] Buddhist temple", that is a transcriptional equivalent of Sanskrit ksetra "property, field" &gt; "Buddhst temple." It is quite apparent that EMC reading /tghe:t/ of $J is the source of MK tyél, and this etymology is universally accepted in the field of Korean his- torical linguistics (Kim Minswu 1997: 907). Even if one prefers to ignore these facts, MK /ye/ (EDAL' s ja) does not correspond to PMT, PM, PT, and PJ *a: one should expect either *a or *9 in MK, if the charts of vow- el correspondences on pp. 92-93 are to be trusted. Thus, only PMT *dali[a]- "to close" and PT *jaí- "to hide" remain after detailed scrutiny, but the match is not perfect either phonetically or semantically. (2) PA *ííi, "work, craft" &gt; PMT *(x)ilga-; PM *üyile; PT *īlč; PJ *isa-b9-; *ísá-m-; PK *īr (p. 585). PMT *(x)ilga- "diligent, brave, handsome, crafty, to develop, to be- come firm" is based on three isolated Tungusic words: Ewk. ilga-n "dodgy, brave, active, diligent," and "body-build;" Ew. ilgArAlbA- "to grow, to develop, to become strong;" and Ma. ildamu/e "elegant, refined, agile, quick-witted" that authors of TMS who certainly had good know- ledge of these languages placed in three different entries (TMS I: 307) and for good reason. The root of the Ewenki word is just ilga-, as dem- onstrated by the adverb ilga-t found on the same page. But here the seg- mentation process comes to a halt: there is no Ewk. suffix *-ga- that would allow us to see Ewk. ilga- as *il-ga-. Ew. ilgArAlbA- can be seg- mented as ilgArA-lbA-, with suffix -lb a- denoting acquisition of a quality 22 On the same page Haylyey also marks the accent of MK sywò "cow" as LOW, although it also should be sywó HIGH as in MK tyél. Thus, we have philological evidence that Haylyey notation of accents is not reliable. CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="26">96 Alexander Vovin in derived verbal stems (Novikova 1980: 30). There is a suffix -r'- in Ewen, but it is used to derive verbs from nouns that denote liquid or dry substances (Novikova 1980: 19), therefore it is not applicable here, and the process of segmentation stops at UgArA-lbA-. Ma. ildamu "elegant, refined, agile, quick-witted" apparently includes an obsolete suffix *-mu, which is not mentioned in Manchu grammars, but can be established due to the existence of the verb ilda- "be quick-witted, be agile, be bright." The latter form cannot be segmented any further, though, since the root"*il- that is badly needed for this etymology to survive simply does not exist in the language and even contradicts the rules of Manchu phonotactics. Thus, Ewk. ilga- and Ew. UgArA-lbA- do not represent the same etymon, and neither of them has any connection with Ma. ildamu. This is further strengthened by the fact that all three happen to have different semantics, if one reads the original articles in (TMS I: 307) and not its "remake" in EDAL. Thus, there is no PMT etymology here, and no chance to compare it with anything "Altaic." PM *üyile "deed, action, work" is reconstructed correctly,23 but how PM *üyi- can correspond to just *i- in other four "Altaic" languages remains a mystery, since according to p. 92 and pp. 106-108 where the reflexes of PA *i are presented in a chart and discussed in detail we should expect PM *i or *e here. Thus, PM "cognate" contradicts au- thors' own system of correspondences and should be discarded. PT *īlč "work, deed" is a questionable reconstruction, because there are other solutions to the correspondence of CT -š to Chuvash -ç besides reconstructing it as *-íč that follows (VEWT 64) and (Tekin 1988: 110), such as (Doerfer 1971: 294). But even if one agrees with it, PT *ííč is going to be a kiss of death to further Altaic comparisons, because it again contains the element *č that cannot be explained away as a suffix in Turkic. Thus, we have to deal with *īlč as a root, and as such it is in- compatible phonetically with other suggested cognates. PJ *isa-ba-, *ísá-m- "craftsman, diligent person; to be brave" recon- structed in EDAL on the basis of OJ and MJ isawo "craftsman, diligent person" and isam- "to be brave" is indeed an entry created by a skillful craftsman. When I see this and many other similar cases I really start to wonder whether EDAL' s authors can read modern Japanese in their fa- 23 But some of the data cited are not correct. Thus, e.g., MM ueyile attested in MNT is misleading, cf. uiyile (Haenisch 1939: 161), ujyile (Ozawa 1989: 365), iiyile (de Rachewiltz 1972: 336), correctly representing Chinese transcription g /ff ?!] (EM ui-yi-lié). CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="27">The End of the Altaic Controversy 97 vorite dictionaries, let alone the OJ texts. OJ isawo is defined in modern Japanese as isamasii otoko "brave man" and kiryoku no aru otoko "vig- orous man" (JDB 74). No craftsmen are even remotely present here, and there is no such word in MJ, contrary to EDAL, although it appears in IKJ, but the text IKJ quotes from is the NS (720 C. E.), and that is an OJ text. It is quite apparent on the basis of this and multiple other examples that EDAL' s authors do not understand that JDB is not a dictionary of Old Japanese, since it includes data from 9th century as well, and that any of the "Kogo jiten" are not the dictionaries of MJ, since they include eclectic data from the Nara period to the Edo period. Only by looking at the references to the actual texts and realizing their chronology one can form a scholarly judgment whether this or that entry is OJ, MJ, and so on. Thus, e.g., there is an adjective isawosi listed in JDB with meanings "brave," "diligent," and "meritorious" (JDB 74), but only the first meaning of it is really attested in OJ, since isawosi "diligent" appears in phonetic attestations only in the Nihon kõki (840 C. E.), and, therefore it is MJ; and the word in the third meaning "meritorious" does not have any phonetic attestations in OJ either. Thus, PJ *isa is not a cognate for PA "work." PK *īr "work, profession" based on MK ir is a live witness to a re- peatedly manifested ignorance of the most basic facts about the Korean language history. It is very well known, contrary to EDAL' s unfounded statement: "In MK orthography, length was marked by two dot..." (p. 165), that these two dots do not represent the length, but indicate the RISING pitch, thus MK :il. The reference to that can be found in the most elementary books on the history of Korean, such as (Yi 1972), which, of course, has not been consulted. Furthermore, there is over- whelming evidence coming both from the much despised pre- 15th cen- tury sources as well as from morphophonology of MK itself that mono- syllabic roots with RISING pitch have a disyllabic origin (Ramsey 1991: 227), (Martin 1996: 2-5), etc. Thus, the PK form of the word in question is *ilu LH. It is also necessary to add that "profession" is another se- mantic ghost created by assigning to a meaning in the proto-language a semantic tag obtained through a poor translation process without paying attention to how a given form functions in a language. In MK, as far as I can judge on the basis of its textual usage, the word means "thing", "matter", "affair", "fact", "deed" as well as "work", "job," but un- controversial examples for "work" and "job" start to appear only in later texts. The meaning of "thing", "fact" and "matter" still exists in CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="28">98 Alexander Vovin the modern language, and it also shows up in the constructions like Han- kwuk-ey ka pon il-i isseyo? "Have you ever been to Korea?, lit.: "Is there a fact that [you] went to Korea?", and I believe that it is the primary meaning of the word, that is also supported by the fact that MK Chinese- Korean dictionaries translated the Chinese character Í "matter", "thing" as MK :il (Hwung III: 31), (Yuhap III: 63). In SSK there is a meaning that is translated into English as "employment, occupation" (KED 1349), but we should not forget that translations are only tags and dictionaries are good sources only when they include examples of usage. KED is excellent in that respect, and we see that KED provides the fol- lowing example after this meaning: Atu-nim-un musun i7-ul hamnikka? "What line of business is your son in?, lit.: What kind of job/work your son does?" Thus we can see that the meaning of "profession" is not present here. Therefore, the whole "etymology" for PA "work" just falls apart on morphological, phonetic, philological, and semantic grounds. Let us move to the next one. (3) PA *k'iía "fetters" &gt; PMT *xil-, PM *kelbeyür, PT *kiíe- PJ *kàsi, PK *kár (p. 790). I wonder what would PA speakers use fetters for in the 6th millennium B. C. E., when nomadic pastoralism did not yet exist. PMT *xil- is based on Ewk. inman , inmar "halter, headstall," iltē "loop for a billet on deer' s neck," Ew. inmAr "halter, headstall," Oroch sili, Ul. sini, Orok sinni, Ma. i It en "fur collar", Orok sïlma "halter, headstall" with reference to (TMS I: 310, 316) and (TMS II: 84). The authors of TMS felt it necessary to place these words into three different entries similar to the previous "etymology," and for good reason, as we will see. Ewk. iltē "loop for a billet on deer's neck" (TMS I: 310) is found only in the Tommot, Uchur, and Chul'man subdialects that all belong to the Eastern Ewenki dialect. EDAL apparently treats -tē in iltē as a suffix, but no explanation is given, because, of course, this suffix does not exist.24 Ewk. inman, inmar and Ew. inmAr "halter, headstall" (TMS II: 316) are supposed to represent PMT cluster *-lm-, which is reflected in both of these languages as -nm- (p. 162), but there is a slight problem: in contrast to Ewk. iltē, Ewk. inman, inmar are found in the different 24 Since all the dialects where Ewk. iltē "loop for a billet o, deer's neck" is found are adjacent or close to Yakut, it is quite likely that this is a loan from Yakut, cf. Yak. iilet- "to make surround" (Slepcov 1972: 142), with the expected verbal noun iilet-ee "the thing that someone places around [reindeer's neck]." CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="29">The End of the Altaic Controversy 99 subdialects of Ewenki (Podkamenno-Tungusskii, Verkholenskii, (both belonging to the Southern Tungus dialect), Sakhalin subdialect of the Eastern Ewenki dialect and in Titov's dictionary (Titov 1926). And I have bad news for the EDAL team: the same Tommot, Uchur, and Chul' man subdialects where Ewk. iltē is present do not have the forms *inman, *inmar, but the form itmar, and it is cited right next to those (TMS I: 316). Thus, there is no *-lm- cluster in Ewk. inman, inmar and Ew. inmOr "halter, headstall", and these words can be safely discarded. Therefore, only Orok sttma "halter, headstall" remains, but here again we have a slight problem: according to EDAL the Orok cluster -Im- can reflect only PMT *-rm-, but not *-lm-, which is reflected in Orok as -nm- (p. 162). Thus, Orok sïlma &lt; *si'rma can also be rejected. Ma. ilten is not just "fur collar", but is a "fur collar made of sables for the court cere- monial dress," and actually it is a kind of collar that rests on the shoul- ders and has an ornament resembling the wings of a bat or a fan (BB 3252). It is not possible to segment it into il-ten, because there is no internal evidence for the suffix -ten in Manchu, and because the root *il- contradicts Manchu phonotactics, as I mentioned in the discussion of the previous etymology. I also doubt that sable fur collars were used as loops for reindeers. Therefore, neither Ewk. iltē, nor Ma. ilten can be shown to contain much needed root *il-, so they have to be excluded as well. That leaves us with Oroch sili, Ul. s ini, Orok sinni "fur collar" (TMS II: 316). The very first problem we have here is that without the evidence from other languages, we cannot know whether the etymon started with PMT *x- or *s-, so even if these three words constitute a valid etymology, there is only 50% credibility for initial *x- that is needed here for the external comparison. But the greater problem is that these three words do not constitute a valid etymology: Oroch sili, Ul. s ini, Orok sinni exhibit the correspondence -I- : -n- : -nn-, which is a non-correspondence, if we are to believe the authors' chart of consonantal correspondences, where PMT *-1- is reflected as -I- in all Tunguusic languages and PMT *-n- is also reflected as -n- in all Tungusic languages (p. 157). Authors might mean that there is a cluster *-ln-, but such a cluster is not reconstructed in the list of consonantal clusters (pp. 160-162), nor it is to be seen in (Cincius 1949). It is necessary to add that these words cannot also be branded together as a simple "fur collar": Oroch sili "collar for woman's finery dress, made from bright satin with otter fur at the rim, and decorated with beads," Ul. sini "woman's fur collar," Orok sinni "collar" (TMS II: CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="30">100 Alexander Vovin 84) Thus, all Tungusic words recruited for the support of this "ety- mology" are just chance comparanda. PM *kelbeyür "chock, boot-tree" based on WM kelbegiir and the following data from other Mongolie languages without any specification of semantics in these languages: KH xelbüiir, Bur. xelberi, and Dag. kelbej- (p. 790). WM and Khalkha words indeed mean "boot-tree," the semantics of Buriat is just "form, shape", and Dagur form is a ghost, but there is Dagur kalbur "form, shape" in the same source that was used in EDAL for Dagur data (Sun 1990: 341). Thus, really no chocks here - using this word as a translation of Russian "KOJio^Ka" may be mis- leading at best, but this is a very minor detail compared with what follows next. This etymology is accompanied by a note: "The word is formally derived from kelbe- "to shape", whence also kelberi (Lessing 1995: 446) "shape": external evidence, however, strongly suggests that "boot-tree" must have been the original meaning, and "shape" is a secondary devel- oped abstract meaning" (p. 790). Now, this goes against both Mongolian grammar and common sense. WM suffix -yur / -giir is a frequent and a productive deverbal suffix used to derive nouns designating tools for performing an action described by a verb, e. g. qana-yur "lancet for blood-letting" ( qana - "to phlebotomize"), qadu-yur "sickle" ( qadu - "to mow"), elgii-giir "hanger" ( elgii - "to hang"), etc. (Poppe 1964: 46). Neither chocks nor boot-trees are used as any kinds of fetters, and boot-trees have very specific application, as they are used to shape shoes or hats, in short, they are shapers. In other words, derivation is absolutely transparent, and we do not need any external parallels to rewrite Mong- olian grammar. In addition, for the WM verb kelbe- that EDAL defines as "to shape," we find a significantly different definition in the very source that EDAL refers us to. WM kelbe- is defined as lOMbir tsji* yyacHM hx ßojirox "to make things big and wide by stretching" with two specific examples: ryTayi x3j'6sx "to shape shoes," Majiraft xsjiÖsx "to shape hats" (Cevel 1966: 758). Thus we can see that WM kelbe- means not just "to shape," but "to shape shoes and hats by stretching." WM kelbe-giir is defined in the same dictionary as lOMbir t3ji3x x3^6sx3a TOXHpyyjiac xHftc3H 3YHJI, xsBTiYYp "a thing made to stretch and shape things so [they] fit, boot-tree" (Cevel 1966: 757). I should also add that there is no evidence whatsoever for segmentation of WM kelbe- "to shape" as *kel- be-. No word of PA antiquity here: it cannot be considered even re- motely. CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="31">The End of the Altaic Controversy 101 PT *kile- "to hobble, fetters" is actually just a verb which means "to hobble (e.g. a horse)," and nouns meaning different kinds of "fetters", also including "chains", are all derived from the verb. To my taste it should be reconstructed as *kiše possibly with a vowel length: *kiiše-, as indicated by Turk, kiišen "chains." PJ *kàsi "fetters", "shackles" is based on OJ kasi and MJ kasi, kase "id." Two preliminary notes are necessary. First, OJ kasi are not just any kind of "fetters", it is a "cangue," that is a wooden board with holes for head and/or hands and feet. The instrument itself is apparently borrowed from the mainland, since binding prisoners with ropes was more usual practice in traditional Japan, and using of a cangue was restricted. Second, there are no phonetic attestations of this word in OJ (JDB 186): we can just suppose that it was there only on the basis of later glosses to Nara period texts written entirely in Chinese. Phonetically the word is attested for first time in MJ as kasi. As far as I can tell, the form kase given as MJ in ED AL actually appears for the first time only in Early Modern Japanese. Taking all this into consideration, one should possibly look for other possibilities before embarking on a search for origins of a cangue in the PA-speaking community. Two possibilities are much more realistic: MJ kasi 2.3 "cangue" is called so, because it was made from kasi 2.3 "oak", known for the hard quality of its wood. It may not be completely coincidental that the MC word for "cangue" is $)[I /ka/, although I do not have at the moment an explanation for the -si in MJ word, so I prefer the first etymology, which will be certainly branded as a "folk etymol- ogy" by my esteemed opponents. PK *kár "fetters ", "cangue" is based on MK kár, kār and SSK khal (p. 791). "Fetters" is again introduced by EDAL's authors to make the comparison look better: MK word means only "cangue" and SSK word means "cangue", "pillory." I agree with EDAL's authors that PK re- construction should be *kál, as a matter of fact, we do not need MK kār at all, as the MK word is really kál with a HIGH pitch. Its citation with RISING pitch (Nam 1997: 27) is a mistake, because it is found with RISING mark only once in the whole MK corpus (Nung VIII: 86), but even there the second dot, differentiating RISING from HIGH, is not really distinct. And MK kál "cangue" was also made from kal 25 "oak." Of course, my esteemed opponents can accuse me of another "folk ety- mology," but to my taste we already have a cultural tendency here. 25 Unfortunately, no information on accent, since the word appears for the first time only in the Mwulpo, a Korean text that was compiled in late 18th or early 19th century. CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="32">102 Alexander Vovin Therefore, the etymology of PA "fetters" goes up in smoke: only PT *kile- "to hobble" remains, which, as authors admit themselves has a completely irregular vocalism when compared to other "Altaic" words. But, as we have seen, there is nothing to compare it to. (4) PA *p'eío "to walk, to run" &gt; PMT *peli-(/puli-), PM hiilde-, PT *eí-, PJ *pàsìr-, PK *parb- (p. 1133). PMT *peli-(*puli) "to walk, to hurry" lumps together two different entries found in TMS under Ewk. helde- "to move, to ride" (TMS II: 363-364) and Ewk. helin "hurry (n.)" (TMS II: 364), that again separates these two entries for a good reason. Alleged PMT *peli- "to walk, to hurry" is represented in the first entry only by Ewk. helde- "to move, to ride" found only in Nerchinskii subdialect of the Eastern Ewen- ki dialect and in Castren's materials (in addition, Castren's materials have a doublet form elde- without initial h-)' and in Ma. feliye- [fel'e-], mean- ing just "to walk" without any "hurry:" "to stroll," "to go for a walk," "to tread," "to start walking (of a child)," "to take part in cere- monial procession." Ewk. helde- besides being sparsely attested and having a meaning that may not have any connection to "walking" what- soever, also has an obscure morphological structure, since Ewenki has no suffix *-de- that we can segment in this case. Remaining Ma. feliye- [fel'e-] 'to walk' has to be excluded on phonological grounds: one would expect Ma. *feli- as a reflex of PMT *peli-, not feliye- [fel'e-], since only Ma. N and not /e/ corresponds to PMT *i (Cincius 1949: 79- 85). Remaining words in the first entry of TMS constitute a valid PMT etymology, with a protoform that should be reconstructed as *pöli- "to walk" on the basis of Ew. hol-, not as *puli-: EDAL authors do not know (judging by their bibliography) or disregard Doerfer's important propos- al for reconstruction of PT *ö (Doerfer 1978), as was mentioned above. It should be noted that neither EDAL' s fallacious *puli-, nor correct *pöli- can correspond to PA *p'eío, because by authors' own system of correspondences PMT *e in the first syllable is required (p. 92). Thus the whole first entry in TMS (pp. 363-364) can be dismissed on phonol- ogical, morphological, and semantic grounds. That leaves us with a se- cond entry that represents PMT *peli- or, possibly, *pelin- "to hurry," but "hurry" is not necessarily connected with "walking" or "running," which is well demonstrated by individual languages so we can safely ig- nore this part of the PA "etymology" as well. PM * hiilde- "to chase" is based on MM xulde-, WM ülde-, KH aide- /öldö-, and Bur. ülde- (p. 1134). WM, KH and Bur. tilde- indeed have CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="33">The End of the Altaic Controversy 103 meanings "to chase away, to drive out, to expel, to chase" (Hangin 1986: 576), (Luvsandendev 1957: 481), (BAMRS 407), (Cheremisov 1951: 504), (Cheremisov 1973: 500). MM xulde- also has a range of meanings: "to chase," "to chase away," "to trail" (Haenisch 1939: 78), (Ozawa 1994: 434). We can see again that ED AL authors edit or oversimplify the semantics to serve their purpose: if "to chase" certainly involves move- ment, "to chase away" or "to drive out" does not necessarily have the same connection, since one can chase away or drive out somebody just verbally. The much greater problem is, of course, the perennial trouble with morphology: -de- in *hülde- is left unexplained, and it certainly cannot be explained as a "suffix," because Mongolian -da-l-de- exists as a denominal suffix forming transitive verbs (Poppe 1964: 64), but it is not the case here, since there is no respective noun *hül. Another problem is with the regularity of correspondences: according to ED AL, PM *ü can correspond to PA *e in the PA vowel sequence *e-o only if it is found before or after a labial consonant (p. 92). The labial consonant is reconstructed only for PA, and not for PM. Thus, the PM *hülde- does not withstand the scrutiny on phonological and morphological grounds, and in addition it has questionable semantics. PT eí- "to walk, to trot, to amble" is based on OT, Tur., Gag. es-, Yak. is-, etc., and Chuv. is- (p. 1134). However, Chuv. is- "to walk in the snow or in the dirt" cannot be a cognate of other Turkic forms, since some- thing like Chuv. *al- would be expected.26 Therefore, Chuv. iš-, since it violates correspondences can only be a loan, and for the purposes of PT reconstruction the Chuvash form simply does not exist. An absence from Chuvash may be indicating that PT *eš- is a comparatively new word. Glossing PT *eí- simply as "to walk, to trot, to amble" in English is mis- leading, because, as noted by Sevortian, the basic meaning of this verb is "to amble" (ÉSTIa I: 316). Thus, in sharp contrast to other "Altaic" languages in this etymology, PT *el- does not refer to a human's walking or running, but to a very specific type of walking/running done by a horse. A very helpful insight to the etymology of PT *el- is again offered by Sevortian, who suggests that PT *eí- "to amble" could develop its meaning metaphorically from PT *eí- "to dig, to paddle" (ÉSTIa I: 26 Dybo refers to a rule that in Chuv. PA *1 &gt; / in syllable final position, but &gt; .v in intervocalic position (p. 138). Since in this case we have a syllable final position, either is something wrong with the etymology, or with the rule, which is given with- out examples, but with reference to Mudak's dissertation and another obscure publica- tion by Mudrak that are not accessible outside Moscow. CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="34">104 Alexander Vovin 315-316). Presence of both Chuv. al - (an expected cognate for PT *el- "to dig, to paddle") and Chuv. if- (a loan from another Turkic lan- guage) further strengthens Sevortian's proposal for this derivation. Thus, ED AL' s PT *el- "to walk, to trot, to amble" can be also removed on semantic grounds. PJ *pàsìr- "to run" based on OJ pasir -, MJ fàsìr -, STJ hasir -, etc. (p. 1134) is quite problematic for the following reasons. First, there is no internal Japonic evidence for segmenting *pasir- as *pas-ir, because there is no suffix *-ir- in Japonic.27 Second, OJ pasir- apparently had much broader semantics than modern pasir-"to run": it could also mean "to move quickly," and "to fall down (of stones)." Thus, it can be safely taken out of the equation for morphological and semantical reasons. PK *parb- "to tread, trample" based on MK parp- and SSK pāp- [pālp-] (p. 1134) is reconstructed incorrectly due to the ED AL authors' stubborn refusal to recognize lenition in MK and its implications for PK reconstruction, which was already discussed earlier. This, PK form is ac- tually bisyllabic *polpo- LH. Needless to say, there is zero internal evi- dence for the suffix *-po- in Korean that is needed to make the root comparable to other "Altaic" forms, and the etymology can be dis- missed on morphological grounds. (5) PA *sïia "sharp stick, tooth" &gt; PMT *sila(-bun) "skewer"; PM *sidü "tooth" PT *sīi /*s*í "tooth, sharp stick;" PJ *sàs-, *sàsì "to prick, stab, sharp stick;" PK *sár "arrow, sting" (p. 1251). PMT *sila(-bun) "skewer"28 is followed by a note: "Most languages also reflect the verb *sila- "to roast on a spit, to put on a spit" (p. 1251). I am afraid that the meaning "to put on a skewer" is again invented by the authors, and the verb *sila - *silo- (to cite it more exactly) means 27 There is OJ pase- "to make run, to run" that authors do not cite and that is sometimes considered to be a transitive form of the intransitive pasir - (JDB 579). However, this is problematic for the following reasons. First, the expected intransitive form of pase - will be *pasar-, but not pasir -, therefore the exact morphological relationship between pase- and pasir- is unclear, and it is likely that both can be unrelated. Second, pase- can be used as an intransitive verb "to run", too, thus further undermining the possibility of its relationship to pasir-. Third, examples of phonetic attestation of pase- as a transitive verb in OJ are lacking (all cases are limited to much later kana glosses), and the first known to me comes only from very late MJ (USM III. 12). Meanwhile, although not indicated in JDB, intransitive pase- "to run" is likely to be attested in Old Japanese in the expression ama-pase-dukapî "heavenly runner messen- ger" ( KK 2, KK 3). 28 I have replaced "spit" used in ED AL by "skewer;" as the former can trigger unnecessary associations with "spitting". CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="35">The End of the Altaic Controversy 105 just "roast on a skewer" (TMS II: 82). I can understand that ED AL' s authors do not know that PMT suffix *-pūn makes the deverbal nouns designating tools (Sunik 1982: 91), but only a religious belief in Altaic can obscure their to vision such a degree that they fail to realize that PMT noun *sila-pūn "skewer" is morphologically complex, and therefore, must be an obvious secondary derivation from *sila- "to roast on a skew- er," that is morphologically simple. Now, a quick excursus into roasting ways of Tungus peoples will demonstrate that roasting on a skewer was traditionally the only common Tungusic way to roast things that involved any kind of an instrument, and that it is known to the majority of Tung- usic tribes (Smoliak 1966: 95), (Lar'kin 1964: 54), (Vasilevich 1969: 122, 124), (Ivashchenko et al. 1989: 56), (Startsev 1996: 98), (Tugolukov et al 1997: 87). Roasting on charcoals seems to be attested only for Ude- ge (Ivashchenko et al. 1989: 56). Thus, *sila- means just "to roast", it is a reference to the cooking method itself, but not to the way it was done. Tus, PMT *sila-pūn is just a "tool for roasting", nothing more; and the Tungusic part of etymology can be safely deleted on morphological and semantic grounds. PM *sidii is a "tooth," but the PM *-1- that is supposed to reflect PA *-1- is not present. To give EDAL its credit, this apparent irregularity is explained away by a wonderful rule: "In Mong. *-1- &gt; -0- before the af- fixes -du-, -su- (cf. ho-dun &lt; *hol-dun &lt; *p'ļulo ("star" - A.V.), si-dii &lt; *sil-dü ("tooth" - A.V.)..." (p. 66), and the origins of this "rule" can be traced back at least to (Poppe 1973: 253). But like many other similar rules employed in EDAL, it is based on an ad hoc analysis of Mongolie morphology, because contrary to the suffix -su(n), widely used to form denominal and deverbal nouns, suffix -du(n) is used in Mongolian ex- clusively to form deverbal nouns designating bodily conditions, e.g. qaniya- "to cough" &gt; qaniya-dun "cough," iniye- "to laugh" &gt; iniye- diin "laughter," and when even Poppe deals strictly with internal Mong- olie data, he discusses only deverbal nouns in -du(n), and does not de- scribe any -du(n) as an "unproductive suffix" of body parts29 (Poppe 29 An "unproductive suffix" of body parts -du(n)/-dii(n) in Mongolie fares no better than an "unproductive prefix" of body parts g- in Russian, e.g., one may suggest that the following words all contain this "prefix": g-olova "head," g-laz "eye," g-uba "lip," g- rud' " chest," g-orlo "throat," g-lotka "gullet," g-ortan' "larynx," g-olen' "shin," g- landy "tonsils," and g-orb "hump." Needless to say, only divine intervention can ex- plain why "unproductive suffix" of body parts -du(n)/-dii(n) in Mongolie is not found in such words as gar "hand," qabar "nose," kelen "tongue," etc., or why "unproductive CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="36">106 Alexander Vovin 1964: 45). It is quite clear that one cannot find verbal stems underlying WM sidii(n) "tooth", modu(n) "tree", ildii(n) "sword," MM hodu(n) "star" etc., and, therefore, the proposed morphological analysis repre- sents a segmentation not based on any internal Mongolie evidence. It is a segmentation based entirely on the assumption that the Mongolie word in question must be related to "Altaic", the assumption that this comparison tries to prove in the first place. Thus, the ED AL' s authors lock themselves in a vicious cycle of circular logic, and adding another hypothetical rule of *-1- loss on the top of this internally unjustified assumption is not going to solve the problem but just makes it worse. Thus, PM *sidü is certainly just a root, and the Mongolie comparison can be dismissed on phonological and morphological grounds. PT *sîi/ *sïl "tooth, sharp stick" represents another case on which both supporters of "Altaic" and critical Altaists spilled much ink. It is re- markable that the meaning "tooth" is represented exclusively by Chuv- ash šāl. Besides, even Common Turkic šiš / šiš means "skewer" rather than a "sharp stick." I do not have much to add on this debate, except that in my opinion a solution presented by Doerfer that Chuvash šāl "tooth" is related to Common Turkic tiš "tooth" and is actually the de- velopment from the latter through palatalization and subsequent as- similation *tiš &gt; *čiš &gt; *šiš &gt; šāl (Doerfer 1967: 325-326) is much more elegant and simple solution, that does not require unusual semantic shift within Turkic, although EDAL authors reject it as "quite unjustifiable doubt" (p. 1251). Recently, Doerfer's proposal was further strengthened by (Georg 2003a). Thus, only Common Turkic šiš / šiš "skewer" is left on the Turkic side of the etymology. PJ *sàs-, *sàsì"to prick, stab, sharp stick" is based on OJ sas-, sasi' MJ sàs-, sasi', STJ sás-, sasr, Kyoto s ás-, Kagoshima sàs- without specification of meanings (p. 1251). It must be noted that sasi "sharp stick" is a fruit of authors' imagination, and, I should add, their ignorance of the basic facts even of modern Japanese grammar. It is of course, sas-i, a nomi- nalized verbal form, derived with absolutely regular and productive nom- inalizer kak-i "writing" ( kak - "to write"), yom-i "reading" (yom- "to read"), watar-i "crossing" ( watar - "to cross"), etc., etc. The basic form is a verbal one: sas- "to pierce, stab, stick (into)."

CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="37">The End of the Altaic Controversy 107 even less "teeth", with which you certainly don't pierce in Japanese, you bite, as in many other languages. The further problem for this exciting etymology is that sas- in all historical periods of Japanese, including modern language, used to mean quite different things: pulling a boat with a pole, setting a trap, igniting fire, pouring rice wine, pointing with a finger, wearing a sword on one's side, holding up an umbrella, etc. I can hear the outcry: "folk etymology!", but I have one important argument on my side: all these allegedly different verbs have the same accentuation and they belong to the same paradigm. Thus, the archetype of the mean- ing seems to be connected with "pointing" or "insertion", and not ne- cessarily with "stabbing" or "piercing." Thus, Japonic parallel has to be excluded on semantic and morphological grounds. PK *sár "arrow, sting" is based on MK sár, SSK sal (p. 1251). As- signing the meaning "sting" to the protolanguage is begging the issue, as it is attested only in the modern language, and in addition it is usually treated as a homonym of sal "arrow." Arrows can be viewed as "sharp sticks," but so can spears and javelins. The crucial difference between the former and the latter is that "arrows" are always projectiles, while "spears" are not necessarily so. A possible, but not exciting etymology. Therefore, we are left only with Common Turkic šiš / šiš "skewer" and PK *sal "arrow" to support the lambdaism in "Altaic." Neither phonetically nor semantically can the remaining part be called an ex- citing etymology, unless, of course, PA speakers had a unique cultural tradition when they roasted their meat on arrows and used their skewers for hunting and fighting. (6) PA *sļoie "to mock, to slander" &gt; PMT *sulu, PM *sila, PT *siāl, PJ *sásír-, PK *hār- (p. 1279). PMT *sulu "rogue, to mock" is based only on Ul. sulu "rogue," sulu-de- "to mock," and Orok sulu-da- "to mock" (p. 1279). Only very strong belief in Altaic could have caused such semantic misrepresen- tation of the data. No "rogues", "swindlers", or "con artists" are in- volved here: Ul. sulu is just a "prankish person," Ul. sulude-/i- (sic! - A.V.) means "to play pranks, to joke, to tease", and Orok suluda- is "to tease, to offend" (TMS II: 125). No "mockery" is involved either. One obvious problem is that the word is limited to only two South Tungusic languages, therefore, even its Tungusic provenance, let alone "Altaic," is more than doubtful. Since we have no crucial data from Neghidal and Nanai, we really do not know whether the vocalism of this word should include back [u] or central [u]. The Orok word is transcribed with central CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="38">108 Alexander Vovin [u], but there is an oddity: a stem with central [u] should be followed by a suffix with central vocalism, and not with back vocalism, but in reality we have -da-, not -de-. Moreover, in two other Orok words provided in TMS in the same entry, but not cited in EDAL: sulu-qta , sulu-tci "bully" we again see back vocalism. Not so in the Ulchi word, where suffix -de- apparently shows that the word has central vocalism. In short, it looks like we have two different Tungusic words with different vocalism, although they share one meaning "to tease." But here the similarity ends. So, which one of them has the honor to represent the Altaic heritage in Tungusic? Finally, there is another important problem: neither the Ulchi suffix -de- nor the Orok suffix -da- can represent the PMT denominal suffix *-da-/*-de- because the latter is used to derive verbs denoting an action performed by the instrument expressed by noun (Sunik 1962: 104-107), which is not the case here. Thus, both suffixes must be a result of a comparatively recent development within these two languages. Therefore, I think that PMT part of etymology can be also rejected on the basis of internal incompatibility, far-fetched and distorted semantics, and limited attestation. PM *sila "to talk nonsense, to squander" is a very brave reconstruc- tion based on WM sali-qu (NB: clearly not WM sila-qu' - A. V.) (Lessing 1995: 750), KH, Bur. sali-, Kalm. šāl-, Ord. šaligla- "to talk nonsense" (p. 1279). It is necessary to note that EDAL's source for KH treats sali- 1 "to lie, to talk nonsense" and sali- II "to squander, to plun- der" as two different verbs (Luvsandendev 1957: 643), and the same ap- proach is taken in (BAMRS IV: 336), but this is not even mentioned in EDAL. Bur. šali- appears to have only the meaning "to talk nonsense, to blab out" (Cheremisov 1973: 717), and so does Kalm. ša/'-30 "to babble" (Muniev 1977: 663); but with the way Mongolie forms are cited in EDAL, it is impossible to figure out what language has what meaning. Therefore, sali- II "to squander, to plunde" seems to be confined to KH and WM. But WM does not equal Classical Mongolian, and neither Les- sing 1995 nor BAMRS are dictionaries of Classical Mongolian, therefore, attestation only in WM and KH does not warrant treatment of a particular word as PM, since we simply do not know how old are many WM forms included in (Lessing 1995) and BAMRS. Thus, I believe we should not be concerned about sali- II "to squander, to plunder" any longer, especially that I really cannot understand how this meaning can be connected with "slandering." Sometimes one can get clues from Lessing 1995 and 30 EDAL's authors give Kalm. šāl, following (Ramstedt 1976: 354). CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="39">The End of the Altaic Controversy 109 BAMRS based on the examples of usage. In particular, there is one ex- ample illustrating WM šali- "to talk nonsense": ter-e yayu šali-ju bain-a? "What nonsense is he talking ?" (Lessing 1995: 750). The presence of bain-a instead of bai-mui "be-PRES" clearly indicates colloquial style and therefore the suspicion arises that Mongolie šali- "to talk nonsense," is a late word, which is further strengthened by two facts: first, by absence of the word in MM, and second, by the phonological shape of the word. If šali- was indeed from PM *sila- as EDAL authors allege, it would be- come *šal- in KH, *šala- in Bur., and *šali- in Kalm. (cf. PM *sira "yel- low" &gt; KH šar, Bur. šara, Kalm. sari), but all three languages have dif- ferent reflexes from what is predicted on the basis of the known devel- opment of a word that has a very close phonological shape. Thus, the Mongolian part of the etymology should be rejected on phonological grounds as well as on the basis of a likely recent origin and weak seman- tics. PT *siāl- "wild, to be astonished, to slander" is based only on very few Turkic languages: Karakh. (Mahmud Kashgari) saš "wild;" Tur. šaš- , Az. čaš-, Turkm. čāš- "to be astonished;" Khal. šašqa- "to slan- der;" Chuv. šuldra "pert" (p. 1279). It follows a similar etymology in VEWT 405 with some languages taken out and Khaladj and Chuvash added. Since the data are limited and the semantic range is suspicious, the detailed analysis is in order. First of all, to the best of my knowledge, Khal. šašqa- "to slander" is a ghost: the word is not attested in (Doerfer &amp; Tezcan 1980) that is EDAL source on Khaladj, nor in other published Khaladj materials. With this Khaladj word gone, the meaning "to slan- der" is also gone from PT as presented in EDAL. Second, glossing Kara- kh. saš as "wild" repeats Räsänen's mistake who mistranslated saš in saš at in Mahmud Kashgari's dictionary (III: 152) as "wild, unbändig." In fact, saš at means "shy horse" (Dankoff &amp; Kelly 1985.3: 156), (DTS 490). In fact, Clauson even noted that Turkic šāš- "to be astonished" is not to be related to Karakh. saš "shy" (Clauson 1972: 856). Thus, one can well see that EDAL' s authors do not consult all relevant sources, but instead repeat a mistake found just in one dictionary. Third, Chuv. šuldra (also šuldara - A.V.), contrary to EDAL, does not mean "pert," but "large, large-size, rough, rude" (Ashmarin 1950.17: 219-220), (Skvor- tsov 1985: 622), with the meaning "rude" being an obvious derivation of "rough." Ashmarin further notes that the original meaning is "large" (Ashmarin 1950.17: 219-220). It is necessary to note that Chuv. šuldra! šuldāra cannot be segmented as šul-dralšul-dāra, because there is CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="40">110 Alexander Vovin no suffix -tra/-tära in Chuvash. Both etymological dictionaries of Chuv- ash present Meadow Mari šoldra and Mountain Mari šaldra "large" (Egorov 1964: 338), (Fedotov 1996.2: 460). I am not aware of any cognates for these Mari words in any other Uralic languages, but the correspondence between Meadow Mari loi and Mountain Mari /a/ seems to indicate Proto-Mari *šaldra "large" (cf. Meadow Mari jol, Mountain Mari jal, and Finnish jalka "foot"). Since Chuv. suldra &lt; * šaldra, it is impossible to determine the direction of borrowing. Räsänen in his seminal book on Chuvash loanwords in Mari placed this Chuvash-Mari parallel into his "Verzeichniss der tscheremissischen Lehnwörter im tschuwassischen und anderer für diese Sprachen gemeinsamer Wörter, deren Etymologie unklar ist" with identification of the similarity between Chuv. šuldra and Mari šoldra, but without any etymology or suggestion for the direction of borrowing (Räsänen 1920: 266). The most likely solution seems to be that the word has no etymology either in Chuvash, or in Mari. It may just belong to a common unknown substratum. There- fore, Chuv. šuldra! šuldāra really does not have any cognates in other Turkic languages. That essentially leaves us with three Oghuz languages representing only PT *sāš- "to be astonished," also supported by other CT languages not cited in EDAL, see (VEWT 405). The reconstruction of initial PT *si- in EDAL is also ad hoc without Chuvash, as only *sāš- can be accepted on the basis of Räsänen's proposal: *s-š &gt; č-š &gt; š-š (Räsänen 1949: 175-176). Thus, EDAL's Turkic etymology for PA *sjoíe "to mock, to slander" can be safely rejected on phonological, morphological and semantical grounds, as well as due to ghost words and meanings. PJ *sásír- (~*suasir-) "to slander" is based on OJ sosir- (no phonetic attestations in OJ - A.V.), MJ sósír-, STJ sò s ir- etc. "to slander" (p. 1279). The meaning "to slander" usually happens to be listed first in dictionaries, so it was lucky enough to be picked up, but the actual meaning of the word in both OJ and modern language is much wider: it is rather "to bad-mouth somebody," "to speak ill of smbd.," "to blame". Since we do not know whether OJ form was *sösir- or *sôsir- (with latter possibly going back to *su[C]asir- or *sa[C]usir-, not just to *ua as indicated by EDAL's authors), the etymology will work only in the case of a tentative OJ *sösir-, since in all other cases it will violate the proposed correspondences and will go straight out the window. Thus, we have only 50% of credibility to start with. In addition, in order for this etymology to work, one needs to demonstrate that sosir- is segmentable into sos-ir-, but as I have shown above, there is no suffix *-ir- in Japanese (see PJ *pàsïr- CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="41">The End of the Altaic Controversy 111 "to run" under number (4)). Finally, I am afraid I have bad news for ED AL' s authors. There is MJ nonosir- "to make big noise, to shout," that must be a compound of some sort - it is just too long, and indeed nonomek- "to make noise talking in a loud voice" with a rather produc- tive suffix -mek- is attested in late MJ (USM XII. 6). Thus, it is clear that -sir- in nono-sir- is an obsolete suffix. We can then suspect that sosir- may also include the same suffix. And the suspicion comes true, because there are also MJ so-mek-, sè-mèk- "to accuse / reproach holding a grudge," e.g. oinu tote nado ka wa-ga mi-wo semekikemu "why would [I] reproach my own body, saying "[You] have aged" (KKW XVII: 903). Therefore, OJ sosir- is to be analyzed as so-sir-, and with this segmentation the Japanese "evidence" for the precious PA *-1- evapo- rates completely. PK *hār- "to slander" is based on MK hār- "id." (p. 1279). How- ever, as I mentioned already above, MK form is actually :hal- with RISING pitch that indicates bisyllabic origin of the word, therefore the PK reconstruction should be *halo- LH. The etymology is very weak, because a correspondence of MK h- to OJ s- (and, presumably, to *s- in "Altaic") cannot be supported by a significant number of examples (Vovin 1993: 340-341), (Vovin 2000: 149-150), contrary to EDAL's fantastic claim that PA *s- &gt; PK *h- in front of PA *-ja- and *- ļo- (p. 50-51) that contradicts any phonological or phonetic reality. (7) Next is the famous, or, rather, infamous PA *tjõíi, "stone" &gt; PMT *3ola, PM *čilaYU, PT *diâí, PJ *(d)ísi, PK *törh (p. 1373-1374). PMT *3ola "stone" is basically reconstructed correctly, although there is an argument in favor of *3olo rather than *3ola, since it is the former that is actually attested in all Tungusic languages except Ewen that has jo/ and Manchu that has a different word. But since the sequence o-a is not to be found in PMT, one can assume an early merger of *o-a and *o-o. In addition, the initial consonant does not match with other Altaic languages, but EDAL authors know the way around: a diphthong in PA is created to support the correspondence. Thus, we are facing again the sit- uation when the reconstruction is done "from above." PM *čilayu "stone" presents several problems. First, the reconstruc- tion is likely to be *čila-xun &lt; *čila-pun (Doerfer 1965: 437), with a suffix *-pun that is used to derive nouns from verbs. True enough, the corresponding verbal stem is not attested.

Chuvash čul/čol "stone") (Georg 2003b: 447). Thus, PM word is related to the following Turkic word, but only as a loanword, and cannot be used as evi- dence for this correspondence. The ED AL' s authors apparently believe that words such as "stone" cannot be borrowed (Starostin 1991: 38). But of course, words for "stone" can be borrowed, and they do get borrow- ed. For example, Latin petra &lt; Greek petra (Georg 2003b: 448). Within "Altaic," two Mongolie languages of the Gansu Qinghai area, Shira Yögur and Minhe Mangghuer both independently borrowed taš from some Turkic source (Georg, personal communication). PT *diāl "stone" should be really PT *tiāš as already noted above, thus causing a problem with correspondence to initial consonant in Tung- usic. PJ *(d)isì HL "stone" presents several problems. The presence of ini- tial *(d)- or *(y)- at the first glance cannot be proved or disproved, but the first syllable vowel in PJ is *e-, that can be safely reconstructed on the basis of the Ryukyuan evidence. This *e- in PJ presents a problem for re- construction of PA *iā, for which, according to EDAL, a PJ *i is needed. PR treats primary *e and secondary *e &lt; PJ *a[C]i, *i[C]a in the same way, so we would expect a preservation of PR *d- or *y- in front of primary or secondary *e, cf. OJ yeda "branch", ye "handle" and PR *yUda "branch," *yUe "handle" (Thorpe 1982: 267, 293). Ryukyuan evidence might seem sufficient to exclude any initial *d- or *y-, but it is always nice to have a second independent piece of evidence. This comes from Eastern Old Japanese. Before we consider this evidence, we must mention that OJ has another word, isô HH "rock", which is connected with OJ is i HL "stone".31 The seemingly unusual i : wo correspondence can be easily explained on the basis of OJ isu "rock", that is used as a doublet for isô in the name of the shrine: Isö-nö kamVlsu-nö kamt "top of the rock," also written in semantographic spelling as 5 _h "top of the stone" (JDB 76). OJ isi "stone" probably &lt; *isï &lt; *isu-i with a suf- fix *-i, and OJ isô "rock" &lt; *isu-a. Unfortunately, isô has no reflexes in Ryukyuan, but it is attested in EOJ. EOJ has isi "stone", attested twice in Azuma uta (MYS XIV: 3398, 3425), however, with the exception of a dia- lectal word teko "girl" in MYS XIV: 3398 none of these poems have any other EOJ dialect features. Thus, we really do not know whether isi in these poems is a genuine EOJ word, or it is used under WOJ influence. 31 Contrary to Vovin 1999: 370. CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="43">The End of the Altaic Controversy 113 There is also EOJ isô "rock" attested once in MYS XIV: 3563, but the same word also appears as osi in MYS XIV: 3359 and as osu in MYS XIV: 3385. Now, if the word in question had an initial *d- or *y- in PJ, why these EOJ words do not show up as *yosi and *yosu? The answer seems to be quite straightforward: PJ has *esu-i 2.2b "stone" and *esu-a 2.1 "rock", without any initial consonant. Thus, PJ *esu- 2.2b "stone" has no connection whatsoever with other "Altaic." PK *tõrh "stone" is an asterisked MK tõrh "stone", which should be MK :twolh with a RISING pitch, and the reconstruction, due to the rising pitch, as noted above, should be *twòlóh, where -h is likely a reflex of the diminutive suffix -(a)k, that follows both nominal and verbal stems (Martin 1992: 416, 592). I believe that Martin is right that there is an internal etymology for this word. It is from MK :twol- "turn (intr.)" &lt; PK *twòló-, that is "pebble" &lt; "that which rolls" (Martin 1996: 36). Thus, no PA "stone" is rolling on the Korean side either. Thus, the remaining parts of the "stone" etymology are really only PMT *3ola and PT *tiāš , but initial consonants really do not match, so this remaining comparison should be also discarded.

PMT *sulūn-n is based on Ewk. sulūn with a note: "attested only in Evk., but with probable external parallels" (p. 1519). But, it is not "at- tested only in Ewenki", it is actually attested only in the Uchur subdialect of the Eastern Ewenki dialect (TMS II: 125). It is quite possible that this is nothing but a loan from Yukaghir soll'e- "to burn (intr.)" (Kurilov 2001: 440).

I agree with ED AL' s authors that MM s IP Bn "rainbow" (HY lb) should be read with Irl, and not /1/, as indicated by the diacritic sign s at the side of the character IP , with this diacritic being present in the oldest extant xylograph of HY (Haenisch 1957: 5). Nevertheless, vowel /a/ in MM soratjxa is more prob- lematic, in spite of the fact that the Chinese character IP has EM reading /laq/, and together with the diacritic s is should be taken as transcription of the syllable /raņ/. However, one has to keep in mind that the Chinese transcription is not the IPA, and that Chinese had some limitations to its syllable structure, resulting in possible transcriptional gaps. Similar to modern Mandarin, Early Mandarin did not have syllable *loņ. This be- CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="44">114 Alexander Vovin comes quite obvious when one looks at the list of Chinese characters used to transcribe MM provided in (Lewicki 1949: 29-50). There are Chinese characters transcribing syllables /lar)/, /raq/, /luņ/,32 lioni, /ron/, /lun/, and /run/, but there are no *loņ or *roq. Since these two syllables did not exist in EM, but existed in MM, they had to be written somehow by the ex- isting Chinese characters. I believe that the character ^ could also be used for writing MM /rorj/ in addition to MM /raq/. Thus, I agree with Lewicki' s reading s olotjxa (Lewicki 1959: 72) as far as the reading se- cond vowel as loi is concerned; and with Haenisch' s reading soraņha (Haenisch 1957: 9), as far as the consonant /-r-/ is concerned. Therefore, I suggest that MM reading is sorotjxa , that agrees vocalically with other Mongolie forms33 much better than ED AL' s soratjxa. Since the assimila- 32 Presence of H /lut]/ and absence of /rur)/ is just accidental in HY, because in MNT the latter occurs as well (Haenisch 1939: 187), (Hattori 1946: 143). 33 In EDAL's source on Monguor, Monguor suloņGo actually appears as fuloGo (Sun 1990: 605). I must also note that EDAL's Dag. soloņ "dream", šāringī "rainbow" do not belong here, since neither Dag. /o/, nor Dag. /ā/ can correspond to loi in other Mongolie languages, and the meaning "dream" looks a little bit puzzling (more on that below). Neither Dag. soloņ "dream", nor šāringī "rainbow" can be found in (KW 330) that is cited by authors as a general source for the entry or in EDAL's source on Dagur (Sun 1990). The latter gives Dag. fe.ro: "rainbow" (Sun 1990: 605), and this word is also found asfe. ru: in (Enghebatu et al. 1984: 232) and (Zhong 1982: 101). I managed to trace both words to the probable source (Poppe 1930) (I have to say "probable" because it is not listed in EDAL's bibliography, instead EDAL lists Poppe N. N. Dagurskii iazyk . Moscow-Leningrad 1933-1937, which, to the best of my knowledge, is a ghost book, since it is not mentioned in bibliographies of Poppe' s works (Krueger &amp; Pritsak 1957: 177-189), (Alpatov 1996: 136-143), and even not cited by Poppe himself). There are both Dag. soloņ and šāringī in (Poppe 1930: 91, 101). However, Poppe clearly indicates that Dag. soloņ is not just a "dream," but a "dream, bestowed by a shaman [cHOBH/ieHHe, HHcnocjiaHHoe waMaHOM ]" (Poppe 1930: 91). Although in the Mongolie shamanistic tradition rainbows are considered bridges between Heaven and Earth by which a shaman can go to Heaven and spirits can descend to Earth (Manzhigeev 178: 94), the meaning still remains very far-fetched, and, of course, EDAL does not provide any explanation. The case of Dag. šāringī "rainbow" (also found in (Todaeva 1986: 183) is even more instructive: Poppe hon- estly informs his readers that this word is a loan from Ma. šaringga "bright" (Poppe 1930: 101), but EDAL's authors know better, or just sweep the data under the rug. It is well known that Dagur is saturated with loanwords from Manchu, and Ma. šaringga has a transparent internal structure ( šari "brightly, white, glittering" (Zakharov 1875: 666) + -ngga) that provides additional evidence for the direction of borrowing. But apparently any word that has even a remote similarity with Mongolie *sorogga can find its cozy place in EDAL, nothwithstanding the regularity of correspondences, obvious loanword relationships, and far-fetched semantics.

But PM *-r- does not correspond to PA *-1-, therefore Mongolie etymology must be rejected. In addition, anoth- er problem for this etymology lies in morphology: in order to be com- parable to PA *zļola "to shine, to blaze", PM *soroņga "rainbow" must be a derived de verbal noun from something like *soro- "to shine, to blaze," but neither such a stem, no suffix of deverbal nouns *-qga pres- ent themselves in Mongolie. Therefore, this etymology is also to be re- jected on the basis of morphological and phonetic grounds. PT *jal(č)- "to blaze, to flame, lightning" is supported by an impres- sive collection of language data. Although the reflexes of the verb *jaši- "to blaze, to flame" are found only in OT, Karakh., and Chuv., the in- clusion of this meaning at the level of PT reconstruction seems to well supported by the fact that jašin &lt; *jaši-m "lightning" found in many other Turkic languages is an obvious derivation of the verb jaši- "to blaze, to glare." However, even here there is exactly the same problem as we have already seen in (2) above. If one accepts the reconstruction *-lč (for the correspondence of CT š to Chuv. ç), then this verb does not re- present a cognate for other "Altaic" words, because it contains an ele- ment *č that cannot be internally explained away as a suffix. PJ *sas- "to shine" is based on OJ and MJ sas-, STJ sas- with a note: "Usually not distinguished from the homonymous *sas- "to prick, to point", but attested with the meaning "shine" already in Nara OJ" (p. 1519). There is a very good reason for this verb to be "not distin- guished" from PJ *sàs- "to point, to insert" that has already been dis- cussed above in great detail (see number (5)). Not only does this verb have the same accentuation: PJ *sàs- (one can just guess why accent marks were removed by ED AL' s authors in this case - apparently with a goal to help their readers to differentiate between these two verbs that the rest of Japanologists consider to be the same); it does not mean "to shine" in general neither in OJ, nor in modern language. In both OJ and modern Japanese it used in the context describing sunbeams or sunlight pointing/falling on an object or a specific place, e.g.: OJ wata-tu UMÎ-nô TÖYÖ-PATA KUMÔ-ni iri-pî sas-i... "The setting sun shines upon multi- ple stretched clouds over the sea, ..." (MYS I: 15);34 STJ hi-ga yane-ni 34 I follow Omodaka's commentary to MYS in reading this poem (Omodaka 1982.1: 155), for details see (Omodaka 1982.1: 156-159).

There is also MJ fisasi "eaves" and STJ hisasi "visor (of a cap)," "eaves" that historically is a com- pound consisting of hi "sun" and sas-i, the nominalized form of sas- "to point." Visors and eaves are the objects protecting from piercing sunrays, and not something that gets illuminated by the sun. No shining in the sense of illuminating or blazing is described by sas-, because these notions are expressed in both OJ and modern Japanese by the verb ter- ato shine, to blaze." Therefore, the alleged *sas- "to shine" means just "to point," and the Japanese etymology has to be rejected on semantic grounds. PK *sär- "to burn, to make fire" based on MK sär- and SSK sari- is an excellent illustration for the well-known fact that it is not always possi- ble to obtain an underlying MK or SSK stem just by throwing away suf- fix -ta from a dictionary form listed at the beginning of an entry. Some- times knowledge of Korean morphology is needed. In addition, the pitch for MK form is given incorrectly: it is HIGH sói-, not LOW sòl- (see, e.g., Sek XI.42b-43a where MK sól- is used several times and always with HIGH pitch).35 MK sól- behaves like /-dropping verb, but SSK salu- is an /-doubling verb, e.g. salla-yo "makes fire (informal polite form)." This is an obvious contradiction, and we have to look into dialect materials to solve it. Ceycwuto dialect has an /-doubling form: salu-/sallu- (Hyen et al. 293). The -se forms salwase and sallase found in the dialect of Southern Cenlato (Yi et al. 1998: 330-331) suggest that the verb salu- /salwu- found in this dialect is also /-doubling. The dialect of Northern Phyenganto reveals the forms salwu- and salkwu- (Kim 1981: 313) that not only conclusively confirm that the MK /-dropping form sól- is inno- vative, but also indicate what the reconstruction of the stem of our /- doubling verb should be with a final velar: *solok-36 (HL?). Thus, the comparison with "Altaic" can be rejected on morphological grounds: PK *solok- represents a root that cannot be divided any further. Therefore, nothing remains of this "etymology" either, similar to the rest of them. Thus far, I have surveyed eight etymologies that are supposed to sup- port the reconstruction of PA *-í. These eight etymologies are the most 35 Incidentally, the information on correct HIGH pitch is also found in (LCT 425) and in a revised Nam Kwangwu's dictionary (Nam 1997: 945), but EDAL's authors chose to rely on an old outdated dictionary by the same scholar (Nam 1960), that contains nu- merous mistakes. 36 On reconstruction of different types of /-doubling stems see (Martin 1992: 238-240).

The only one etymology that remains is not even one whole etymology, but a part of an etymology: PT *tiāš and PM *čila-pun "stone" are surely connected, because the latter is the Bulghar loan in Mongolie. Everything else, as I believe I was able to demonstrate, is just fata morgana based on an ad hoc morphological analysis, invented se- mantics, inadequate knowledge of the languages involved and their philology, irregular phonetic correspondences found inside and outside of a given branch, and severely limited attestations that have a different explanation. To complete the discussion of these eight etymologies, I believe that a concise presentation on the regularity of the correspondences is in order. Three of the eight etymologies, discussed above, have PA *i, and three have PA *jp reconstructed in the first syllable. Let us see how these PA vowels are reflected in daughter branches: Group 1: PA *i PMT PM PT PJ PK *ííi"work, craft" *i *iiyi *i *i *i *khiia "fetters" *i *e *i *a *a *sīia "sharp stick, toot" *i *i *i/*i *a *a Group 2: PA *jo PMT PM PT PJ PK *siõíe "to mock, to slander" *u *i *iā *3 *ā *tjoíi "stone" * o *i *iā *i *o *zjpía "to shine, to blaze" *u *o *a *a *ã One can clearly see that in the first group only PMT has regular reflexes, and PT comes almost close, with a split reflex in one case. PJ and PK have two different reflexes, and PM has three different reflexes in three etymologies. In the second group, none of the languages have reg- ular reflexes, with PMT, PM, and PT exhibiting two different reflexes and PJ and PK having three different reflexes. The only conclusion that one can reach seeing such "regular" correspondences is that the etymologies presented are in fact comparanda obtained by the method similar to the method of Mass Comparison, but dressed into "pseudo-regularity" clothes. I am sure that the ED AL authors' response will be that different reflexes are conditioned by different vowels in the second syllable, but this is exactly where the fact that ED AL' s "Altaic" is a construct of CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="48">118 Alexander Vovin human mind becomes absolutely clear. Let us take all the vowel se- quences that involve reconstructed PA *¿0 in the first syllable (pp. 125- 129) and let us see how this PA *jo is reflected in daughter languages: sequences PMT PM PT PJ PK with PA *jo CjoCa *u, *0 *a,*o,*u *a, *iā, *2?^ *a, *0, *u *a, *(i)a QoCi *õ, *0, *u *i, *ö *a, *iā, *i *0, *0, *u *(i)a *a, *a QoCe *u, *Q, *0, *ü, *ö, *i, *a, *a, *ā *u, *3, *ua *(j)a, *° *0, *e *(i)a, *(i)ā, *0, *ui, *3, *e, *e *js, *jā CjoCo *i, *ī *0, *u, *ö *0, *õ, *u, *3, *a *i, *js *ü *ü CioCu *ia, *i, *(i)a *i, *e, *u, *0, *u *u, *ua *ja, *j§, *5 *0 *0, *ä, *äi I trust that the reader can see for him/herself how "regular" are the vocalic correspondences. Finally, I would like to use two examples, which, in my opinion, represent all problems typical for the EDAL. The first etymology under consideration is PA *pélaba(nV) "a figure made of stone or clay" &gt; PMT *pelbu, PM *barimal, PT *bAlbal, PJ *páníwá, *panipai, *panima (p. 1084-1085). PMT *pelbu "anthropomorphic pendant for women's hair": Ewk. helbu with reference to (TMS II: 363) with a comment: "Attested only in Ewenki, but having interesting external parallels." Problems begin imme- diately: the authors forgot to tell their readers that helbu is attested just in one Ewenki subdialect: Ilimpi, which is what TMS explicitly states. The Ilimpi subdialect belongs to the Northern Ewenki dialect, where initial h- 37 Japanese reflexes look remarkably more regular than reflexes in other branches. But the reader should not forget that EDAL' s authors adopt an out-of-date reconstruction of PJ that includes only four vowels: *a, *i, *u, *3. As one can see all four happen to re- present PA *jo. CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="49">The End of the Altaic Controversy 119 can have two possible sources: PMT *p- and *s-, in contrast to the South- ern and Eastern Ewenki dialects, where h- is always &lt; PMT *p- (Vasile- vich 1948: 12, 161), (Lebedeva et al. 1985: 8). It is therefore equally pos- sible that this word goes back to *selbu or *pelbu, and since the attesta- tion is limited only to the Ilimpi it is likely that we deal with a loanword from Yakut: sälbi "skin hanging under bull's neck," cf. Yakut sälibiriär "earrings" (&lt; sälibirä- "to dangle, to swing" (Pekarskii 1959.2: 2155, 2157-2158). No word of "Altaic" antiquity here. PM *barimal "sculpture": WM barimal (Lessing 1995: 88), KH bařmal (actually bat*mal, if authors suddenly switch to phonetic transcrip- tion - A. V.) This comparison, as well as the Japanese "cognate" below, are followed by the commentary: "The comparison is very tempting, al- though one has to suppose secondary folk-etymological reanalysis in Mong. (where barimal /a regular development &lt; *balima-r/) is associated with bari- "to build", and in Jpn., where all the variants are associated with patii "red clay." I will come back to Japanese below, but in the case of Mongolie only an uncontrolled urge to create another "Altaic" ety- mology can explain why authors forsake the common sense and start to see a "folk etymology" in the case where internal composition of the word is absolutely transparent: bari- "to build" + -mal/-mel, a fairly pro- ductive suffix of deverbal nouns and adjectives denoting qualities, cf. tuši-mel "minister" &lt; tuši- "to rely on, to lean on," jerge-mal "lark" &lt; jerge- "to chirp," jiru-mal "painted" &lt; jiru- "to paint", biči-mel "writ- ten, letter" &lt; biči- "to write", barla-mal "xylographed" &lt; baria- "to print", neke-mel "woven" &lt; neke- "to weave", širi-mel "quilted" &lt; siri- "to quilt", etc. Probably these also represent folk etymologies and just are waiting for their chance to be granted "interesting external parallels" demonstrating the uselessness and vanity of Mongolian grammar. PT *bAlbal "stone pillar erected on a grave"38 superficially looks like a reduplication bal-bal, which is not a productive device in Turkic, giving the whole word an un-Turkic look. Taking into consideration that the word is attested only in Old Turkic, it seems a kind of a leap to sug- gest its PA origins. There seems to be a consensus among Turkologists on 38 Actually, the exact meaning of the word is: "stone pillar erected on a grave in token of an enemy killed by the deceased and occasionally inscribed with the name of an enemy" (Clauson 1972: 333). It is also important that balbals were always placed in a straight line in south-eastern direction from the stone anthropomorphic figure sym- bolizing the deceased (Maidar 1981: 53). It is an arrangement that is fundamentally different from arrangement of Old Japanese paniwa discussed below. CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="50">1 20 Alexander Vovin both sides of Altaic debate that OT balbal is a loan into Turkic from Mongolie *barimal "sculpture", most likely from the Xianbi language or a closely related dialect that had a form *barmal with syncope typical for Xianbi (Tekin 1968: 99), (Doerfer 1993: 79), (Schönig 2003: 405- 406). Everything pales though when we come to PJ *páníwá, *panipai, *panima "figures of men and animals made of clay," based on OJ paniwa, panipë, and panima. OJ paniwa are the clay objects placed around burial mounds that were created in order to replace human sacrifice during the reign of the emperor Suinin (traditional dating: 29 B. C. E. - 71 C. E., but the actual dates are likely to be in the 4th century C. E.), hence the name paniwa &lt; pani-wa "red clay ring." There is a passage in the Nihonshoki (Annals of Japan, 720 C. E.), describing the whole story (NS VI: 275), 39 but it apparently represents a fairy tale created when ancient Japanese were at a loss what to do with this piece of "Altaic" cultural heritage in their everyday life. Paniwa were never exclusively anthropomorphic or zoomorphic, as there are many paniwa that include clay models of the houses, weapons, and finally just clay cylinders, which are considered to be one of the oldest forms. All this information can be safely secured from the most elementary books on Japanese archeology or cultural history. The word panima is quite specific, as it can refer only to a clay horse, and represents an absolutely transparent compound: pani-ma &lt; pani-uma "red clay horse", with a regular and expected vowel contraction. Needless to say, the word pani "red/yellow clay" is attested in OJ by itself and in compounds that have nothing to do with paniwa as burial objects, e.g. pani-pu "place where red/yellow clay is found." One of such compounds is pani-pë "vessel for rice wine or food made of red clay," which includes word pë "vessel for rice wine or food," quite widely attested in OJ texts, e.g. itu pë "sacred vessel", ipapî pë "vessel for celebration/festival", sasina-bë (&lt; *sasina- n[ô]-pë) "vessel with a spigot", etc. No anthropomorphic or zoomorphic burial figures are involved. Finally, even if one were to take all these comparanda at face value, we are still faced with irregularities in correspondences. Thus, PJ *-n- does not correspond to PMT *-1-, PM *-1- (even if one believes in the non- existent PM *balima-r cooked up from well-attested bari-mal ) and PT 39 Pages are cited according to the reprint of the Nihon koten bungaku taikei edition of the "Nihonshoki" (Sakamoto et al. 1994).

Just combining "double reflexes" for Turkic and Mongolian we get four distinct possibilities: PM *e - PT *e, PM *a - PT *a, PM *e - PT *a, PM *a - PT *e. If this kind of "correspondence" is considered "regular", then one can "prove" anything s/he wants. The second etymology is PA *agà "rain, air" based on PMT *aga "rain" and *agdī40 "thunder," PM *agayar "air, atmosphere", PJ *àkî "autumn", PK *ak-su "heavy rain", with the note: "The Jpn. form may be attributed here if it originally meant "rainy season", autumn is not so rainy in present-day Japan, but it must have been different in the original homeland" (pp. 273-274). Elementary familiarity with climates in East and Central Asia or at least a brief check of handbooks on climate in respective areas would certainly reveal to the authors that it is the summer that is the rainy season not only in Japan, but also in Korea, Manchuria, and Mongolia (including Buriatiia), while autumn tends to be dry and sunny in all these regions (Anuchin 1948: 64, 66-68), (Tsapkin 1948: 14-15), so unless the "Altaic homeland" was located in Moscow, the ety- mology cannot be accepted. There are other serious problems: PK *ak-su is reconstructed solely on the basis of SSK ak-swu and ek-swu (no attestations in MK or dialects), which are both transparent loans from Chinese: ak "bad" ) + swu "water" (7j&lt; ) and ek "oppressive" (ļf|3 ) + swu (7.K ) "water." PMT *aga is not really PMT, but limited only to Manchu, Jurchen, and Sibe, that constitute just one branch within South Tungusic. PJ *aki "autumn" may possible have a PJ status, but Ryukyu- an achi actually means "season for harvesting", and you do not do your harvesting under a heavy rain. It is also possible that PJ word has to be reconstructed with final *-m:41 *akim, thus making the comparison even 40 The *-dī in *agdī remains unexplained: to the best of my knowledge there is no such derivational suffix in PMT, nor it is listed in the list of "Altaic" derivational suffixes on pp. 173-220.

Finally, the reconstruction of PM *agayar "air, atmo- sphere" should rather be *agaxar &lt;*agapar, and the semantic side of the comparison is dubious as well. All this combined information demon- strates that the whole "etymology" is spurious. EDAL was published by Brill, a respectable publishing house in the Netherlands that has a long and distinguished tradition of producing ex- cellent books in various fields of the humanities. However, there are some warning signs that this good reputation may not last forever. It is not quite clear why EDAL was not subjected to a rigorous refereeing process: it seems that such a book that claims to prove a genetic relationship of five language families in Eurasia has to be sent to at least five or better ten scholars, having at least one or two who are the recognized specialists in each language family. It is hard to believe that Brill received even five positive referee reports. It is even less clear why Brill's production editor let this book go to the printer with a great number of technical flaws. For example, the bibliography looks like a bibliography written for a Russian publishing house: no page numbers for any articles, no indication of publishers for books. It is also divided into two bibliographies: one for sources in Russian (pp. 255-265) and one for sources in all other languages (pp. 241-255), exactly how it is done in Russia. However, these standards are not admissible in an English language publication. The romanization of Chinese sources mixes Pinyin and Wade-Giles transcrip- tions, e.g. Menggu yuzu yuyen cidien (p. 246), and the romanization of Korean sources mixes Yale and McCune-Reischauer systems, e.g. Kuge ekwi sa yengu (p. 245). There are other technical flaws, e.g., the chart on p. 143 is badly misprinted. Some abbreviations of language names found in the text do not appear in the list of abbreviations on pp. 267-269, e.g. Mongr. presumably stands for Mongor (i.e., Monguor), but one cannot find it on p. 268 where it should be. The text was not checked carefully by an English-language editor, as some sentences are just ungrammatical, e.g. "The TM form is not borrow &lt; Mong." (p. 274). I believe I have presented enough to be able to come to the following conclusion: EDAL fails to prove genetic relationship of Tungusic, Mong- olie, Turkic, Korean and Japonic, and it is, therefore, another etymolo- gical dictionary of a non-existing language family, which should come as usual, with some factual mistakes: e.g., contrary to Starostin's claim, some manu- scripts of the dictionary Ruiju Myôgishô (1081 C. E.) are believed to reflect 2.5 class with the töten "eastern dot" (ļElfi ) that is placed right at the middle at the side of a syllabic letter. CAJ 49/1 (2005)</page><page sequence="53">The End of the Altaic Controversy 123 no surprise, since one of its authors has already co-authored an etymol- ogical dictionary of another non-existing family: North Caucasian (Niko- layev &amp; Starostin 1994). Thus, ED AL really puts an end to the Altaic controversy, but not quite the way its authors envisioned. Several years ago Doerfer observed in reference to the Altaic hypothesis that "Nostrat- ism has developed, but did not improve" (Doerfer 1995: 252). I would add that it became much worse: the fathers of Nostratic theory might have been honestly mistaken in their interpretation of the data, but I do not think that any of them ever tried to squeeze the data in the Procrustean bed of the theory. The only tangible explanation for everything that can be seen in ED AL in that respect, is that the Altaic hypothesis at least in its Moscow version became a set of beliefs highly reminiscent of a religion. However, religion and science cannot coexist, because the first is based on faith, while the second seeks the explanation of the facts that are in need of explanation. EDAL does not explain these facts, it simply creates the "evidence" for the pre-existing belief that is, of course, non-evidence. None of the real problems in the histories of Tungusic, Mongolie, Turkic, Korean, and Japonic are addressed in this book, simply because its authors are not interested in solving these problems. Consequently, EDAL' s "Altaic" does not offer any valuable insights into the history of, let us say, Tungusic in the same way as Indo-European offers valuable insights into the history of Germanic. Quite to the contrary, it obscures the history of all five language families by its religious approach that sometimes results even in distortion and/or falsification of the data. EDAL will surely become another part of Nostratic Holy Scriptures for true believers, but for the rest of us who are interested in a real linguistic prehistory of Central and East Asia it is a curio, although a very expensive one. Specialists will be amused at best, but I have no doubt journalists and Proto- Worlders will hail EDAL as a "great achievement." But, well, we should hardly be concerned about them - they will all drown in the River of Time, since they do not know the Ford.
