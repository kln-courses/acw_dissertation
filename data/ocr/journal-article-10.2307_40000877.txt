<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mytho-Theology in Ancient Egypt Vincent Arieh Tobin I. An analysis of Egyptian religion is a matter which may be approached by one of two methods. The simpler of these methods is to view the religion of Egypt as a strictly polytheistic system, one which contained a number of different gods each of whom was responsible for a specific aspect of life and the world. Such an interpreta- tion would, for example, state that Shu was the god of the air, Hathor the goddess of sexuality and love, Geb the god of the earth, and Nut the goddess of the sky. We could proceed further to divide the whole of human experience among the various other Egyptian deities, and thus produce a picture of an ordered divine pantheon whose function was the protection of all areas of man's existence. Such an interpretation would further imply that the Egyptians had evolved a highly fundamentalist approach to religion and had expressed no higher spiritual aspirations than the veneration of a set of totally anthropomorphic deities. The actual content of the religion, therefore, could be said to be the mythology through which the actions of these deities were expressed, there being no attempts at a more abstract and philosophical speculation. Such an interpretation does contain a cer- tain amount of truth. The ancient Egyptians were neither philosophically nor theologically minded, and hence spiritual and religious values required an expression which was concrete and anthropomorphic. Nor can there be any doubt that to many of the common people religion must have meant no more than a literal accep- tance of the mythological gods. At the same time, however, there is another method of viewing the religion of ancient Egypt, one which is more legitimately in keeping with the mythic nature of that religion. This interpretation will view the mythology of Egypt for what in effect mythology truly is: an attempt to give concrete expression to an abstract reality. Unlike the later Greek, the Egyptian had not yet developed the intellectual ability to think in abstract terms. As a result, there was developed, particularly through the agency of the priestly classes, a system wherein the gods, although expressed in anthropomor- phic terms, functioned, nevertheless, more as mythic symbols than anthropomorphic deities. The gods of Egypt, therefore, even though they were worshipped and portrayed as individual personal deities, must be understood on a higher level as component parts in a wider mythic system of thought. Within the confines of the various individual cults, each god had a certain identity and character of his own; but within the context of the various corpora of Egyptian religious texts, it is possible and quite legitimate to see the individual gods as having a more important mythic and symbolic value and signifi- cance. We cannot, of course, properly claim that the Egyptians had developed a theological system, but we can quite correctly speak of an Egyptian my tho- theological system, one which expressed through the mythic symbols of its gods and its traditions the abstract concepts which later civi- lizations would express through an abstract philosophy or theology. The hallmark of the Egyptian system of thought was the fact that its expression of such abstractions was forced to retain a concrete manner of articulation. In its structure and make-up Egyptian religion was totally unlike the forms of religion known in the modern western world. It contained no doctrine or dogma; it had no set and required beliefs; there was no standard of orthodoxy which its adherents were expected to accept. In fact, the very contrary appears to have been the case, for Egyptian religion has been described as 169</page><page sequence="2">170 JARCE XXV (1988) consisting of a "confused mass of material" ! and as being made up of a number of "unrelated local cults."2 It contained what Henri Frankfort has called a "multiplicity of approaches" as well as a "multiplicity of answers." Egyptian religion was, therefore, marked by an exceedingly high degree of freedom of belief, and, except for the short-lived Amarna period under the heretic pharaoh Akhenaten, the concept of religious heterodoxy was totally unknown to the Egyp- tians. All of the symbols and expressions of the various local cults and traditions were regarded as valid and correct expressions of religious faith, and internal contradictions in articulation were seen as both acceptable and natural. Egypt's complex mythological system has been aptly described as being "completely free of those logics which eliminate one of two contradictory concepts and press religious ideas into a system of dogmas."3 Such an approach to the content of a religion can only be possible when it is quite obvious that the concrete expressions of that religion are indeed mythic and symbolic in nature and are not intended to be taken as factual dogmatic statements of a literal "truth." Such a flexible approach to the realm of the spiritual appears to be the most positive feature of the religion of ancient Egypt, for this approach enabled it to encompass virtually any religious symbol as a valid expression of abstract reality. This freedom of Egyptian religion from doc- trine and dogma has led some interpreters to suggest that even mythology played a role of relatively small importance,4 and that the main emphasis of Egyptian religion was the perfor- mance of the cultic rituals. Such an interpretation would naturally imply that any stress on the mythological content of Egyptian religion would strongly distort the true nature of that religion, such a distortion being even greater if we were to attempt to stress doctrine or dogma. Such an assertion, however, must be tempered by a realization of the nature of the cultic ritual in ancient Egypt. Cult, not only in Egypt but in any religious system, is an expression of myth and not simply a performance of empty and meaning- less rituals. In Egypt the cultic ritual was the visible and dramatized expression of the mytho- logical content of religion. If, therefore, we interpret Egyptian religion as having its main basis in the cult, we must, nevertheless, consider also the mythic symbols of which that cult is the expression, for it is in these mythic symbols that the basic spiritual and theological values of Egyptian religion are to be found. In considering Egyptian mythology, however, we must be careful not to be misled by any comparison of it with the mythology of ancient Greece. In contrast to Greek mythology, the myths of Egypt do not present us with highly developed and intricate narrative patterns. There are, in other words, very few stories and traditions about the Egyptian gods; there are very few actions and deeds of the gods preserved in any narrative compositions. This, however, does not prevent the Egyptian gods from being the mythic symbols which the cultic rituals expressed, mythic symbols which themselves gave expression to an abstract reality. In actual fact it may indeed be this very poverty of mythological material which enabled the Egyptian gods to be what in effect they were, "an enunciation of a reality and not an explanation of this reality."5 The lack of mythological detail prevented the Egyptian myths from becoming dogmatic and doctrinal state- ments. Hence the gods of Egypt were able to function as symbols which articulated the assur- ance that behind the visible world there lay a realm which could not be comprehended by the intellect but which could be apprehended by mythic and cultic experience. Despite the non-dogmatic and non-doctrinal nature of the religion of Egypt, there was, nevertheless, one fundamental idea which may be seen as the basic doctrinal content of that religion. This was the idea that the world and the universe were parts of a strict and unchanging order of stability. This order was an expression of 1 H.

To the Egyptian mind Macat was both an abstract idea and concept of universal stability as well as the personalized goddess who represented and upheld that order. According to the Egyptian mythical expressions, Macat had come into existence at the time of the creation and con- tinued to be the principle which guaranteed and assured the on-going stability of that creation. Within this order of Macat, the universe, the world, and the political state all had their appointed place; and it was within this same order that each individual also was able to find meaning and significance for his own existence. In effect Macat governed every aspect of human, political, and natural life. Even matters as relatively minute as individual personal etiquette could be said to be encompassed by Macat. Every human action was evaluated not by a prescribed system of laws and rules, but by how far it conformed to the general principle of right and order which was expressed by Macat. It was the assurance of the stability of Macat which gave the Egyptian his confidence that the world in which he lived was stable and unchanging; it was Macat which prevented the world and the universe from dissolving into chaos and disorder. Macat, in short, could well be seen as the Egyptian con- sciousness of the existence of a transcendent divine power which was the basis and ground for all being and existence. If the religion of Egypt and the cult through which that religion was expressed could be said to have any one funda- mental doctrine and purpose, it was to uphold and renew the order of Macat. The cultic ritual was performed on its daily basis as well as at the great festivals for the one main purpose of affirming the existence of Macat and of bringing into actual reality the order and stability symbol- ized by that figure. In view of such a purpose, we may well state that Egypt's religious cultic practices were practical and pragmatic to the highest degree, for they were designed to streng- then and ensure the cosmic order by the dramatic performance of the mythical concepts on which they were based. In brief, Egyptian religion meant no less than the recognition of universal stability, and to be religious would have implied the conscious attempt to remain within the bounds and requirements of that same stability. The sense of order and stability which was characteristic of Egyptian religion may be seen as natural when one considers the two chief sources of Egyptian religious consciousness. One of these sources, and probably the main one, was the order and stability so evident in the natural world. The regular rising and falling of the Nile, the daily return of the sun, and the constant recurrence of the seasons all pointed to the unfailing assurance that the positive powers of life and light would always overcome the negative forces of darkness and death. Unlike the area of Mesopotamia, Egypt was not forced to live in fear of the unpredictable, and often destructive, power of nature. In the natural phenomena the Egyptians saw no evidence of threats of disaster, but rather the guarantee that the forces of nature were positive and productive of life. Nature and the universe were in their very essence good to mankind; therefore the gods in which the Egyp- tian personified the natural forces were also good. It was obvious to them that death with its destructive effects was not the ultimate force in the universe. That ultimate force was rather to be seen in the power of the life which was so evident in the natural world. Hence, the Egyptian knew, by a kind of natural revelation, that life would constantly overcome death and that order would overcome disorder. A similar assurance was given to the Egyptians in the stability of the political order which had been established at the time of the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt at the start of the dynastic period. With the land united under a stable monarchy, and with the institution of the kingship deified by its association with the figures of Horus and Osiris, the former of these deities being actually incarnate in the ruling monarch, there was need of no other signs or symbols of both natural and political stability. The very person of the monarch served as a guarantee that the reality of Macat could not be permanently threatened in the political and social order; the ruler himself was expected to function as the effective agent of maintaining Macat and restoring it whenever it might be thrown out of balance through some accident or mistake in human action. As a result, the Old Kingdom of Egypt was able to develop an extremely high degree of optimism about life and</page><page sequence="4">172 JARCE XXV (1988) the world, and this optimism in turn was reflected in the positive mythic symbols of the religion and in the cult which both affirmed and effected the reality of Macat in the universe and in human affairs. If we were, therefore, to attempt to point to one characteristic Egyptian religious emotion, we would have to state that that emotion was one of a joyful celebration of the stable and unchanging nature of the universe in which man lived. That this universe should be stable and unchanging was the primary goal and purpose of the power of Macat. Due to the abstract nature of this concept of order, its expression had to be articulated by means of a pattern of concrete mythic symbols. Thus the mythology of Egypt was not just a collection of fantastic legends of the gods, nor was it a simplistic way of explaining the existence and working of the universe. The myths of the gods were not intended to be accepted as literal beliefs. The myth was rather a symbol which had been evolved to express "the infinite complexity of divine power".6 The myth-makers of Egypt appear to have recognized the fact that the dichotomy between the world of human experi- ence and the world of the divine was so great that the latter could be represented only through the means of myth and symbol, no literal description being possible. The various mythic symbols and narratives were in no way intended to define the world of the divine, but rather to give expression to the concept that the creation and the universe do have a real significance and meaning.7 The myths could not, of course, provide in any allegorical fashion a precise definition of this meaning, but they could point to its existence and provide at least an experiential apprehension of it. Unlike the "myths" of the epic poetry of Homer, the Egyptian myths were designed not merely to entertain but to edify, and beyond edification, actually to effect the reality which they symbolized. For the Egyptian mind, the divine world, and to a certain extent even the visible world, was something which was mysterious and totally other than the world of normal human compre- hension. Human intellectual abilities were, there- fore, not capable of grasping or articulating its nature and structure. As a result the Egyptian mentality used the one means which was com- prehensible for such articulation, and hence to speak of the mythic tradition of ancient Egypt as "mythological rubbish"8 is to misunderstand totally the function of true myth. Far from being "rubbish," Egyptian mythology served as the one viable means of expressing the wholly other world and realm of the divine. The actual time of the mythological traditions, the period at which they were said to have taken place, was usually the far distant past, a period beyond the normal experience of man. At the same time, however, the myths of Egypt were also applicable to the contemporary world in which they were articulated and dramatized. The true realm of Egyptian mythology was the realm of eternity; the myths were in effect timeless, designed to bring about in the present an "actualization of the mythic pantheon."9 Such an actualization was the primary purpose of the cultic dramatization of the myth. In the cultic ritual the dramatization of the myth functioned as a type of revelation of the divine world; but due to the fact that such a revelation remained in symbolic terms, the aspect of the secret and mysterious nature of the divine world was not violated. In such a manner the Egyptians were able to experience the world of the divine in a sacramental manner without running the risk of committing the blasphemy of claiming an actual intellectual comprehension of that world. It is important to note here that the cultic performance of a myth was not a mere com- memoration of an event which had taken place in the distant past. It was in effect an attempt to make real in the present moment that same mythic action and to actualize its significance in the present moment. In such a manner, for example, the priesthood of Heliopolis would have given cultic actualization to the creation myth of Atum-Re, and would have thus re-created in the present moment the original action of the establishment of the world. The pragmatic pur- 6 H. Frankfort, Ancient Egyptian Religion, 19. 7 C. J. Bleeker, Egyptian Festivals, 11. 8 A. H. Gardiner, Egypt of the Pharaohs (Oxford, 1961) 227. 9 S.

The detailed content of the myth was of little actual importance. What was im- portant was the fact of expressing in symbolic terms the basic concept which the mythic symbol embodied. The articulation within the cultic ritual of the concept of order and stability in creation brought about the actualization of Macat within the world of human experience, thus allowing the cult to function as a sacrament of the divine stability of the universe and of the world in which man lived. II. The gods of the Egyptians, although always portrayed in anthropomorphic and theriomor- phic forms, were not such simplistic beings as their iconography might suggest. Again one must remember that, like the symbols of the mythic tradition, the portraits of the gods should also be taken in a symbolic manner. Such a symbolic portrayal of the gods was a necessity because, like every other aspect of the divine world, the gods were mysterious and indefinable, their true essence being unknown to mortal man who could hope to know them only after death when he would be capable of perceiving the true forms of the gods.10 The fact that the gods were unknowable to man arose from the fact that they were holy (dsr), which implies that they were different than and separate from11 man; they were secret,12 and hence their essence and true being could be neither described nor portrayed. How- ever, even though the gods were unknowable, man could nevertheless experience them; and he experienced them as being beneficial and good (nfr) to man and the world in keeping with the positive and optimistic nature of the outlook engendered by the realization of Macat. Indeed it was the main function of the gods to see to it that this same order of Macat was supported and upheld. The gods of Egypt, at least in their mythic representations, were seen as personal deities; if they had not been so, they could have made no appeal to the non-abstract Egyptian mentality. Their true value, however, went far beyond their personal nature. Most importantly, the gods of Egypt must be seen as mythic personifications of the various aspects and powers of the world. The very name of Amun, for example, meant "he who is hidden," the secret and unknown force which upholds the universe. Nun was the primaeval water, Kuk the darkness, and Huh infinity. Geb was the earth with its procreative power in Osiris, while Nut was the goddess who personified the sky. This deification of the natural phe- nomena and the natural forces constituted a recognition by the ancient Egyptian of the essentially mystical nature of his environment. Hence, he was able to apprehend and experience the rational and ordered nature of the universe, even though he could not give rational articula- tion to it. The mythical aspect of the gods lay in the fact that they were symbolic of deeper forces and powers than man could comprehend. The gods of Egypt, however, were not mythical in the same sense that the Homeric gods were mythical, for the Egyptian gods appear to have had no extended mythological narratives associated with them. Nevertheless, this latter fact does not decrease the mythic value of the Egyptian gods; if anything, it enhances such value, for it prevented the gods from becoming the subjects of mere narrative legends and fables. By their refusal to develop a complex system of legends and sagas, the Egyptian gods were able to retain their value as full mythic figures right up until the end of their history as a viable religious concept. The mythic value of the gods lay in the fact that when taken as a whole they could function as symbols of the totality and completeness of all things. The very name of the creator god Atum signifies something like "he who is complete",13 that is, the one who contains within himself the fullness of all things. The sacredness of the life- giving creative force was symbolized in the figures of Min of Coptos and Ptah of Memphis. In Osiris there was deified the natural life-force of the earth and the resulting rebirth of the dead 10 CT VI, 69c, 72d. 11 PT 1778b. 12 WbV, 610. 13 See R. Anthes JNES XVIII (1959) 177.</page><page sequence="6">174 JARCE XXV (1988) in the next world. The sun god Re of Heliopolis provided a deification of the creative power of the sun, as did the later figure of the Aten in Akhenaten's system during the Amarna period. Even the deity Sokar, a god of the dead somewhat related to Osiris, appears to signify the potenti- ality of death to reproduce life, and the main purpose of his festival seems to have been to ensure the constant generation of life.14 The mythic symbolism of the sun god Re and his daily journey in the sunboat served for the Egyptian as an assurance of the daily rebirth of the sun and the return of the natural life and activity of the world, the latter idea also being very strongly emphasized in the figure of the Aten during the Amarna period. It is significant to note that most of the Egyptian male deities have associated with them a female counterpart. We may note, for example, Osiris and Isis, Amun and Mut, Ptah and Sekhmet, Horus and Hathor, Geb and Nut, Shu and Tefnut. Such a pairing of the masculine and feminine appears to be more than just a sense of balance, as has been suggested.15 Rather it appears as a recognition of the necessary complementary aspects of the male and female as concerns regeneration and procreation. This is particularly evident in the fact that from such divine pairs there frequently comes an offspring indicative of the results of the procreative power. The off- spring of such divine couples are then associated with their parents to form a number of divine triads which function as symbols of the con- tinuity of life. In such a manner the mythic systems of Egypt deified the principle of procrea- tion and regeneration, this principle becoming an integral part of the cosmic order of the universe. To summarize the gods of Egypt, we may state that in their deepest essence they were mythic symbols of the active power of creation, life, and regeneration. They were symbolic too of order and stability in the universe, especially the figure of Macat, and through them such order and stability were maintained and assured. Because the gods were different from man, they were beyond his comprehension. They were not, however, beyond his apprehension, for they could be experienced in the universe and in life itself. The gods were of necessity many, for the complexity of the divine world could not be comprehended in any one single symbol. The one attempt to do so, that of Akhenaten, failed because it was so totally foreign to the Egyptian religious experience. However, beyond the poly- theistic symbolism of Egyptian religion one can comprehend that the Egyptian intellect was able to sense some unarticulated unity in the divine force which upheld the universe. This was the primary meaning of the Egyptian gods: they were the very force and essence of the cosmic life which expressed itself in the totality of all things. III. The symbolic nature of Egyptian religion is perhaps best illustrated in the creation myth- ology. Such creation myths were not intended as historical and factual accounts of the manner and method by which the universe emerged, although they did provide a type of articulation of the way by which things had come into existence. They did not, however, give a precise answer to the question of how the world had come into being, at least not in terms of the actual mechanics of creation. The Egyptians were quite likely aware of the fact that such myths were of a non-historical nature, intended only to express symbolically the make-up of the universe.16 Hence, we may not maintain that the Egyptians had several doctrines or dogmas of creation. They had rather several myths of creation, several sets of symbols which were used to articulate the same reality. As a result, they were able to attribute the creation of the universe to such different deities as Atum, Ptah, or Amun without seeing any inherent contradiction. We may, therefore, speak of a single Egyptian con- cept of creation, but not of a single expression of that creation. Nor was the creator deity required to be one and the same in every creation myth, with the exception of the Amarna period when creative powers were attributed to the Aten alone. 14 C. J.

At Memphis Ptah was said to have created the world, particularly through the agency of the spoken word as seen in the document known as the Memphite Theology. At Elephantine it was the potter god, Khnum, who was the agent of creation. All of these creator deities were for the Egyptian not actual anthropomorphic gods who had acted in a specific manner to bring the universe into being; they were rather symbols of the mysterious and undefinable force of life and generation which was naturally inherent within the divine. Creation itself, however, was not a symbol. In Egyptian thought, the universe had come into being at a specific time in the past, and, accord- ing to the Pyramid Texts, there had been a time when nothing had existed,17 at least nothing specific and tangible. This does not, however, mean that the Egyptians had evolved a doctrine of creation out of nothing, for in the period before creation there had existed the primaeval waters of Nun, symbolic of chaos and disorder, the unbounded, and the negative infinite. At the same time, this Nun contained within itself the full creative potential, embodying both the mascu- line and feminine principles necessary for pro- creation and generation. This primaeval water appears to have been the foundation of all Egyptian creation mythology, being a common symbol in all the mythic systems.18 Within the primaeval waters were begotten the Heh gods, all symbolic of chaos, infinity, and shapelessness, each of the masculine Heh gods being balanced by a female counterpart, a recognition of the positive creative power naturally inherent within the chaos. Out of the primaeval water there emerged the sun god, the creator Atum-Re, whose very name, Atum, symbolizes fullness or completion, the total potentiality for all created being. Atum-Re, seated upon the primaeval mound which had also arisen out of Nun, then produces by himself (either by spitting or by masturbation) Shu and Tefnut (the latter being also identified with Macat) both of whom are symbolic of breath and order. Shu and Tefnut, respectively male and female, may now be seen as symbols of the actualization of regenerative power, the power which in both its masculine and feminine principles had already been in- herent within Atum-Re who is called the "he/ she".19 By the division of the creative principle into two distinct male and female hypostases, the Egyptian myth-makers had created in Shu and Tefnut individual deities who could symbolize the actuality of the creative force. As a natural consequence, Shu and Tefnut then beget Geb and Nut, respectively the earth and sky, respec- tively male and female, thus giving a concrete expression to the created order by the emergence of the actual physical structure of the universe. The figures which emerge in the next step of this mythic system (which is basically the system of Heliopolis) are Osiris and Isis, Seth and Nephthys, in both of which pairs the masculine and feminine are also balanced. Of these latter deities, it is Osiris and Isis who bear the strongest mythic importance, Osiris being the personifica- tion of ordered political stability in the fact that he inherits the kingship from Atum through Geb, and Isis being in effect the personification of the royal throne and its ruling power. The full mythic impact of the Heliopolitan tradition was thus extended as far as the political organization which governed Egypt, such a political structure being, therefore, an integral part of the divinely created universal order.20 We may note here in passing the strong element of sexual symbolism in the Egyptian creation mythology, a symbolism which was expressed in the male/female pairing of the deities within the Heliopolitan system. We must not, however, place an overly heavy stress on this sexual imagery, for the intention of the 17 PT 1466: n hprt pt n hprt tS n hprt rmt m mst ntrw n hprt mt The sky had not yet come into being, The earth had not yet come into being, Mankind had not yet come into being, The gods had not yet been born, Death had not yet come into being. 18 Clark, Myth and Symbol, 35. 19 CT II, 161a. 20 An extended treatment of the Osiris tradition with its political over tones may be found in R.

This sexual symbol- ism even found an expression in the relatively myth-free system of Akhenaten during the Amarna movement, where the deity of that movement, the Aten, is addressed: "You are the mother and father of everyone whom you cre- ate."21 The point which we must stress in considering such imagery is that for the Egyptian the creation of the universe was symbolically expressed through the usage of the imagery of birth, and as a result the universe was seen as a vital and living organism. Such was totally in agreement with the Egyptian affirmation of the reality and sanctity of the life force as opposed to the destructive forces of death and disorder so evident in the figure of the god Seth. In Egyptian thought, the mythic symbolism of the creation was an affirmation and celebration of the reality and indestructable force and power of life. The ultimate result of the Egyptian mythic accounts of the creation was the conception of Macat. Macat may be variously described as a symbol or abstract idea of order and right, as the force of universal and unchanging stability, or as a personal goddess who embodies and enforces the latter. To see Macat as only a personal goddess would be to underestimate its nature. It is true that Macat was personified and that she was the object of cultic worship, but this was no more than a way of giving expression to the existential reality of such a concept. Macat represented, perhaps even more than the idea of a creator god, the real foundation stone of the spirituality of Egypt. Macat was seen as the force which ensured the order and stability of all creation, of the state and of life itself. Macat was something which could not cease to exist, some- thing which could not change or evolve, some- thing which was perfect and complete from the very beginning. Without Macat neither the cre- ated universe nor the gods would be able to exist. Macat has been aptly described as "the cosmic force of harmony, order, stability and security, . . . the organizing quality of created phenomena . . . the just and proper relationship of cosmic phenomena".22 As a result of this concept of the eternally stable and unchanging nature of Macat, the Egyptians evolved a highly optimistic outlook on the world, or perhaps one might say that the development of Macat was a consequence of the optimism which already existed in Egyptian society, optimism justified because of the regu- larity of the Egyptian world. The pleas of the Eloquent Peasant, so well known from the text which bears the same title, are all based on the assurance that Macat is "mighty, great, and enduring".23 As a powerful force for justice and the maintenance of moral right, Macat provided both the justification of moral action and the ability to perform such action. A world wherein Macat did not exist or was at least disregarded would have been for the Egyptian totally un- acceptable. Such a situation is graphically de- scribed in the text known as the "Dispute of a Man with his Ba," wherein there is portrayed an individual who actually contemplates suicide because of the breakdown of order and morality within the land. Under normal circumstances, however, Macat, the very principle of creation, was ordered, regular, and benevolent, an assur- ance that the universe was essentially good and righteous. Macat bound all things together in an indestructable unity: the universe, the natural order, the state, and the individual were all component parts of the order of Macat. The result was the conception of a perfect universe which could never be totally destroyed. Although from time to time this order might be disrupted and thrown out of balance through human error or folly, Macat provided the assurance that in the final outcome order would again be restored and life be enabled to continue on its normally positive course. Within the order of creation and Macat, the Egyptian king, the pharaoh, played a role of central importance. Although the theological formulations concerning this individual were highly complex and elaborate, let it suffice for the 21 M. Sandman, Texts from the Time of Akhenaten (Brux- elles, 1938) 12.10. 22 J. Wilson, The Culture of Ancient Egypt (University of Chicago Press, 1951)48. 23 The Eloquent Peasant Bl, 320-21.</page><page sequence="9">MYTHO-THEOLOGY IN ANCIENT EGYPT 177 present purpose to say that he was the earthly embodiment of the power of Macat and the effective agent through which the latter was realized within the political and social spheres of Egypt. As the incarnation of Horus, specifically Horus as he was portrayed in the mythic tradition of the conflict with Seth, the pharaoh was the direct heir of Osiris, and through him the direct heir of the divine kingship which had originally been established at the time of the creation of the universe. As such he had both the ability and the duty to be the upholder of Macat within the earthly sphere, and his very words and pro- nouncements were regarded as embodiments of the eternal principles for which Macat stood. The pharaoh has been well described as "a token of the efficacious power of the creator god in the world,"24 and, being such, it was his function to see to it that the order of Macat, established at the time of creation, was upheld and realized within Egyptian politics and society. Because of such a role on the part of the pharaoh, it was only at a very late date that official law codes came into existence in Egypt. Throughout the great periods of the history of Egypt, such law codes were totally unnecessary. It could perhaps even have been regarded as a blasphemy to think of substituting a dead law code for the living word of the pharaoh in whom the principles of Macat were actually alive and vital. He was an integral element in the divinely created order, an integral element in the practical functioning of the power of Macat. In a word, the pharaoh represented the embodiment of all power and authority, and this power and authority was the very power of the divine realm. In short, the person of the pharaoh was the guarantee of the divine presence of the gods on earth. The Egyptian mythic system could have developed no stronger symbol of the reality of the divine power than this. Further- more, through his priestly power the pharaoh also functioned as an assurance of the mediation of the natural blessings of the gods to the land of Egypt. The place of the pharaoh within the Egyptian my tho- theological system can be briefly summed up. The pharaoh was the one means whereby Macat was maintained on earth. When he as- cended the throne as ruler, Macat was again re-established and revealed as it has been origi- nally at the time of the creation. Throughout the duration of his life he was the living and ever- present symbol of the continuation of Macat. When the obvious order of Macat was threatened or disturbed, it was the pharaoh who was expected to take positive action to restore that order to its proper place. In this one individual there was summed up the true basis for the security of the Egyptian state and of the universe itself. Each individual was, therefore, assured of his own stability and the stability of his future within the cosmic order. Perhaps the greatest achievement of the Egyptian my tho- theological synthesis was this unity and purpose which it was able to give to the whole of the universe and to the whole of human experience. IV. The unity of existence was further expressed in Egyptian mythic symbolism through the figure of Osiris. In many ways Osiris could even be said to be the most central of the gods of Egypt, for he was connected with the kingship as the deified figure of the dead pharaoh, and also with the life of nature, and also, eventually, with the eternal life of each individual. No one origin can strictly be assigned to the figure of Osiris, and we are probably correct in assuming that he was a deity who had evolved from a number of different sources as an answer to several distinct aspira- tions. What concerns us, however, is the final picture of Osiris which emerged over a number of centuries. Nor should we be overly dogmatic in trying to reconstruct the details of the Osiris myth. That Osiris had a number of mythical activities and roles connected with him there can obviously be no doubt. More questionable, how- ever, is the total myth of Osiris, a myth which appears to be of almost epic proportions. It is only through the writings of Plutarch that we possess any full extended account of the Osiris myth, and here we must seriously question whether Plutarch had simply reported the myth of Osiris as he had learned it from authentic Egyptian sources, or whether he had constructed 24 E. Hornung, Conceptions of God in Ancient Egypt: The One and the Many (London, 1983) 142 (translated by J. Baines from the original German Der Eine und die Vielen).</page><page sequence="10">178 JARCE XXV (1988) a narrative myth in the Greek style out of the original Egyptian elements. The latter appears somewhat more likely to have been the case, insofar as the Egyptian sources give no full and complete narration of any one accepted Osirian mythical tradition. Any attempt to reconstruct such a fully developed mythical tradition with regard to Osiris could well lead us to a misunder- standing of the true nature of the deity. One must, rather, see the figure of Osiris as he was represented in the various symbols connected with him. Above all else (and perhaps this will in fact fully define the nature of the deity), Osiris may be seen as the principle of natural life and its continuity. He was the actual power and force of fertility,25 being immanent and inherent within nature. As a deity of the life of nature, it was a logical step for Osiris to become eventually the god of individual immortality, man's life also being seen as part of the wider manifestation of the power of universal life. Although originally, at least in certain mythic traditions, a demon,26 Osiris was, even during the Old Kingdom, accepted into the ranks of Egypt's official gods and made into a positive force of eternal life. The most obvious manifestations of Osiris were to be seen in the phenomena of nature. He was present in the growing grain and the vegetation of the land; he was seen also in the waters of the Nile, often called the "great efflux of Osiris," for it was these waters which gave the land its fertility and allowed it to produce. It would be a mistake, however, simply to make the identification between Osiris and the earth or the waters. Osiris was more than this; he was the abstract source of fertility and life which was contained within the water.27 From his observa- tion of the unfailing return of the life of nature, the Egyptian must have very easily become aware that Osiris would also bring about the resurrec- tion of each individual after death. Hence, Osiris finally reached his full potential as the god who could afford immortality to every man, the latter function being by far his most important aspect even though it was but an extension of his true nature. Osiris, however, in virtue of his place within the Heliopolitan Ennead and mythic system, was also a god of order, and as such he may be further seen as a revelation of the Egyptian concept of Macat. As the ruler who had inherited the kingship from his father Geb, and hence from Atum-Re, Osiris was also the symbol of the ideal terrestrial kingship; but because the created universe was to the Egyptian consciousness an actual living organism, Osiris' identification with natural life was also a logical one. The political world and the world of nature were for the Egyptian one and the same order, and the unity of that order was aptly represented in the figure of the god Osiris. However, unlike the more abstract symbol of life which one sees in Atum-Re, Osiris appears as more concrete, more immanent, more closely connected with the life and experience of each individual. It was perhaps for this reason that his popularity grew to the bounds which it eventually attained. The perfect order which was so evident in the world which revealed Osiris had also, in the thought of the Egyptian, to be able to overcome the negative aspect of death and destruction both as regards the wider order and as regards the individual. The optimism engendered by the concept of Macat could not be complete unless man was no longer threatened by eternal annihilation. It was, therefore, a natural process that the Egyptian should have arrived at a belief in the rebirth and immortality of the individual, and no more suitable god than Osiris could be found with whom to connect this hope which became one of the distinguishing characteristics of the religion of Egypt. The promise of personal immortality thus became one of the most positive and beneficial aspirations which the Egyptian reli- gion gave to the world. The concept of the dying and rising god was one which appears to have exerted a tremendous influence on later religious development, not the least of its effects being quite evident within the mythology of the Chris- tian tradition. The most evident sphere of the interest and activity of Osiris was within the realm of individual immortality. The concept that eternal life could be attained by all men was a belief 25 Clark, Myth and Symbol, 97. 26 See, for example, PT 145b-c, 146a-b, 1267a-b; LI 111, 295h-296a, 3O4f-g, VI, 79-81, 82-85; BD XVII, 30. 27 J. H. Breasted, Development of Religion and Thought in Ancient Egypt (New York, 1959) 20 (reprint of the 1912 ed.).</page><page sequence="11">MYTHO-THEOLOGY IN ANCIENT EGYPT 179 which arose as a result of the confusion and chaos of the First Intermediate Period. Un- doubtedly such a belief would have arisen natur- ally even without this latter impetus, for it is quite obviously a natural extension of the concept of the wider order of the life of the universe and nature. It is important to note, however, that the belief in the afterlife was a secondary develop- ment in Egyptian thought, and was based on the mythic system which had already evolved. The mythic system had been designed for the wider purpose of expressing the reality of universal order, not simply for satisfying the hopes and aspirations of individuals. Egyptian mytho-theology had relatively little to say about the nature of man. He had been brought into being by the creator god, but more by accident than as a purposeful creation as in Hebrew thinking. Nor did the mythic system say a great deal about the final end of man, at least in the early period, except for the king whose eventual purpose was to be deified and to join the gods, an end which was later extended to all men. One aspect of man, however, was quite clear to the Egyptian consciousness: man was mortal; death was a reality, something to be feared and dreaded. Let us not think that the Egyptians were unaware of that grim fact.28 The Egyptian fear of death is quite evident in the vast body of mor- tuary literature- Pyramid Texts, Coffin Texts, The Book of the Dead - which had been produced as an aid to overcoming the power of ultimate death. The affirmation afforded by such texts that death was not the final end must have done much to mitigate the natural fear of human mortality. The mortuary texts themselves often even deny the reality of death, the dead being spoken of as "the living ones" (cnhw). The Coffin Texts frequently show formulae which emphasize the fact that the deceased has not died, but that he lives.29 The reality of human mortality was strongly affirmed in the figure of the god Sokar; but the further reality of life after death was even more strongly stressed in the figure of Osiris. The place of the afterlife was no simple doctrine in the Egyptian system. The dead are said to live in the underworld, in the Western Land with Osiris, in the Hotep Fields, in the sky with the sun god Re, or even in the tomb itself. In brief, there was no one place which could be said to be the abode of the dead. The actual fact was that the next world was portrayed by a variety of symbols which were frequently contra- dictory and often out of keeping with one another. This, however, is entirely consistent with the methodology of Egyptian symbolism which in every aspect of religion allowed for totally different expressions. What is important about the Egyptian symbolism of the afterlife is the fact that it expressed the reality of that afterlife without tying itself to any one specific concept. The journey which the soul had to take to reach the next world is also described in very complex symbolism, and the dangers and diffi- culties of the route are far from minimal, especially in the Coffin Texts and the Book of the Dead. Here again one must ask how far such texts should be taken as literal descriptions and how far they should be seen as symbolic. My own inclination is to say that it is probably the aspect of symbolism which one should rather see in these texts, such symbolism being designed for the purpose of expressing the enormity and the importance of the transition from this world to the next. The transition from death to life was seen as the critical event in the existence of any individual, and hence the symbolism surround- ing such an event had to be of a suitably complex nature, designed to express the solemnity of the event. The most common deity with whom the resurrection of the individual was associated was of course Osiris, and many of the Egyptian funeral rituals appear to have centered around dramatizations and re-enactments of the elements of the Osiris myth, designed by their performance to identify the deceased with Osiris and thereby assure his or her immortality. The dead indi- vidual is, for that matter, frequently spoken of as being an Osiris, fully and completely identified with that deity. In effect, the process which the deceased must undergo appears to have been a full repetition of the process followed by Osiris himself. To put it another way, we may say that 28 On death as an object of fear for the Egyptians, see J. Zandee, Death as an Enemy According to Ancient Egyptian Conceptions (Leiden, 1960). 29 See, for example, CT I, 187e: ''Rise up to life, for you have not died." CT II, li: "You have departed living; you have not departed dead."</page><page sequence="12">180 JARCE XXV (1988) the myth of the death and revitalization of Osiris was in fact a mythologization of the death and revitalization of each mortal individual. The patterns of mythic symbolism in such a case are given a purpose which is totally practical and pragmatic; they ensure and guarantee the con- tinued life of every mortal. It was not, however, only Osiris with whom the dead could be identified. The deceased might be called Horus, Shu, Seth, Thoth, Atum, Re, Isis, Anubis, Sobek or virtually any of the gods. The deceased could moreover, be transformed into the grain or the Nile, into the shape of various living entities within nature such as the crocodile, the lotus, or various birds. In brief, the deceased appears to have been able to assume any form he wished, the end title of Spell 301 of the Coffin Texts being "Taking shape as any god a man wishes."30 This rich and varied symbolism expressing the transformed and spiritualized nature of the deceased appears in virtue of its very variety to point to the fact that such expressions must indeed be taken as only symbolic expres- sions. The Egyptians did not in such expressions claim that they would literally become the deity or the entity involved in the specific formula. What they were in fact affirming was that the soul of the deceased would after bodily death be transformed and revitalized into a spiritual entity which would share the eternal and on-going life of nature and the divine world. The specific image used to express such a transformation had relatively little importance, for it was not de- signed to give any concrete description of the type or manner of life to be followed in the next world. What mattered for the Egyptian mentality was that man would continue to survive as a personal individual and as part of the wider life cycle of the universe. The specific nature of that survival was such that it could not be graphically described in concrete terms and had, therefore, to be expressed in the type of symbols which could appeal to the normal experience of the human intellect. Nevertheless, survival after death was for the Egyptian such a reality that he had to speak of it even in terms of the physical body, for only in such a manner could he comprehend that the afterlife was indeed a reality. The actual nature and details of life beyond death may have been for the Egyptian an unknown mystery, one which could not be given any accurate and certain description. It was, nevertheless, a reality, and that reality was affirmed and expressed in the mythic symbols which allowed man to experience what he could not comprehend by the powers of his intellect. We must not think, however, that for the Egyptian the afterlife was an automatic occur- rence, dependent only upon the correct perfor- mance of the funeral rituals. An important prerequisite for continued survival after death lay in the fact that man must have lived an upright and righteous life. Morality was a serious consideration for the Egyptians, its serious- ness deriving from the fact that even the indi- vidual was part of the wider order of Macat, and Macat had always required that every detail of existence should be in its proper place and function in its proper manner. Hence, the indi- vidual whose life had not been lived in accordance with what was demanded by Macat could expect to find no place in the wider order of existence after death. The Egyptians had never evolved what we might call a strict moral theology; there were no divinely ordained rules of conduct sanctioned by the gods; there were no detailed and specific instructions laid down to determine what the individual could and could not do. Man, nevertheless, was expected to live a good life and to conduct himself, by the exercise of his own conscience, in accordance with what was right and proper. The man who desired to be judged as morally good and righteous would not steal, lie or cheat; he would not defraud the widow, the orphan, or the poor; he would not act in any way to harm others or to offend the gods. On the contrary, he was expected to do what he could to be kind and generous to others and to be of benefit and help to those around him. There was, in fact, no need for specific moral codes to be detailed by the gods. Man had been given something far more powerful to control his life; the strength of Macat was seen as the ultimate force which determined the goodness of the life of any individual. We must say, to the credit of the Egyptians, that they were willing to entrust the proper conduct of one's life to the strength of the individual conscience. While moral treatises were abundant in ancient Egypt, the elaboration of such was a matter for the writers of the wisdom 30 CT IV, 53e.</page><page sequence="13">MYTHO-THEOLOGY IN ANCIENT EGYPT 181 literature and not for the theologians who evolved the mythic systems. Despite the absence of divinely sanctioned moral codes, the force of morality is apparent in the abundant literature which the Egyptians produced on the subject. Even in the Old Kingdom the fact of having led an upright life appears to have been a prerequisite for the eternal happiness even of the ruler. The monarchs whom the Pyramid Texts describe as joining the gods appear to do so because their lives were free from evil and because they had lived according to Macat. When the afterlife was extended to the common people after the fall of the Old King- dom, the same moral requirements were de- manded and perhaps even more strongly. We see in the Coffin Texts that the individual is accepted into the next life only because he has been judged as righteous and justified before Osiris. The so- called ''Negative Confession" in Chapter CXXV of the New Kingdom Book of the Dead gives strong evidence of the necessity of having led a good life. Only the individual who was judged innocent and pure before Osiris could hope to be rewarded with eternal life. We may summarize the Egyptian concept of the afterlife by saying that the individual whose life had been righteous and in accordance with the principle of Macat had the sure and certain hope that he would not perish eternally, but that his life would somehow continue to survive. The exact manner of that survival may not have been clear to the Egyptian, but he did have the certainty, provided by the mythic symbolism of his religion, that he would be safe after death and that he would continue to enjoy the benefits of a vital and spiritual existence. Perhaps the most simple, but nevertheless most elegant and beauti- ful expression of this hope is found in a Spell of the Coffin Texts where it is said that the deceased "shall eat bread among the living ones, and they shall never die."31 V. Two final points remain for brief considera- tion, although these belong more strictly to the area of abstract theology rather than to mytho- theology. These are the questions of universal- ism and monotheism in Egyptian thought. It has been suggested32 that even in the Pyramid Texts one can find evidence for the concept of a universal deity in Egyptian thought.33 My own assessment on this matter is that the Egyptian mentality during the Old Kingdom was still too strongly parochial in its outlook, and that the expressions which may be taken as indicative of universalist thinking should probably be seen as no more than pious hyperbole in addressing the deity. There can be no doubt that universalism did eventually appear in Egyptian religious thought, but only during the New Kingdom after Egypt had expanded into an empire of such an extent that it became necessary for her to give due recognition to the place held by foreign nations in the universal scheme. Such universalism is clearly expressed in some pre-Amarna sun hymns, where it is centered around the Theban deity Amun-Re, and most evident in the texts from the Amarna period when the nature of the Aten required the exclusion of any other deities whatsoever. In the first instance we may assert that the universalist tendencies were in effect little more than a religious expression of the political goals and aspirations of Egypt, and that they had not in reality arisen out of any serious philosophical development within the sphere of religious thought. To be certain, the expression of such universalism must have done a great deal to increase the prestige of Amun-Re within Egypt's boundaries, but it did not result in any significant changes within the traditional mytho- theological system. The structure and content of the traditional myths remained the same, only the descriptions and epithets of Amun-Re becom- ing more encompassing and far-reaching. It would be rash, however, to make any claim that the Egyptian mind was now holding to any philosophical concept of the unity of all men or to the oneness and equality of all nations. Egypt's own outlook still held that she was herself the center of the universe; and little, if any, altruistic interest was evident as regarded foreign nations. As for the universalism evident in the Amarna movement, such must also be said to reflect the interest of Akhenaten in promoting 31 CT VII, 506. 32 R. Anthes, JNES XVIII (1959) 191. 33 See, for example, PT 305a: nb tm ("Lord of the totality"); PT 1434b: nn dr.f ("He who has no limit").</page><page sequence="14">182 JARCE XXV (1988) his own god and suppressing all other possible rivals. It is here again highly doubtful, given the general religious atmosphere of the age, that Akhenaten had made such an advance in thought that he had been able to arrive at universalist attitudes such as were totally genuine and dis- interested. In both cases, that of Theban thought in general and that of Akhenaten in particular, we cannot overlook the political advantages of such universalist expressions. We must, however, admit that concepts of a universal deity were not unknown in Egypt and that such did at least form an important element in cultic and liturgi- cal expression, even though they may have had little effect on the mythic content of religion. The question of monotheism in Egyptian thought is even more of a debatable issue. It is well known that scholars have frequently shown overly enthusiastic tendencies to demonstrate that Egypt's religion was a monotheism even in the earliest periods. It is, however, unlikely that any serious modern scholar would maintain the idea that behind the Egyptian polytheistic sym- bolism there was hidden a genuine monotheism. It is, of course, quite possible to see the Egyptian system of polytheistic expression for what it was, namely an expression of the unity and oneness of the divine power which upheld and supported the universe. This, however, is far removed from the abstract concept of one personal deity whose knowledge and power encompasses everything which exists. For the Egyptian to have admitted monotheistic thinking into his system would have been tantamount to denying the traditional polytheistic system of symbolism and the com- plexity of the divine world which was given expression in such a system. In brief, the world of Egyptian thought and the world of monotheistic thought were poles apart. Any attempt to recon- cile the two and to see a monotheistic basis for Egyptian religion is to misunderstand totally the nature of that religion. To the Egyptian mind, even the term "monotheism" would have been completely irrelevant and meaningless. In the thought of the Theban theologians of the New Kingdom, there were distinct tendencies to posit Amun-Re as the supreme deity, and in the my tho- theology of this period that same Amun-Re did hold the position of king of the gods. A supreme deity, however, cannot be equated with a monotheistic deity, nor even with the henotheistic deity. The position of Amun-Re as king of the gods could have gone to a certain extent in the direction of henotheism, but even the latter would have required that the other deities be ignored, although not totally denied. The best we can state of traditional Egyptian thought is that the weight of the position attributed to the Theban Amun-Re may have created a deity who after a long process and after the emergence of an abstract way of thinking could have eventually evolved into a monotheistic god. Such a phenomenon, however, did not take place within Egyptian religious thought; and when monotheism was eventually found in Egypt, it was only as the result of a foreign importation. Monotheism, however, cannot be said to have been truly inherent within the native Egyptian systems. Many have maintained the fully monotheistic nature of the religion of Akhenaten. To attempt any debate on the latter question, however, would be beyond the bounds and purposes of the present context. I would suggest, however, that the Amarna texts themselves give no real clear indication of the absolute denial of the existence of other gods. The other deities were simply ignored and, in the latter years of Akhenaten's reign, even actively persecuted. Such an action, however, may probably be best interpreted as a political move on the part of the heretic king to strengthen his own position and the position of the religious system which he advocated. His main purpose, however, was probably to break the power of the priesthood of Amun-Re which had functioned as a rival to the royal throne for well over a century. A movement to suppress the traditional mythic system of Egypt for the pur- pose of strengthening his own political position can hardly be viewed as a genuine monotheistic conviction on the part of Akhenaten. We must, however, admit that more favourable views of Akhenaten's movement are in existence. It has been said, for example, that his religion consti- tuted "a more joyous acceptance of the natural world, and a more rational belief in a universal sole god."34 At the opposite extreme, it has been 34 C. Aldred, Akhenaten and Nejertiti (New York, 1973) 79.</page><page sequence="15">MYTHO-THEOLOGY IN ANCIENT EGYPT 183 suggested that the religion of Akhenaten, at least against the background of traditional Egyptian religion, would have been viewed as nothing else than atheism.35 Such an opinion emerges natur- ally from the fact that in ancient Egypt myth was the only true and possible means of revelation. With the abolishment of the traditional mythic symbols, there would have remained for the Egyptian mind no means of perceiving or appre- hending the divine. Akhenaten's movement was, therefore, from the Egyptian point of view no real religion at all, for it denied the reality of Egyptian mythic perception and in so doing denied the basis of Egyptian religious experience. Hence, whether or not Akhenaten's system was a monotheism is, at least in the Egyptian way of thought, a totally pointless question. The best we may say for Akhenaten is that he created an anachronism which could find no place in the my tho- theology of his day. To conclude this survey of the mytho-theology of ancient Egypt, we must beware of making statements which are too broad and too general- ized. We must not assume that there was a homogeneous outlook on life and its meaning, on the universe and the world of the divine. For the general masses, religion probably meant no more than the acknowledgement of the poly- theistic deities of tradition and the observation of the cults and festivals of the state. Many must have taken the mythic symbols at their face value and interpreted them in a fundamentalist and literalistic manner. Such does not, however, alter the fact that the Egyptian my tho- theological system did contain within itself the possibility of articulating a more abstract and intellectual concept of the world of the divine, even though that articulation did remain within the sphere of concrete symbolic expression. To be certain, its value was in no way thereby diminished. The Egyptian religious synthesis appears as an all-encompassing and all-embracing method of perception, unifying the human experience of the universe and functioning as a true integrat- ing force. Egyptian religion was, in effect, the articulation of unified existential being, even though the Egyptian himself would not have described it in such terminology. Since it was unhampered by the orthodoxy of dogma and doctrine, Egyptian religion was free to meet the spiritual needs of man as they were felt in the given situation. It was able to stress the mystery and the sanctity of all life without restricting itself to official definitions which could run the risk of becoming outmoded and obsolete. It was able to articulate and make real to human experience the existence of a universal and unchanging order based on Macat, and it thus gave the assurance that human life would be stable and secure despite the disruptions which might occur from time to time. Man could thus be free from fatalism and was able to develop an optimism which was unsurpassed in the myth- ologies of the ancient world. In the celebration of the myths in the cultic rituals, the worshipper was enabled to participate in the positive realities of the universe and thus feel that he was an integral part of the wider system. As such, his well-being and his survival were assured both in the present world and even after death. Even though he could not precisely define the structure and nature of existence, he did have the assurance that his own life was integrated into the wider cosmic order of universal life. The concepts expressed in the Egyptian mytho- theological synthesis may thus be seen as valid theological statements such as can affirm the most positive aspects of the universe and of life itself. If the Egyptian believed in any doctrine of dogma, it was the simple yet profound truth that life is sacred and eternal. One may well wonder if the most profound abstract theological system can offer more than that. Saint Mary's University Halifax 35 D. B.
