<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW ARTICLE Allegories of Intertextuality: The Controversy over Paul de Man TILOTTAMA RAJAN University of Western Ontario I In 1987, as is well known, a Belgian researcher Ortwin de Graef discov- ered a number of articles by Paul de Man written between 1940 and 1942 for the collaborationist newspapers Le Soir and Het Vlaamsche Land. The disclosures about the wartime journalism constitute an inter- textual event that fundamentally alters how we see de Man's work, though in ways that are more oblique than a simple moral judgment would suggest. The publication of an important collection of responses to the journalism coincides with the appearance of two other posthu- mous volumes: a collection of essays on de Man largely written before the current controversy and an edition of his early critical writings. These volumes provide an occasion to reassess not only the relation- ships between de Man's texts but also the place of his work in the cur- rent theoretical scene. For reasons of space it will not be possible to discuss the fine articles in Reading de Man Reading except as they bear on the current controversy. They include critiques of de Man by Neil Hertz and by Rodolphe Gasche, who argues that de Man's approach "emphasizes the likeness among instances and moments of a text, or different parts of a work," to the point of conveying an "in-difference" toward difference (RDR, pp. 272-73). But for the most part the volume In this article, I will be considering the following books: Paul de Man, Critical Writings, 1953-1978, ed. Lindsay Waters (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1989), pp. lxxiv+246 (hereafter cited as CW); Lindsay Waters and Wlad Godzich, eds., Reading de Man Reading (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1989), pp. 312 (hereafter cited as RDR); and Werner Hamacher, Neil Hertz, and Thomas Keenan, eds., Responses on Paul de Man's Wartime Journalism (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1989), pp. xxi+477 (hereafter cited as R). ? 1991 by The University of Chicago.

Among these it is worth pausing over Newmark's essay, which argues, but with a difference, that de Man was a profoundly historical thinker. In what seems an allusion to Christopher Norris's recent book,l New- mark warns against a genetic and linear account of the relationship be- tween rhetoric and history in de Man's work, one that would see him in his final phase as about to turn toward the critique of the aesthetic ide- ology for which Allegories of Reading was a preparation. The effect of such a schema, Newmark suggests, would be to domesticate de Man by "refashion[ing] his name in our own image" (RDR, p. 133). Instead Newmark suggests that de Man's rhetorical analyses are always histori- cal, but in a way that is best represented by his discussion of Baude- laire's "Correspondances," where he focuses on the multiple references of the word 'transports' to lyric rapture, to rhetorical transfers, and to urban transit systems. This may sound cute, but Newmark's point is a serious one: namely, that the exoteric concern of de Man's writing with rhetoric entails a concern with historical issues that is not the esoteric but the allegorical content of these writings. The term 'allegorical' is mine, but it conveys Newmark's sense that de Man can only write about history by not writing about it. In other words, we lose the force of his rhetoric if we convert him into a cultural critic, thus suggesting that 'history' finally has priority over rhetoric, in a reinstatement of the very metaphysics he deconstructs. It is precisely to avoid the already figural (re)turn to a ground outside language that de Man withholds any lit- eral discussion of the political, and places his references to it sous rature by making them allegorical. With the exception of those by Hertz and Gasche, what marks these otherwise illuminating essays is that they read de Man almost entirely on his own ground. Thus Newmark, in contrast to Norris's (not entirely convincing) assimilation of de Man to Adorno, deflects criticism of de Man's ahistoricity by using this as further proof of his theoretical pu- rity. Similarly, Deborah Esch, though she goes farther than many of de Man's followers in criticizing him for certain self-monumentalizing ten- dencies, does so by suggesting that we read him through his own read- ing of Shelley (RDR, pp. 66-81). Both essays typify a tendency of Yale deconstruction noted by Geoffrey Hartman, to write as though it "had 1. Christopher Norris, Paul de Man and the Critique of Aesthetic Ideology (London, 1988). 232</page><page sequence="3">Tilottama Rajan o The Controversy over Paul de Man no relatives," to use critical intertexts not as "sources but materials only" (RDR, p. 20), and thus to criticize itself only from within. It is this rhetoric of self-containment that now seems particularly dated. For as Hartman suggests, the current controversy allows us to question the "purity of deconstructive thought" (RDR, p. 20), even as we reaffirm its "power" in using it to understand the very controversy it has generated. If the additions to de Man's corpus have restored a sense of what Hart- man calls the "personal or ideological context" of his work, and thus of its "situatedness" (RDR, p. 20), it is important to remember that the 'context' removed from his later work includes not just his activities in occupied Belgium but also his postwar criticism. Lindsay Waters's edi- tion of the early critical writings, accompanied by an invaluable and wide-ranging introduction, brings together a number of essays and re- views written between 1953 and 1978. The author of these pieces is un- familiar to many students of contemporary theory, though he is well known to Romanticists on the basis of essays like "The Intentional Struc- ture of the Romantic Image." If de Man's turn to rhetoric was motivated, as Hartman suggests, by "a belated, but still powerful, act of conscience" (RDR, p. 23), these writings, in a very different way, are also part of an autocritique whose thrust has not always been clear to those who suspect the earlier, phenomenological criticism of using the concept of inward- ness to reinstate the transcendental ego. As such, the writings of 1953- 78 allow us to situate the later de Man in a different way, with respect to an even earlier turn away from the wartime journalism. Three concerns recur in these essays: inwardness, Romanticism, and the need for a new theoretical poetics. The particularly postwar reso- nances of the term 'inwardness' are best summed up in an essay on Rilke, where de Man defines it as "a negative moment" and associates the reassertion of the self with a "feeling of loss and bewilderment" (CW, pp. 167-68). Inwardness, in other words, is not a source of iden- tity but a self-reflexive category used to counter a naive activism that identifies the subject with the outside world, as de Man had done in his wartime writings. If inwardness is a way of withdrawing from illusions about the unmediated contact of the self with what is outside it or even with itself, Romanticism is for de Man the site at which the radical difference between subject and object is first encountered: not in the Blake of Harold Bloom (CW, pp. 90-96) but in Hegel, refigured by Jean Hippolyte and Alexandre Kojeve as a thinker of negativity rather than teleology, and then made paradigmatic for other Romantics like Wordsworth and Keats. For de Man a Romanticism concerned with in- wardness is the beginning of what Kant calls 'critique' and of what he himself will later call 'theory'. We could argue that insofar as Hegel in- scribed negativity within the exteriorizing movement of the dialectic, it 233</page><page sequence="4">MODERN PHILOLOGY is really in Kierkegaard's correction of Hegel that we meet the first un- recuperated instance of the inward turn. The attraction of Heidegger, despite his eschatological tendencies, lies precisely in the critical sepa- ration he effects between "the knowing" of experience and the "pathos of direct experience" (CW, pp. 104-6). As the most refined source of deconstruction, literature is potentially an important form of critique. Thus we see de Man searching outside philosophy for a theoretical po- etics that might question the assumptions of immediacy made by the- matic criticism. And we see him finding intimations of it not only in Maurice Blanchot but also in Hillis Miller and Joseph Frank, whose phenomenological concern with perceptual categories has a potential for a more (self)critical poetics of the signifier that is, however, subli- mated by their focus on spatial rather than temporal categories of mediation (CW, pp. 107-15). The early critical writings consist mostly of reviews and occasional pieces, but there are three essays of particular importance: "The Inward Generation" (1955), "The Temptation of Permanence" (1955), and "Process and Poetry" (1956). Already in these essays we find an emphasis on the intentional structure of consciousness and a concern with the temporality of a subject who risks bad faith if he submerges himself in the ontological stability of objects, or of nature conceived as eternal pro- cess and thus as becoming congealed into being. These are the concerns not only of the seminal essays on "The Intentional Structure of the Ro- mantic Image" and "The Rhetoric of Temporality" but also of Allegories of Reading, where the opposition between temporality and other forms of essentialism has been rewritten into one between rhetoric and logic. But the earlier de Man is also very different from the one we have come to know, and this volume is useful for making us aware of the way in which his work developed in diacritical relation to intellectual contexts of which it therefore bears the traces. It is clear from this volume that phe- nomenology exerted a profound catalytic influence on de Man, not only through Heidegger, whose importance is acknowledged at several points, but also through Sartre, to whose two books on imagination he owes the pivotal concept of intentionality. If de Man is generally dismiss- ive of Sartre, that is because of the latter's postwar turn to a politics of engagement that untheoretically bypasses the admittedly paralyzing re- flexiveness of his earlier critique of bad faith. The journalistic as opposed to the philosophical Sartre forgets his own affinity with the "theoretical poetics" of his early work. That poetics, from which decon- struction develops as a radicalization of phenomenology, distinguishes between perception and imagination (CW, p. 155) so as to impede the naturalizing of linguistic constructs in ways that will prove crucial for the remainder of de Man's career. 234</page><page sequence="5">Tilottama Rajan o The Controversy over Paul de Man What does it mean that de Man is already preoccupied with the self- critical processes he later describes in "The Resistance to Theory," but inscribes them in the terminology of 'inwardness' and 'intentionality'? As someone who draws philosophically and ethically from phenome- nology and existentialism respectively, the earlier de Man is still com- mitted to some kind of 'subject', and to critique as something that happens within the 'experience' (though not necessarily the 'Bildung') of this subject. Correspondingly he also comes across as much more historical than he has come to seem, though admittedly not in the ma- terialist way that has now become normative. The review of Hillis Miller and Joseph Frank, for instance, criticizes space as closure from the van- tage point of history as temporality. This historicizing of the subject is implicit in the style of the earlier writings. For de Man writes as a cul- tural rather than rhetorical critic, one who locates himself in historical time rather than theoretical space. As such he is concerned with criti- cism as part of a larger cultural project, and he works at this project in- tertextually, by using the figures on the current intellectual scene to intimate a new theoretical poetics-but only negatively, as they func- tion to criticize each other. The cultural contextualizing of what de Man says makes his 'solutions' local, and subject to further local dis- placements. The spatial quality of the later criticism is of course an effect of how it is produced. In other words, it evinces a certain positiv- ism that derives from such factors as the institutionalizing of de Man, and his passage from Europe to America, from essay to book, and from (im) migrant scholar to respected professor within the professionalized structure of American academia. By contrast, the early writings are in- tertextual rather than autotelic, critical rather than systematic, but for reasons that are material effects of their status as essays and reviews as much as ideological choices. The 'implied author' of these texts is nev- ertheless a very different 'figure' from the one who emerges in the later work. As we shall see, he is a figure who in important ways supple- ments and displaces the authorial persona of the later de Man. II The publication of the postwar writings coincides with the revelations about an even earlier stage in de Man's career. We shall return later to how both events cause us to refigure de Man and the place that his crit- ical corpus now occupies in the scene of contemporary theory. If the present heuristic value of that corpus is to provide an allegory of the in- terrelations among the various critical positions he has occupied, the importance of the Early Critical Writings is that they complicate the alle- gory. They supplement the narratives we might construct to interpret 235</page><page sequence="6">MODERN PHILOLOGY the relationship between the very earliest and more recent writings, but must in turn be supplemented by these narratives. Thus we can argue that the earlier writings are continuous with de Man's later critique of representation as the illusory self-confirmation of the subject through language. But they also provide a way to engage in this critique that is still part of a hermeneutic, and that therefore avoids the move into an objective space which results from renouncing the rhetoric of the sub- jective. At the same time we may also want to limit the authority of the early writings. We may want to argue that their emphasis on interiority is complicit with the separation between art and politics urged by de Man in the aesthetic politics of his wartime writings, even as their aim is precisely to turn away from that phase of de Man's career. The wartime journalism is the subject of a wide-ranging volume con- taining a number of new responses as well as reprints of the well-known articles by Derrida and Miller. The responses themselves fall into two groups concerned either with what de Man actually did and wrote or with the relationship between the journalism and the later theory. If the first group asks us to reach a judicial or humanitarian verdict on de Man himself, the second invites theoretical reflection, either on the consequences of his journalism for his later writings or on the rele- vance of his later theory for an analysis of what he "did." The two groups of essays, however, are not so neatly separable as a distinction between the material and theoretical might suggest. As Ian Balfour points out, ad hominem attacks on de Man are often allegorical in that their real target is Yale deconstruction (R, p. 13). Perhaps because they are reactively shaped by these attacks, defenses of de Man are also alle- gorical, but in less simple ways. In defending him so as to defend a valuable approach, they can seem to reverse the allegory so that the theoretical integrity of the work (sometimes established in ingenious ways) becomes a metaphor for the integrity of the man. That integrity in turn has always been a metaphor for the moral correctness of the work. But now, by a further unintended metonymy, the (allegorical) defense of the man can seem to contain the trace of a defense of col- laboration that is politically insensitive. It is because he hypostasizes this trace that Stanley Corngold criticizes such defenses for a displacement of the historical into the theoretical that is in some sense enabled by poststructuralism's displacement of interest from the signified to the signifier (RE pp. 80-84). One of the problems raised by the current controversy is that material arguments carry theoretical investments of the kind noted by Balfour. But the attempt to deal with these arguments theoretically, so as not to repeat their naivete, results in a strategy whose very embrace of the the- oretical over the material carries material investments. The same criti- 236</page><page sequence="7">Tilottama Rajan o The Controversy over Paul de Man cism can of course be made of the present writer, who is not "defending" de Man, but who will argue that we should in fact use the present controversy allegorically, to reflect on the interrelationships be- tween the various positions he has occupied, rather than literally, to reach a verdict in the trial of Paul de Man. All we can say is that allegory is not necessarily pernicious if it is used self-critically rather than blindly as a form of projection (using the signifier 'de Man' to attack decon- struction) or displacement (talking about de Man theoretically to avoid talking about something else). Nor is it wrong to turn from a material response (judging de Man) to a theoretical one (reflecting on decon- struction), if that turn includes some reflection on the impossibility of separating the material and the theoretical. The essays that directly take up de Man's wartime activities include "neutral" pieces by de Graef, Edouard Colinet, and Els de Bens, which situate de Man within the constraints of publishing and survival in oc- cupied Belgium. They also include condemnatory essays (by John Brenkman, Corngold, and Jeffrey Mehlman), and ones that attempt some kind of exculpation on the humanitarian grounds of de Man's youth, or for historical reasons having to do with political pressure. In different ways all these responses leave one feeling unsatisfied. The condemnatory essays are too strident and simplify a complex human and political situation. On the other hand, there is an awkward quality to the apologias by Aris Fioretos, Andrzej Warminski, and Samuel Weber, among others. Thus it may well be that de Man was not an out- right anti-Semite, that he wrote the article on the Jews in contempo- rary literature under pressure, and that the exoteric anti-Semitism of this article conceals an esoteric message evident in his inclusion of Kafka among the classics (Thomas Fries). But there is something dis- turbing about containing criticism of the wartime journalism within the narrow orbit of anti-Semitism, as if the fact that de Man wrote only one anti-Semitic article renders more acceptable a Eurocentric aesthetic nationalism which one would expect those who have learned the les- sons of deconstruction to find troubling. Equally disturbing is the argu- ment that his racial chauvinism was culturally rather than biologically based (Weber) or aesthetic rather than political (Fioretos, Kamuf, Hamacher). Nor is it really helpful to establish that de Man was not a crude but a conflicted anti-Semite, a Belgian nationalist who admired the German ascendancy but not the Nazis. In the end the historical re- sponses resolve nothing because they tell us more about their authors than about de Man himself. The examination of material evidence about de Man's 'past' is a nec- essary stage in the hermeneutics of the current controversy. But it is only a stage, because the responses to what de Man 'did' are so clearly 237</page><page sequence="8">MODERN PHILOLOGY allegorical. The best one can say of the apologias is that they are under- taken precisely because he is a 'figure' for deconstruction. Yet, as Wil- liam Flesch points out, one can grant the brilliance of de Man's later work without teasing out of the wartime writings "private scruples" that may not be there (R, p. 175). The answer is not necessarily to separate the man from the work if that means separating the material from the theoretical. But given the difficulties of passing judgment on a situation from which we are so removed, our response should probably be to de- clare a personal amnesty that will free us to look at de Man's past alle- gorically, though not in the sense of that word criticized by Balfour. A consciously allegorical reading will make de Man's past part of his the- oretical corpus, but not because it unlocks the truth about him or about deconstruction. Instead we attend to the past, as we might also do in the case of Barthes or Foucault, because looking at a person's ca- reer allows us to trace the complex interweavings and transfers between critical positions that might seem like positive or autonomous terms when discussed on an abstractly theoretical level. If the material responses make one want to deal with the case of de Man in more theoretical ways, the 'theoretical' responses are inevitably refracted through material considerations that did not complicate the essays in Reading de Man Reading. The question of the material and the theoretical can be followed through a problem that surfaces in many of the more 'theoretical' pieces: that of collaboration. Some of the at- tempts to relate the early and late phases of de Man's career take the form of a narrative of enlightenment in which the present is an over- coming of the past. Thus Hartman argues that de Man's later writings are an act of conscience (RDR, p. 23), and Lindsay Waters suggests that the blindness of the early writings dialectically facilitates his later work (R, pp. 397-403). Many of the responses, however, are narratives of collaboration which trace a complicity between de Man's early and late writings. These narratives are particularly interesting because 'collabo- ration' has an ambiguously material and theoretical referent. We are rarely clear whether we are reading about political collaboration or some kind of metaphorical complicity between two kinds of theoretical absolutism. These narratives therefore exhibit with particular clarity the structures of projection and displacement that characterize the blind allegories utilized by so many responses to bring the material and the theoretical into relation. Narratives of collaboration have been written by both sides, but each side conflates the material and the theoretical differently. Those criti- cal of de Man use the theoretical as a figure for the material by insinu- ating that his theoretical collaboration is the trace of something he actually did. Stephen Bretzius recognizes the radicalism of the later 238</page><page sequence="9">Tilottama Rajan o The Controversy over Paul de Man work but sees a link between "synchronic theory and absolutism" (R, pp. 37-38). Writing from a more sympathetic position, Alice Kaplan notes a rhetorical continuity that is the unsettling counterplot to the substantive differences between the early and the late: a continuity reg- istered in the endings of de Man's early writings, where "instead of the abyss" there is a "proto-fascist community building statement" (R pp. 278-79). What haunts her essay is the fear that the theoretical may actually be material, in some troubling way of which we would remain ignorant had it not been for the recent disclosures. Stanley Corngold is much more explicit in actually equating the theoretical and the mate- rial. His discussion of the violence and disfiguration that de Man asso- ciates with writing parallels Hertz's in an essay predating the current controversy. But where Hertz focuses on the impossibility of determin- ing de Man's 'position' (physical or ethical) in relation to this violence (RDR, pp. 86, 100), Corngold bypasses precisely that problem of 'un- certain agency' which we term 'collaboration'. His collapsing of the theoretical into the material is, of course, part of his view that no prac- tical difference exists between collaborating with and supporting the Nazis. In that respect his article is a useful foil for 'theoretical' essays that are more 'evasive' in relating the material and the theoretical. Es- says like Bretzius's use the theoretical as a figure for the material pre- cisely because they are sensitive to the pathos of uncertain agency. Alternatively, a second group of essays refigures the material as theoret- ical and, from Corngold's point of view, these essays repeat the very complicity which they try to contain. This second group, which treats collaboration sympathetically, subli- mates the material into the theoretical by discussing collaboration on a purely theoretical level. In effect these essays displace the problem of collaboration into the more general problem of aporia. The beginnings of this strategy can be found in de Man himself, in the title of an essay which now seems to contain a secret irony- "The Resistance to Theory." According to the chiasmus which structures the word 'resis- tance', not only is collaboration a kind of resistance but all resistance is already collaboration. De Man's collaboration with the Germans, so this argument goes, was not unequivocal: he sheltered a Jewish couple, wrote an article in defense of a resistance publication, and used the pages of Le Soir to plead for the autonomy of art from politics. At the other end of the spectrum, the deconstructive resistance to totalizing structures is inevitably caught in a totalitarian gesture which causes it to collaborate with what it criticizes. That error is repeated in all of de Man's postwar writings, inasmuch as the cognitive and performative dimensions of a text will never coincide. The error raises the question of what it would have meant to 'resist' rather than 'collaborate', of 239</page><page sequence="10">MODERN PHILOLOGY whether there is even any choice between the two. The error is also re- peated in any position we take with respect to the current controversy. In condemning de Man we would be collaborating, as Andrzej Warmin- ski suggests, with the same totalitarian thinking we claim to resist (R, pp. 387-88). But then as Richard Klein parodically suggests, we also cannot read de Man carefully to avoid a totalizing dismissal of him, be- cause then we would be repeating de Man's errors through our reading, collaborating by making understanding take the place of dismissal (R, pp. 285-86). Whatever we do, resistance will always be inscribed in acts of collaboration. As valid as these points are regarding specific acts of collaboration, there is something disquieting about the arguments outlined above. The problem lies in the essentialist and paradigmatic character of the aporia-or put differently, in a fatality that functions as a form of ex- culpation. Because it is unavoidable, the aporia preempts criticism, not only of de Man but, more important, of Yale deconstruction. In this re- spect the term 'bad faith' may have something to offer that aporia does not. Sartre concedes that there is no authenticity, because any position we take is condemned to repeat the error it opposes. Yet he insists that there are choices to be made, however equivocal they may be. Equally troubling is the treatment of collaboration as a purely theoretical issue. This displacement of the concrete into the abstract is linked to a ges- ture of mastery, in which de Man's theory accounts at all points for his/ its errors. In this respect the argument just described exhibits a strategy used by a number of respondents from Cynthia Chase to Derrida. Der- rida points out that de Man himself has given us the tools with which to approach his wartime journalism (R, p. 128). Chase makes the point more poignantly. The opening of her essay echoes de Man's discussion of Shelley, whose corpus is disfigured by his own drowning, in a histori- cal irony that makes the inscription of his body in the margins of The Triumph of Life a chiastic inscription of his text within his body. Accord- ing to Chase, the "reappearance of those abandoned texts [the wartime writings] is something that happens to de Man's writing from the out- side, which thus strikes it with blindness" with regard to its own situa- tion. By a tragic irony, de Man's own writing now falls victim to "the blindness and the violence of writing" (R, p. 44), undoing on a perfor- mative level what it so unsparingly analyzes on the cognitive level. The uneasy response aroused in us by this narrative of victimage and mastery is brilliantly analyzed by Allan Stoekl with respect to its prefigu- ration in de Man's own texts. Stoekl traces the "inscription of guilt" in the last chapter of Allegories of Reading and asks how we can evaluate de Man while respecting his own methods (R, pp. 376-78). In retro- spect, de Man's discussion of guilt in terms of whether emotional states 240</page><page sequence="11">Tilottama Rajan o The Controversy over Paul de Man precede or are generated by writing seems to have clear autobiograph- ical resonances. But it is precisely these resonances that de Man's the- ory calls into question. The more we recognize the force of de Man's arguments "against an autobiographical subjectivity, and a personal responsibility," Stoekl argues, "the more we recognise their significance for a (re)writing of his own biography.... Following his own logic, as soon as we consider his own biography, and in any way try to 'judge' him, it is our reading that is guilty, that. . . sees de Man's larger argu- ment, so rigorous, so irrefutable, as just another excuse" (R, p. 381). The resulting aporia precludes criticism. If we read de Man's corpus in his own terms, we cannot pass judgment on his early (or his late) writ- ings; but if we break from those terms in order to evaluate him, we are guilty of a blindness that reinscribes us in de Man's critique of rhetoric, so as to transfer 'his' guilt to 'us'. Stoekl is consciously unable to break out of this impasse, and he uses psychoanalysis not to resolve but to re- main ironically outside and inside the aporia between rhetoric and eth- ics, the theoretical and the material. Perhaps another way to stand (at least for a moment) outside this aporia is to distinguish the cognitive and performative aspects of the narratives outlined above. The argu- ment that we learn from de Man even in critiquing his work is cogni- tively true. But the rhetorical as opposed to the logical tenor of this argument is that de Man, as author of the insights to which he now falls victim, remains in a position of authority. This discrepancy between the cognitive and the performative is not just aporetic but also strategic. If we are seduced into the metonymic transfer from the performative to the cognitive that these narratives effect, we risk losing precisely the in- sights with which Derrida credits de Man. A different approach to the problem of collaboration as it bears on the material-theoretical relation is taken by Werner Hamacher and Gerald Graff. Both point to what Hamacher calls the "ambidexterity of ideologemes"-the fact that a concept develops its totalitarian poten- tial only when placed in contiguity "with related ideologemes" (R, p. 440). Hamacher's essay can be seen as an attempt to 'excuse' de Man by arguing that the nationalist and organicist motifs of his early writing would have remained harmless had it not been for the histori- cal moment at which he wrote. But both articles raise the larger ques- tion of appropriation, and do so in a way that reinscribes the past in the present as part of the allegory of reading which links the early and late in the current controversy. In other words, they suggest (in Hamacher's case, through a metonymic substitution of the late for the early that he leaves to the reader) that the usefulness of a theory is not limited to its use in specific material context(s). The fact that the deconstructive fo- cus on rhetoric has been used with an ahistoricism that now seems 241</page><page sequence="12">MODERN PHILOLOGY complicit with the highly political aestheticism of the early writings does not mean that it cannot be used as part of a cultural critique. This displacement of emphasis from the inherent qualities of an approach to its use is, of course, a form of pragmatism. It has the merit of coun- teracting essentialism, of reminding us that deconstruction's ultratex- tualism cannot simply be dismissed for complicity with the Reagan era, when that same quality constituted its radicalism in the Paris of the six- ties. At the same time, we can ask whether pragmatism is itself ambi- dextrous, a form of opportunism as well as of tolerant hermeneutic contextualizing. Does it recuperate any approach whatsoever, on the grounds that one can simply choose the 'good' way of appropriating it? Are the good and bad uses of an ideologeme neatly separable? In the complex process of judging de Man or, more honestly, of assessing our- selves through the figure of de Man, it is unlikely that we can come to rest in any of these narratives for connecting the early and the late. Per- haps the merit of this volume is precisely that its format as a collection makes it unnecessary for us to do so. III If the collection as a form is inconclusive, what lesson can we learn from the publication of this volume and the writings with which it is con- cerned? For one thing, de Man's work emerges as far less monolithic than it had seemed. If he has also become a less monumental figure, his career has become more complex, inviting us to situate him (and our- selves) as subjects within this complexity. Needless to say, the reconstruc- tion of any author as 'subject' must proceed by way of hermeneutic as well as cultural criticism if it is not to seem condescending. In other words, it is not enough to recognize that de Man is a social and historical subject. We must also identify experimentally with 'de Man', by using his career as an allegory of (self-) reading, if we are to understand the blind- nesses and insights of the critical positions he has made available. The treatment of de Man as 'subject' had already begun before the current controversy, in Neil Hertz's extraordinary article "Lurid Figures." Hertz deals with the melodramatic surfacing, in a writing otherwise purged of pathos, of images associated with violence and mu- tilation (RDR, pp. 81-104). His approach is psychoanalytic rather than historical, and the resonances of the images he discusses have now come to seem even more complex than he was aware. To explain them requires a historical psychoanalysis that risks essentializing a trace by making it into a subtext. But we can note in the Responses volume the shift from author to subject that has occurred even in articles consider- ably more recuperative than Hertz's. Thus Heidi Krueger discusses 242</page><page sequence="13">Tilottama Rajan o The Controversy over Paul de Man de Man's transition from a language of pathos and affect to a language of "rigor." She presents this not as the site of an inward fracture, but as an askesis necessary to correct the young de Man's ethnological criti- cism, which had valorized German irrationalism over French rational- ity. But her argument depends on situating de Man as a historical subject and justifying, on the basis of his (wartime) 'experience', a rhetoric that would otherwise seem inhumanely pure. Insofar as Krue- ger privileges the later work, the claim is no longer that it is true but that it is understandable in its context. With this shift from the logical to the hermeneutic, it becomes possible to historicize the later work, perhaps to historicize poststructuralism itself, as exemplified not only by de Man but also by the post-1968 work of Althusser and Foucault. Hitherto, reading de Man as author rather than subject has also been accompanied by a homogenizing or teleological narrativizing of his ca- reer. This homogenizing can take two forms. Typical of the synchronic mode is Hillis Miller's essay "'Reading' Part of a Paragraph in Allegories of Reading" (RDR, pp. 155-70). My concern here is not with his discus- sion, which is invaluable for anyone wanting to understand what de Man says about allegorical and tropological narratives, but with its form as exegesis. Miller patiently explains a very difficult passage by practic- ing a hermeneutic that presupposes an author who puts every word in its proper place. The impression of total coherence thus created can also take a diachronic form. Thus Carol Jacobs, in a characteristically fine article (RDR, pp. 105-20), argues against the view that de Man in "The Rhetoric of Temporality" uses a phenomenological approach that differs from his later work. She suggests that its movement from the narrative mode of allegory to the synchronic mode of irony already performs the later work's critique of its own tendency to recuperate de- construction within a phenomenology of the subject by inscribing it in a narrative movement from blindness to insight. Embedded in Jacobs's argument is a narrative of her own, in which differences within and be- tween de Man's texts turn out to be ironies rather than points of ten- sion. For this reason hers is a narrative that we must now question, if only because it risks doing precisely what she sees de Man as not do- ing-namely, reinstating "the authority of a [deconstructive] self at the far end of its most radical negation" (RDR, p. 110). This is not to say that we can avoid narrative entirely. Catherine Gal- lagher provides a useful account of some of the (hi) stories that have or- ganized responses to the de Man controversy, whether sympathetic or hostile. She argues that narrative is a structural symptom of compla- cency, allowing us to learn what we already know (R, p. 207). But her familiar point about the dangers of narrative, while valid, does not ex- haust the ways in which narrative can function. We are unlikely to stop 243</page><page sequence="14">MODERN PHILOLOGY narrativizing de Man's career, because its very complexity calls for nar- rative as a heuristic device and because it is precisely through narrative that understanding occurs. But what the Responses volume demonstrates is that different and more recursive narratives have become possible. It is useful in this context to recall Dominick LaCapra's suggestions (made with reference to Sartre) on how a reading of the canon might be reconceived. Over against Sartre's own narrative, which makes his later work a dialectical completion of Being and Nothingness, LaCapra suggests that the parts of an author's career should not be treated as a linear dialectic but as a "supplementary interplay that permits a process of mutual grafting not entirely accounted for by a notion of dialectical totalization."2 The strategies of totalization used by de Man's interpret- ers are, of course, more varied. The canonization of de Man has made use of two related narratives: a narrative of coherence and a narrative of dialectical evolution. According to the second, the later work is a rig- orous renunciation of previous epistemological errors and phenome- nological temptations. Since the release of the wartime journalism, this narrative has been rewritten in moral terms as a story of confession and atonement, or of dialectical correction. According to the first narrative, which Jacobs's essay exemplifies, de Man has been consistent through- out his career and cannot be described as having moved (for instance) from a phenomenological to a poststructuralist position. An ingenious version of this story is found in Richard Klein's article, which locates the critique of organicism even in the wartime writings and plays with the idea that de Man was on some (literal or metaphorical) level a member of the Belgian resistance (R, pp. 287-89). But, by and large, the release of the wartime writings has made the identity of early and late either untenable or unpalatable and has been replaced by a story in which de Man himself figures as a victim of the aporia between blindness and insight that he detects in so many others. While this dis- figuration might seem to lessen his authority, it also makes his "error" a particular instance of the theory he has authored. Both narratives, with their sub-versions, share a tendency to figure ei- ther change or continuity in such a way that the de Man canon be- comes a well-wrought urn, its impact somehow unitary. Despite an attempt to be dialectical and dialogical, both narratives therefore con- vey a sense of closure. What LaCapra proposes as an alternative is that the "very openness of the dialectical method may depend . . . upon sup- plementary and repetitive relationships that both invite a project of di- alectical totalization and limit it."3 In this sense we would not regard de Man's later work as superseding the earlier writings but as supplement- 2.

Ibid., p. 153. 244</page><page sequence="15">Tilottama Rajan o The Controversy over Paul de Man ing them, filling a gap left by the latter while remaining open to a con- testation by them that is generated by the intertextual impact of the wartime journalism on our reading of the later work. We would no longer arrange de Man's corpus in a linear fashion as evolution or re- cantation, or in a static fashion as always already enlightened, or as al- ways compelled to repeat its earlier errors. Rather, we might think of his career spatially-in terms of 'sectors' that repeat, correct, displace, and interrogate each other. These sectors would include the wartime journalism, the existential and phenomenological essays that eventually verge on deconstruction, the work on rhetoric, and the last essays that may have included more "political" tendencies. To some extent Waters's introduction to the early writings assumes such a model. In taking up the relation between the early criticism and a rhetorical poststructuralism purged of any references to interiority, he argues that we should not see rhetoric as superseding subjectivity. Since the deconstruction of the self is generated by a concern with the self which it continues to summon up, we should read de Man's cri- tique of the subject rhetorically and polemically rather than literally (CW, pp. Ivii-iii, xxxvii). Such a reading allows the writings of the phe- nomenological period to coexist alongside the later texts, which are (dia) critically related to the former, as a way of correcting an approach that had used the concept of intentionality to reduce the authority of the subject, but had made the inwardness of a self unable to coincide with itself into an end in itself. But while Waters suggests a valuable new way of relating the seg- ments of de Man's career, he still assumes that this relation was some- thing de Man planned. The genetic reading of canons that de Man himself criticized (without entirely forsaking it) thus remains in place. The later writings are more mature than their predecessors because they see beyond the former, but also anticipate their own self-correc- tion by offering themselves as provocations rather than literal truths. In Waters's argument, de Man still provides us with a point of view for his work as an author. He places the middle texts sous rature, but intends the impersonality of the later texts to be corrective and not evasive. Such a reading does not allow us to situate the later de Man, who may have developed a rhetoric of impersonality to correct the ahistorical fe- tishizing of inwardness, only to create an approach allowing for the eli- sion of historical considerations that are at least subtextually present in the existential writings. At the same time, the format of Waters's intro- duction as a critical biography which has philological and historical as well as rhetorical concerns invites us to situate the late as well as the early work. Moreover, Waters can plead for our understanding of the corrective relation between the stages of de Man's career only by con- structing him as subject rather than author. But if there are historical 245</page><page sequence="16">MODERN PHILOLOGY reasons for the way de Man thought in the forties, we can wonder whether the later texts are not transected by similar pressures. Specifically, we can question de Man's conviction about the arbitrari- ness of a language that is "not made by us as historical beings . . . per- haps not even made by humans at all."4 Is this 'pure language' emptied of any anthropomorphism simply part of a critique of the aes- thetic ideology? Or does it also allow him to see us as subject to a lin- guistic occupation that spares us the responsibilities that the subject acquires in Kierkegaard or Sartre? These complicities between the early and the late have been ad- dressed by more than one contributor to the Responses volume. They suggest that if the writings produced in the middle years survive as the dialectical supplement of the later texts, marking a certain incomplete- ness in them, that is not the lesson of Paul de Man. Rather it is the les- son we learn from the scene of reading generated by the current controversy, which has added a further layer to the palimpsest of rela- tions we can construct between the various sectors of de Man's work. The notion of 'sectors' rather than 'stages' allows for relationships be- tween parts of de Man's canon that are not simply unidirectional. We can now see the relation of the late to the early work as corrective, but we can also see it as written across continuities between writings that are meant to be radically different. We can construct the middle work as a corrective to these complicities, but we must be aware of it as a problematic alternative, partly for the reason that led de Man himself to question it. The analysis of de Man's career in terms of a supplemen- tary interplay between sectors is in fact encouraged by the Responses vol- ume. As a collection or bringing together, it has an encyclopedic intention which its very form suspends. Put differently, its format stim- ulates a dialectic that is intertextual and recursive rather than synthesiz- ing. Given the deconstruction of closure implicit in a collection, the lesson of this controversy cannot be confined to conclusions about de Man himself. Indeed, one of the more significant effects of the disclo- sures about de Man is their allegorical impact on readers for whom criticism must now include an element of autobiography. In other words, the revelations about de Man's wartime 'experience' analogi- cally raise the question of our having to experience, differently and more critically, the consequences of critical positions that must be lived through if they are to disclose their genealogy and their ambidextrous potential for our own thinking. This is perhaps the lesson not of de Man but of the controversy-or of our need to construct controversies around critical figures. 4.
